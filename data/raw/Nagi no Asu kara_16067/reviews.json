            "content": "The age-old idiom of \"don't judge a book by its cover\" never ceases to amaze me. Every so often you come across an anime that just blows your expectations out of the water and delivers something completely different. In the case of Nagi no Asukara, on the surface (or below the surface in this case) it mostly looks like yet another done-to-death high-school romcom. Consequently, if there was one thing I didn't expect coming into this, it'd be that it turned out to be the most beautiful anime TV-series I've seen aired since 2011.\r\n--Story--\r\nNagi no Asukara (or Nagi-Asu for short) takes place in a fantasyworld where there exist two different subspecies of humans. In this story, people originally came from the ocean, however over time there were ones who started crawling up on land as well to see what lay above the surface of the water. Now, ages later, the population has been split completely into land people and sea people, and they generally live quite isolated from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a circle of childhood friends from the sea, living in an underwater village called Shioshishio. For various reasons their local middle school closed down, and they had no choice but to transfer schools\u2026 to one above the surface. Trying to adapt to a life on land is not an easy thing, as they constantly have to keep themselves wet in order to not dry out their Ena; the protective shell given to the sea people by the Sea God, which is what enables them to live and breathe underwater in the first place. Furthermore, there is substantial discrimination and tension between the land people and the sea people which keeps raising new hurdles for the group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous areas that the plot revolves around over the course of time. There is the diplomatic relationship between the two groups of people, the mysterious supernatural aspects concerning the Sea God and Ena, and last but not least Nagi-Asu has some of the most complicated love drama I've ever come across in anime. However fear not, because Nagi no Asukara is an exceedingly rare case of romance done right.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nYou see, unlike 99% of all romance anime out there, Nagi-Asu is actually unpredictable. Normally you barely have to watch five minutes of the first episode of an anime TV-series in order to know with almost complete certainty which couplings will end up taking place before the end (unless there turns out to be no development at all, which is even worse), but not this time.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the main character cast of Nagi-Asu is rather large as well as evenly divided in gender. There is also no one that really can be called a protagonist in this series; Hikari probably gets the most screen time but I wouldn't really go as far as to call him a \u201clead\" character. Point being that it never really feels like anyone has any innate \u201cadvantage\" when it comes to love rivalry simply due to the concept of plot armour, because they all appear to be on fairly even grounds from start to finish. Above all though, if you would draw up all the characters and their various crushes in a relationship graph, you would very quickly realize that there are just way too many arrows\u2026 and there is no obvious nor optimal solution in sight. Hence, I honestly didn't know how any of this would turn out until very close to the end of the entire series, and that is something extraordinarily rare in anime (which in itself is a pretty sad realization for the sake of the anime industry).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, all the love drama aside, the character development in Nagi no Asukara is fantastic. Each and every character feels like he/she actually serves a purpose, and adds something crucial to the bigger picture. The anime covers a quite large timespan and there is plenty of opportunity to see how everyone matures and changes over the course of the story. All the members of the main character cast have very specific and detailed personalities and depth behind them, and you never get the feeling that any of them are any less important than the other. I guess the best way to explain it is that the supernatural aspects aside, there is a constant sense of realism when it comes to the characterization in Nagi-Asu and it just kept getting better and better the longer it went because of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Animation--\\n\r\nOh the burden of not having an 11/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing you will realize within the first few minutes of the very first episode, it is that the visuals of Nagi-Asu are simply out of this world phenomenal. I'm not talking as much about the facial expressions etcetera although those are certainly very good as well, but this category is all about the environments. Everything involving the sea in this anime is breathtaking. Absolutely stunning. The underwater world and its submerged town has all kinds of marine creatures swimming around everywhere in perfect detail, and the lighting coming through the ocean surface (which works sort of like the sky in this case) and how it refracts with the water looked almost futuristic at times. P.A. Works really outdid themselves this time around.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that the surface world is that much less impressively looking in any way, as the animation quality of this show is just all-round top notch. I don't really have much to say about it however other than the fact that it is really solid throughout; it's just that it kind of gets outshined simply by how gorgeous the water world of Nagi no Asukara is. I really cannot praise it enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nAnything starring Hanazawa Kana is always an immediate potential winner in my book, but she's not exactly the only factor to take into account regarding the audio of Nagi no Asukara. As far as the voice acting goes, I think pretty much everyone really lived out their characters' roles as good as you could possibly ask for. While there was no one character that really stood out for me as being above the others in this regard, the amount of feeling that was put into the voice acting should definitely not be understated, and consequently I think it was a really good performance by the seiyuu cast in general.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack\u2026 this part is actually pretty hard to comment on. The reason for this is that the music of Nagi-Asu is generally pretty quiet. It doesn't have any sort of epic OST or catchy/emotional music; rather it goes with a generally ambient theme that tries to up-play the atmosphere of the anime in general as well as its key scenes. As far as that goal goes, I think it does its job very well, but on the flipside it also results in the individual tracks not being very memorable as they're pretty much only good alongside the show itself and not as something you would ever listen to on its own in a music playlist. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it's simply the way it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe various OP/ED themes would probably all fall into the category of \u201cgood, not great\" to me; originally I wasn't too fond of them but they kind of grew on me over time as the show kept getting more and more emotional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel that the music of Nagi-Asu was mostly intended as a supporting aspect for other categories of the show rather than something intended to be great on its own. It's not the most common way of approach but if that was indeed the producers' goal then I think it was executed fairly satisfactory.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nThis show took up almost all the spare time I had available over the course of the three days it took me to marathon it. Normally that is not something I manage to do quite as much anymore, at least not for anime of this type of genre, but in the case of Nagi no Asukara I really could not stop watching it. It has this constant drive of making you want to know more, both regarding what is going to happen to the characters in focus, but also regarding the entire population of the two human subspecies and the world itself. It is extremely immersive and has a huge sense of realism to it that makes it really hard to not get absorbed by it. Also, like I mentioned earlier, it is less predictable than most anime series out there so you can never take what is going to happen next for granted.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is a series for people seeking feels and beautiful landscapes. It utilizes environments you normally never get to see in anime and it does so in style. It once again showcases that a seemingly stereotypical concept can be extremely successful when you add one or two twists to it on a very basic level, as well as boost it with very high production values. It also makes you care, not just for the main characters but for everyone and everything in it as the scope of Nagi no Asukara is unusually large.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me bask in its beauty as well as sob silently. It went above and beyond all my expectations and now I have to consider it as one of the best I've seen in ages. A gem not quite like any other.",

            "content": "I made sure I watched it until the end even though I wanted to die, so that people would not say that I hated it just because I missed the best part. \nIt was crap from start to end, they took a nice idea about a fantasy world that could totally become decent and turned it into the most senseless idiocy about \"love\", a kid's fairytale with no goal whatsoever. \nThe best ideas such as enviroment and history were completely skipped and left unexplained, the setting under the sea could become absolutely awesome and they botched it, because instead of adjusting it to the situationthey simply stuffed a copy of a normal village on the bottom of an ocean with no change at all. They even have stairs. They drink broth. I just don't understand what was the point of such a forced setting.\\n\\n\nThere are loads of things that I don't understand, but just to say a few: why in the world do people from the sea and from the shore hate each other so much if they don't differ among each other in the slightest? They have the exact same culture and habits, they eat the same stuff, they even put the same designs on curtains; Why the hell should salt fall from the sky? I'm fine with fantasy but you could at least try to come up with some kind of explanation; Did someone tell those guys that they didn't have to go as far as to make every possible pairing? There are fanfictions for that; Just where did the other students of the sea school go? That's kind of creepy, they simply melted away, right?\\n\\n\nOh, and yes, I totally agree that the series did a 180 turn. The characters visibly leveled up in annoyance.\\n\\n\nThe ending was the best part of them all, it just wrapped things up as uncomprehensible as they were and gave it all that sickly sweet taste that dulls every black hole in the plot to a triviality. \\n\nThe dialogues were awkward, trite and embarrassing to listen to.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\nWhen I first saw the description for Nagi No Asukara I really didn't know what to expect. The synopsis didn't really give off much of an idea of what this show was going to be like. So thinking that Nagi no Asukara would be another cheesy romantic comedy. I began watching with low expectations. Little did I know that what I was about to watch would be one of the most enjoyable slice of life anime I have seen in a long time. \r\n     A long time ago people livedand flourished in the sea. But one day some of the sea people wanted to live in the land, and thus they moved to the land and away from the sea. The story revolves around 4 middle school students who are forced to attend a school on land after their school in the sea village closes. Many problems such as adapting to new environments and dificulties making friends follow. \\n\\n\r\n      The story presents itself as a slice of life in the beginning with the main focus on problems the main characters have on the surface. Now for some people the pacing in the first half might be a bit slow, but There is good reason for that. As a character driven anime, Nagi No Asukara has to focus on its characters a lot and flesh them out properly, and Nagi No Asukara does just that. The show uses a lot of its time developing its characters and making sure they feel more like actual people rather than flat characters that you care little about. Was it worth it? Definitely. \\n\\n\r\n      But don't be fooled. Nagi No Asukara doesn't always stay a fun, light slice of life. The mood changes dramatically darker in the second half. The show takes a turn from slice of life to being more dramatic, and this is where Nagi No Asukara falls short on.  Many slice of life romances that try to implement drama in their plot tend to be overly melodramatic, and this also seems to be the problem with Nagi No Asukara. Nagi No Asukara's second half is chocked full of drama. From unrequited love to arguing. The show sometimes becomes quite frustrating in the dramatic parts. Many parts felt uncomfortably lengthened because of the melodrama and how the characters are so unwilling to talk and make up after an argument. Now although to me this wasn't a major problem. It still dampened from the experience as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n      Story isn't the only thing Nagi No Asukara focuses on.The animation of Nagi No Asukara is top-notch, with animation that rivals even The big studios like Kyoto animation The show looks absolutely gorgeous. The backgrounds were created with such detail that it felt like I was watching an art gallery.  Character designs were also very appealing and detailed. Seriously, Nagi No Asukara's art is definitely some of the best I've ever seen in the anime industry. I'm not exaggerating at all.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound of Nagi no Asukara is also paid much attention on. \"lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~\" by Ray is a great first opening that fits the slice of life aspect of the show perfectly. The second opening  \"ebb and flow\" also by Ray has a more serious tone to it and is also a great song to listen to. ( I have already listened to it 20 times). The soundtrack also doesn't disappoint. Pretty much every track and tune fits the mood well. Nagi no Yanagi also does a great job on the ending song.The first ending song \"Aqua Terrarium\", is a calming song that fits the show very well. The second ending song \"Mitsuba no Musubime\" is also a very good song that fits with the second half very well.\\n\\n\r\n     As a character driven show, the characters are the aspects that make or break the series, and I can honestly say that Nagi No Asukara has quite the cast. The main cast consists of 5 characters. The crybaby Manaka Mukaido, the hotheaded Hikari Sakishima, the calm and collected Kihara Tsumugu, beautiful and caring Hiradaira Chisaki, and the handsome Isaki Kaname. Now at first the characters felt very stereotypical. Hikari is the main character that gets mad at many things and gets the viewers pissed off because of how much a jerk he can be. Manaka felt like those characters that were made to be cute and cater to the audience. Tsumugu was the smart one in the show that would preach life lessons to the other characters. Kaname was the handsome guy, and Chisaki is that kind girl who also joins in on the love triangle. As you can see. The cast doesn't seem to be very likable or original in the beginning. What P.A works does an extraordinary job on though, is putting a serious amount of depth to the characters and developing them immensely over the course of the show.The characters develop dramatically and feel way more alive throughout the show. As you get to learn more about the characters through the show. You end up feeling way more connected to the characters.They turn into characters that you actually care about. Not second dimensional characters that you forget about in a few weeks, but characters that really make an impression on you.But that's not the end. There are two more main characters added through the show. Shiodome Miuna and Sayu Hisanuma. Although they only receive development in later parts of the show. They recieve a lot of development through the series and although they might not get as much depth as the other characters. I ended up caring for them just as much as the main cast.Another very interesting part of the show is that Nagi No Asukara has one of the biggest and most complicated love webs I have seen in a while. Almost every important character in the show loves someone else. And watching this web unfold was truly an enjoyable experience. As I watched the characters grow up and see how they coped with their unrequited love. I began to root for their happiness from the bottoms of my heart. The characters truly made an impact to me, and it was a bit sad for me to finish the show.\\n\\n\r\n      Nagi No Asukara isn't for everyone. It's slow pacing in the beginning and it's focus on the characters are enough to scare off people who have little patience and want immediate action . But for people who are patient enough. Nagi no Asukara is a show that will deliver. With its beautiful atmosphere, great characters, and a very interesting story. Nagi No Asukara is that gem in the rough that should definitely be watched by fans of romance and slice of life.",

            "content": "First a little background, having just watched Golden Time, I was on the look out for something new to watch and first came across Nagi no Asukara in the suggestions list. At a first glance at the anime and having read its description, I thought perhaps it could be worthwhile and decided to chance it. It didn't disappoint at all, this show was magical from start to finish and I couldn't have been happier to have stumbled across this gem. It certainly ranks among my top 7 favourite anime.\r\nThis show is a \"slice of life, fantasy and romance\" show in a nutshell, however it takesthese themes and fulfills them really rather well and isn't without some original twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in two villages, one in the sea and one in the land. There is a conflict between the people of these villages due to friction about their cultures and beliefs. The people from Shishoshio, the sea village, believe that the people originated in the water and that those who had left in the past for land had betrayed the sea god and had turned their backs on their way of life. This rivalry in the show is actually well developed as the show goes on and plays a defining role in moulding the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts of with four main characters, essentially around whom the meat of the story revolves around (although there are two other main characters added shortly after). These are Chisaki, Kaname, Hikari and Manaka, the few children in the sea village. They have been childhood friends and in the same school for as long as they can remember and  are being transferred to the school on the land to continue their education. Obviously, having been together for so long, they all have strong feeling for each other and the refreshing fact is how realistic their relationships are. They fight, have fun, love each other and are jealous of each other at times. Unlike many  other shows this really helps drive the story further on solid foundations. \\n\\n\r\nThe story then revolves about their life on the land and the interactions between the characters. The new main characters added are Tsumungu, a quiet but reassured boy who lives on the land with his grandpa and two younger girls, Sayu and Miuana. All of these characters are well developed over the show and themselves are involved in secondary themes such as dealing with second marriages in their family and loneliness. Not everything is laid out on a plate however and there are certain things that are left for you to figure out or wonder at. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half goes through the gears and describes the life of the characters and how they get on, with a few usual bumps and twists, some of which is original and some which is to be expected but by no means boringly cliched. The main plot of the start is the build up to the \"Onefeukhi\" a ritual which is carried out by the sea and land people together to pay sacrifice to the sea god. I shall say no more. This is one of the very few anime with a twist that is shocking however done in such a way that doesn't irritate but actually works with the story and ultimately makes it better. It is this \"twist\" that actually helps to make this such a memorable anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo thats the story glanced over, of course there is so much going on all at once for me to explain but take this much 1) The complex relationships (between sister and brother, children and parents and between the children themselves, even the adults, the villagers too. 2) The character development is paced perfectly with the story and is satisfying to watch unfold. I haven't even scratched the surface of the story yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nice, there are no faults and quite mellow. \\n\r\nThe soundtracks are well used and OPs are definitely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gave me a chance to feel what I had with anime such as Clannad and Little Busters. It's a story driven by the entire cast, there is a whole bigger picture behind everything and the fantasy setting doesn't detract it really defines the show in a way while still making everything absolutely relatable (not in a practical sense but an emotional one). \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something with substance, a well paced story and a brilliant cast all blended to amazing effect, Nagi no Asukara is not a show to miss.",

            "content": "Oh, I'm not gonna make myself any new friends with this review. PA Works is one of those studios that you either praise the shit out of or you just don't give a rat's ass about. Even for the number of \"successes\" that they've had in the past, I don't really find myself feeling anything but indifference toward the bulk of stuff that they've produced. Hell, I'm surprised I found myself giving this show a negative review. Granted, I've never truly liked a single show that they've ever released. PA Works' programmes aren't as visually enticing as A-1 Pictures', they're nowhere near as emotionally involvingas Kyoto Animation's, and they're not as comfortable to watch as JC Staff's. But yeah, PA Works doesn't really rank all that high on my visceral outrage meter. So what is it about Nagi no Asukara that doesn't work for me? Well, it's hard to sum up in just a few words so let's just dive straight into the review.\\n\\n\r\nI should point out that I actually quite enjoyed watching Nagi no Asukara when I first started. The fantasy setting was certainly intriguing and I also found myself quite fascinated by the relations between the land and sea people. Of course, another reason why I picked this show up in the first place was that it was supposed to be one of the better anime romantic dramas out there on the market and I was in the middle of a romance binge at that point in time. But over time, the stuff that I found myself liking about the show combined with other things the show was doing as it progressed ended up causing me to actually really hate the show. Allow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\n1) The \"romance\" is fucking terrible and it eclipses the actual plot of the show\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not one to despise will they/won't they romances from the get-go (especially given how I happen to adore the shit out of Rumiko Takahashi's works) and I usually don't take umbrage with love polygons because if done well enough, it makes for a more suspenseful read and leads to interesting developments going down (like in the manga for Ichigo 100%). But in Nagi no Asukara's case, nothing of the sort actually happens. This is the kind of love polygon that's just meant to shoehorn some shitty melodrama into the show for no other reason than to give off the illusion of actual romantic development.\\n\\n\r\nKaname likes Chisaki, but Chisaki has the hots for Hikari. Hikari wants to bone Manaka, but Manaka's fingering herself to the thought of Tsumugu. Meanwhile, Tsumugu's just standing there like Kurasama from School Rumble with a blank expression on his face. Hell, this isn't even a love polygon. It's a love line segment, if anything. I mean, I wouldn't mind this so much if the characters were actually capable of carrying a scene without it devolving into melodramatic territory. I wouldn't mind this so much if the farcical melodrama didn't eclipse the actual plot of the story, but it unfortunately does.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing against works that try to tell a romantic subplot whilst telling a larger story at hand, and if done correctly, it can actually be quite lovely (i.e. Futurama, Justice League, Daria, The Spectacular Spider-Man, etc). Unfortunately, it would seem that PA Works forgot that the real story at hand is (supposedly) about two tribes of people with vastly different ways of life that must work together to avoid cataclysmic disaster. I wouldn't mind this so much if the \"romance\" actually went somewhere but unfortunately it doesn't and it never does at any point in the series. Hell, the resolution is open-ended with only one official couple actually forming by the end of it all (and even then, that pairing didn't have much build-up going for it).\\n\\n\r\n2) The characters are one-note archetypes with no depth whatsoever\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it seems like just yesterday when I was 15/16 years old so the hormone mixture was still running wild and I was having a shitload of brand new experiences. As such, I can definitely sympathise with what our leading quartet would (presumably) be going through... to a certain degree, anyway. Unfortunately, being able to sympathise with someone does not a good character make. I suppose it's not entirely fair to say that the characters are one-note archetypes but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said they weren't defined by a gimmick or two.\\n\\n\r\nHikari is your typical male tsundere, whilst Kaname is the mature, mild-mannered one. Manaka is the primary love interest who's a crybaby, relies on her friends, and has the hots for some other guy whilst Chisaki is the tertiary love interest who withholds her feelings for Hikari because he knows he wants to fuck the shit out of Manaka. Meanwhile, Tsumugu doesn't even have any sort of characterisation about him. He's just this quiet guy who follows our leading quartet around.\\n\\n\r\nManaka and Chisaki could've easily been fused into a single character, because they both feel like they were meant to originally be one character but were then written into to separate separate characters for some undecipherable reason. On that note, Kaname has to be the most useless character in the entire show. I appreciate how he's a foil to Hikari, but he never contributes anything of relevance to the story at hand. All he really does is just stand there chatting with the other characters. At least Manaka, Hikari, Chisaki, and even Tsumugu (at one point) contributed *something* of relevance to the story at hand. Hell, I can't even call Kaname a Kaworu Nagisa clone because Kaworu actually did more stuff in Evangelion in one episode than Kaname ever does across the span of 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, I really shouldn't be bitching about Kaname and Tsumugu not contributing anything of substance to the plot because they (along with some irrelevant side characters) are the only ones I could actually find myself liking. I couldn't help but feel contempt any time I saw Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, or Miuna in the frame because they're so fucking unbearable. Hikari's tendency to shout at everything he doesn't understand is what ultimately causes me to viscerally despise him because I just want him to shut the fuck up AND HE NEVER DOES. Whilst I hate Manaka and Chisaki, I can safely say that they're nowhere near as infuriating as Hikari is.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, let's talk about our two lead \"heroines\" and why they make me want to shoot up some heroin. Manaka is a moeblob plot device and nothing more. Thankfully, she's not the insufferable hyperactive type of moeblob, but that still doesn't change the fact that she's a useless crybaby who serves no purpose other than to advance the plot. Say what you will about Usagi from Sailor Moon, but at least Usagi grows as an individual over the course of the series. Hell, at least Nagisa from Clannad helped spark Tomoya's growth as an individual. I have absolutely nothing of the sort to say about Manaka whatsoever. Virtually everything I've said about Manaka can also be applied to Chisaki, but it should be noted that Chisaki at least has *some* sense of characterisation about her.\\n\\n\r\n3) The worldbuilding in Nagi-Asu is absolutely appalling.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the fact that this show takes place in a fantasy world where one group of people split off from another and then went on to live their own lives whilst still retaining *some* form of contact with one another, one would assume that the cultures of the people on land and at sea would be highly divergent but that couldn't be further from the truth. Aside from the fact that the people of Shioshishio live underwater and worship a sea deity, there's virtually no conceivable differences between the people of the former village and the people of Oshiooshi. I mean, their names are just anagrams of one another's for Christ's sake!\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, I love how the series claims that all of humanity originated from the sea and moved onto land but we only really see two locations throughout the span of the entire series. By sheer implication, Shioshishio would've been the origin of all humanity since that's the only sea village we're ever made aware of and it's never stated whether or not other sea villages exist. So how is it that a faction of people could emigrate from a single village and then go on to populate the rest of the planet? I mean, Nagi no Asukara does exist in /some/ space of reality. We have electrical grids, motor vehicles, grocery stores, and other such things that would imply that the history of the world that Nagi no Asukara also follows real world events to /some/ degree. I wouldn't be bitching about this so much if the show didn't bring up all this shit and decided to do absolutely fuck-all with it. Hell, I wouldn't have minded any of this whatsoever if the actual \"romance\" went anywhere meaningful, but both plots are fucking awful and half-baked.\\n\\n\r\n4) The second half of the show is a poorly paced time skip and has a resolution that forces a happy ending\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show starts us off with a time skip after a MAJOR event occurs, which is already an indicator that these episodes are bound to suck because PA Works already proved that they're incapable of writing a cogent plot in the first half of the series. With that in mind though, it's not like the first half of the show was entirely without merit because the actual plot of the story, though extremely atrophied in terms of depth and detail, was still interesting enough to keep my attention and the episode before the timeskip was nothing short of intense to the point where it was almost enough to make me forget about all the shit I was complaining about previously.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I should point out that I don't have anything against time skips in general. When you get right down to it, a time skip is a literary device and what ultimately matters is how that literary device is used. Oyasumi Punpun, one of my all-time favourite mangas uses time skips to great effect, as it covers life-changing events throughout various points in time that ended up shaping the person that Punpun would eventually become. Unfortunately, the guys at PA Works lack the tact of Inio Asano so they just ended up using the time skip as a crutch to avoid actually writing up the direct aftermath of what just happened after said major event.\\n\\n\r\nIf that weren't bad enough, the pacing is just dreadful. There's almost no sense of transition whatsoever, so events are brought up like there's no fucking tomorrow. Random plot details are also introduced at random intervals with almost no sense of foreshadowing whatsoever and effectively diminish the impact of events that previously happened. The events pre-timeskip implied that the world was doomed because the sea god was angry at the fact that people abandoned the sea to live on the surface, and the land dwellers aren't appeasing him with regular offerings. It's not a perfect set-up, but at least that seems like something meaningful, right? Post-timeskip, apparently the sea god is just lonely and he needs someone to cuddle on those cold winter nights. Way to ruin what little good there was to be found in your shitty programme, PA Works!\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the actual ending to the entire series just feels forced beyond all belief. I understand the desire to see everything work out for the better in regards to your protagonists, but god damn it, you have to fucking EARN that happy ending and I can safely say that nobody in Nagi no Asukara deserved that happy ending. The entire conflict is just resolved without any hint of subtlety, foreshadowing, or anything of the sort. Hell, nobody ends up getting sacrificed to appease the sea god's raging boner by the end of it all! Like, what the actual fuck PA Works? Is it so hard to actually write up an ending that doesn't stick a gigantic middle finger to anyone with a functioning brain? Of all the things that I dislike about Nagi no Asukara, the ending would definitely have to be the thing that I hate the most.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion: this show sucks the chrome off of doorknobs. In between the farcical melodrama, the shitty worldbuilding, the hackneyed \"romance,\" AND that shitty ending, I just have one question to ask: Why? As in, \"why did PA Works even greenlight this show in the first place if it had such obvious problems?\" I guess this is the level of quality we should expect from a studio that's effectively the poor man's Kyoto Animation. Whilst Nagi no Asukara is far from the worst thing I've ever watched, it's still undoubtedly the most disappointing thing I've ever sat through. Here's to hoping that PA Works won't fuck up another show beyond all belief... oh wait, we have Charlotte. *sigh*",

            "content": "P.A. Works is known for delivering shows chock full of drama in a school setting; however, different from shows like Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari, romance is the primary focus in Nagi no Asukara. Why does this matter? Because P.A. Works really nailed it on the head with the drama this time around, and romance might have been the reason why. Compared to other romances, Nagi no Asukara's unique setting combined with its compelling cast of characters makes Nagi no Asukara a fresh entry into the established school romance genre.\r\nNagi no Asukara's setting revolves around two worlds: the land above the sea and Shioshishio, thevillage under it. People who live on land are the same as normal humans, like us. The people living in Shioshishio however have an advantage. With a protective layer around them called \"Ena,\" the villagers of Shioshishio are able to live underwater while also being able to freely maneuver on land. The setting is completely unrealistic, yet at the same time, the relationships explored in the show feel completely genuine. Of course, the drama is exaggerated to the point of being completely artificial, but such exaggeration is a necessary evil to keep its audience enthralled; a tactic that worked well. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, a setting combining two distinct worlds wouldn't be complete without its own religion and lore, and Nagi no Asukara certainly delivers. The problem is that the religion and lore comes on too strong. Romances are supposed to be stories that are driven by the character's emotions and actions, but in Nagi no Asukara, there are many times where the plot advances as a direct consequence of its religion and lore. Now I'm not saying that these events shouldn't ever occur, but in Nagi no Asukara's case, the plot advances so many times due to its mythology that you begin to question whether the show is about teenagers experiencing romance or high schoolers fighting against the supernatural. While it certainly can be both, the fact that the mythology is so forward in the show consequently adds many plot inconsistencies and leaves the watcher with numerous questions; it ultimately detracts from the romance, which is conclusively the prevailing factor. I'll apologize in advance for being so vague, but as the plot and mythology are so closely tied together, I wouldn't be able to provide a good example without spoiling the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance itself, be prepared to draw one of the silliest relationship charts ever. A square? A pentagon? A hexagon? Unfortunately, things are just too complicated, and with seven main characters, it would be pretty much impossible to keep everything straight in your head. Yet somehow, I can keep all the relationships straight in my head. That's where the Nagi no Asukara shines. Even while the plot advances and everything becomes more and more complicated, Nagi no Asukara doesn't want you to forget that these are the main characters. Yet while it's impressive that I've become attached to the characters to this point, there are still too many characters. While I can keep the relationships straight, it doesn't mean I fully understand all the characters. Talking about specifics, the only characters I feel like I truly understood were Hikari, Chiasaki, and Miuna. I felt like these three characters were truly fully developed. While Manaka can be considered the most important character in the show, the fact that she was missing for a considerable amount of time made her feel distant, even more so when she begins to profoundly discuss love in the last episode, which felt completely uncharacteristic of her. The remaining characters, Kaname, Sayu, and Tsumugu felt distant for the majority of the show; it almost felt as if they were contrived solely to advance Chisaki's character. Ultimately, a mix of developed and undeveloped characters crossed together as if they were all equally developed makes everything feel extremely complicated and messy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of complicated and messy, let's talk about the pacing. Before getting into details, Nagi no Asukara is divided into two major arcs. The second arc is a direct consequence to the events of the first arc, so as a result, they can't really be considered separate entities. But back to the topic at hand: pacing. The first half of Nagi no Asukara threw a myriad of themes at the audience including themes such as racism, the death of family, parent-child relationships, romantic freedom, and tradition. With so many different things going on, everything felt frantic. Yet even still, the underlying plot barely moved an inch in the first half until it reached its pinnacle, which was unsatisfactorily ushered by the fantasy of Shioshishio's mythology. As soon as the second half began, everything was reset. Essentially, all the themes from the first half instantly vanished and were replaced by new themes. Could Nagi no Asukara have been a 13 episode series? Probably not. But does it need 26? I'm sure it would have been fine in 24 or even something like 20 (I'm looking at you, NiseKoi), especially when the show essentially restarted. But that being said, I honestly can't complain about the second half of the series. After being completely engrossed in the setting of Nagi no Asukara in the first half, the pacing really began to feel natural during the second.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works does a fantastic job with animation as always, and this is certainly highlighted by the gorgeous underwater landscapes present in the show. Of course, the animation still falls short when animating crowds, and you still have a fair share of CG usage due to the vast amounts of water present in the show. Overall, there's not much to comment on this subject. Expect fresh art and animation when watching this show due to its setting, but keep in mind that like all anime, Nagi no Asukara is still prone to CG, still frames, slide shows, and the works. It's not ufotable, so don't expect movie quality, and it's not Shaft, so don't expect any interesting artistic choices, but it's still P.A. Works, so expect it to be good. \\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of P.A. Works, the music and sound in Nagi no Asukara is definitely up a notch from their usual work. Putting popular voice actors aside, the soundtrack is where the sound department really shines in Nagi no Asukara. While there might not be anything iconic or inspiring in its music, the eerie yet serene tracks really make you feel like you're listening to the music of the sea. Of course, the tone of the music shifts to its opening and ending songs as well. For example, I found that the intro to the first ending song really captured the eeriness from the soundtrack, and fit the show's drama perfectly, bringing a fantastic mix of curiosity, mystery, and sadness. And of course, how could I forget Miuna's piercing yet poetic voice in the second opening song? Such a poetic start is greatly complimented by the second ending's upbeat intro, which gives the audience a sense of apprehension and urgency. Overall, the music fits Nagi no Asukara beautifully; unfortunately, the soundtrack just isn't memorable enough despite being so fitting. That doesn't make it bad, it's just a little disappointing to think that I won't remember anything about the original soundtrack a few months or years from now.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could tell you more about Nagi no Asukara's themes, and dig deeper into its plot, but I feel like I have already articulated the vast majority of my opinions, so any more would be unnecessary. A more in-depth analysis on Nagi no Asukara's definition of love or Akira's arc on star-crossed lovers might have been great points to cover, but I leave them to discuss another day.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch Nagi no Asukara? If you like romance and drama, it's certainly a great addition to the genre. Personally, I grew very frustrated with the characters and themes as the show progressed, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good experience. Besides, you might have a different opinion about it, so give it a try, and remember, everyone deserves a chance at love.",

            "content": "The ocean is a mass and mysterious place. It seems to be endless and stretches beyond our imaginations with its vast amount of creatures that lives within. If I was to live in the ocean, the possibilities would be endless to how my life would change. But in the world of Nagi no Asukara, living in the waters is not an uncommon sight to see. No, in fact it\u2019s a way of life for sea people like Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido. Nagi No Asukara chronicles the lives of a group of young people as they go through stages of childhood, adolescence, and maturity thatdivides the race of human and amphibian. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is not based on any previously existing works but rather stands alone as an original story produced by P.A. Works. It\u2019s the first series since Hanasaku Iroha that is produced by P.A Works that presents itself as a 2 cour show. But more importantly are the themes explored. While the show is colored as fantasy, Nagi no Asukara surprisingly explores many factors that can be interpreted as human. This series explores various themes ranging from jealousy, regret, prejudice, alienation, bullying, and identity. It\u2019s a show not to be taken just as a love story but something like a treasure box because you\u2019ll someday come back and relive its precious moments.\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara\u2019s setting blends in two major contrasting style of societies. On one side is the people of the land who are just like you and me. On the other side are individuals that originated from sea. The people from the sea are curious about the surface world so they decide to venture from the deep and explore land. There\u2019s an interesting insight based on this premise as there are various and controversial ideas poured in that divides the two societies. For instance, there are certain rules involving relationships between a sea dweller and a human living on land. This is presented early on in the series when a case involves such an incident. It sets forth a theme of prejudice and racism with debates between various characters. While it seems unfair, there are justifiable reasons to back up some of these themes such as involving the population of the human species. On another note, people on the surface world often associates themselves of being normal while identifying the sea dwellers as being inhuman. There\u2019s a case of identity issue at crisis with even some of the sea dwellers themselves wondering where they belong in the world they live in. What Nagi no Asukara presents skillfully is the cultural clash between the people living on land and sea dwellers. Rather than some farcical soap drama with senseless dialogues, the show does well by showing rather than telling with its actions. The beginning of the school with our main characters sets a primary example of what\u2019s to be expected with this cultural difference. It\u2019s what Nagi no Asukara does at its best that divides its societies that draws the audience in beyond just a love story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no story can be complete without its characters. Nagi no Asukara\u2019s strong points involves its small yet complex characters. Not all of them are human but they often demonstrate explicit traits that can be found in humanity. Hikari stars as a main male protagonist whom may be initially seen as a brat. He is overprotective with the people he cares about but also gets into fights over his own problems. On the other hand is Manaka, a timid girl with a frail nature prone to crying. She is perhaps one of the more normal characters with her behavior and often not trying to cause people problems. Of course, she has problems of her own with insecurity about identity and sometimes even feels alienated from others. Other main characters also become involved in the story such as Tsumugu Kihara and Chisaki Hiradaira with their own interests. These interests settles itself with the romance and formulates angles of drama. Tear-jerking might not be the exact word to always describe these angles but it presents itself in a way that makes the audience want to know more and more about the characters with its dramatic storytelling. This is probably because some of these characters are relatable and have complex natures. \\n\\n\r\nTaking a retrospective point, we also get to witness growth as each of the characters climbs stairs to adolescence. Characters such as Miuna and Sayu grow up more than just their physical selves. They mature from kids into young women with their own feelings and ideologies. More importantly is how far they have grown from their previous kiddy stages. What makes Nagi no Asuakra stands out itself with these stages is the construction of its timeline. There\u2019s consistency although it lacks depth on some parts. Yet, the show also demonstrates how people can change with circumstances with characteristics learned from the characters whether it\u2019s through bullying, romantic relationships, or alienation. Responsibility also takes in as a factor to be considered especially with some of the older characters such as Hikari\u2019s brother, Akari. Surprisingly enough, some of the younger characters demonstrates more maturity than the adults in the show. It contrasts itself with them being one dimensional in this case with their unpredictable actions despite knowing some of the consequences. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as romance goes, the series can be or feel forceful at times with their exaggerated dialogues. Hikari can be seen as a male tsundere with the words that comes out of his mouth as well as his actions. Often or not, he says the opposite of his true intent and comes off as a rather blunt individual. On the other hand is Tsumugu with his easy-going nature. He\u2019s more of the guy like a textbook with ambiguous words and difficult person to read on the surface. Nonetheless, he gets involved with the complexity of Nagi no Asukara\u2019s love polygons. Because let\u2019s face it here, this show focuses on romance as a main structure of story presentation with angles developing from various stages with even fantasy elements added to the mix. However, this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise as the world this show takes place in is decorated with fantasy elements. The waters is just one element of conventional presentation that allows this show to become what it is rather than what is trying to be. On the other hand is where we see how normal the surface people live that reflects on a society where we humans are used to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the melodramatic nature of this show, there is also room for comedy whether it involves our characters or the events that takes place. Kids in the beginning such as Sayu still says things that kids would say. It fits well with their initial role before growing up because it defines Nagi no Asukara as a series that matures itself. This later comes with regret from our younger characters that may earn sympathy from the audience. While not all expressive in nature, it demonstrates itself with characterization that focuses characters in more ways than just relationships. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself has some unexpected plot twists later on, the show still has some generic attributes that doesn\u2019t shine itself at times. Most of the characters have complex personalities but sometimes hard to appreciate with their actions. Manaka is one character I find difficult to get accustomed with her frail nature and constant prone to tears. The audience might also find this a hard to bear and takes patience to get used to. Hikari\u2019s outbursts sometimes also feels forceful and over exaggerated that serves as a primary example of being immature despite his intentions. And while the show\u2019s plot can be unpredictable at times, there are various foreshadowing hinted at throughout some episodes that makes the show seem lifeless. This pinpoints some future events that can come as unsurprising even if done in a way that seems dramatic. Yet still, Nagi no Asukara doesn\u2019t just focus on its fantasy-romance nature. It does more than that with its pyramid of character building on a foundation of its story.\\n\\n\r\nBy technical art standards, Nagi no Asukara can be described as a lavishly and luster anime that shines in this field. Thanks to P.A. Works, this show stands out more than just its images but with its setting that demonstrates credibility. The aquatic natures and backgrounds presents itself fair with consistency such as the fishes and sea. Not only has that but the characters themselves also showed evidence of being sea dwellers. These include but not limited to the characters\u2019 azure-green glowing eyes or their bluish hair. They don\u2019t look like merman or mermaids but rather as people not too different than you and me.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also demonstrates progress. In the beginning, most of the music has a light tone with some dramatic moments. But later on, we hear more of an emotional tone with the events going on. The OST itself also becomes an embodiment that reflects as a clear view to present Nagi no Asukara\u2019s melodramatic style. Additionally, the OP and ED songs presents montages of characters and how they have changed over the time. Most of the voice acting of the characters fits well thanks to their talents. In particular, Hikari and Tsumugu\u2019s voice becomes a symbol of opposites with their clashing personalities. Manaka\u2019s voice also is easily recognizable thanks to the talents of Kana Hanazawa whom is well known for portraying cute characters.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend giving this show a try at the very least besides just from reading the synopsis. While it seems generic at all once with its characters, the show moves itself with characterization and plot that demonstrates maturity. It also focuses on a variety of themes that is credible and relates to humanity despite having fantasy elements. More so however is the way the characters interacts and the circumstances they undertake to become who they are. While the show focuses on romance as a central element, there is also themes of responsibility and cultural clashes that becomes insightful to get accustomed to. Not everything is fair after all in a world with drastically different cultures. In the world of Nagi no Asukara, that\u2019s an understatement and you\u2019ll find out exactly why. \\n",

Very few have ever portrayed it correctly, and even then it's difficult to move us. They either fall flat because of pacing issues or the plot fails to convey a character's motivation causing climactic moments seem melodramatic or forced. Nagi no Asukara doesn't face these issues. In fact, the show has been one of the most well-paced anime I have ever seen in terms of character and plot development. I will get to that soonenough, but first I would like to start with the art.\\n\\n\r\nYou may know them best for animating Angel Beats!, Another, Tari Tari, and Hanasaku Iroha. Yes, it's P.A Works and they have done it again, creating wonderful background arts and stunning imagery as well as good, consistent animation. None of that going-to-shit in some episodes to save budget to make one or two episodes look fantastic. I don't know how many times I had to pause to take a screenshot to store in my wallpaper folder. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of time is evidently dedicated to creating the world of Nagi no Asukara, and rightfully so. Story is heavily focused around their lives on Shioshishio and Oshiooshi. The sea's art alludes to the beauty of our own world but retains its mysteriousness. The ocean's depths isn't something people see every day and yet the studio is able to capture its beauty with little details like the schools of fish, coral reefs, and among other details that I won\u2019t spoonfeed. The art manages to enrapture us by showing what the sea looks like, and it is only made more stunning by the inhabitants of Shioshishio going about their daily lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound to me was something to admire. The OPs and EDs were composed so well, and even the lyrics fit well into the story. The sound department did a stunning job, it\u2019s not often you find a studio adhere to the laws of physics when creating sounds for the background. By this I mean the claps of thunder, thrashing of water, birds, fish, the bloops you hear from fish, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nI love good character development and I love good characters. It is incredible to see how much Hikari changes throughout the show. If you were to watch the first episode, and skip a few, you will notice that Hikari isn\u2019t the same. Everything that happens in the plot serves to progress his development, and this was done extraordinarily well. While development is good, no development is also good when portrayed correctly. Take Chisaki for example, her development remains static, but it does something for the plot. It drives Kaname to act the way he does after the time skip and when juxtaposed to her peers accentuates the change that the group of friends go through. Furthermore, many, but not all of the supporting characters play their role into the story. Not everything is great though. I take issue with certain character interaction in the show. One blaring issue is the friendship between Kaname and Hikari. Their interactions with each other are so bland that it almost seems like they\u2019re hardly childhood friends at all. It is known that tension exists between the two regarding Chisaki, but it isn\u2019t conveyed enough in the dialogue between the two boys. Sure there was the time at the Shioshishio\u2019s school, but having a climactic moment to portray that tension without proper character interactions prior to the incident is simply melodramatic. This just undermines the whole issue they have with each other and depreciates its attempt to move the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe web of love may seem overwhelming at first, but when you stop, start at one character and ask yourself \u201cwho does this character like?\u201d you will realize it is much simpler than you think.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. This is a story about a young group of friends dealing with the concept of change, both themselves and the world around them.  However, the plot is a lot more intricate. Four childhood friends from Shioshishio attend the surface school Mihama. Their coming of age becomes the catalyst that motivates the Sea God (Notice how Uroko-sama acts as the herald for some radical shift when he sniffs out Manaka and Miuna.) Along the way, tensions between the inhabitants of Oshiooshi and Shioshishio continue to grow and culminate into that dramatic shift.  What I think the writers did best is how they well they incorporated the issue of change and love as a theme into the plot. I will explain; BEWARE, BEYOND THIS SENTENCE IS SPOILERS AND THEME ANALYSIS TERRITORY. \\n\\n\r\nTheme of Love\\n\r\nOne would imagine that after the main group deals with the idea of love after 26 episodes, at least one relationship would have formed. That isn\u2019t the case, but that is the beauty of it. They are young and na\u00efve, and they deal with love as young and na\u00efve children do. Notice how by the end of the story the only ones to truly form a relationship is Akari and Itaru. This is because they are mature enough to understand love. (If you really want to use Egawa Takashi as a point to refute this theme go right ahead, but I disregarded him because he served very little importance to the main cast as opposed to Akari and Itaru).\\n\\n\r\nTheme of Change\\n\r\nWhen Hikari wakes up after the time skip, he mentions to Chisaki that she hasn\u2019t changed. He speaks in terms of maturity. Yet Chisaki feels she has changed. She speaks in terms of age. Two forms of changes are at play in this story, Age as a form of change, and Maturity as a form of change. Chisaki may have changed in regards to age, but she has not matured at all. This is evident when Chisaki pushed Tsumugu, it is very much like when Manaka pushed Hikari. Hikari on the other hand, while he hasn\u2019t aged at all, he has matured very much. The character development for Hikari is so top notch such that no three episodes is he static. He is a very dynamic character that grows after facing a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Nagi no Asukara is anime with a great plot-driven and character-driven premise. The art and sound is breathtaking and something to be admired. I am glad this nice little story was able to grace the face of the anime industry in such an ecchi-harem-romcom dominated age.\\n",

            "content": "Since there are only good reviews about this anime, I thought it only fair to add in one that focused on the bad aspects of it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion and that everyone is entitled to their own. \r\nLet me start off with what I liked about the anime. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe art style was one that I'd never seen before, therefore it was very refreshing and overall very pleasing. Since turquoise blue is my favourite colour, the art was really a gold mine for me, seeing as all of the characters who come from the sea have turquoise coloured eyes.Overall I thought the art was beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWow! In terms of music and sound, this anime would be up there with my top 10. All of the openings and endings gave me chills, and I actually have them in my iTunes playlists. Both Ray and Yanagi Nagi have incredibly beautiful voices, and to be honest I thought they were the same person at first. They sound very similar, however they each have their own style of singing which adds a beautiful aspect to the music. I don't have much to say about the inserted music because I actually don't remember much of it, but I'm sure it was appropriate for whichever scene it was used it. Overall the music was stunning and used very well throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nOkay. Now that I've gotten what I like out of the way, let's get to the biggest issues that I have with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nI would give this a higher rating, as I actually liked most of the characters in the anime. The two characters that broke this anime for me were Manaka and Miuna. I actually quite like Miuna's personality, so I'll get to why I don't like her later. Let's focus on Manaka. God, I hated her. I still hate her. I hate Manaka with a burning passion and it will never go away. One reason is because of the voice acting. Manaka is played by Hanazawa Kana, who is a respectively known voice actress. She has a childish but very cute voice, but she was wrong for Manaka. I feel like Hanazawa-san is repeatedly getting thrown into the crybaby role, which I hate. The only character that I really thought Hanazawa-san played exceptionally well was Kuroi Mato from Black Rock Shooter (the OVA, mind you). Now let's move on to Manaka's character. She acts like she's 5 or 6 years old, constantly crying and making other people worry about her. She is incredibly naive, such to the point where she can't face the truth when it's right in front of her, and doesn't pay attention to the way anybody else is feeling around her. She runs away from everything, including Hikari's love for her (which isn't really a spoiler since it is known that Hikari likes her from episode 1). One could argue that she's very noble, since she does a certain something halfway through the series (I will not give up spoilers), however I found that she had no basis or motivation for doing what she did. It's like the writers just wanted to paint her as a good person so they made her do what she did. She confused me for a long time into the series, making me believe that she liked someone when she actually didn't. Sigh. Overall, I hate Manaka. \\n\\n\r\nOkay. I am done ranting about Manaka. Time to look at the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked Chisaki. Chisaki, unlike Manaka, had a very in-depth character, and actually took the time to think through her actions and decide why she wanted to do something. She is a very mature, independent person, and I really like that about her. It's really hard to analyse Chisaki's character further without adding spoilers, so I will just say that Chisaki is a very likable character. \\n\\n\r\nI also really liked Hikari and Sayu. Hikari was one of the boys with a short temper, making him angry at almost anything. However he got angry with good reason. He would usually get angry trying to protect Manaka and his friends, or he would get angry because he was jealous of Tsumugu, whom he thought Manaka liked. I liked Hikari's playful and caring side, however, and that he would honestly admit a mistake when he made one. Throughout the episodes you watch his character changing, so that he becomes a more flexible and less angry guy. I don't understand what he sees in Manaka, but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\n I also liked Sayu. Sayu looks like a typical tsundere on the surface, however she really cares about her friend Miuna and about the boy she loves. She felt tortured because she started liking him when she was in elementary school, and worked hard during middle school to get him to notice her. I really liked Sayu's voice and I hope that the voice actress, Ishihara Kaori, get's more opportunities to star in more anime. Overall, Hikari and Sayu are very likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime's characters all have the opportunity to be likable, depending on what kind of person YOU as the viewer like. As I have said many a time before, I hated Manaka's character. But I liked everyone else. Overall, the characters were pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nI usually love the kind of drama found in this anime. Friends that are dealing with unrequited love within themselves is a genre that I wouldn't give up any day. However the fantasy part of the story was really bad. Let me start by saying that this is one of those stories that makes you think it's about one person the entire way through, and then at the very end it pulls the rug out from under you and says, \"Whoops, it's actually not about the main character.\" This is the main reason why I don't like Miuna. Miuna, from what I understood, was supposed to be a side character. A character that sort of mattered to the plot, but not really. Then I find out at the end that she is essential to the plot, and suddenly she becomes a main character. Think about it like this: if you were reading Harry Potter, and the main character is Harry Potter, wouldn't you be ticked off if, at the last page of the last book, it became about that kid that Harry said \"Hi\" to one time in the second book? Of course I'm exaggerating a bit but that's what it feels like to me. I was extremely thrown off when I found out that Miuna was the main character all-of-a-sudden, and I honestly hate stories like that. The fantasy part of the story, while it did it's best to be explained, didn't really make me believe it. It seemed very shallow, and there were a lot of mysteries that weren't explained, which makes me angry. The ending of the story felt very rushed and hurried, and suddenly there were these new things that had to be smushed into the last few episodes. I was also astonished by how foolish the sea god acted at the end of the series. I was honestly sitting there, at my computer, thinking to myself, \"How could you be so stupid?!\" But I digress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime didn't strike me as anything worth watching, although I am glad to have watched it so that I know exactly what I hate now. I'm also glad that I got to listen to the music as that, as well as the art, was probably the only thing that kept me going. Please remember that this is only my opinion, and that I am not trying to convince you to share it, but rather tell you of the things that I noticed while I was watching it. Anyway, happy anime watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Prepare to dive into an ocean of emotions and a whirlpool of feels with Nagi no Asukara (A Lull in the Sea). This anime is truly a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough in the world of shows out there. I must confess that this show completely bypassed me when it aired back in Fall 2013, and I only recently picked it up during late November 2016, more than three years later. Boy am I glad I found it! I went into the series blindly, and ended it feeling absolutely satisfied, warm all over, and just generally in a state of emptiness when Idon't know what to do after the perfection that was this anime. Looking back, I could only wonder why this series seemed to go terribly underrated and not mentioned a whole lot in the community. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I admit that I probably haven't watched too many anime yet to truly justify my rating, as I will most likely continue to watch more shows into the future, I can safely say that among those that I have already watched, Nagi no Asukara is the only anime I can give my rare, proud 10 to.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into my long, deep opinion, let's take a look at the components of the show first and how I feel about each of them:\\n\\n\r\nPremise:\\n\\n\r\nNagi-Asu promotes itself as a drama, fantasy, and romance according to MAL, and I think it delivers in all of these perfectly, especially the first one. Truthfully, the synopsis didn't really give me a clear idea of what to expect from the show; it was as ambiguous as a road map you could get. I thought it would be a slice-of-life in a manner similar to Kokoro Connect, and while the first half of the series definitely felt like it at times, the second half all but abandoned the general cheerfulness of a SOL.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nPlot and Setting:\\n\\n\r\nUnder the sea and in a town beside the sea. We've seen this many times in both anime and other media before, but Nagi-Asu goes beyond and adds racial traits, prejudices and misunderstandings to the people who live underwater and the land-dwellers, almost making it seem like the equivalent of color, wealth, or beliefs in the real world. And boy, does Nagi-Asu deal with the topic of discrimination beautifully . . . Moving on, the plot is nothing too special but the execution was godlike, and safe to say there were a lot of twists along the way, with the most heart-wrenching ones truly unexpected.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nCharacter and Story Development:\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is a masterpiece, and even then that stills sounds like an understatement. One of the male MC's was the most unlikable piece of shite at the beginning, but he did a full 180 throughout the series, until it came to a point that one of the things that kept me going through the 2nd half's more emotional arc was seeing his progress as a person into something truly unforgettable. And it's not just him, everyone else in the ensemble cast had developments worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also had a very reasonable pacing, with no unreasonable or unwarranted slow-downs or rushes. As I already mentioned, the first half feels a lot like a SOL, but after the first half ended it slowed down a lot, but in exchange we get even more of the character development that I've praised so highly (although the first half definitely had great character developments as well).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. As much as I'm a fan of Nagi-Asu, I can't help but be disappointed with the way the show ended. Yes, everything was resolved and all the ships sailed, but I feel like a lot more could have been done it if just wasn't rushed as hell. All that wonderful buildup for those last underwhelming 5-7 minutes ..\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nAnimation and Art:\\n\\n\r\nNow, let me just say one thing:\\n\\n\r\nThat animation was legit, bro!\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Nagi-Asu and are browsing the internet for recommendations about it, then 9 times out of 10 this is the aspect of the anime that most people loved. PA Works, the studio behind Nagi-Asu (which is an anime original by the way), has always been known to deliver and exceed expectations in the visual department, and this series is no exception. Seriously, just pause whenever you encounter a background or basically any scene with few to no characters on it, and observe every little detail drawn in glorious, movie-level quality. In particular, the various underwater effects are simply spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really beautiful as well and definitely works in favor of the show.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nAny anime with Kana Hanazawa as a seiyuu is already a winner for me . .\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, the soundtrack is yet another masterpiece element of the show. There are a lot of great tracks, with its fair share of upbeat and happy and sad and emotional. The right tracks play at the right moments, and a lot of times I was just held into a 'wow'.\\n\\n\r\nHere is probably one of the most uplifting tracks I've heard in all of anime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBpHEnSIIU8\\n\\n\r\nAnd an accompanying emotional track, which has feels written all over it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNFA7unbg0\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's do well to accompany the series' soundtrack. Ebb and Flow (OP 2) is still among my favorite anime songs. The ED's also have great usage in the ending of some episodes as well - the one that comes most to mind is Episode 23.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nProduction and replay value:\\n\\n\r\nConsistency is the name of the game for Nagi-Asu, as its wonderful animation never falters even late unto the series. There is little to no drop in soundtrack quality and usage as well. Sasuga, P.A. Works\\n\\n\r\nReplay value is at an all-time high here. Rewatch it whenever you've lost hope in humanity but still want to believe there is a chance, whenever you want to feel warm all over .. no. Just rewatch it whenever you have the time to fully commit to it, as this is when Nagi-Asu will reward you the most. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nSummary of Nagi-Asu's elements:\\n\\n\r\nThe best: Animation and art, soundtrack, production and replay value, character development\\n\r\nThe good: Story development, premise, plot and setting\\n\r\nThe bad: the ending\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nPersonal opinion:\\n\\n\r\nI've already gushed about all the things about this anime that made me love it above, so I'm just gonna keep this short. Nagi no Asukara is an anime you MUST watch before you die. It definitely and safely belongs in a top 50 anime of all-time list, although I would boldly argue it has the repertoire to belong in even a top 20 list. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime takes its rightful place among the likes of Toradora and Clannad as some of the best romance and drama anime has to offer. Although I admit, the starting episodes might not really hook you in, as this anime only really starts to get going by around the ninth episode. It definitely has the pacing of a 26-ep show and I'm so glad P.A. works made this rare decision instead of going for their usual 12-13 ep shows. Twice the amount of episodes really helped this show flesh out the world, characters and the story it wanted to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had me not watching anything else for about a week after I finished it - it was that good for me. It made me question important things in life such as family and love. This anime is that kind - that is, if it hits you in all the right places, it is a show capable of changing your very life.\\n\\n\r\nAn ocean of emotions is waiting for you in Nagi no Asukara!\\n",

            "content": "Out of the hundreds of anime I've watched there are very few that deserve a 10 and Nagi no Asukara is definitely one of them. The show is a combination of fantasy, romance and slice of life and is one of the very few successful mix-ups. I hardly watch any anime more than once, some good shows maybe twice, this is the only show that I think I've watched at least 4 times and enjoyed each time.\r\nThe background of the story is a fantasy world with two types of people - the people who live in the sea and the people who live on land.The people from the sea have a shell called \"ena\", which allows them to breath underwater. They live in a small completely submerged town called \"Shishishio\" a little off the coast. The people who live on land (those without ena) in this story are mainly the residents of a small fishing village called \"Oshioshi\" right on the coastline. Due to the declining birth rates in the underwater village the local middle school closes and the students are transferred to a school on land. The show focuses on a quadrio of middle-schoolers from the sea who were childhood friends since kindergarten and the people from land around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show can be actually described as two sagas more or less equal in length. The first half is a slice of life, presenting the prejudice and hostility between the two people, maybe even the politics behind them, as well as some stories of forbidden love (literally forbidden) between people from sea and people from land. Overall the first part is OK but not incredible so don't lose hope if the first episodes don't seem that good.\\n\r\nAround halfway the story takes a dramatic turn and at some point fast forwards a few years. Certain events affect people from both sea and land, certain people change and others don't. New romances develop and people are deeply affected as they change, as their friends change and as the environment and the relations between sea and land change. I think my description may be a little boring, unfortunately I couldn't find a way of conveying the main plot of the second part without major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest distinction of this show is character development. There is a lot of character development, not only restricted to the main characters. Actually even the identity of the main characters changes a little over time. There is some love cliche but if you think you can guess how the love stories will develop right from the first two episodes expect huge twists.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Amazing. The art of the sea including the undersea village is incredibly detailed. There are a few quirks here and there (how can you pour someone a cup of sake when everything including the drink are underwater?) but but overall nearly perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Nearly perfect, this is a must watch.",

Although the ending isn't what I was expecting and even got confused at some parts I'd still watch it again..\r\nStory 10/10: I thoroughly enjoyed the story from beginning to the end with 4 main characters joining a new school where they're basically outcasts to a certain range.. They make friends and even enemies and it all turns out forthe best. There are a few problems I'd like to clear up and the main one is.. The 'love' in this series was terrible... They made to many people lovey dovey, I swear it was always \"This character is going to love this character BUT this character is going to love this other character\" and I kind of got sick and tired of it until the end where it kind of got straightened out abit. (Still really pissed there was no kiss scene or anything romantic at all... >.>) The story was well laid out and gave me a new kind of anime to watch that I've never seen before and I really enjoyed it\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I don't think I've ever seen an anime so sparkly and shiny all the time.. I'm not that big on the art style of anime consider I only watch one 'type' of anime and it's these kinds but the art for this looked really good!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I'm not that big on sound so I don't really have anything to comment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Even though most of the characters would fall for someone who didn't like them in that way and it really annoyed me.. I like how the characters progressed from these children and became more responsible that petty rivalry between sea people and surfacers. I didn't really enjoy the love square they had going with Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki and Tsumugu. If Tsumugu and Manaka would of ended up together I would of been disappointed in the whole thing.. Even though I kinda do ship Hikari and Chisaki, I still would rather Hikari and Manaka together! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Really enjoyed the watch and would recommended it to anyone looking for a slow paced love square which will infuriate you at some times aswell...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Do not go into this looking for alot of romantic parts like other animes like Maid Sama and other types like those. I kinda think this anime was targeted for a younger audience range now (Oh well!)...",

            "content": "When you see the poster and genres of this anime you may think this will be a childish romantic comedy show. Besides here the characters are not even high schoolers. What can you expect from some middle school going kids and their childish crush? Not to mention all those characters with large moe moe eyes.  But no! Nagi No Asukara has a lot more than that to offer you.\r\n~STORY~ 8/10\r\nIn this anime it is shown that human beings originally came from the sea. Some people craved to see the world beyond the ocean. So they left the sea and started living permanently on theland. Soon they were divided into two groups. The sea people from Shioshishio and the land people from Oshioshi. 14 years old Hikari Sakishima, Manaka Mukaido, Chisaki Hiradaira and Isaki Kaname; a group of four childhood friends are forced to go to Mihama Junior High School on the land as their Nami Junior High School of underwater village closed down and that\u2019s when they discovered a whole new world, learnt about their newfound feelings, the conflicted relationships of land people and sea people, the mystery of the sea god and many more. \\n\\n\r\n~ANIMATION~ 10/10\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the remarkable animation of this anime must be discussed about. This is one of the best part of this anime. The underwater village looks simply stunning and breathtaking. You can see water in any anime. But since water is a major part of Nagi-Asu it is animated with great care and details. You will feel like you\u2019re the one who is diving under the ocean and watching the underwater creatures. Of course the lands, snow and other things also look splendid. Every scenario looks amazing. As for the characters it goes all out with the big, round, sparkly eyes. People from the sea have gleaming azure eyes which looks very pretty. Whether you like this type of character design or not is completely your choice. But at least in my opinion this is what makes them look attractive and charming. You could stare at the characters and the scenes forever. The animation is that much appealing and eye-soothing.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe sounds and music are mellifluous. They did a great job for the OST. Voice acting of the characters is done perfectly. It completely suits with each and every character\u2019s personality and characteristics. Opening and ending songs are both good. Both of the openings are suitable for the two parts of the story. Originally Aketagawa Jin was in charge of the soundtracks. But he left and was replaced by a talented composer Dewa Yoshiaki. So you know what you can expect from him. But you may not notice how amazing the background musics are when you\u2019re hooked up to watching it. So make sure to check the OSTs in youtube.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ 9/10\\n\r\nAll the characters of this series are like the life of this anime. Each and every character has his /her own important role. Without any of them the anime would be incomplete. You can say every character is the protagonist here. No matter how much you like particularly one of them, you will still feel bad for the others. They are just that lovable. You might think it\u2019s only about those four kids. But it has more characters like Tsumugu, Sayu and Miuna who are the essential part of the story. Also the characters are not always kiddy. It\u2019s actually a coming-of-age anime. And if you ever get bored with all the serious things going on, the cute Akira will be there to make you laugh!\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~ 10/10\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get back to the story. What makes Nagi-Asu so special? At the first half of the series this is what will come to your mind. It seems like a normal story at the beginning. But if you can wait patiently and finish the first arc you will see what an unexpected turn it takes. Nagi-Asu gets even better at the second half of the series. Just when you think of something as a fact, it will make sure to surprise you and prove you wrong. You can never guess what is going to happen until you watch it through the very end. Whether it\u2019s about which character will end up with whom or it\u2019s about something else. Nagi-Asu develops centering two things. One of them is love. Yes, it is all about love. This anime has one hell of a love triangle! Or should I say a love heptagon?! But please don\u2019t be discouraged just by hearing it. Relax! Because this is not your regular, cheesy romance anime. It shows the feelings we go through while stepping into adulthood from childhood in a realistic way. Growing up little by little every day and seeing the change in our beloved ones. The other important thing of the story is the fantasy part. It doesn\u2019t end playing its role with making people live in the water. The sea has its own tale. The story of the sea god will make you feel like you are listening to folklore or a legend.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy, slice of life and romance; these 3 genres merge in impeccably and make this series splendid. All of these create a big plot twist that will hook you up. It will make you wonder how will be the ending of such complicated story. Luckily it still manages to give you a perfect ending you can think of. I assure you there will be a big smile of satisfaction and enjoyment in your face in the end and a little sadness in your mind that it ended!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Nagi No Asukara is an amazing anime. I don\u2019t really know why it didn\u2019t gain much popularity or why less people have heard about it. If you like romance or fantasy then it\u2019s a must watching anime for you. Lastly I will say \u201cdon\u2019t judge an anime by its\u2019 poster\u201d!  Though I must say it\u2019s not your cup of tea if you\u2019re not a fan of the romance genre and too picky about anime.\\n",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is a story about two races of humans. One of them lives on Earth the second in the sea. I've got to say, the setting is actually a great one and can give birth to a good story but it failed to do so.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs stated before, the setting is original. The plot line however fails to bring forth anything. To put it in simple terms, it was crap from start to end. Basically, we follow a few youngsters and their romance. There is no goal whatsoever and the romance isn't even properly developped. They completely scrapped the idea within the settingby failing to talk about it or exploit it. Sure, it is present over the whole series but except them being from the sea and the transition in between arcs, there isn't any manifestation of it. We have something awful that happens on a global scale but in a few years, the people haven't even acted when their life was endangered. Instead we have a resolution full of bullshit which smells as bad as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/8\\n\r\nThe art was great. Unfortunately for Nagi no Asukara it isn't what makes an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/8\\n\r\nOST wasn't that great. Didn't like either OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nJust how the hell can every single character fall in love with no character developpement whatsoever for more than half of them. I can't comprehend it. Also, I hate how everything went in between the characters. The interactions in between them were just bad and sometimes embrassing. Unjustified hate in between people of the Earth and the Sea. They do the same things, have the same decorations and some people of the Sea even end up leaving it for the Earth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI could not comprehend such a high rating with the first few episodes. I had to watch the first episode three times before forcing myself to get into the show. I was expecting things to go smoother in the rest of the show because of its rating but it clearly didn't. It even got worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6/10\\n\r\nThis show was boatched. This series is an overflowng garbage dump. I usually hate to use 'overrated' but it can only be described as such. A last thing I want to add is that the script wasn't well-written, it was written to please a large audience. I find it very stupid how naive people can be.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara Review:\r\nAre ya ready kids? I can\u2019t hear youuu!!! OHHHH!!! Who lives in a village under the sea? Hikari Sakishima! Ill-tempered, in love, tsundere is he! Hikari Sakishima!\r\nJoking aside, my first impression of this show was that it was going to be just another slice of life anime, this time set in Bikini Bottom rather than in your average high school\u2026 Oh how wrong I was. Nagi no Asukara turned out to be sooo much more, and is not only currently my personal favorite show of 2014 so far, but also a future classic if enough people are smart enough to decide towatch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8.2:\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara follows four friends who are in essence \u201csea people\u201d who can breath underwater. These four middle school friends have to go to school on land after their school closes. This show really gives the impression that it will be another carefree slice of life school anime at first, but slowly builds up the drama until the drama levels are set over 9000. Yes the show goes into detail about what it\u2019s like living underwater and how the underwater students are treated in the transitional phase by the land people, but the main focus of the show is the relationships between the characters. This show has one majorly complicated love triangle, er\u2026 pentagon\u2026 octogon? whatever, it\u2019s a shape with a lot of sides. Now personally I usually don\u2019t like when shows make it unclear who will end up with who, but Nagi no Asukara really just perfectly nailed this aspect of the show. More detail as to why it was so successful will be discussed later in the character section, but just know that it is done wonderfully. To go along with the personal issues each of the characters are dealing with, there is an impending larger issue that I will avoid going into due to spoilers, but is also very intriguing. This issue is made so interesting because of the fantasy setting that the world is set in, and the lore behind it all is truly fascinating. As for negatives, there are some things that get left unanswered, as well as a few poorly explained plot devices. Some of the plot devices or decisions made by the characters may frustrate the viewer as well depending on his or her preferences. However, these issues are few and far between for the most part. Nagi no Asukara\u2019s story has its share of humor, but also moments that could easily cause someone to shed tears. The drama created by the situations the characters are put in, the problems that the world is having, and the love-triangle always keep you interested in what is truly an incredible story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9.1:\\n\r\nP.A. Works has just been on fire lately with their production. Once an anime is revealed to be produced by P.A. Works, just assume that it will be absolute scenery porn. Other shows by P.A. Works include Angel Beats, Another, and Hanasaku Iroha for reference on how good this show looks. The fantastical setting is gorgeously realized both under the sea, and above ground. The animations (particularly under water) are just beautiful and incredibly fluid. It is a wonder how P.A. Works manages to make a profit with the seemingly limitless budget they throw into everything they do. There really is not much to say on the negative side for the art department for this show, so it\u2019s about time to move on.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.4:\\n\r\nMuch like the art, Nagi no Asukara\u2019s OST is just plain beautiful. The music really perfectly matches the setting, and appropriate songs play for appropriate moods. The OST sets the tone and setting wonderfully. There aren\u2019t necessarily any songs I would download onto my phone to listen to on a regular basis (besides the OPs and EDs which are great as well), but everything sounded perfect as the show was happening. The voice acting was also wonderful with varied emotions on display from each of the characters in a large cast of family members and friends of the main 4 characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.7:\\n\r\nThis is the department that separates Nagi no Asukara from the vast majority of anime shows out there. The overall cast of characters is one of the strongest overall that I have seen in anime. While the cast lacks one stand out character like a Lelouch, a Light, or a Saber, each character is incredibly human (which many anime can\u2019t say). Obviously all of the main characters are extremely relatable and 3 dimensional (although Manaka can leave a bit to be desired in terms of development). The characters that we see a lot of screen time of like Hikari, Miuna, Chisaki, and Kaname really get a lot of development and grow vastly out of their initial archetypes. Even characters who don\u2019t seem to develop much are still multi-faceted and very likable (Manaka, Tsumugu, Uroko-sama). Side characters are also strong, displaying their own opinions, struggles, and personalities when the spotlight is on them, even if it\u2019s only for a minute or two. Although there was a massive love web going on throughout the show (which I usually don\u2019t like), the characters made me interested in it and made it an enjoyable experience. Usually I come up with the pairs I want, and if they don\u2019t happen I feel disappointed. But with Nagi no Asukara, I didn\u2019t care who ended up with who, because I loved all the characters so much. I just wanted everyone to end up happy, because they all deserved to be happy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.8:\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is one of those anime that can make you laugh, cry, sit on the edge of your seat, pull your hair out in frustration, and do just about any other emotionally driven action. The beautiful world, and loveable characters alone could keep you anxiously waiting week to week for a new episode. Add in the wonderful story filled with drama, emotion, and excitement, and we have ourselves a show that earns extremely high marks in the enjoyment category. The show is one of those shows that you will want to rewatch immediately after finishing because you love it so much and just want to experience it all over again. This was THE show I waited for every week, dying of anticipation to see what would happen next. Think about the other wonderful shows that aired at the same time (Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Noragami, Nisekoi), and then you will realize just how enjoyable this show was for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.64:\\n\r\nWith an 8.64 overall score, Nagi no Asukara comes in at number 6 in my ever growing list of anime series. That should show you just how good this show is. Nagi no Asukara was a masterpiece not only from a production standpoint, but in its story and most importantly in its ridiculously strong characters. As far as drama, slice-of-life, fantasy, or romance anime go, this is among the elite and should be watched by all, and is an absolute must watch by fans of any of the genres listed above.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful slice of life story of friends in a beautiful world that is an absolute treasure to watch, will deserve consideration for anime of the year\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Eye-meltingly beautiful animation\\n\r\n+ Incredibly strong cast of characters\\n\r\n+ Intriguing world and lore\\n\r\n+ Drama is wonderful\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters can be annoying based on personal preferences\\n\r\n- Poorly marketed to the public\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Nagi no Asukara, watch...\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori - childhood friends, romance, fantasy, captivating world\\n\r\nAnohana the Flower We Saw That Day - childhood friends, romance, tear-jerking drama\\n\\n\r\n8.64/10 - Wonderful\\n\\n\r\n*For those of you disappointed in my 8.64 score and feel it deserves a 9 or a 10, please see my review scale and/or my google spreadsheet link of anime ratings on my profile and you will recognize just how insanely high this overall score is. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWell, for anyone who is a fan of the romantic drama genre, Nagi no Asukara (or \u201cA Lull in the Sea\u201d) is definitely a must watch. Personally though, I have never been a big fan of the genre for a wide variety of reasons, including its dependence on sappy melodrama, the abundance of clich\u00e9s, and a lack of general depth in the plotlines. However, after witnessing the massive influx of monumental praise for this series, I couldn't resist giving it a try. Quite frankly, it's not hard to see why this anime received such high praise; beautiful animation, memorable characters (sort of), aperfect soundtrack, and an immersive world that's impossible not to fall in love with. However, while NnA manages to break free of many of its genre's traditional flaws and stand out from the crowd, it seems to add a new flaw of its own for every flaw it eliminates. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In this universe, all humans were created by the \"Sea God\" and designed to live underwater. However, some humans who longed for the land abandoned the ocean, casted off the Sea God's gifts, and began a new life on the surface. Mankind was divided into sea dwellers and land dwellers, and it didn't take long for them develop a strong dislike for each other. The story follows four sea-dwelling teenagers who begin attending school on the surface, as their experiences with the land-dwellers create a youthful fantasy tale as the character's lives unfold for better or for worse in the bittersweet world that they live in.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just go ahead and say this right off the bat: NnA has one of the best settings and conceptual fantasy elements for a fictional world I've ever seen in an anime. Shioshishio, the underwater city, feels unbelievably alive, as does the surface world. It is truly special how immersive this setting really is, especially when you factor in the amazing and well-thought out mythos that the world is attached to regarding the Sea God and split between the ocean/land dwellers. That being said, I was dumbstruck when the show proceeded to glaze right over the world it had masterfully crafted as if it was nothing special. The plot of this show pays an insultingly miniscule amount of attention to its setting, which is by far the greatest part about the show. It's essentially skipped over in the beginning in favor of introducing the characters first and then only reappears in flashes and during major plot events; what this show instead opts to focus the majority of its time on is something that everyone and their mother has seen a million times over; Love polygons! While I have nothing against shows centered around romantic drama, I've already touched on some of the problems the genre always seems to fall into, and while NnA is a very good installment into the genre and does most aspects of the concept correctly, it is no major exception to copious melodrama and clich\u00e9s. It\u2019s just frustrating that there were so many great opportunities for potential main-plotlines here, like the hatred between the land dwellers and the sea dwellers (a symbol for racism?), yet they decided to go with something clich\u00e9. Overall, the plot is a pretty standard romantic drama with less focus on the exceptional setting and mythos than most people would want; a missed chance.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a show about romance, NnA is very character driven; it's these little guys that are going to either make or break the anime for you, and in my opinion, they make it. I think the best thing about NnA's characters is that the writers completely understand the role that each character should have and do a fantastic job of balancing the amount of screentime each of them get as well as fleshing out their emotions and motivations. A brilliant example of this is the character of Kaname, my personal favorite. He seems to be nothing more than a bystander character at first; he is given no discernible personality or emotions what so ever. However, when the show actually takes the time to give him a spot in limelight, you can see how much of a well-written and relatable character actually he is. The lack of attention that the show gave him compared to the other major characters in the beginning was purposeful; it served isolate him as \"the odd man out\", a feeling that we later see that Kaname was not oblivious to. This, my friends, is some very clever character writing. The rest of the characters, as I just mentioned, fill their respective roles more than adequately. Hikari is the protective friend with a short temper, Manaka is your typical ditzy girl character, and Chisaki is the shy, big-breasted girl, but they are more than just stereotypes; they all have depth to their personalities and they all receive character development, which is all you can really ask for. There is one character who really bothers me though, and that is Tsumugu. I don't understand why it is still considered acceptable to write characters like this\u2026 He has no personality what so ever, he never receives any development at any point, and he has only one expression: a blank stare. Could this guy be any more boring? And yet he is a huge part of the series of love-polygons that this show is centered around? Ridiculous. Overall though, this is a pretty well done cast of characters. I'd be shocked if you didn't find at least one that you get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that NnA has some truly beautiful animation; everything is colorful, bright, fluent, and alive. There aren't many scenes where the animation is fast paced, but when those scenes arrive, they also look fantastic. NnA is the definition of eye candy. The music is also well executed; a very calming selection of music for a very calming anime. It doesn't have the heart-wrenching emotional tracks of, say, a Clannad: After Story, but I don\u2019t think it needed to. I don't think I've ever seen a pair of OPs that perfectly represent the anime they are attached to, both animation-wise and sound-wise. I don't think they could have been done any better (same goes for the EDs, I suppose). The voice acting is pretty good as well, although there is a lot more SCREAMING then crying going on here\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of romantic dramas, you have no excuse for not watching NnA; you will absolutely love it. If you are not a fan of the genre, I still think it's worth a watch. The immersive world, excellent animation, and well-written characters make the experience worthwhile. The only people who I think should pass on this anime are those who can't stand shows about romance or shows with very little action.",

            "content": "STORY\r\nThe story may seem like a typical romance, with a sea people twist, but it's so much more. At first, it was focused on the children and their feelings for each other and the surface. But as the children realized they were apart of something much bigger, the series was about accepting change and how some people wish for it and some fear it. More importantly, I thought this series told a good mixture of fantasy romance quite well. I loved the characters and was interested in the story's lore. The themes of unrequited love, change, and acceptance, were mashed around well. But, there liesa weakness in this story. The pacing. While you don't really notice this until the last quarter, it's pace is a bit too slow. Instead of dragging things out, there should have used that time to some a bit more interactions between the characters. Since they didn't do this, relationships were given poor resolutions and the ending was somewhat of a mixed bag. But in the end, I still enjoyed the story Nagi no Asukara told.\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\n Most of the characters are nicely developed, with a great main cast and supporting cast. With each character having their own personal problems and flaws to deal with. My favorite character, has to be Chisaki. She arguably goes through the toughest times, and I can kind of relate to her fears. But, there's also a few characters I'm disappointed with. Manaka is probably the most controversial character in the show. Some people are annoyed by her, and some are cool with her. I'm with the latter, but I wasn't too pleased with her character in the second half. While she does develop I found her presence to be a plot device in the second half. I just feel what they did to her character was freeze her development, and in a show about change, that's a bad thing. Another thing I didn't like was that, in the end, the character relationships weren't tied up as I liked. This traces back to the pacing problem, and it's a shame. There was room for things to be tied up better, but overall, the characters are the best part of the show.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nAnimated by P.A Works, Nagi no Asukara is amazing to look at. From the stunning backgrounds, lighting, and the overall feel of the show. I have to say, it's probably P.A's best work. Rivaling their past show, Hanasaku. The animation is also pretty good for a romance, and that's because of the fantasy aspect of the show. The swimming looks really good, and while it's no where near Free!'s animation, it's fluid enough. The best aspect of the animation has to be the backgrounds. I felt that P.A Works know what a run down fishing town looks and feels like, and the show wouldn't be the same without these backgrounds. \\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe music of Nagi is very relaxing to listen to. Fitting of the theme of the show. A half of the ost was light summer like songs, but the latter half leaded on the cold and emotional parts. I really like this variety of songs, because it reflects the story. I find that the ost, to be a very nice listen for doing homework, or cleaning up your room. It's really nice to listen to. As for the openings and endings, I found every song to be nice. Like the ost they were nice, and I didn't really skip them. Okay, I admit, the second one is pretty amazing. It's a really good song with great build up, and emotional relevance to the plot. Overall, it's really nice, and I would give it a listen if you are doing your homework.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara may start out a bit bland, but it;s really a coming of age story about friction between two lands as well as relationships. I felt for the characters, because of how they changed and grew. And, I like how each character was characterized because of how it revolved around how everything has to change. Your home, family, friends, and most importantly, you as a person change. And that makes Nagi no Asukara worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Nagi no Asukara] for your reading pleasure.\r\nStory(9): Nagi no Asukara has a very interesting story that will convey both heart warming moments and heart breaking moments. Much of the story is strongly driven by romantic entanglements of the various characters present. In a world where there are two types of Humans in the form of land dwellers and sea dwellers, when 4 sea dwelling teenagers are forced to attend school alongside land dwellers; the internal struggles as well as the emotional impact of trying to adapt to the new situation, results in an interesting Slice of Life type of drama.The story itself revolves around the changing relationships between the 4 sea dwellers as well as their relationships with land dwellers and elders of the sea village they reside in. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10): The animation used in Nagi no Asukara is simply marvelous, quite outstanding even amongst strong contenders of 2014 animes. The art done for the underwater world of the Sea dwellers are beautifully rendered, making it effortless for the viewer to imagine oneself as being in the Sea village. This creates the feeling of being underwater in a world that is like our own yet different at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10): Nagi no Asukara has exceptionally well done sound effects, voice acting, as well as the music that is seamlessly integrated into the scenes with precision. The sound of an underwater world is most certainly unknown to most of us as we possess no natural capability to survive underwater for any extensive length of time; however if one could survive underwater, the sounds you might hear is quite possibly near identical to the sounds Nagi no Asukara delivers. In addition to the realistic sounds, the music utilized is quite emotion-provoking. During emotionally powerful moments in the anime, the music delivers a strong force unto the viewer that can definitely cause the activation of tear ducts without conscious control.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10): As such animes are mainly driven by the interactions and relationships between the various characters rather than flashy fights, the Characters of Nagi no Asukara most certainly fulfill its role in creating a high quality anime of great enjoyment potential. The changing world around them and the need to adapt to an unknown world from their own, results in changing relationships. When romance is added in to the emotional drama that is Nagi no Asukara, it becomes quite interesting to observe how everything will end. The concern, worry, and fear as well as confusion regarding their changing world view, is something that is channeled in a very human way; as these concerns are not only those of 14 year olds but also for adults, it is very easy to understand the mental processes of the characters in Nagi no Asukara.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): Nagi no Asukara was a very enjoyable anime. Though I personally prefer animes of the darker nature, Nagi no Asukara has enough twist and turns plus emotional dramatic moments to maintain my interest. It was very difficult to predict what will happen, who would end up with who, can the main character come to understand his confusions and overcome his fears, as well as what in blazes is happening to the world in Nagi no Asukara? Thus, even without flashy fights or the mysterious and psychological aspects of darker animes, I found Nagi no Asukara to be most enjoyable indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9): It is of my personal opinion that Nagi no Asukara possess a strong enough story with a very human element to it, which adds to the relatable drama and emotional moments, thus can be enjoyed by a large variety of Anime watchers. In addition, the amusement from observing a certain demon butler squirm with discomfort from watching Nagi no Asukara was most enjoyable and implies Nagi no Asukara is meant for those with a sense of humanity. As such, I would recommend Nagi no Asukara to those with a heart and suggest supernatural beings watch other Animes more to their liking, such as Another. \\n\\n\r\n[This review has been brought to you by the Funtom Company!

            "content": "This anime was rather dull and childish. \"Emotions\" and \"change\". This didn't really carry any message with it except the repetition of these two motives that aren't even deeply explored. Same shit you see everywhere except that here they actually even managed to contradict themselves a few times and have opinions that are logically wrong. Did they reach any conclusions on either of the subjects they tried to explore? Oh gosh they did, \"the world is filled with beautiful shining emotions that are passed down and surpass time\". A lot of attempts to be serious sound like a badly written essay of a 14 yearold who was desperate to get a passing grade in his literature class.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not realistic. Tsumugu wtf? He's a motherfucking lifeless robot who can see into other people's minds because they're shallow. He's supposed to be special because of that as no one else seems to possess that convenient ability called sapience.\\n\\n\r\nChisaki wtf? You didn't feel like you were allowed to love anyone else because you thought you should wait for Hikari and the rest to return? Wtf is wrong with you? Five fucking years have passed and there wasn't any development, she's thinking like a child, a very stupid child indeed. She wanted to be the fucking sacrifice because she's the \"only one who's changed\" and it wasn't fair to the others because she changed and they didn't. She felt like she betrayed them. She spent five fucking years without her friends and family, living with Tsumugu and his grandfather all while she couldn't even enter her hometown to see if everyone's okay. Hikari, Manaka and Kaname felt like a day passed by. I would feel anger in her stead, not fucking guilt. Anger because they don't know the pain and what it was like. It feels natural to embrace the change and even emphasize it, not act like a kid and pretend that five years didn't go by.\\n\\n\r\nKaname's one of the characters I simply didn't develop any feelings for. I feel like he didn't get enough screen time, but by what I've seen they probably didn't know what lines to give him.\\n\\n\r\nI did find Manaka a little annoying, but as I'm trying to be objective I won't count that in. Everything she's done until she went to hibernate hinted that she liked Tsumugu. The plot twist on that boat was poorly implemented and expected. Everyone knew that Hikari was going to get a reward for being a tryhard even though the plot didn't go in his favor. \\n\\n\r\nThe show didn't use its potential. When I saw it recommended from Shinsekai Yori, I had completely different expectations. I personally hoped that the plot would turn darker, not resolve around badly done romance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent, I didn't like the openings very much but they knew which scenes to emphasize and used the correct music while doing it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was incredible. It's truly beautifully done. I didn't watch it in HD, but it still felt amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was decent. I didn't hate the series, it was fun to watch, but I can't shake the feeling that I wasted my time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10",

And I was mind blown. P.A Works have done a really, really great job by making this.\r\nStory : Well, you might considered the background story a bit strange when you first watched it and then you raised your eyebrows. I mean, underwater villagers? It's a bit strange right? But, I promise you, with that kind of background, you'll be super amazed as the story progressed. \r\nNagi no Asukara served you a really interesting dramaand romance story. In my experience, I thought I've figured out who ended up with who, but I was totally wrong. Because they gave you a twist that sometimes you can't expect. So, for me, the story was a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art was a complete beyond awesome. The beautiful backgrounds and scenery, the details, even the water details, it was really awesome and breathtaking. So, it's a 10/10 because of the amazing art and details.\\n\\n\r\nSound : The Opening and Endings are both lovely. Really soothing and relaxing. The voice actors themselves were awesome as well. The main male trio were voiced by new faces in the anime industry, such as Ishikawa Kaito, Hanae Natsuki and Ohsaka Ryouta, yet they have gave us an awesome performances. Hana Kanazawa, Ai Kayano, Ishihara Kaori and Mikako Komatsu also gave us their best performances while voicing their characters. Both the OSTs and Voice Actors are 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : The characters are great in their own ways. I admired all of them. The unrequited romances, friendships and conflicts between a character with another character or a character with themselves are great. It's a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall : For me Nagi no Asukara was a pretty amazing anime. The story, the characters, the conflicts and dramas, it made me want to joined them and explore. I had a great time watching this, all the funny moments, the breathtaking moments, even the sad moments (I remember crying watching several episodes couple of times), I'm glad I watched Nagi no Asukara. Really, I do. For an enjoyment, it was a 8/10, and the overall score for Nagi no Asukara was a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance, drama and fantasy with a little bit of twist, then Nagi no Asukara is definitely the one.",

            "content": "The age-old idiom of \"don't judge a book by its cover\" never ceases to amaze me. Every so often you come across an anime that just blows your expectations out of the water and delivers something completely different. In the case of Nagi no Asukara, on the surface (or below the surface in this case) it mostly looks like yet another done-to-death high-school romcom. Consequently, if there was one thing I didn't expect coming into this, it'd be that it turned out to be the most beautiful anime TV-series I've seen aired since 2011.\r\n--Story--\r\nNagi no Asukara (or Nagi-Asu for short) takes place in a fantasyworld where there exist two different subspecies of humans. In this story, people originally came from the ocean, however over time there were ones who started crawling up on land as well to see what lay above the surface of the water. Now, ages later, the population has been split completely into land people and sea people, and they generally live quite isolated from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a circle of childhood friends from the sea, living in an underwater village called Shioshishio. For various reasons their local middle school closed down, and they had no choice but to transfer schools\u2026 to one above the surface. Trying to adapt to a life on land is not an easy thing, as they constantly have to keep themselves wet in order to not dry out their Ena; the protective shell given to the sea people by the Sea God, which is what enables them to live and breathe underwater in the first place. Furthermore, there is substantial discrimination and tension between the land people and the sea people which keeps raising new hurdles for the group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous areas that the plot revolves around over the course of time. There is the diplomatic relationship between the two groups of people, the mysterious supernatural aspects concerning the Sea God and Ena, and last but not least Nagi-Asu has some of the most complicated love drama I've ever come across in anime. However fear not, because Nagi no Asukara is an exceedingly rare case of romance done right.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nYou see, unlike 99% of all romance anime out there, Nagi-Asu is actually unpredictable. Normally you barely have to watch five minutes of the first episode of an anime TV-series in order to know with almost complete certainty which couplings will end up taking place before the end (unless there turns out to be no development at all, which is even worse), but not this time.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the main character cast of Nagi-Asu is rather large as well as evenly divided in gender. There is also no one that really can be called a protagonist in this series; Hikari probably gets the most screen time but I wouldn't really go as far as to call him a \u201clead\" character. Point being that it never really feels like anyone has any innate \u201cadvantage\" when it comes to love rivalry simply due to the concept of plot armour, because they all appear to be on fairly even grounds from start to finish. Above all though, if you would draw up all the characters and their various crushes in a relationship graph, you would very quickly realize that there are just way too many arrows\u2026 and there is no obvious nor optimal solution in sight. Hence, I honestly didn't know how any of this would turn out until very close to the end of the entire series, and that is something extraordinarily rare in anime (which in itself is a pretty sad realization for the sake of the anime industry).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, all the love drama aside, the character development in Nagi no Asukara is fantastic. Each and every character feels like he/she actually serves a purpose, and adds something crucial to the bigger picture. The anime covers a quite large timespan and there is plenty of opportunity to see how everyone matures and changes over the course of the story. All the members of the main character cast have very specific and detailed personalities and depth behind them, and you never get the feeling that any of them are any less important than the other. I guess the best way to explain it is that the supernatural aspects aside, there is a constant sense of realism when it comes to the characterization in Nagi-Asu and it just kept getting better and better the longer it went because of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Animation--\\n\r\nOh the burden of not having an 11/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing you will realize within the first few minutes of the very first episode, it is that the visuals of Nagi-Asu are simply out of this world phenomenal. I'm not talking as much about the facial expressions etcetera although those are certainly very good as well, but this category is all about the environments. Everything involving the sea in this anime is breathtaking. Absolutely stunning. The underwater world and its submerged town has all kinds of marine creatures swimming around everywhere in perfect detail, and the lighting coming through the ocean surface (which works sort of like the sky in this case) and how it refracts with the water looked almost futuristic at times. P.A. Works really outdid themselves this time around.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that the surface world is that much less impressively looking in any way, as the animation quality of this show is just all-round top notch. I don't really have much to say about it however other than the fact that it is really solid throughout; it's just that it kind of gets outshined simply by how gorgeous the water world of Nagi no Asukara is. I really cannot praise it enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nAnything starring Hanazawa Kana is always an immediate potential winner in my book, but she's not exactly the only factor to take into account regarding the audio of Nagi no Asukara. As far as the voice acting goes, I think pretty much everyone really lived out their characters' roles as good as you could possibly ask for. While there was no one character that really stood out for me as being above the others in this regard, the amount of feeling that was put into the voice acting should definitely not be understated, and consequently I think it was a really good performance by the seiyuu cast in general.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack\u2026 this part is actually pretty hard to comment on. The reason for this is that the music of Nagi-Asu is generally pretty quiet. It doesn't have any sort of epic OST or catchy/emotional music; rather it goes with a generally ambient theme that tries to up-play the atmosphere of the anime in general as well as its key scenes. As far as that goal goes, I think it does its job very well, but on the flipside it also results in the individual tracks not being very memorable as they're pretty much only good alongside the show itself and not as something you would ever listen to on its own in a music playlist. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it's simply the way it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe various OP/ED themes would probably all fall into the category of \u201cgood, not great\" to me; originally I wasn't too fond of them but they kind of grew on me over time as the show kept getting more and more emotional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel that the music of Nagi-Asu was mostly intended as a supporting aspect for other categories of the show rather than something intended to be great on its own. It's not the most common way of approach but if that was indeed the producers' goal then I think it was executed fairly satisfactory.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nThis show took up almost all the spare time I had available over the course of the three days it took me to marathon it. Normally that is not something I manage to do quite as much anymore, at least not for anime of this type of genre, but in the case of Nagi no Asukara I really could not stop watching it. It has this constant drive of making you want to know more, both regarding what is going to happen to the characters in focus, but also regarding the entire population of the two human subspecies and the world itself. It is extremely immersive and has a huge sense of realism to it that makes it really hard to not get absorbed by it. Also, like I mentioned earlier, it is less predictable than most anime series out there so you can never take what is going to happen next for granted.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is a series for people seeking feels and beautiful landscapes. It utilizes environments you normally never get to see in anime and it does so in style. It once again showcases that a seemingly stereotypical concept can be extremely successful when you add one or two twists to it on a very basic level, as well as boost it with very high production values. It also makes you care, not just for the main characters but for everyone and everything in it as the scope of Nagi no Asukara is unusually large.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me bask in its beauty as well as sob silently. It went above and beyond all my expectations and now I have to consider it as one of the best I've seen in ages. A gem not quite like any other.",

They even have stairs. They drink broth. I just don't understand what was the point of such a forced setting.\\n\\n\nThere are loads of things that I don't understand, but just to say a few: why in the world do people from the sea and from the shore hate each other so much if they don't differ among each other in the slightest? They have the exact same culture and habits, they eat the same stuff, they even put the same designs on curtains; Why the hell should salt fall from the sky? I'm fine with fantasy but you could at least try to come up with some kind of explanation; Did someone tell those guys that they didn't have to go as far as to make every possible pairing? There are fanfictions for that; Just where did the other students of the sea school go? That's kind of creepy, they simply melted away, right?\\n\\n\nOh, and yes, I totally agree that the series did a 180 turn. The characters visibly leveled up in annoyance.\\n\\n\nThe ending was the best part of them all, it just wrapped things up as uncomprehensible as they were and gave it all that sickly sweet taste that dulls every black hole in the plot to a triviality. \\n\nThe dialogues were awkward, trite and embarrassing to listen to.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\nWhen I first saw the description for Nagi No Asukara I really didn't know what to expect. The synopsis didn't really give off much of an idea of what this show was going to be like. So thinking that Nagi no Asukara would be another cheesy romantic comedy. I began watching with low expectations. Little did I know that what I was about to watch would be one of the most enjoyable slice of life anime I have seen in a long time. \r\n     A long time ago people livedand flourished in the sea. But one day some of the sea people wanted to live in the land, and thus they moved to the land and away from the sea. The story revolves around 4 middle school students who are forced to attend a school on land after their school in the sea village closes. Many problems such as adapting to new environments and dificulties making friends follow. \\n\\n\r\n      The story presents itself as a slice of life in the beginning with the main focus on problems the main characters have on the surface. Now for some people the pacing in the first half might be a bit slow, but There is good reason for that. As a character driven anime, Nagi No Asukara has to focus on its characters a lot and flesh them out properly, and Nagi No Asukara does just that. The show uses a lot of its time developing its characters and making sure they feel more like actual people rather than flat characters that you care little about. Was it worth it? Definitely. \\n\\n\r\n      But don't be fooled. Nagi No Asukara doesn't always stay a fun, light slice of life. The mood changes dramatically darker in the second half. The show takes a turn from slice of life to being more dramatic, and this is where Nagi No Asukara falls short on.  Many slice of life romances that try to implement drama in their plot tend to be overly melodramatic, and this also seems to be the problem with Nagi No Asukara. Nagi No Asukara's second half is chocked full of drama. From unrequited love to arguing. The show sometimes becomes quite frustrating in the dramatic parts. Many parts felt uncomfortably lengthened because of the melodrama and how the characters are so unwilling to talk and make up after an argument. Now although to me this wasn't a major problem. It still dampened from the experience as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n      Story isn't the only thing Nagi No Asukara focuses on.The animation of Nagi No Asukara is top-notch, with animation that rivals even The big studios like Kyoto animation The show looks absolutely gorgeous. The backgrounds were created with such detail that it felt like I was watching an art gallery.  Character designs were also very appealing and detailed. Seriously, Nagi No Asukara's art is definitely some of the best I've ever seen in the anime industry. I'm not exaggerating at all.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound of Nagi no Asukara is also paid much attention on. \"lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~\" by Ray is a great first opening that fits the slice of life aspect of the show perfectly. The second opening  \"ebb and flow\" also by Ray has a more serious tone to it and is also a great song to listen to. ( I have already listened to it 20 times). The soundtrack also doesn't disappoint. Pretty much every track and tune fits the mood well. Nagi no Yanagi also does a great job on the ending song.The first ending song \"Aqua Terrarium\", is a calming song that fits the show very well. The second ending song \"Mitsuba no Musubime\" is also a very good song that fits with the second half very well.\\n\\n\r\n     As a character driven show, the characters are the aspects that make or break the series, and I can honestly say that Nagi No Asukara has quite the cast. The main cast consists of 5 characters. The crybaby Manaka Mukaido, the hotheaded Hikari Sakishima, the calm and collected Kihara Tsumugu, beautiful and caring Hiradaira Chisaki, and the handsome Isaki Kaname. Now at first the characters felt very stereotypical. Hikari is the main character that gets mad at many things and gets the viewers pissed off because of how much a jerk he can be. Manaka felt like those characters that were made to be cute and cater to the audience. Tsumugu was the smart one in the show that would preach life lessons to the other characters. Kaname was the handsome guy, and Chisaki is that kind girl who also joins in on the love triangle. As you can see. The cast doesn't seem to be very likable or original in the beginning. What P.A works does an extraordinary job on though, is putting a serious amount of depth to the characters and developing them immensely over the course of the show.The characters develop dramatically and feel way more alive throughout the show. As you get to learn more about the characters through the show. You end up feeling way more connected to the characters.They turn into characters that you actually care about. Not second dimensional characters that you forget about in a few weeks, but characters that really make an impression on you.But that's not the end. There are two more main characters added through the show. Shiodome Miuna and Sayu Hisanuma. Although they only receive development in later parts of the show. They recieve a lot of development through the series and although they might not get as much depth as the other characters. I ended up caring for them just as much as the main cast.Another very interesting part of the show is that Nagi No Asukara has one of the biggest and most complicated love webs I have seen in a while. Almost every important character in the show loves someone else. And watching this web unfold was truly an enjoyable experience. As I watched the characters grow up and see how they coped with their unrequited love. I began to root for their happiness from the bottoms of my heart. The characters truly made an impact to me, and it was a bit sad for me to finish the show.\\n\\n\r\n      Nagi No Asukara isn't for everyone. It's slow pacing in the beginning and it's focus on the characters are enough to scare off people who have little patience and want immediate action . But for people who are patient enough. Nagi no Asukara is a show that will deliver. With its beautiful atmosphere, great characters, and a very interesting story. Nagi No Asukara is that gem in the rough that should definitely be watched by fans of romance and slice of life.",

            "content": "First a little background, having just watched Golden Time, I was on the look out for something new to watch and first came across Nagi no Asukara in the suggestions list. At a first glance at the anime and having read its description, I thought perhaps it could be worthwhile and decided to chance it. It didn't disappoint at all, this show was magical from start to finish and I couldn't have been happier to have stumbled across this gem. It certainly ranks among my top 7 favourite anime.\r\nThis show is a \"slice of life, fantasy and romance\" show in a nutshell, however it takesthese themes and fulfills them really rather well and isn't without some original twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in two villages, one in the sea and one in the land. There is a conflict between the people of these villages due to friction about their cultures and beliefs. The people from Shishoshio, the sea village, believe that the people originated in the water and that those who had left in the past for land had betrayed the sea god and had turned their backs on their way of life. This rivalry in the show is actually well developed as the show goes on and plays a defining role in moulding the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts of with four main characters, essentially around whom the meat of the story revolves around (although there are two other main characters added shortly after). These are Chisaki, Kaname, Hikari and Manaka, the few children in the sea village. They have been childhood friends and in the same school for as long as they can remember and  are being transferred to the school on the land to continue their education. Obviously, having been together for so long, they all have strong feeling for each other and the refreshing fact is how realistic their relationships are. They fight, have fun, love each other and are jealous of each other at times. Unlike many  other shows this really helps drive the story further on solid foundations. \\n\\n\r\nThe story then revolves about their life on the land and the interactions between the characters. The new main characters added are Tsumungu, a quiet but reassured boy who lives on the land with his grandpa and two younger girls, Sayu and Miuana. All of these characters are well developed over the show and themselves are involved in secondary themes such as dealing with second marriages in their family and loneliness. Not everything is laid out on a plate however and there are certain things that are left for you to figure out or wonder at. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half goes through the gears and describes the life of the characters and how they get on, with a few usual bumps and twists, some of which is original and some which is to be expected but by no means boringly cliched. The main plot of the start is the build up to the \"Onefeukhi\" a ritual which is carried out by the sea and land people together to pay sacrifice to the sea god. I shall say no more. This is one of the very few anime with a twist that is shocking however done in such a way that doesn't irritate but actually works with the story and ultimately makes it better. It is this \"twist\" that actually helps to make this such a memorable anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo thats the story glanced over, of course there is so much going on all at once for me to explain but take this much 1) The complex relationships (between sister and brother, children and parents and between the children themselves, even the adults, the villagers too. 2) The character development is paced perfectly with the story and is satisfying to watch unfold. I haven't even scratched the surface of the story yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nice, there are no faults and quite mellow. \\n\r\nThe soundtracks are well used and OPs are definitely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gave me a chance to feel what I had with anime such as Clannad and Little Busters. It's a story driven by the entire cast, there is a whole bigger picture behind everything and the fantasy setting doesn't detract it really defines the show in a way while still making everything absolutely relatable (not in a practical sense but an emotional one). \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something with substance, a well paced story and a brilliant cast all blended to amazing effect, Nagi no Asukara is not a show to miss.",

            "content": "Oh, I'm not gonna make myself any new friends with this review. PA Works is one of those studios that you either praise the shit out of or you just don't give a rat's ass about. Even for the number of \"successes\" that they've had in the past, I don't really find myself feeling anything but indifference toward the bulk of stuff that they've produced. Hell, I'm surprised I found myself giving this show a negative review. Granted, I've never truly liked a single show that they've ever released. PA Works' programmes aren't as visually enticing as A-1 Pictures', they're nowhere near as emotionally involvingas Kyoto Animation's, and they're not as comfortable to watch as JC Staff's. But yeah, PA Works doesn't really rank all that high on my visceral outrage meter. So what is it about Nagi no Asukara that doesn't work for me? Well, it's hard to sum up in just a few words so let's just dive straight into the review.\\n\\n\r\nI should point out that I actually quite enjoyed watching Nagi no Asukara when I first started. The fantasy setting was certainly intriguing and I also found myself quite fascinated by the relations between the land and sea people. Of course, another reason why I picked this show up in the first place was that it was supposed to be one of the better anime romantic dramas out there on the market and I was in the middle of a romance binge at that point in time. But over time, the stuff that I found myself liking about the show combined with other things the show was doing as it progressed ended up causing me to actually really hate the show. Allow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\n1) The \"romance\" is fucking terrible and it eclipses the actual plot of the show\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not one to despise will they/won't they romances from the get-go (especially given how I happen to adore the shit out of Rumiko Takahashi's works) and I usually don't take umbrage with love polygons because if done well enough, it makes for a more suspenseful read and leads to interesting developments going down (like in the manga for Ichigo 100%). But in Nagi no Asukara's case, nothing of the sort actually happens. This is the kind of love polygon that's just meant to shoehorn some shitty melodrama into the show for no other reason than to give off the illusion of actual romantic development.\\n\\n\r\nKaname likes Chisaki, but Chisaki has the hots for Hikari. Hikari wants to bone Manaka, but Manaka's fingering herself to the thought of Tsumugu. Meanwhile, Tsumugu's just standing there like Kurasama from School Rumble with a blank expression on his face. Hell, this isn't even a love polygon. It's a love line segment, if anything. I mean, I wouldn't mind this so much if the characters were actually capable of carrying a scene without it devolving into melodramatic territory. I wouldn't mind this so much if the farcical melodrama didn't eclipse the actual plot of the story, but it unfortunately does.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing against works that try to tell a romantic subplot whilst telling a larger story at hand, and if done correctly, it can actually be quite lovely (i.e. Futurama, Justice League, Daria, The Spectacular Spider-Man, etc). Unfortunately, it would seem that PA Works forgot that the real story at hand is (supposedly) about two tribes of people with vastly different ways of life that must work together to avoid cataclysmic disaster. I wouldn't mind this so much if the \"romance\" actually went somewhere but unfortunately it doesn't and it never does at any point in the series. Hell, the resolution is open-ended with only one official couple actually forming by the end of it all (and even then, that pairing didn't have much build-up going for it).\\n\\n\r\n2) The characters are one-note archetypes with no depth whatsoever\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it seems like just yesterday when I was 15/16 years old so the hormone mixture was still running wild and I was having a shitload of brand new experiences. As such, I can definitely sympathise with what our leading quartet would (presumably) be going through... to a certain degree, anyway. Unfortunately, being able to sympathise with someone does not a good character make. I suppose it's not entirely fair to say that the characters are one-note archetypes but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said they weren't defined by a gimmick or two.\\n\\n\r\nHikari is your typical male tsundere, whilst Kaname is the mature, mild-mannered one. Manaka is the primary love interest who's a crybaby, relies on her friends, and has the hots for some other guy whilst Chisaki is the tertiary love interest who withholds her feelings for Hikari because he knows he wants to fuck the shit out of Manaka. Meanwhile, Tsumugu doesn't even have any sort of characterisation about him. He's just this quiet guy who follows our leading quartet around.\\n\\n\r\nManaka and Chisaki could've easily been fused into a single character, because they both feel like they were meant to originally be one character but were then written into to separate separate characters for some undecipherable reason. On that note, Kaname has to be the most useless character in the entire show. I appreciate how he's a foil to Hikari, but he never contributes anything of relevance to the story at hand. All he really does is just stand there chatting with the other characters. At least Manaka, Hikari, Chisaki, and even Tsumugu (at one point) contributed *something* of relevance to the story at hand. Hell, I can't even call Kaname a Kaworu Nagisa clone because Kaworu actually did more stuff in Evangelion in one episode than Kaname ever does across the span of 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, I really shouldn't be bitching about Kaname and Tsumugu not contributing anything of substance to the plot because they (along with some irrelevant side characters) are the only ones I could actually find myself liking. I couldn't help but feel contempt any time I saw Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, or Miuna in the frame because they're so fucking unbearable. Hikari's tendency to shout at everything he doesn't understand is what ultimately causes me to viscerally despise him because I just want him to shut the fuck up AND HE NEVER DOES. Whilst I hate Manaka and Chisaki, I can safely say that they're nowhere near as infuriating as Hikari is.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, let's talk about our two lead \"heroines\" and why they make me want to shoot up some heroin. Manaka is a moeblob plot device and nothing more. Thankfully, she's not the insufferable hyperactive type of moeblob, but that still doesn't change the fact that she's a useless crybaby who serves no purpose other than to advance the plot. Say what you will about Usagi from Sailor Moon, but at least Usagi grows as an individual over the course of the series. Hell, at least Nagisa from Clannad helped spark Tomoya's growth as an individual. I have absolutely nothing of the sort to say about Manaka whatsoever. Virtually everything I've said about Manaka can also be applied to Chisaki, but it should be noted that Chisaki at least has *some* sense of characterisation about her.\\n\\n\r\n3) The worldbuilding in Nagi-Asu is absolutely appalling.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the fact that this show takes place in a fantasy world where one group of people split off from another and then went on to live their own lives whilst still retaining *some* form of contact with one another, one would assume that the cultures of the people on land and at sea would be highly divergent but that couldn't be further from the truth. Aside from the fact that the people of Shioshishio live underwater and worship a sea deity, there's virtually no conceivable differences between the people of the former village and the people of Oshiooshi. I mean, their names are just anagrams of one another's for Christ's sake!\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, I love how the series claims that all of humanity originated from the sea and moved onto land but we only really see two locations throughout the span of the entire series. By sheer implication, Shioshishio would've been the origin of all humanity since that's the only sea village we're ever made aware of and it's never stated whether or not other sea villages exist. So how is it that a faction of people could emigrate from a single village and then go on to populate the rest of the planet? I mean, Nagi no Asukara does exist in /some/ space of reality. We have electrical grids, motor vehicles, grocery stores, and other such things that would imply that the history of the world that Nagi no Asukara also follows real world events to /some/ degree. I wouldn't be bitching about this so much if the show didn't bring up all this shit and decided to do absolutely fuck-all with it. Hell, I wouldn't have minded any of this whatsoever if the actual \"romance\" went anywhere meaningful, but both plots are fucking awful and half-baked.\\n\\n\r\n4) The second half of the show is a poorly paced time skip and has a resolution that forces a happy ending\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show starts us off with a time skip after a MAJOR event occurs, which is already an indicator that these episodes are bound to suck because PA Works already proved that they're incapable of writing a cogent plot in the first half of the series. With that in mind though, it's not like the first half of the show was entirely without merit because the actual plot of the story, though extremely atrophied in terms of depth and detail, was still interesting enough to keep my attention and the episode before the timeskip was nothing short of intense to the point where it was almost enough to make me forget about all the shit I was complaining about previously.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I should point out that I don't have anything against time skips in general. When you get right down to it, a time skip is a literary device and what ultimately matters is how that literary device is used. Oyasumi Punpun, one of my all-time favourite mangas uses time skips to great effect, as it covers life-changing events throughout various points in time that ended up shaping the person that Punpun would eventually become. Unfortunately, the guys at PA Works lack the tact of Inio Asano so they just ended up using the time skip as a crutch to avoid actually writing up the direct aftermath of what just happened after said major event.\\n\\n\r\nIf that weren't bad enough, the pacing is just dreadful. There's almost no sense of transition whatsoever, so events are brought up like there's no fucking tomorrow. Random plot details are also introduced at random intervals with almost no sense of foreshadowing whatsoever and effectively diminish the impact of events that previously happened. The events pre-timeskip implied that the world was doomed because the sea god was angry at the fact that people abandoned the sea to live on the surface, and the land dwellers aren't appeasing him with regular offerings. It's not a perfect set-up, but at least that seems like something meaningful, right? Post-timeskip, apparently the sea god is just lonely and he needs someone to cuddle on those cold winter nights. Way to ruin what little good there was to be found in your shitty programme, PA Works!\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the actual ending to the entire series just feels forced beyond all belief. I understand the desire to see everything work out for the better in regards to your protagonists, but god damn it, you have to fucking EARN that happy ending and I can safely say that nobody in Nagi no Asukara deserved that happy ending. The entire conflict is just resolved without any hint of subtlety, foreshadowing, or anything of the sort. Hell, nobody ends up getting sacrificed to appease the sea god's raging boner by the end of it all! Like, what the actual fuck PA Works? Is it so hard to actually write up an ending that doesn't stick a gigantic middle finger to anyone with a functioning brain? Of all the things that I dislike about Nagi no Asukara, the ending would definitely have to be the thing that I hate the most.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion: this show sucks the chrome off of doorknobs. In between the farcical melodrama, the shitty worldbuilding, the hackneyed \"romance,\" AND that shitty ending, I just have one question to ask: Why? As in, \"why did PA Works even greenlight this show in the first place if it had such obvious problems?\" I guess this is the level of quality we should expect from a studio that's effectively the poor man's Kyoto Animation. Whilst Nagi no Asukara is far from the worst thing I've ever watched, it's still undoubtedly the most disappointing thing I've ever sat through. Here's to hoping that PA Works won't fuck up another show beyond all belief... oh wait, we have Charlotte. *sigh*",

            "content": "P.A. Works is known for delivering shows chock full of drama in a school setting; however, different from shows like Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari, romance is the primary focus in Nagi no Asukara. Why does this matter? Because P.A. Works really nailed it on the head with the drama this time around, and romance might have been the reason why. Compared to other romances, Nagi no Asukara's unique setting combined with its compelling cast of characters makes Nagi no Asukara a fresh entry into the established school romance genre.\r\nNagi no Asukara's setting revolves around two worlds: the land above the sea and Shioshishio, thevillage under it. People who live on land are the same as normal humans, like us. The people living in Shioshishio however have an advantage. With a protective layer around them called \"Ena,\" the villagers of Shioshishio are able to live underwater while also being able to freely maneuver on land. The setting is completely unrealistic, yet at the same time, the relationships explored in the show feel completely genuine. Of course, the drama is exaggerated to the point of being completely artificial, but such exaggeration is a necessary evil to keep its audience enthralled; a tactic that worked well. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, a setting combining two distinct worlds wouldn't be complete without its own religion and lore, and Nagi no Asukara certainly delivers. The problem is that the religion and lore comes on too strong. Romances are supposed to be stories that are driven by the character's emotions and actions, but in Nagi no Asukara, there are many times where the plot advances as a direct consequence of its religion and lore. Now I'm not saying that these events shouldn't ever occur, but in Nagi no Asukara's case, the plot advances so many times due to its mythology that you begin to question whether the show is about teenagers experiencing romance or high schoolers fighting against the supernatural. While it certainly can be both, the fact that the mythology is so forward in the show consequently adds many plot inconsistencies and leaves the watcher with numerous questions; it ultimately detracts from the romance, which is conclusively the prevailing factor. I'll apologize in advance for being so vague, but as the plot and mythology are so closely tied together, I wouldn't be able to provide a good example without spoiling the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance itself, be prepared to draw one of the silliest relationship charts ever. A square? A pentagon? A hexagon? Unfortunately, things are just too complicated, and with seven main characters, it would be pretty much impossible to keep everything straight in your head. Yet somehow, I can keep all the relationships straight in my head. That's where the Nagi no Asukara shines. Even while the plot advances and everything becomes more and more complicated, Nagi no Asukara doesn't want you to forget that these are the main characters. Yet while it's impressive that I've become attached to the characters to this point, there are still too many characters. While I can keep the relationships straight, it doesn't mean I fully understand all the characters. Talking about specifics, the only characters I feel like I truly understood were Hikari, Chiasaki, and Miuna. I felt like these three characters were truly fully developed. While Manaka can be considered the most important character in the show, the fact that she was missing for a considerable amount of time made her feel distant, even more so when she begins to profoundly discuss love in the last episode, which felt completely uncharacteristic of her. The remaining characters, Kaname, Sayu, and Tsumugu felt distant for the majority of the show; it almost felt as if they were contrived solely to advance Chisaki's character. Ultimately, a mix of developed and undeveloped characters crossed together as if they were all equally developed makes everything feel extremely complicated and messy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of complicated and messy, let's talk about the pacing. Before getting into details, Nagi no Asukara is divided into two major arcs. The second arc is a direct consequence to the events of the first arc, so as a result, they can't really be considered separate entities. But back to the topic at hand: pacing. The first half of Nagi no Asukara threw a myriad of themes at the audience including themes such as racism, the death of family, parent-child relationships, romantic freedom, and tradition. With so many different things going on, everything felt frantic. Yet even still, the underlying plot barely moved an inch in the first half until it reached its pinnacle, which was unsatisfactorily ushered by the fantasy of Shioshishio's mythology. As soon as the second half began, everything was reset. Essentially, all the themes from the first half instantly vanished and were replaced by new themes. Could Nagi no Asukara have been a 13 episode series? Probably not. But does it need 26? I'm sure it would have been fine in 24 or even something like 20 (I'm looking at you, NiseKoi), especially when the show essentially restarted. But that being said, I honestly can't complain about the second half of the series. After being completely engrossed in the setting of Nagi no Asukara in the first half, the pacing really began to feel natural during the second.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works does a fantastic job with animation as always, and this is certainly highlighted by the gorgeous underwater landscapes present in the show. Of course, the animation still falls short when animating crowds, and you still have a fair share of CG usage due to the vast amounts of water present in the show. Overall, there's not much to comment on this subject. Expect fresh art and animation when watching this show due to its setting, but keep in mind that like all anime, Nagi no Asukara is still prone to CG, still frames, slide shows, and the works. It's not ufotable, so don't expect movie quality, and it's not Shaft, so don't expect any interesting artistic choices, but it's still P.A. Works, so expect it to be good. \\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of P.A. Works, the music and sound in Nagi no Asukara is definitely up a notch from their usual work. Putting popular voice actors aside, the soundtrack is where the sound department really shines in Nagi no Asukara. While there might not be anything iconic or inspiring in its music, the eerie yet serene tracks really make you feel like you're listening to the music of the sea. Of course, the tone of the music shifts to its opening and ending songs as well. For example, I found that the intro to the first ending song really captured the eeriness from the soundtrack, and fit the show's drama perfectly, bringing a fantastic mix of curiosity, mystery, and sadness. And of course, how could I forget Miuna's piercing yet poetic voice in the second opening song? Such a poetic start is greatly complimented by the second ending's upbeat intro, which gives the audience a sense of apprehension and urgency. Overall, the music fits Nagi no Asukara beautifully; unfortunately, the soundtrack just isn't memorable enough despite being so fitting. That doesn't make it bad, it's just a little disappointing to think that I won't remember anything about the original soundtrack a few months or years from now.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could tell you more about Nagi no Asukara's themes, and dig deeper into its plot, but I feel like I have already articulated the vast majority of my opinions, so any more would be unnecessary. A more in-depth analysis on Nagi no Asukara's definition of love or Akira's arc on star-crossed lovers might have been great points to cover, but I leave them to discuss another day.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch Nagi no Asukara? If you like romance and drama, it's certainly a great addition to the genre. Personally, I grew very frustrated with the characters and themes as the show progressed, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good experience. Besides, you might have a different opinion about it, so give it a try, and remember, everyone deserves a chance at love.",

            "content": "The ocean is a mass and mysterious place. It seems to be endless and stretches beyond our imaginations with its vast amount of creatures that lives within. If I was to live in the ocean, the possibilities would be endless to how my life would change. But in the world of Nagi no Asukara, living in the waters is not an uncommon sight to see. No, in fact it\u2019s a way of life for sea people like Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido. Nagi No Asukara chronicles the lives of a group of young people as they go through stages of childhood, adolescence, and maturity thatdivides the race of human and amphibian. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is not based on any previously existing works but rather stands alone as an original story produced by P.A. Works. It\u2019s the first series since Hanasaku Iroha that is produced by P.A Works that presents itself as a 2 cour show. But more importantly are the themes explored. While the show is colored as fantasy, Nagi no Asukara surprisingly explores many factors that can be interpreted as human. This series explores various themes ranging from jealousy, regret, prejudice, alienation, bullying, and identity. It\u2019s a show not to be taken just as a love story but something like a treasure box because you\u2019ll someday come back and relive its precious moments.\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara\u2019s setting blends in two major contrasting style of societies. On one side is the people of the land who are just like you and me. On the other side are individuals that originated from sea. The people from the sea are curious about the surface world so they decide to venture from the deep and explore land. There\u2019s an interesting insight based on this premise as there are various and controversial ideas poured in that divides the two societies. For instance, there are certain rules involving relationships between a sea dweller and a human living on land. This is presented early on in the series when a case involves such an incident. It sets forth a theme of prejudice and racism with debates between various characters. While it seems unfair, there are justifiable reasons to back up some of these themes such as involving the population of the human species. On another note, people on the surface world often associates themselves of being normal while identifying the sea dwellers as being inhuman. There\u2019s a case of identity issue at crisis with even some of the sea dwellers themselves wondering where they belong in the world they live in. What Nagi no Asukara presents skillfully is the cultural clash between the people living on land and sea dwellers. Rather than some farcical soap drama with senseless dialogues, the show does well by showing rather than telling with its actions. The beginning of the school with our main characters sets a primary example of what\u2019s to be expected with this cultural difference. It\u2019s what Nagi no Asukara does at its best that divides its societies that draws the audience in beyond just a love story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no story can be complete without its characters. Nagi no Asukara\u2019s strong points involves its small yet complex characters. Not all of them are human but they often demonstrate explicit traits that can be found in humanity. Hikari stars as a main male protagonist whom may be initially seen as a brat. He is overprotective with the people he cares about but also gets into fights over his own problems. On the other hand is Manaka, a timid girl with a frail nature prone to crying. She is perhaps one of the more normal characters with her behavior and often not trying to cause people problems. Of course, she has problems of her own with insecurity about identity and sometimes even feels alienated from others. Other main characters also become involved in the story such as Tsumugu Kihara and Chisaki Hiradaira with their own interests. These interests settles itself with the romance and formulates angles of drama. Tear-jerking might not be the exact word to always describe these angles but it presents itself in a way that makes the audience want to know more and more about the characters with its dramatic storytelling. This is probably because some of these characters are relatable and have complex natures. \\n\\n\r\nTaking a retrospective point, we also get to witness growth as each of the characters climbs stairs to adolescence. Characters such as Miuna and Sayu grow up more than just their physical selves. They mature from kids into young women with their own feelings and ideologies. More importantly is how far they have grown from their previous kiddy stages. What makes Nagi no Asuakra stands out itself with these stages is the construction of its timeline. There\u2019s consistency although it lacks depth on some parts. Yet, the show also demonstrates how people can change with circumstances with characteristics learned from the characters whether it\u2019s through bullying, romantic relationships, or alienation. Responsibility also takes in as a factor to be considered especially with some of the older characters such as Hikari\u2019s brother, Akari. Surprisingly enough, some of the younger characters demonstrates more maturity than the adults in the show. It contrasts itself with them being one dimensional in this case with their unpredictable actions despite knowing some of the consequences. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as romance goes, the series can be or feel forceful at times with their exaggerated dialogues. Hikari can be seen as a male tsundere with the words that comes out of his mouth as well as his actions. Often or not, he says the opposite of his true intent and comes off as a rather blunt individual. On the other hand is Tsumugu with his easy-going nature. He\u2019s more of the guy like a textbook with ambiguous words and difficult person to read on the surface. Nonetheless, he gets involved with the complexity of Nagi no Asukara\u2019s love polygons. Because let\u2019s face it here, this show focuses on romance as a main structure of story presentation with angles developing from various stages with even fantasy elements added to the mix. However, this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise as the world this show takes place in is decorated with fantasy elements. The waters is just one element of conventional presentation that allows this show to become what it is rather than what is trying to be. On the other hand is where we see how normal the surface people live that reflects on a society where we humans are used to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the melodramatic nature of this show, there is also room for comedy whether it involves our characters or the events that takes place. Kids in the beginning such as Sayu still says things that kids would say. It fits well with their initial role before growing up because it defines Nagi no Asukara as a series that matures itself. This later comes with regret from our younger characters that may earn sympathy from the audience. While not all expressive in nature, it demonstrates itself with characterization that focuses characters in more ways than just relationships. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself has some unexpected plot twists later on, the show still has some generic attributes that doesn\u2019t shine itself at times. Most of the characters have complex personalities but sometimes hard to appreciate with their actions. Manaka is one character I find difficult to get accustomed with her frail nature and constant prone to tears. The audience might also find this a hard to bear and takes patience to get used to. Hikari\u2019s outbursts sometimes also feels forceful and over exaggerated that serves as a primary example of being immature despite his intentions. And while the show\u2019s plot can be unpredictable at times, there are various foreshadowing hinted at throughout some episodes that makes the show seem lifeless. This pinpoints some future events that can come as unsurprising even if done in a way that seems dramatic. Yet still, Nagi no Asukara doesn\u2019t just focus on its fantasy-romance nature. It does more than that with its pyramid of character building on a foundation of its story.\\n\\n\r\nBy technical art standards, Nagi no Asukara can be described as a lavishly and luster anime that shines in this field. Thanks to P.A. Works, this show stands out more than just its images but with its setting that demonstrates credibility. The aquatic natures and backgrounds presents itself fair with consistency such as the fishes and sea. Not only has that but the characters themselves also showed evidence of being sea dwellers. These include but not limited to the characters\u2019 azure-green glowing eyes or their bluish hair. They don\u2019t look like merman or mermaids but rather as people not too different than you and me.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also demonstrates progress. In the beginning, most of the music has a light tone with some dramatic moments. But later on, we hear more of an emotional tone with the events going on. The OST itself also becomes an embodiment that reflects as a clear view to present Nagi no Asukara\u2019s melodramatic style. Additionally, the OP and ED songs presents montages of characters and how they have changed over the time. Most of the voice acting of the characters fits well thanks to their talents. In particular, Hikari and Tsumugu\u2019s voice becomes a symbol of opposites with their clashing personalities. Manaka\u2019s voice also is easily recognizable thanks to the talents of Kana Hanazawa whom is well known for portraying cute characters.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend giving this show a try at the very least besides just from reading the synopsis. While it seems generic at all once with its characters, the show moves itself with characterization and plot that demonstrates maturity. It also focuses on a variety of themes that is credible and relates to humanity despite having fantasy elements. More so however is the way the characters interacts and the circumstances they undertake to become who they are. While the show focuses on romance as a central element, there is also themes of responsibility and cultural clashes that becomes insightful to get accustomed to. Not everything is fair after all in a world with drastically different cultures. In the world of Nagi no Asukara, that\u2019s an understatement and you\u2019ll find out exactly why. \\n",

            "content": "If I had to define \"beautiful\" with an anime, I would have to say Nagi no Asukara.\r\nThe anime industry often has a tough time dealing with the idea of love. Very few have ever portrayed it correctly, and even then it's difficult to move us. They either fall flat because of pacing issues or the plot fails to convey a character's motivation causing climactic moments seem melodramatic or forced. Nagi no Asukara doesn't face these issues. In fact, the show has been one of the most well-paced anime I have ever seen in terms of character and plot development. I will get to that soonenough, but first I would like to start with the art.\\n\\n\r\nYou may know them best for animating Angel Beats!, Another, Tari Tari, and Hanasaku Iroha. Yes, it's P.A Works and they have done it again, creating wonderful background arts and stunning imagery as well as good, consistent animation. None of that going-to-shit in some episodes to save budget to make one or two episodes look fantastic. I don't know how many times I had to pause to take a screenshot to store in my wallpaper folder. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of time is evidently dedicated to creating the world of Nagi no Asukara, and rightfully so. Story is heavily focused around their lives on Shioshishio and Oshiooshi. The sea's art alludes to the beauty of our own world but retains its mysteriousness. The ocean's depths isn't something people see every day and yet the studio is able to capture its beauty with little details like the schools of fish, coral reefs, and among other details that I won\u2019t spoonfeed. The art manages to enrapture us by showing what the sea looks like, and it is only made more stunning by the inhabitants of Shioshishio going about their daily lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound to me was something to admire. The OPs and EDs were composed so well, and even the lyrics fit well into the story. The sound department did a stunning job, it\u2019s not often you find a studio adhere to the laws of physics when creating sounds for the background. By this I mean the claps of thunder, thrashing of water, birds, fish, the bloops you hear from fish, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nI love good character development and I love good characters. It is incredible to see how much Hikari changes throughout the show. If you were to watch the first episode, and skip a few, you will notice that Hikari isn\u2019t the same. Everything that happens in the plot serves to progress his development, and this was done extraordinarily well. While development is good, no development is also good when portrayed correctly. Take Chisaki for example, her development remains static, but it does something for the plot. It drives Kaname to act the way he does after the time skip and when juxtaposed to her peers accentuates the change that the group of friends go through. Furthermore, many, but not all of the supporting characters play their role into the story. Not everything is great though. I take issue with certain character interaction in the show. One blaring issue is the friendship between Kaname and Hikari. Their interactions with each other are so bland that it almost seems like they\u2019re hardly childhood friends at all. It is known that tension exists between the two regarding Chisaki, but it isn\u2019t conveyed enough in the dialogue between the two boys. Sure there was the time at the Shioshishio\u2019s school, but having a climactic moment to portray that tension without proper character interactions prior to the incident is simply melodramatic. This just undermines the whole issue they have with each other and depreciates its attempt to move the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe web of love may seem overwhelming at first, but when you stop, start at one character and ask yourself \u201cwho does this character like?\u201d you will realize it is much simpler than you think.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. This is a story about a young group of friends dealing with the concept of change, both themselves and the world around them.  However, the plot is a lot more intricate. Four childhood friends from Shioshishio attend the surface school Mihama. Their coming of age becomes the catalyst that motivates the Sea God (Notice how Uroko-sama acts as the herald for some radical shift when he sniffs out Manaka and Miuna.) Along the way, tensions between the inhabitants of Oshiooshi and Shioshishio continue to grow and culminate into that dramatic shift.  What I think the writers did best is how they well they incorporated the issue of change and love as a theme into the plot. I will explain; BEWARE, BEYOND THIS SENTENCE IS SPOILERS AND THEME ANALYSIS TERRITORY. \\n\\n\r\nTheme of Love\\n\r\nOne would imagine that after the main group deals with the idea of love after 26 episodes, at least one relationship would have formed. That isn\u2019t the case, but that is the beauty of it. They are young and na\u00efve, and they deal with love as young and na\u00efve children do. Notice how by the end of the story the only ones to truly form a relationship is Akari and Itaru. This is because they are mature enough to understand love. (If you really want to use Egawa Takashi as a point to refute this theme go right ahead, but I disregarded him because he served very little importance to the main cast as opposed to Akari and Itaru).\\n\\n\r\nTheme of Change\\n\r\nWhen Hikari wakes up after the time skip, he mentions to Chisaki that she hasn\u2019t changed. He speaks in terms of maturity. Yet Chisaki feels she has changed. She speaks in terms of age. Two forms of changes are at play in this story, Age as a form of change, and Maturity as a form of change. Chisaki may have changed in regards to age, but she has not matured at all. This is evident when Chisaki pushed Tsumugu, it is very much like when Manaka pushed Hikari. Hikari on the other hand, while he hasn\u2019t aged at all, he has matured very much. The character development for Hikari is so top notch such that no three episodes is he static. He is a very dynamic character that grows after facing a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Nagi no Asukara is anime with a great plot-driven and character-driven premise. The art and sound is breathtaking and something to be admired. I am glad this nice little story was able to grace the face of the anime industry in such an ecchi-harem-romcom dominated age.\\n",

            "content": "Since there are only good reviews about this anime, I thought it only fair to add in one that focused on the bad aspects of it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion and that everyone is entitled to their own. \r\nLet me start off with what I liked about the anime. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe art style was one that I'd never seen before, therefore it was very refreshing and overall very pleasing. Since turquoise blue is my favourite colour, the art was really a gold mine for me, seeing as all of the characters who come from the sea have turquoise coloured eyes.Overall I thought the art was beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWow! In terms of music and sound, this anime would be up there with my top 10. All of the openings and endings gave me chills, and I actually have them in my iTunes playlists. Both Ray and Yanagi Nagi have incredibly beautiful voices, and to be honest I thought they were the same person at first. They sound very similar, however they each have their own style of singing which adds a beautiful aspect to the music. I don't have much to say about the inserted music because I actually don't remember much of it, but I'm sure it was appropriate for whichever scene it was used it. Overall the music was stunning and used very well throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nOkay. Now that I've gotten what I like out of the way, let's get to the biggest issues that I have with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nI would give this a higher rating, as I actually liked most of the characters in the anime. The two characters that broke this anime for me were Manaka and Miuna. I actually quite like Miuna's personality, so I'll get to why I don't like her later. Let's focus on Manaka. God, I hated her. I still hate her. I hate Manaka with a burning passion and it will never go away. One reason is because of the voice acting. Manaka is played by Hanazawa Kana, who is a respectively known voice actress. She has a childish but very cute voice, but she was wrong for Manaka. I feel like Hanazawa-san is repeatedly getting thrown into the crybaby role, which I hate. The only character that I really thought Hanazawa-san played exceptionally well was Kuroi Mato from Black Rock Shooter (the OVA, mind you). Now let's move on to Manaka's character. She acts like she's 5 or 6 years old, constantly crying and making other people worry about her. She is incredibly naive, such to the point where she can't face the truth when it's right in front of her, and doesn't pay attention to the way anybody else is feeling around her. She runs away from everything, including Hikari's love for her (which isn't really a spoiler since it is known that Hikari likes her from episode 1). One could argue that she's very noble, since she does a certain something halfway through the series (I will not give up spoilers), however I found that she had no basis or motivation for doing what she did. It's like the writers just wanted to paint her as a good person so they made her do what she did. She confused me for a long time into the series, making me believe that she liked someone when she actually didn't. Sigh. Overall, I hate Manaka. \\n\\n\r\nOkay. I am done ranting about Manaka. Time to look at the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked Chisaki. Chisaki, unlike Manaka, had a very in-depth character, and actually took the time to think through her actions and decide why she wanted to do something. She is a very mature, independent person, and I really like that about her. It's really hard to analyse Chisaki's character further without adding spoilers, so I will just say that Chisaki is a very likable character. \\n\\n\r\nI also really liked Hikari and Sayu. Hikari was one of the boys with a short temper, making him angry at almost anything. However he got angry with good reason. He would usually get angry trying to protect Manaka and his friends, or he would get angry because he was jealous of Tsumugu, whom he thought Manaka liked. I liked Hikari's playful and caring side, however, and that he would honestly admit a mistake when he made one. Throughout the episodes you watch his character changing, so that he becomes a more flexible and less angry guy. I don't understand what he sees in Manaka, but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\n I also liked Sayu. Sayu looks like a typical tsundere on the surface, however she really cares about her friend Miuna and about the boy she loves. She felt tortured because she started liking him when she was in elementary school, and worked hard during middle school to get him to notice her. I really liked Sayu's voice and I hope that the voice actress, Ishihara Kaori, get's more opportunities to star in more anime. Overall, Hikari and Sayu are very likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime's characters all have the opportunity to be likable, depending on what kind of person YOU as the viewer like. As I have said many a time before, I hated Manaka's character. But I liked everyone else. Overall, the characters were pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nI usually love the kind of drama found in this anime. Friends that are dealing with unrequited love within themselves is a genre that I wouldn't give up any day. However the fantasy part of the story was really bad. Let me start by saying that this is one of those stories that makes you think it's about one person the entire way through, and then at the very end it pulls the rug out from under you and says, \"Whoops, it's actually not about the main character.\" This is the main reason why I don't like Miuna. Miuna, from what I understood, was supposed to be a side character. A character that sort of mattered to the plot, but not really. Then I find out at the end that she is essential to the plot, and suddenly she becomes a main character. Think about it like this: if you were reading Harry Potter, and the main character is Harry Potter, wouldn't you be ticked off if, at the last page of the last book, it became about that kid that Harry said \"Hi\" to one time in the second book? Of course I'm exaggerating a bit but that's what it feels like to me. I was extremely thrown off when I found out that Miuna was the main character all-of-a-sudden, and I honestly hate stories like that. The fantasy part of the story, while it did it's best to be explained, didn't really make me believe it. It seemed very shallow, and there were a lot of mysteries that weren't explained, which makes me angry. The ending of the story felt very rushed and hurried, and suddenly there were these new things that had to be smushed into the last few episodes. I was also astonished by how foolish the sea god acted at the end of the series. I was honestly sitting there, at my computer, thinking to myself, \"How could you be so stupid?!\" But I digress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime didn't strike me as anything worth watching, although I am glad to have watched it so that I know exactly what I hate now. I'm also glad that I got to listen to the music as that, as well as the art, was probably the only thing that kept me going. Please remember that this is only my opinion, and that I am not trying to convince you to share it, but rather tell you of the things that I noticed while I was watching it. Anyway, happy anime watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Prepare to dive into an ocean of emotions and a whirlpool of feels with Nagi no Asukara (A Lull in the Sea). This anime is truly a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough in the world of shows out there. I must confess that this show completely bypassed me when it aired back in Fall 2013, and I only recently picked it up during late November 2016, more than three years later. Boy am I glad I found it! I went into the series blindly, and ended it feeling absolutely satisfied, warm all over, and just generally in a state of emptiness when Idon't know what to do after the perfection that was this anime. Looking back, I could only wonder why this series seemed to go terribly underrated and not mentioned a whole lot in the community. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I admit that I probably haven't watched too many anime yet to truly justify my rating, as I will most likely continue to watch more shows into the future, I can safely say that among those that I have already watched, Nagi no Asukara is the only anime I can give my rare, proud 10 to.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into my long, deep opinion, let's take a look at the components of the show first and how I feel about each of them:\\n\\n\r\nPremise:\\n\\n\r\nNagi-Asu promotes itself as a drama, fantasy, and romance according to MAL, and I think it delivers in all of these perfectly, especially the first one. Truthfully, the synopsis didn't really give me a clear idea of what to expect from the show; it was as ambiguous as a road map you could get. I thought it would be a slice-of-life in a manner similar to Kokoro Connect, and while the first half of the series definitely felt like it at times, the second half all but abandoned the general cheerfulness of a SOL.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nPlot and Setting:\\n\\n\r\nUnder the sea and in a town beside the sea. We've seen this many times in both anime and other media before, but Nagi-Asu goes beyond and adds racial traits, prejudices and misunderstandings to the people who live underwater and the land-dwellers, almost making it seem like the equivalent of color, wealth, or beliefs in the real world. And boy, does Nagi-Asu deal with the topic of discrimination beautifully . . . Moving on, the plot is nothing too special but the execution was godlike, and safe to say there were a lot of twists along the way, with the most heart-wrenching ones truly unexpected.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nCharacter and Story Development:\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is a masterpiece, and even then that stills sounds like an understatement. One of the male MC's was the most unlikable piece of shite at the beginning, but he did a full 180 throughout the series, until it came to a point that one of the things that kept me going through the 2nd half's more emotional arc was seeing his progress as a person into something truly unforgettable. And it's not just him, everyone else in the ensemble cast had developments worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also had a very reasonable pacing, with no unreasonable or unwarranted slow-downs or rushes. As I already mentioned, the first half feels a lot like a SOL, but after the first half ended it slowed down a lot, but in exchange we get even more of the character development that I've praised so highly (although the first half definitely had great character developments as well).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. As much as I'm a fan of Nagi-Asu, I can't help but be disappointed with the way the show ended. Yes, everything was resolved and all the ships sailed, but I feel like a lot more could have been done it if just wasn't rushed as hell. All that wonderful buildup for those last underwhelming 5-7 minutes ..\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nAnimation and Art:\\n\\n\r\nNow, let me just say one thing:\\n\\n\r\nThat animation was legit, bro!\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Nagi-Asu and are browsing the internet for recommendations about it, then 9 times out of 10 this is the aspect of the anime that most people loved. PA Works, the studio behind Nagi-Asu (which is an anime original by the way), has always been known to deliver and exceed expectations in the visual department, and this series is no exception. Seriously, just pause whenever you encounter a background or basically any scene with few to no characters on it, and observe every little detail drawn in glorious, movie-level quality. In particular, the various underwater effects are simply spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really beautiful as well and definitely works in favor of the show.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nAny anime with Kana Hanazawa as a seiyuu is already a winner for me . .\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, the soundtrack is yet another masterpiece element of the show. There are a lot of great tracks, with its fair share of upbeat and happy and sad and emotional. The right tracks play at the right moments, and a lot of times I was just held into a 'wow'.\\n\\n\r\nHere is probably one of the most uplifting tracks I've heard in all of anime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBpHEnSIIU8\\n\\n\r\nAnd an accompanying emotional track, which has feels written all over it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNFA7unbg0\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's do well to accompany the series' soundtrack. Ebb and Flow (OP 2) is still among my favorite anime songs. The ED's also have great usage in the ending of some episodes as well - the one that comes most to mind is Episode 23.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nProduction and replay value:\\n\\n\r\nConsistency is the name of the game for Nagi-Asu, as its wonderful animation never falters even late unto the series. There is little to no drop in soundtrack quality and usage as well. Sasuga, P.A. Works\\n\\n\r\nReplay value is at an all-time high here. Rewatch it whenever you've lost hope in humanity but still want to believe there is a chance, whenever you want to feel warm all over .. no. Just rewatch it whenever you have the time to fully commit to it, as this is when Nagi-Asu will reward you the most. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nSummary of Nagi-Asu's elements:\\n\\n\r\nThe best: Animation and art, soundtrack, production and replay value, character development\\n\r\nThe good: Story development, premise, plot and setting\\n\r\nThe bad: the ending\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nPersonal opinion:\\n\\n\r\nI've already gushed about all the things about this anime that made me love it above, so I'm just gonna keep this short. Nagi no Asukara is an anime you MUST watch before you die. It definitely and safely belongs in a top 50 anime of all-time list, although I would boldly argue it has the repertoire to belong in even a top 20 list. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime takes its rightful place among the likes of Toradora and Clannad as some of the best romance and drama anime has to offer. Although I admit, the starting episodes might not really hook you in, as this anime only really starts to get going by around the ninth episode. It definitely has the pacing of a 26-ep show and I'm so glad P.A. works made this rare decision instead of going for their usual 12-13 ep shows. Twice the amount of episodes really helped this show flesh out the world, characters and the story it wanted to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had me not watching anything else for about a week after I finished it - it was that good for me. It made me question important things in life such as family and love. This anime is that kind - that is, if it hits you in all the right places, it is a show capable of changing your very life.\\n\\n\r\nAn ocean of emotions is waiting for you in Nagi no Asukara!\\n",

            "content": "Out of the hundreds of anime I've watched there are very few that deserve a 10 and Nagi no Asukara is definitely one of them. The show is a combination of fantasy, romance and slice of life and is one of the very few successful mix-ups. I hardly watch any anime more than once, some good shows maybe twice, this is the only show that I think I've watched at least 4 times and enjoyed each time.\r\nThe background of the story is a fantasy world with two types of people - the people who live in the sea and the people who live on land.The people from the sea have a shell called \"ena\", which allows them to breath underwater. They live in a small completely submerged town called \"Shishishio\" a little off the coast. The people who live on land (those without ena) in this story are mainly the residents of a small fishing village called \"Oshioshi\" right on the coastline. Due to the declining birth rates in the underwater village the local middle school closes and the students are transferred to a school on land. The show focuses on a quadrio of middle-schoolers from the sea who were childhood friends since kindergarten and the people from land around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show can be actually described as two sagas more or less equal in length. The first half is a slice of life, presenting the prejudice and hostility between the two people, maybe even the politics behind them, as well as some stories of forbidden love (literally forbidden) between people from sea and people from land. Overall the first part is OK but not incredible so don't lose hope if the first episodes don't seem that good.\\n\r\nAround halfway the story takes a dramatic turn and at some point fast forwards a few years. Certain events affect people from both sea and land, certain people change and others don't. New romances develop and people are deeply affected as they change, as their friends change and as the environment and the relations between sea and land change. I think my description may be a little boring, unfortunately I couldn't find a way of conveying the main plot of the second part without major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest distinction of this show is character development. There is a lot of character development, not only restricted to the main characters. Actually even the identity of the main characters changes a little over time. There is some love cliche but if you think you can guess how the love stories will develop right from the first two episodes expect huge twists.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Amazing. The art of the sea including the undersea village is incredibly detailed. There are a few quirks here and there (how can you pour someone a cup of sake when everything including the drink are underwater?) but but overall nearly perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Nearly perfect, this is a must watch.",

Although the ending isn't what I was expecting and even got confused at some parts I'd still watch it again..\r\nStory 10/10: I thoroughly enjoyed the story from beginning to the end with 4 main characters joining a new school where they're basically outcasts to a certain range.. They make friends and even enemies and it all turns out forthe best. There are a few problems I'd like to clear up and the main one is.. The 'love' in this series was terrible... They made to many people lovey dovey, I swear it was always \"This character is going to love this character BUT this character is going to love this other character\" and I kind of got sick and tired of it until the end where it kind of got straightened out abit. (Still really pissed there was no kiss scene or anything romantic at all... >.>) The story was well laid out and gave me a new kind of anime to watch that I've never seen before and I really enjoyed it\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I don't think I've ever seen an anime so sparkly and shiny all the time.. I'm not that big on the art style of anime consider I only watch one 'type' of anime and it's these kinds but the art for this looked really good!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I'm not that big on sound so I don't really have anything to comment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Even though most of the characters would fall for someone who didn't like them in that way and it really annoyed me.. I like how the characters progressed from these children and became more responsible that petty rivalry between sea people and surfacers. I didn't really enjoy the love square they had going with Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki and Tsumugu. If Tsumugu and Manaka would of ended up together I would of been disappointed in the whole thing.. Even though I kinda do ship Hikari and Chisaki, I still would rather Hikari and Manaka together! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Really enjoyed the watch and would recommended it to anyone looking for a slow paced love square which will infuriate you at some times aswell...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Do not go into this looking for alot of romantic parts like other animes like Maid Sama and other types like those. I kinda think this anime was targeted for a younger audience range now (Oh well!)...",

Nagi No Asukara has a lot more than that to offer you.\r\n~STORY~ 8/10\r\nIn this anime it is shown that human beings originally came from the sea. Some people craved to see the world beyond the ocean. So they left the sea and started living permanently on theland. Soon they were divided into two groups. The sea people from Shioshishio and the land people from Oshioshi. 14 years old Hikari Sakishima, Manaka Mukaido, Chisaki Hiradaira and Isaki Kaname; a group of four childhood friends are forced to go to Mihama Junior High School on the land as their Nami Junior High School of underwater village closed down and that\u2019s when they discovered a whole new world, learnt about their newfound feelings, the conflicted relationships of land people and sea people, the mystery of the sea god and many more. \\n\\n\r\n~ANIMATION~ 10/10\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the remarkable animation of this anime must be discussed about. This is one of the best part of this anime. The underwater village looks simply stunning and breathtaking. You can see water in any anime. But since water is a major part of Nagi-Asu it is animated with great care and details. You will feel like you\u2019re the one who is diving under the ocean and watching the underwater creatures. Of course the lands, snow and other things also look splendid. Every scenario looks amazing. As for the characters it goes all out with the big, round, sparkly eyes. People from the sea have gleaming azure eyes which looks very pretty. Whether you like this type of character design or not is completely your choice. But at least in my opinion this is what makes them look attractive and charming. You could stare at the characters and the scenes forever. The animation is that much appealing and eye-soothing.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe sounds and music are mellifluous. They did a great job for the OST. Voice acting of the characters is done perfectly. It completely suits with each and every character\u2019s personality and characteristics. Opening and ending songs are both good. Both of the openings are suitable for the two parts of the story. Originally Aketagawa Jin was in charge of the soundtracks. But he left and was replaced by a talented composer Dewa Yoshiaki. So you know what you can expect from him. But you may not notice how amazing the background musics are when you\u2019re hooked up to watching it. So make sure to check the OSTs in youtube.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ 9/10\\n\r\nAll the characters of this series are like the life of this anime. Each and every character has his /her own important role. Without any of them the anime would be incomplete. You can say every character is the protagonist here. No matter how much you like particularly one of them, you will still feel bad for the others. They are just that lovable. You might think it\u2019s only about those four kids. But it has more characters like Tsumugu, Sayu and Miuna who are the essential part of the story. Also the characters are not always kiddy. It\u2019s actually a coming-of-age anime. And if you ever get bored with all the serious things going on, the cute Akira will be there to make you laugh!\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~ 10/10\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get back to the story. What makes Nagi-Asu so special? At the first half of the series this is what will come to your mind. It seems like a normal story at the beginning. But if you can wait patiently and finish the first arc you will see what an unexpected turn it takes. Nagi-Asu gets even better at the second half of the series. Just when you think of something as a fact, it will make sure to surprise you and prove you wrong. You can never guess what is going to happen until you watch it through the very end. Whether it\u2019s about which character will end up with whom or it\u2019s about something else. Nagi-Asu develops centering two things. One of them is love. Yes, it is all about love. This anime has one hell of a love triangle! Or should I say a love heptagon?! But please don\u2019t be discouraged just by hearing it. Relax! Because this is not your regular, cheesy romance anime. It shows the feelings we go through while stepping into adulthood from childhood in a realistic way. Growing up little by little every day and seeing the change in our beloved ones. The other important thing of the story is the fantasy part. It doesn\u2019t end playing its role with making people live in the water. The sea has its own tale. The story of the sea god will make you feel like you are listening to folklore or a legend.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy, slice of life and romance; these 3 genres merge in impeccably and make this series splendid. All of these create a big plot twist that will hook you up. It will make you wonder how will be the ending of such complicated story. Luckily it still manages to give you a perfect ending you can think of. I assure you there will be a big smile of satisfaction and enjoyment in your face in the end and a little sadness in your mind that it ended!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Nagi No Asukara is an amazing anime. I don\u2019t really know why it didn\u2019t gain much popularity or why less people have heard about it. If you like romance or fantasy then it\u2019s a must watching anime for you. Lastly I will say \u201cdon\u2019t judge an anime by its\u2019 poster\u201d!  Though I must say it\u2019s not your cup of tea if you\u2019re not a fan of the romance genre and too picky about anime.\\n",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is a story about two races of humans. One of them lives on Earth the second in the sea. I've got to say, the setting is actually a great one and can give birth to a good story but it failed to do so.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs stated before, the setting is original. The plot line however fails to bring forth anything. To put it in simple terms, it was crap from start to end. Basically, we follow a few youngsters and their romance. There is no goal whatsoever and the romance isn't even properly developped. They completely scrapped the idea within the settingby failing to talk about it or exploit it. Sure, it is present over the whole series but except them being from the sea and the transition in between arcs, there isn't any manifestation of it. We have something awful that happens on a global scale but in a few years, the people haven't even acted when their life was endangered. Instead we have a resolution full of bullshit which smells as bad as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/8\\n\r\nThe art was great. Unfortunately for Nagi no Asukara it isn't what makes an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/8\\n\r\nOST wasn't that great. Didn't like either OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nJust how the hell can every single character fall in love with no character developpement whatsoever for more than half of them. I can't comprehend it. Also, I hate how everything went in between the characters. The interactions in between them were just bad and sometimes embrassing. Unjustified hate in between people of the Earth and the Sea. They do the same things, have the same decorations and some people of the Sea even end up leaving it for the Earth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI could not comprehend such a high rating with the first few episodes. I had to watch the first episode three times before forcing myself to get into the show. I was expecting things to go smoother in the rest of the show because of its rating but it clearly didn't. It even got worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6/10\\n\r\nThis show was boatched. This series is an overflowng garbage dump. I usually hate to use 'overrated' but it can only be described as such. A last thing I want to add is that the script wasn't well-written, it was written to please a large audience. I find it very stupid how naive people can be.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara Review:\r\nAre ya ready kids? I can\u2019t hear youuu!!! OHHHH!!! Who lives in a village under the sea? Hikari Sakishima! Ill-tempered, in love, tsundere is he! Hikari Sakishima!\r\nJoking aside, my first impression of this show was that it was going to be just another slice of life anime, this time set in Bikini Bottom rather than in your average high school\u2026 Oh how wrong I was. Nagi no Asukara turned out to be sooo much more, and is not only currently my personal favorite show of 2014 so far, but also a future classic if enough people are smart enough to decide towatch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8.2:\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara follows four friends who are in essence \u201csea people\u201d who can breath underwater. These four middle school friends have to go to school on land after their school closes. This show really gives the impression that it will be another carefree slice of life school anime at first, but slowly builds up the drama until the drama levels are set over 9000. Yes the show goes into detail about what it\u2019s like living underwater and how the underwater students are treated in the transitional phase by the land people, but the main focus of the show is the relationships between the characters. This show has one majorly complicated love triangle, er\u2026 pentagon\u2026 octogon? whatever, it\u2019s a shape with a lot of sides. Now personally I usually don\u2019t like when shows make it unclear who will end up with who, but Nagi no Asukara really just perfectly nailed this aspect of the show. More detail as to why it was so successful will be discussed later in the character section, but just know that it is done wonderfully. To go along with the personal issues each of the characters are dealing with, there is an impending larger issue that I will avoid going into due to spoilers, but is also very intriguing. This issue is made so interesting because of the fantasy setting that the world is set in, and the lore behind it all is truly fascinating. As for negatives, there are some things that get left unanswered, as well as a few poorly explained plot devices. Some of the plot devices or decisions made by the characters may frustrate the viewer as well depending on his or her preferences. However, these issues are few and far between for the most part. Nagi no Asukara\u2019s story has its share of humor, but also moments that could easily cause someone to shed tears. The drama created by the situations the characters are put in, the problems that the world is having, and the love-triangle always keep you interested in what is truly an incredible story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9.1:\\n\r\nP.A. Works has just been on fire lately with their production. Once an anime is revealed to be produced by P.A. Works, just assume that it will be absolute scenery porn. Other shows by P.A. Works include Angel Beats, Another, and Hanasaku Iroha for reference on how good this show looks. The fantastical setting is gorgeously realized both under the sea, and above ground. The animations (particularly under water) are just beautiful and incredibly fluid. It is a wonder how P.A. Works manages to make a profit with the seemingly limitless budget they throw into everything they do. There really is not much to say on the negative side for the art department for this show, so it\u2019s about time to move on.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.4:\\n\r\nMuch like the art, Nagi no Asukara\u2019s OST is just plain beautiful. The music really perfectly matches the setting, and appropriate songs play for appropriate moods. The OST sets the tone and setting wonderfully. There aren\u2019t necessarily any songs I would download onto my phone to listen to on a regular basis (besides the OPs and EDs which are great as well), but everything sounded perfect as the show was happening. The voice acting was also wonderful with varied emotions on display from each of the characters in a large cast of family members and friends of the main 4 characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.7:\\n\r\nThis is the department that separates Nagi no Asukara from the vast majority of anime shows out there. The overall cast of characters is one of the strongest overall that I have seen in anime. While the cast lacks one stand out character like a Lelouch, a Light, or a Saber, each character is incredibly human (which many anime can\u2019t say). Obviously all of the main characters are extremely relatable and 3 dimensional (although Manaka can leave a bit to be desired in terms of development). The characters that we see a lot of screen time of like Hikari, Miuna, Chisaki, and Kaname really get a lot of development and grow vastly out of their initial archetypes. Even characters who don\u2019t seem to develop much are still multi-faceted and very likable (Manaka, Tsumugu, Uroko-sama). Side characters are also strong, displaying their own opinions, struggles, and personalities when the spotlight is on them, even if it\u2019s only for a minute or two. Although there was a massive love web going on throughout the show (which I usually don\u2019t like), the characters made me interested in it and made it an enjoyable experience. Usually I come up with the pairs I want, and if they don\u2019t happen I feel disappointed. But with Nagi no Asukara, I didn\u2019t care who ended up with who, because I loved all the characters so much. I just wanted everyone to end up happy, because they all deserved to be happy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.8:\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is one of those anime that can make you laugh, cry, sit on the edge of your seat, pull your hair out in frustration, and do just about any other emotionally driven action. The beautiful world, and loveable characters alone could keep you anxiously waiting week to week for a new episode. Add in the wonderful story filled with drama, emotion, and excitement, and we have ourselves a show that earns extremely high marks in the enjoyment category. The show is one of those shows that you will want to rewatch immediately after finishing because you love it so much and just want to experience it all over again. This was THE show I waited for every week, dying of anticipation to see what would happen next. Think about the other wonderful shows that aired at the same time (Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Noragami, Nisekoi), and then you will realize just how enjoyable this show was for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.64:\\n\r\nWith an 8.64 overall score, Nagi no Asukara comes in at number 6 in my ever growing list of anime series. That should show you just how good this show is. Nagi no Asukara was a masterpiece not only from a production standpoint, but in its story and most importantly in its ridiculously strong characters. As far as drama, slice-of-life, fantasy, or romance anime go, this is among the elite and should be watched by all, and is an absolute must watch by fans of any of the genres listed above.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful slice of life story of friends in a beautiful world that is an absolute treasure to watch, will deserve consideration for anime of the year\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Eye-meltingly beautiful animation\\n\r\n+ Incredibly strong cast of characters\\n\r\n+ Intriguing world and lore\\n\r\n+ Drama is wonderful\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters can be annoying based on personal preferences\\n\r\n- Poorly marketed to the public\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Nagi no Asukara, watch...\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori - childhood friends, romance, fantasy, captivating world\\n\r\nAnohana the Flower We Saw That Day - childhood friends, romance, tear-jerking drama\\n\\n\r\n8.64/10 - Wonderful\\n\\n\r\n*For those of you disappointed in my 8.64 score and feel it deserves a 9 or a 10, please see my review scale and/or my google spreadsheet link of anime ratings on my profile and you will recognize just how insanely high this overall score is. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWell, for anyone who is a fan of the romantic drama genre, Nagi no Asukara (or \u201cA Lull in the Sea\u201d) is definitely a must watch. Personally though, I have never been a big fan of the genre for a wide variety of reasons, including its dependence on sappy melodrama, the abundance of clich\u00e9s, and a lack of general depth in the plotlines. However, after witnessing the massive influx of monumental praise for this series, I couldn't resist giving it a try. Quite frankly, it's not hard to see why this anime received such high praise; beautiful animation, memorable characters (sort of), aperfect soundtrack, and an immersive world that's impossible not to fall in love with. However, while NnA manages to break free of many of its genre's traditional flaws and stand out from the crowd, it seems to add a new flaw of its own for every flaw it eliminates. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In this universe, all humans were created by the \"Sea God\" and designed to live underwater. However, some humans who longed for the land abandoned the ocean, casted off the Sea God's gifts, and began a new life on the surface. Mankind was divided into sea dwellers and land dwellers, and it didn't take long for them develop a strong dislike for each other. The story follows four sea-dwelling teenagers who begin attending school on the surface, as their experiences with the land-dwellers create a youthful fantasy tale as the character's lives unfold for better or for worse in the bittersweet world that they live in.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just go ahead and say this right off the bat: NnA has one of the best settings and conceptual fantasy elements for a fictional world I've ever seen in an anime. Shioshishio, the underwater city, feels unbelievably alive, as does the surface world. It is truly special how immersive this setting really is, especially when you factor in the amazing and well-thought out mythos that the world is attached to regarding the Sea God and split between the ocean/land dwellers. That being said, I was dumbstruck when the show proceeded to glaze right over the world it had masterfully crafted as if it was nothing special. The plot of this show pays an insultingly miniscule amount of attention to its setting, which is by far the greatest part about the show. It's essentially skipped over in the beginning in favor of introducing the characters first and then only reappears in flashes and during major plot events; what this show instead opts to focus the majority of its time on is something that everyone and their mother has seen a million times over; Love polygons! While I have nothing against shows centered around romantic drama, I've already touched on some of the problems the genre always seems to fall into, and while NnA is a very good installment into the genre and does most aspects of the concept correctly, it is no major exception to copious melodrama and clich\u00e9s. It\u2019s just frustrating that there were so many great opportunities for potential main-plotlines here, like the hatred between the land dwellers and the sea dwellers (a symbol for racism?), yet they decided to go with something clich\u00e9. Overall, the plot is a pretty standard romantic drama with less focus on the exceptional setting and mythos than most people would want; a missed chance.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a show about romance, NnA is very character driven; it's these little guys that are going to either make or break the anime for you, and in my opinion, they make it. I think the best thing about NnA's characters is that the writers completely understand the role that each character should have and do a fantastic job of balancing the amount of screentime each of them get as well as fleshing out their emotions and motivations. A brilliant example of this is the character of Kaname, my personal favorite. He seems to be nothing more than a bystander character at first; he is given no discernible personality or emotions what so ever. However, when the show actually takes the time to give him a spot in limelight, you can see how much of a well-written and relatable character actually he is. The lack of attention that the show gave him compared to the other major characters in the beginning was purposeful; it served isolate him as \"the odd man out\", a feeling that we later see that Kaname was not oblivious to. This, my friends, is some very clever character writing. The rest of the characters, as I just mentioned, fill their respective roles more than adequately. Hikari is the protective friend with a short temper, Manaka is your typical ditzy girl character, and Chisaki is the shy, big-breasted girl, but they are more than just stereotypes; they all have depth to their personalities and they all receive character development, which is all you can really ask for. There is one character who really bothers me though, and that is Tsumugu. I don't understand why it is still considered acceptable to write characters like this\u2026 He has no personality what so ever, he never receives any development at any point, and he has only one expression: a blank stare. Could this guy be any more boring? And yet he is a huge part of the series of love-polygons that this show is centered around? Ridiculous. Overall though, this is a pretty well done cast of characters. I'd be shocked if you didn't find at least one that you get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that NnA has some truly beautiful animation; everything is colorful, bright, fluent, and alive. There aren't many scenes where the animation is fast paced, but when those scenes arrive, they also look fantastic. NnA is the definition of eye candy. The music is also well executed; a very calming selection of music for a very calming anime. It doesn't have the heart-wrenching emotional tracks of, say, a Clannad: After Story, but I don\u2019t think it needed to. I don't think I've ever seen a pair of OPs that perfectly represent the anime they are attached to, both animation-wise and sound-wise. I don't think they could have been done any better (same goes for the EDs, I suppose). The voice acting is pretty good as well, although there is a lot more SCREAMING then crying going on here\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of romantic dramas, you have no excuse for not watching NnA; you will absolutely love it. If you are not a fan of the genre, I still think it's worth a watch. The immersive world, excellent animation, and well-written characters make the experience worthwhile. The only people who I think should pass on this anime are those who can't stand shows about romance or shows with very little action.",

            "content": "STORY\r\nThe story may seem like a typical romance, with a sea people twist, but it's so much more. At first, it was focused on the children and their feelings for each other and the surface. But as the children realized they were apart of something much bigger, the series was about accepting change and how some people wish for it and some fear it. More importantly, I thought this series told a good mixture of fantasy romance quite well. I loved the characters and was interested in the story's lore. The themes of unrequited love, change, and acceptance, were mashed around well. But, there liesa weakness in this story. The pacing. While you don't really notice this until the last quarter, it's pace is a bit too slow. Instead of dragging things out, there should have used that time to some a bit more interactions between the characters. Since they didn't do this, relationships were given poor resolutions and the ending was somewhat of a mixed bag. But in the end, I still enjoyed the story Nagi no Asukara told.\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\n Most of the characters are nicely developed, with a great main cast and supporting cast. With each character having their own personal problems and flaws to deal with. My favorite character, has to be Chisaki. She arguably goes through the toughest times, and I can kind of relate to her fears. But, there's also a few characters I'm disappointed with. Manaka is probably the most controversial character in the show. Some people are annoyed by her, and some are cool with her. I'm with the latter, but I wasn't too pleased with her character in the second half. While she does develop I found her presence to be a plot device in the second half. I just feel what they did to her character was freeze her development, and in a show about change, that's a bad thing. Another thing I didn't like was that, in the end, the character relationships weren't tied up as I liked. This traces back to the pacing problem, and it's a shame. There was room for things to be tied up better, but overall, the characters are the best part of the show.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nAnimated by P.A Works, Nagi no Asukara is amazing to look at. From the stunning backgrounds, lighting, and the overall feel of the show. I have to say, it's probably P.A's best work. Rivaling their past show, Hanasaku. The animation is also pretty good for a romance, and that's because of the fantasy aspect of the show. The swimming looks really good, and while it's no where near Free!'s animation, it's fluid enough. The best aspect of the animation has to be the backgrounds. I felt that P.A Works know what a run down fishing town looks and feels like, and the show wouldn't be the same without these backgrounds. \\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe music of Nagi is very relaxing to listen to. Fitting of the theme of the show. A half of the ost was light summer like songs, but the latter half leaded on the cold and emotional parts. I really like this variety of songs, because it reflects the story. I find that the ost, to be a very nice listen for doing homework, or cleaning up your room. It's really nice to listen to. As for the openings and endings, I found every song to be nice. Like the ost they were nice, and I didn't really skip them. Okay, I admit, the second one is pretty amazing. It's a really good song with great build up, and emotional relevance to the plot. Overall, it's really nice, and I would give it a listen if you are doing your homework.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara may start out a bit bland, but it;s really a coming of age story about friction between two lands as well as relationships. I felt for the characters, because of how they changed and grew. And, I like how each character was characterized because of how it revolved around how everything has to change. Your home, family, friends, and most importantly, you as a person change. And that makes Nagi no Asukara worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Nagi no Asukara] for your reading pleasure.\r\nStory(9): Nagi no Asukara has a very interesting story that will convey both heart warming moments and heart breaking moments. Much of the story is strongly driven by romantic entanglements of the various characters present. In a world where there are two types of Humans in the form of land dwellers and sea dwellers, when 4 sea dwelling teenagers are forced to attend school alongside land dwellers; the internal struggles as well as the emotional impact of trying to adapt to the new situation, results in an interesting Slice of Life type of drama.The story itself revolves around the changing relationships between the 4 sea dwellers as well as their relationships with land dwellers and elders of the sea village they reside in. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10): The animation used in Nagi no Asukara is simply marvelous, quite outstanding even amongst strong contenders of 2014 animes. The art done for the underwater world of the Sea dwellers are beautifully rendered, making it effortless for the viewer to imagine oneself as being in the Sea village. This creates the feeling of being underwater in a world that is like our own yet different at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10): Nagi no Asukara has exceptionally well done sound effects, voice acting, as well as the music that is seamlessly integrated into the scenes with precision. The sound of an underwater world is most certainly unknown to most of us as we possess no natural capability to survive underwater for any extensive length of time; however if one could survive underwater, the sounds you might hear is quite possibly near identical to the sounds Nagi no Asukara delivers. In addition to the realistic sounds, the music utilized is quite emotion-provoking. During emotionally powerful moments in the anime, the music delivers a strong force unto the viewer that can definitely cause the activation of tear ducts without conscious control.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10): As such animes are mainly driven by the interactions and relationships between the various characters rather than flashy fights, the Characters of Nagi no Asukara most certainly fulfill its role in creating a high quality anime of great enjoyment potential. The changing world around them and the need to adapt to an unknown world from their own, results in changing relationships. When romance is added in to the emotional drama that is Nagi no Asukara, it becomes quite interesting to observe how everything will end. The concern, worry, and fear as well as confusion regarding their changing world view, is something that is channeled in a very human way; as these concerns are not only those of 14 year olds but also for adults, it is very easy to understand the mental processes of the characters in Nagi no Asukara.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): Nagi no Asukara was a very enjoyable anime. Though I personally prefer animes of the darker nature, Nagi no Asukara has enough twist and turns plus emotional dramatic moments to maintain my interest. It was very difficult to predict what will happen, who would end up with who, can the main character come to understand his confusions and overcome his fears, as well as what in blazes is happening to the world in Nagi no Asukara? Thus, even without flashy fights or the mysterious and psychological aspects of darker animes, I found Nagi no Asukara to be most enjoyable indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9): It is of my personal opinion that Nagi no Asukara possess a strong enough story with a very human element to it, which adds to the relatable drama and emotional moments, thus can be enjoyed by a large variety of Anime watchers. In addition, the amusement from observing a certain demon butler squirm with discomfort from watching Nagi no Asukara was most enjoyable and implies Nagi no Asukara is meant for those with a sense of humanity. As such, I would recommend Nagi no Asukara to those with a heart and suggest supernatural beings watch other Animes more to their liking, such as Another. \\n\\n\r\n[This review has been brought to you by the Funtom Company!

            "content": "This anime was rather dull and childish. \"Emotions\" and \"change\". This didn't really carry any message with it except the repetition of these two motives that aren't even deeply explored. Same shit you see everywhere except that here they actually even managed to contradict themselves a few times and have opinions that are logically wrong. Did they reach any conclusions on either of the subjects they tried to explore? Oh gosh they did, \"the world is filled with beautiful shining emotions that are passed down and surpass time\". A lot of attempts to be serious sound like a badly written essay of a 14 yearold who was desperate to get a passing grade in his literature class.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not realistic. Tsumugu wtf? He's a motherfucking lifeless robot who can see into other people's minds because they're shallow. He's supposed to be special because of that as no one else seems to possess that convenient ability called sapience.\\n\\n\r\nChisaki wtf? You didn't feel like you were allowed to love anyone else because you thought you should wait for Hikari and the rest to return? Wtf is wrong with you? Five fucking years have passed and there wasn't any development, she's thinking like a child, a very stupid child indeed. She wanted to be the fucking sacrifice because she's the \"only one who's changed\" and it wasn't fair to the others because she changed and they didn't. She felt like she betrayed them. She spent five fucking years without her friends and family, living with Tsumugu and his grandfather all while she couldn't even enter her hometown to see if everyone's okay. Hikari, Manaka and Kaname felt like a day passed by. I would feel anger in her stead, not fucking guilt. Anger because they don't know the pain and what it was like. It feels natural to embrace the change and even emphasize it, not act like a kid and pretend that five years didn't go by.\\n\\n\r\nKaname's one of the characters I simply didn't develop any feelings for. I feel like he didn't get enough screen time, but by what I've seen they probably didn't know what lines to give him.\\n\\n\r\nI did find Manaka a little annoying, but as I'm trying to be objective I won't count that in. Everything she's done until she went to hibernate hinted that she liked Tsumugu. The plot twist on that boat was poorly implemented and expected. Everyone knew that Hikari was going to get a reward for being a tryhard even though the plot didn't go in his favor. \\n\\n\r\nThe show didn't use its potential. When I saw it recommended from Shinsekai Yori, I had completely different expectations. I personally hoped that the plot would turn darker, not resolve around badly done romance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent, I didn't like the openings very much but they knew which scenes to emphasize and used the correct music while doing it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was incredible. It's truly beautifully done. I didn't watch it in HD, but it still felt amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was decent. I didn't hate the series, it was fun to watch, but I can't shake the feeling that I wasted my time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10",

            "content": "A lot of my friends were talking about Nagi no Asukara and at that time, I haven't started it. I wasn't very interested. But, as long time progress, I tried it. And I was mind blown. P.A Works have done a really, really great job by making this.\r\nStory : Well, you might considered the background story a bit strange when you first watched it and then you raised your eyebrows. I mean, underwater villagers? It's a bit strange right? But, I promise you, with that kind of background, you'll be super amazed as the story progressed. \r\nNagi no Asukara served you a really interesting dramaand romance story. In my experience, I thought I've figured out who ended up with who, but I was totally wrong. Because they gave you a twist that sometimes you can't expect. So, for me, the story was a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art was a complete beyond awesome. The beautiful backgrounds and scenery, the details, even the water details, it was really awesome and breathtaking. So, it's a 10/10 because of the amazing art and details.\\n\\n\r\nSound : The Opening and Endings are both lovely. Really soothing and relaxing. The voice actors themselves were awesome as well. The main male trio were voiced by new faces in the anime industry, such as Ishikawa Kaito, Hanae Natsuki and Ohsaka Ryouta, yet they have gave us an awesome performances. Hana Kanazawa, Ai Kayano, Ishihara Kaori and Mikako Komatsu also gave us their best performances while voicing their characters. Both the OSTs and Voice Actors are 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : The characters are great in their own ways. I admired all of them. The unrequited romances, friendships and conflicts between a character with another character or a character with themselves are great. It's a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall : For me Nagi no Asukara was a pretty amazing anime. The story, the characters, the conflicts and dramas, it made me want to joined them and explore. I had a great time watching this, all the funny moments, the breathtaking moments, even the sad moments (I remember crying watching several episodes couple of times), I'm glad I watched Nagi no Asukara. Really, I do. For an enjoyment, it was a 8/10, and the overall score for Nagi no Asukara was a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance, drama and fantasy with a little bit of twist, then Nagi no Asukara is definitely the one.",

You know that feeling of accomplishment yet you are also a tad bit sad because the fun is over? That's what this anime is all about. If you're a drama queen like me and also a hopeless romantic then you'll love this anime. One of my favourite aspects is the way that they portrayed the characters. Yes there is a main character, but it isn't solely focused on them. I may be a bit biased here but my favourite character would have to be Chisaki Hiradaira.The character development is REAL. \\n\r\nIf you're also into an interesting plot twist that shakes the entire anime then 'A Lull in the Sea' is the perfect match for you. It does have a bit of mystery thrown into the story... but it's the good type. I honestly love this anime so much to the point where I'll randomly think about it and get the sudden urge to watch it. You know those anime where you watch it and then whenever you watch another anime you feel slightly empty? Well strap yourself in for a ride because if the story or the characters don't draw you in then the beauty of the animation surely will because no matter what, this anime IS a masterpiece. \\n\r\nXoXo",

            "content": "Harem anime's are very popular aren't they? Some create a real frenzy when it comes to fans \"shipping\" certain relationships, in which a certain sect of the audience drool at the sight of a certain relationship developing. But with any drama, unpredictably can arise, and Nagi no Asukara really does break the harem stereotype.\r\nNagi no Asukara follows the story of Hikari and friends, whom live in an underwater city called Shioshishio from the help of Ena (a skin covering helping them breathe underwater). It documents them making the jump from going to school in the sea to on the surface, as well as showing thestrained relationship between sea dwellers and land dwellers, and how the has affected the fate of the world as they know it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, Nagi no Asukara is a very untypical harem anime drama, in fact, atypical is better in describing it. There are 2 arcs (which is separated by a time skip) in Nagi no Asukara, with many varying themes from the secularization of religion, to coming to terms with change and the \"guilt of love\". Furthermore, it does include a bit of magic in places, mainly when referring to the main religion, the devotion to the sea good. Although it starts of very typical in terms of how harem usually come about, with the many complex love triangles obvious from the get to, the story telling, raw, emotional character interactions and it's pacing make it truly into a drama, with twists and turns in developing friendships and how change can effect the relationships too. In terms of atmosphere, although it may appear light hearted here and there, the many themes which are mainly adult, even including the racism of children and the on going feud with land and sea add a brilliant juxtaposition to what you would 'expect' to see. Those themes lead the group of children coming together to try and mend a broken society and a broken world. The anime ended with an atypical ending, completely against the traditional harem ending.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some draw backs. Although it has the atypical harem anime style, it can be seen as over dramatic in its messages and some issues can be a bit farfetched. In terms of using the magic and supernatural in religion, it can also be seen as too fake as it doesn't work well with the other themes. Nevertheless, the added magic and religion, as well as charterers in love in all do make for some interesting developments.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it's stunning graphics do set it well above many anime made recently, the scenery of shioshishio is truly stunning, giving it almost an 'Atlantis' theme to it, with dazzling, sharp colours. In terms of character models, although each is designed well, one problem can be with this who aren't too fond of HUGE blue eyes, however, as they live in the sea, it acts as an added touch, and even adds to the theme of racism too, which was done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show shines when it demonstrates the characters. When the show started, the characters mainly fell into the most predictable type of casts. For example, the main character Hikari was the usual tsundere, there was Tsumugu, the stoic-voice-of-reason character, as well as the forgotten main characters wing-man Kaname. Not to mention the coy, shy one Chisaki, and the cry baby Manaka. But instead of keeping the characters like that, they were fleshed out to the extreme, with many serious events developing, or better yet, completely re-defining the cast into a group of kids with many flaws, many skewed perceptions of reality and, most of all, grounded and realistic, similar to the youth of today. The show does make use of the characters inner struggles well, this can be seen by the love interest within the friendship group. It does add for drama and emotion, told brilliantly by inner monologues. Overall, the characters really do go on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a catch, some characters do come into play well, such as Miuna, whom was very prevalent in the second arc, but characters like Sayu and Kaname (one of the main protagonists) ended up getting less screen time. Nevertheless, they're problems, although brief were dealt with to a good standard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, both the opening and ending were rather enjoyable, both had a slight feeling of being cute and cuddly, but was preformed well and was very rememberable. However, the ending song did give away some spoilers for what would happen later on in the series, which was disappointing. The original soundtrack was done very well, with each intense moment, working well with the music.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Nagi no Asukara does set a high bar as being a really remarkable drama, with realistic characters, and a well crafted story. I will recommend it to anyone who wants to watch drama at its finest.",

So, our main cast are four kids who live underwater in like a bay, one day their school closes so they have to go to an land school. And thats all I can say, quite interesting right? \\n\\n\r\nThe story is like a romance highschool drama, where the one that is going after someone does not realize having someone behind them also, and it forms like a chain, not that hard to understand.\\n\r\nAlso story wise, it manages to make a good comentary on racism and discrimination, I did not expected to be thinking about those themes while watching a romantic anime, and it slightly changed my view about that matter.\\n\r\nIt is a story of growth and I have not seen a show that made me think the way this one did.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is SO BEAUTIFUL, I dare you to find one shot that is not pretty as hell in this show, even every wall has so many details, its amazing to look at. It is a work of art, and sound wise is at point to, some songs in the ost really got me.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about characters, damn this serie has so many but at least most of them are very likeable, except for the fuckin' kid that is born on the second half (Watch it, you will see). The only thing I have to nag about is that most of them are very melodramatic, I would recommend to not binge watch this show, it might get you a little mad seeing most characters run off instead of facing their problems. But I dont find it that shitty since they are very young and seems to be normal to run from your problems, and eventually they realise that.\\n\r\nThe main cast is highly likeable, a shy girl, an hiperactive boy, another shy but stronger girl and a quiet boy. Then there are boys and girls in the land, witch are very good too. \\n\r\nPersonally I really resonated with Isaki, the quiet boy, the guy at the back always, chill and quiet. Maybe you will too?. \\n\\n\r\nIf you see this show you will see what is the problem most people have with the story. But I can asure you it is highly enjoyable, just trust me and keep watching all the way. It will have you in tears.",

It really was and I wanted to know how they'd explain the mechanics of the sea village. For example, how was gravity working to keep they food from floating out of their bowls and mingling with the sea. What did they do with trash and bodily waste?\r\nBut they never focused on those and instead spent an entire 26 episodes dragging out the romantic drama between various characters. I'm Sorry, but I live in Japan and the 14 year olds here are not so wrought with frustration, full of deep reflectinginsight, or angst as anime likes to portray. Why is that necessary? Are the writers all 80 year old men with no concept of how children actually talk, behave, and solve problems?! \\n\\n\r\nIn reality, if there was a love triangle, then there'd be a quick janken battle and the winner would be decided. Easy peasy. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it's because I hate this style of overly feely, unrealistic characters, that ruined this anime for me. \\n\\n\r\nThat, and the crap way writers always seem to throw a bunch of explanation at the end as if they didn't have 26 episodes to explain. Or as if they were somehow hoping this turd would be polished into another season.",

            "content": "You ever begin a show with moderate to low expectations, find more than you were looking for, get super into it, hype it up to your friends, and get so god damned excited for it every week that you just can't contain yourself (an exaggeration, of course)? Nagi no Asukara was that show for me. It blew my expectations away with it's excellent character development, good story, great art and sound direction, and just overall feel. \"But then why is it a 6\", you may ask. Because endings can cripple a show. A stool with 3 legs will be wobbly if one leg is tooshort, and fall if said leg is almost non-existent. Nagi's ending is the prior, a weak link in an otherwise strong show that, despite my bitter stance on it, is still good and worth your valuable time if you are into shows like Clannad, AnoHana, Angel Beats!, and others of such ilk.\\n\\n\r\nSo story wise, Nagi takes sometime to pick up. Think Steins;Gate. The beginning is somewhat boring and not quite perfect, even boorishly melodramatic in spots. But there are glimpses of excellence here and there to keep you interested. But the proverbial shit hits the fan at the end of the first cor. Everything changes after this point, and Nagi enters it's golden age. Quality character development, good humor, great dialogue and excellent pacing. I was hooked, like a fish on a lure. Christ I was preparing a spot for it in my 5 favorite anime, pondering over which show to give the axe and remove from my hallowed lineup. Then, Nagi's gilded shell began to peel and crack, revealing something not quite so perfect, like discount chocolate. The melodrama began to pick up, confusing new plot lines were introduced, and the amount of crying per episode reached beyond my tolerable limits, which are rather high for the average anime viewer, if I do say so myself. But I held fast, muttering to myself as I scoured the interwebs for my fix that it'd all be rectified by the time the show ended. Much to my dismay, this didn't occur. Most poor endings either provide too little closure on plot lines or really bad closure, too the point where you wish they didn't even do so in the first place. Nagi is special, in that it resolves abso-fucking-lutely nothing. Overall plot line, left out in the open in a \"maybe we fixed the problem\" conclusion. Romantic sub-plots? \"Maybe ever after\" endings. This is disgraceful. The absolute worst thing you can do with a story is leave it out in the open. And I don't even know where'd they go with a second season either. It's like this unfixeable clusterfuck that I just can't get over. The ending is just plain awful.\\n\\n\r\nNow though it may seem like I have nothing but ills to say about Nagi, such isn't the case. As i've exemplified before, I love 90% of the show's story. It does few things wrong, and even fewer of these flaws are critical. One of the best parts of Nagi, IMO, is the characters. Hikari, the main protag, shows huge development throughout the show, going from my least favorite character to my undisputed favorite. Manaka, though I feel she functions as more of a plot device to an actual character, shows good development and does some amazing things in the show. Chisaki is probably the weakest of the cast, constantly inducing groans from me due to her indecisive and grating personality, but still, she grows as a character. Kaname....let's just skip him. His role in the plot in dazzlingly minor, and by the end of the show is revealed to be nothing more than a plot device, much like Manaka (you'll see). Miuna and Sayu are two characters who, though initially seem like unimportant side shows, become incredibly important (at least Miuna does) as the show progresses. Miuna functions as one of the main characters, if not THE main character, in the latter half of the show, taking up most of the screen time with her plot. Sayu always felt like a spectator in the show more than a character being actively affected by the events in the story, and in all reality isn't all that important, but IMHO she is the best girl in the show and I love he-I MEAN, what I meant to say was...*ahem*; she is ultimately an eternal side character that has minimal impact to the plot, but is still likable. \\n\\n\r\nYou notice how most of the characters in Nagi grow, in differing degrees, as characters as the episode count rolls higher. This exposes the predominate motif in Nagi: growth and change. This is one of the most bread and butter themes in anime, considering the demographic that much of anime is aimed at (young people and teens). Nagi manages to provide a fresh take on the growth theme, but not so much change, which is arguably the more important of the two. The show spends quite a bit of time stressing how change is the greatest fear of the characters, and that any change in their relationships with each other is a bad thing. Now, logically, the show would then show the viewer how change isn't bad, how it's a natural part of life and should be embraced, not shunned. The show seems to go in this direction as we wind down to the finale. But guess what happens? Take a guess. Got one? Was it \"the ending\"? If it was, then you're absolutely correct. The ending doesn't provide any real conclusions to the side plots it introduces, with perhaps one exception (you'll know by the ending, trying to refrain from major spoilers here). In this, it betrays the theme of \"change\", as nothing concretely changes. It's certainly in the midst of changing, so perhaps it half-delivers on it convictions, but it still stands that this side-plot is left out in the open, like so many other things in Nagi. \\n\\n\r\nSUPER RUSHED ART AND SOUND SECTION TIME\\n\r\nYeah, I never like writing these sections, so let's just get it over with. Nagi is animated by PA Works (PAW), a studio predominately known for a little anime know as Angel Beats! Now if you've seen Angel Beats!, you know PAW does a bang up job with it's art/animation, and Nagi is 10X better than Angel Beats was. The art is super sharp and the animation is more than fluid enough for a slice of life show like Nagi. The sound is equally excellent. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in awhile, with tracks complimenting every scene under the sea. The OPs and EDs are all good, but the second OP is definitely superior to the first OP. So yeah, no complaints here, the art and sound are actually what keep Nagi from being a 5 overall. \\n\\n\r\nNagi is my prime example of what an awful ending can do to a show. I was balls deep in this show, so to speak, and was about to finish when it just slapped me across the face and left me hanging dissatisfied and betrayed. A crude anecdote to be sure, but it should summarize what I feel about Nagi as a whole. Mixed feeling abound, with an intense longing for something better, but bitter regret knowing that I probably won't get anything to satiate that craving. Nagi no Asukara, The Lull of the Sea is truly-\\n\\n\r\n6/10- Fair",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is simply beautiful. \r\nStory 9/10: The story was quite creative and unique. As you go along the episodes, they explain to you more things. Most events turn out to be unpredictable and very exciting, making you want to watch more! I wouldn't give it a 10/10 though as it wasn't like...Incredibly extraordinary? XD  \r\nArt 10/10: The art was beautiful! The scenery, character designs, and just everything was made stunning to the eye. \r\nSound 10/10: In my bias opinion, I'd give it a 10/10. Both of the openings (sung by Ray) really show you the type of atmosphere and feeling thatboth halves of the anime gives (Second half, much more \"tragic\"). The endings which were sung by Nagi Yanagi also were amazing. The OSTs mostly fitted the show like they know when to put each soundtrack in to make us get into the mood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: The characters are one of the reasons why Nagi no Asukara was such a big enjoyment. The cast is large. Firstly, the main character Hikaru. Many viewers have considered him as an annoying tsundere male but it really depends on your opinions. Manaka the crybaby is also considered annoying however many favor her. Both of these characters are a good example of the anime's theme \"Change\". So they basically end up maturing in some way throughout the anime, realizing the hardships with life and accepting them. Then there's Chisaki, the one who acts the most mature. She also plays a masssssivvveeee role in the anime with the theme. Tsumugu is awesome too, he's really emotionless but when he smiles IT BRINGS HAPPINESS! I would love to continue with Kaname, Miuna, Sayu and company but yeah.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Definitely a masterpiece in my eyes. I had fun finishing that in less than 2 days, probably my favourite anime so far. It felt like I was a fellow member of Shioshishio just watching them go through situations on a screen. It was an incredibly experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 but it really differs on your type. Most say the pacing was somewhat slow in the first half but you'd have to think really hard on why the anime was doing this etc. Anyways, totally recommend this anime to this who love fantasy, and intense drama with a greatly made love pentagon!",

(See what I did there?)\r\n===Story===\r\nNow I gave the story a 9 for the fact that it was not the main driving force (by story I mean the whole sea god being angry and wanting to destroy the surface) while, yes, it was a big part I feel like the characters where a bigger driving force. Now one but I didn't like was how it ended with uncertainty but at the same time that is a positive,I mean, of it ended with a \"they lived happily ever after\" I would've thought that would be worse than how it ended.\\n\r\nI'm not to bring up YLiA very often but I have one gripe with YLiA which is the lie (don't worry I won't into spoiler territory) which was in my opinion unreasonable, like, I know that lie was the driving force behind the story but I still feel it was unreasonable, but with this anime I only have a semi-gripe (a gripe which was the best way to handle it.)\\n\\n\r\n===Art===\\n\r\nI may never have been to Japan but I can still appreciate how detailed the Art is especially on the backgrounds where the details are breathtaking, it shows little details that you see in real life but nearly never in animation. The character animation is good and they don't stand out from the background, the eyes on the people from the sea (I just realised I never summarised the plot... Ehh it has a summary up above) look a little weird but it does make them stand out from the surface people, if only slightly.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound===\\n\r\nI have never heard/seen an anime where the sound was terrible while I can't judge the Japanese voice actors amd I haven't heard the dub the sound of the sea,cars and basically everything besides the voices is easily a 10.\\n\\n\r\n===Characters===\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the story section the characters seem to drive the characters to do what they do more then the actual plot, all the characters have their own personality and they feel real, I can imagine this characters as real people and they grow, especially the main character which is probably because he got the most screen time, and the love... Mess, I heard someone say that if you tried to draw a chart showing who loved who there would be too many arrows, which, to me, makes the characters feel real because you may love someone who someone else also loves and it won't be a clear, this person loves this person, in real life it would be a mess, at least I think that's what it would be like, I don't know because I have never experienced a relationship or even love, only childish crushs. For the characters I give this a 10\\n\\n\r\n===Enjoyment===\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime, and there were a couple of twists I wasn't expecting which made this series really fun to watch, so again this was a 10 to me.\\n\\n\r\n===Overall=== \\n\r\nthis kinda ties into Enjoyment because this is a 10, and I honestly say check it out, if I gave scores like Glass Reflection I would give this a Certified Frosty. So check it out, I'm sure you'll love it like I did.",

            "content": "Where do i even begin for Nagi no Asukara, this anime got to me and will always have a spot in my heart. The word beautifully doesn't even describe how amazing this anime is, and how well it was done. Every character in this anime touched my heart in some way, that this anime will never leave my top five list.\r\nStory 10- The scenery alone is so beautiful that it will have you hooked on the first episode. This anime was just that beautiful! Unlike most anime where the plot is super predictable this one aint, every episode surprised me an took me on aroller coaster that was absolutely amazing. The story surrounds four friends Hikari, Manaka, Kaname, and Chisaki while they not only explore there town Shioshishio which is in the sea, but also the town on land. Where they have to start going to school, since the school in there hometown isn't being used anymore. Their was a a lot of diplomatic dispute between the people on land and those who lived in the sea. Deep down though you can tell they don't really hate each other. The story basically involves the four friends adapted to their new school life on land, because as soon as they get to the school the bullying begins which mostly surrounds Manaka. Throughout the story you will notice everyone's friendship develop not only with each other but with the new friends they make on land. This is defiantly one of those romance anime that was done right, it brought back memories of when i watched Toradora it was just that touching.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10- I don't even know where to begin on the topic of art. This anime was just breath taking from the beginning. Shioshishio was so beautiful, the buildings in the village looked so well down for being something made in the sea. The environment never ceased to amaze me seeing all the beautiful fish swim in just a vast sea. What  i loved the most about this anime wasn't even the sea itself, but the Tomoebi (the three suns) when i saw it i was so amazed I could not take my eyes off of it. The sea salt snow falling into the sea and watching the sea light up in the last episode was also beautiful, out of all the anime Ive seen the Art in this anime is defiantly the best.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10- The opening's and ending's of the anime caught my attention every time i just could not bare to skip them not even once. What i loved most thought was listening to everything interact between the characters, the fish, and the sea itself which was just so soothing to listen to. The sound and music in this anime are hands down a 10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10- I can tell you right now the growth of these characters will catch your attention at every moment. At first it seemed like they were all very predictable, but throughout the anime i was constantly surprised. What surprised me the most was the growth of Hikari and Tsumugu's friendship, at first it seemed like they were gonna be enemies the throughout the entire anime, boy was i way off. I loved every moment of watching everyone relationship with each other grow and change. The romance threw me for a loop, seeing who had feelings for who i loved that about the anime. The character development is 10, i wouldn't even second think that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10- Every moment of this anime was breathtaking to watch, and the sea was so beautiful to look at. The sound, characters, and art weren't what drew me towards these anime, but they sure did keep me hooked in. I enjoyed every heartfelt moment of this anime, many tears were shed because of this amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10- This is a must watch for any one who loves romance. This anime will keep you hooked at every moment, but don't take my word for it. Check out the anime for yourself I promise you wont be disappointed!!!",

I was greatly mistaken, and I owe P.A. Works, the studio producer of Nagi-Asu, an apology for having such presumptions. This fantasy, slice of life, and romance anime is absolutely breathtaking in every aspect. The story is unpredictable and goes beyond your typical anime of its genre. Despite the supernatural aspects, its underwater theme creates logical situations that the characters face, including forbidden love and discrimination. \r\nNagi-Asu takes places between two settings: an underwater village called Shioshishio and thesurface village called Oshiooshi. Upon the closing of their middle school in Shioshishio, four childhood friends (Hikuri, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname) have no choice but to enroll in Mihama Middle School on the surface. Later comes fateful meetings with characters, including Tsumugu, who become an important part of their lives. The new characters also become valuable to the story, because they each face difficulties and have their own goals. The joint of two human races brings forth forbidden love, discrimination, grudges, newfound feelings, heartbreak, etc. Unlike drama anime with your usual love triangles, Nagi-Asu has a love heptagon that gives several opportunities to root for certain individuals but plenty of disappointments for viewers who may dislike the ending result. The love heptagon is not as complicated as it sounds. As the story continues, the events and interactions between characters makes it easier to detect why Character A is precious to Character B.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest accomplishment of Nagi-Asu is its pacing with 26 episodes put to good use. Sea folklore has a huge impact on the story. Proper execution allowed for orderly suspense and thorough explanation of the folklore. It also made way for character development over a five-year time span. Time and characters\u2019 interactions with each other allowed them to grow positively and influence their life choices. Some characters develop into someone you can\u2019t help but praise. The finale was clear and gives the viewer a sense of how the characters\u2019 lives will continue.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are given fair screen time, allowing the viewer to understand each character. Monologues reveal their inner feelings about certain situations or individuals, particularly the ones they care for. Each character worked towards achieving a particular goal. The only character I couldn\u2019t stand was the lead male protagonist Hikuri, who was too similar to Eren from Shingeki no Kyojin with his constant complaints and quick temper over little things. The show reveals important events of MCs' pasts, but it vaguely discusses the origin of their friendship. The most Nagi-Asu does is show some scenes of their times at their underwater middle school. Their interaction with each other proves the closeness of their relationship, but more information about their past would\u2019ve been great.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works never fail in making top-notch and realistic animation for fantasy. The settings, especially Shioshishio, and character designs are beautiful! All of the scenes were active from the sun\u2019s reflection on the sea to the school of fish underwater. Group settings showed activity from all characters. The distinction between the sea people and land people is outstanding. The eye colors of the characters are sparkly with the brown eyes of the land people and the aqua-colored eyes of the sea people, particularly the MCs. It does not matter, but I highly recommend watching this in HD to get a better experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is amazing, and the vocals fits perfectly with its underwater theme, especially in its first ED \u201cAqua Terrarium\u201d by Nagi Yanagi. The lyrics describe the feelings of love throughout the story. There were stressful moments in the series that played happy background music, and it can prevent one from feeling any sympathy for the characters. The seiyuu played the characters\u2019 voices very well. For example, Hanazawa Kana did an excellent job playing Manaka, the sensitive girl who cried most of the time. The sound effects, including crashes of the waves, were very good, too.\\n\\n\r\nNagi-Asu instantly became one of my favorite anime, and I can\u2019t believe I waited months before watching it. Besides Hikari\u2019s annoying tsundere attitude, I was disappointed with how certain parts resembled something you\u2019d expect from a Disney movie. Nevertheless, I enjoyed how each character fought for the ones they loved or openly expressed their feelings. The settings and conflicts that follow are really intriguing, adding to the enjoyment. The unexpected events and passion between the characters led me to marathon it, and I was very pleased with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nagi-Asu is an amazing work of the fantasy and romance-drama genre. P.A. Works makes it live with its colorful and active animation. The characters develop feelings and express themselves fully. The story, especially the conflicts, presents itself well with proper execution, creating suspense. If you have crazy presumptions about Nagi-Asu like me, try at least the first five episodes to truly get a hint of what to expect. You may not like it, especially with the love heptagon, but it is likely to become one of the most beautiful shows you've seen.",

            "content": "Wow, I really can't praise this anime enough. Everything about this story is so creative and just epic. Nagi No Asukara, you will start off annoyed and confused, but still fully immersed in the characters and the whole story. Everything feels really intense, and your baffled by the characters at first and how they interact with one another, but then it just all comes together eventually that the whole story just becomes so beautiful and so worth it in the end. This anime will crush you with feels and you won't be able to hold back the tears, because it's all just so relevant andso REAL. This isn't just a typical love story, there are so many twists and turns that make it beautiful and unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall held so many important messages, and isn't just focused on two characters who love each other. You get to see so many different interaction and changes that happen to the world around them, and not just only them but multiple others. The story and plot of this anime is very prominent and is what makes this such a outstanding anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\noh lord, the anime art in this is just incredible. Their characters look so lively and so bright, I feel like their eyes are piercing my soul. Everything from what they wear, to the big beautiful sea, and the shimmery water, everything felt so peaceful and vivid that I never got bored and my eyes were glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, as prominent as it was, it wasn't a main focus of this anime. Yes it was there, but it was just background music, your more focused on what is happening in the story honestly. The music definitely had a calming, classical kind of vibe to it though and went perfectly with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Hikari Sakishima goes through some incredibly deep changes that really make me love this this anime. Not only that, but so many characters are constantly changing and go through some major life changing event, the character development is mainly what makes this such an amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the enjoyment for this anime was spot on, but there were times where they made is difficult for me to fully understand why they do the things they do until the very end. Everything makes sense at the end, but sometimes their was just so much tension between the characters that it became a little confusing at times and not to mention a tad overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to practically anyone. Enough said. Just watch it, and you won't be disappointed stepping into this unique underworld with multiple realities and so many feels.",

            "content": "Don't be deceived by its cutesy, colorful outlook. You might think Nagi no Asukara is probably one of those run-of-the-mill school romances that always end up as a cliched failure, but that's most definitely not the case here. This anime's storyline is based on two seemingly different races of humans who have been feuding for as long as anyone can remember. They are the people of the sea and surface.\r\nArt:\r\nLet's start off with the foremost first impression, the art. Your eyes do not deceive you when they report the mesmerizing construction of the characters and settings. The artists of this show have done an outstandingjob pronouncing the colors of each little detail to produce a masterpiece of a scene. Meanwhile, the animators work on controlling the lighting so it seems as you are walking through a shimmering dream of precision and almost realistic reality. However, the perfection of the art isn't intense to the point where it robs the spotlight away from the actual story. Picture it as a sparkling, smooth wave of gentle sea water rolling alongside a rocky boat. It would make the boat ride more enjoyable to brush your fingertips on the soft water top, wouldn't it? The art does just that, it emboldens pleasure in watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI described the story as a rocky boat, but why is that, you might ask? Well, the first half of the story enhances the rivalry and feuding that has long been brewing between the sea and surface people. Four friends from the sea village Shioshishio have to attend of a surface school in a town called Oshiooshi. At first, the two different groups of children don't get along with each other, as the whole racism concept still remains. However, after a period of time, they begin to realize that they are more alike than different and decide to cooperate in an annual tradition called the Ofunehiki. Yet, don't be deceive by its new, lighthearted appearance, because a sudden turn of events plunges the story into a slightly different setting. This ends the first half and opens the doors for the second half of the story. The plot line in the second half is a heavy fog of mixed feelings and confusion for the characters as they attempt to unravel the answers to their ever-growing questions. With all that in mind, I could say the first half of the story was a rocky boat ride, but the whole plot is like a drop tower. It slowly builds up and teases you with mild drops of shock until you're confused on whether the real drop will occur, so once it does, you are in for it. Keep in mind that the ride isn't over after one plunge, it will continue its round until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nA story is nothing without good characters plots. In this case, the characters in Nagi no Asukara are, to the very least, much like us. They are all normal beings with the flaws of human nature. They share a society where racism, stereotypes, and discrimination dominate their lifestyles alike our own. One of the great things about this anime is that you can relate yourself to any character. That connection between you and a character makes the show much more enjoyable as you watch the scenes roll by and go, \"I totally feel you, bro.\" Likewise, the connections between the characters themselves is much like our relations too. In their case, it's a flat-out love polygon. Think love triangles or harems are tough enough? Just wait till you see Nagi's. Normally, I'd hate how infuriating love polygons can be, but Nagi no Asukara intertwines their love plots with raw human emotions. Again the relativity of this show breaks through your armor of criticism and reaches into your soul to find something that will squeeze the feels out of you. You may hold your judgement against a particular character (as a matter of fact, I still do), but there is no absolute way you can hate any of them. Put aside the fact that half the cast can breathe in the ocean, they are otherwise all just as humane as you and me. Some may share some of your personality traits, and how could you possibly hate yourself? (C'mon, you gotta at least have some self-respect or arrogance in you) Nevertheless, this show really makes that strong connection with the viewer and I think that's a wonderful thing to have.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI could never forget the impact this show's sound had on me. Nagi no Asukara's OST has made its way into my top 10 anime OSTs of all time. I can't even begin to describe how marvelous it was, but obviously I will have to attempt to describe it. Here goes. The first opening had that sweet, lighthearted feeling of a beautiful friendship. It was like it was stringing together all those days spent with your closest friends that consisted of sunny laughter and frivolous fun. The endings and second opening don't have this level of happiness anymore, but they still make their marks with creating that atmosphere of reminisce. It's like looking back at your life and going through a film of memories, laughing and smiling at the remarkable ones, or somberly regretting the unappealing ones. You can't make out a specific emotion when you hear those works of music, but rather a steady stream of feelings that make you enjoy your life as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDo I even need to say anymore? Yes, I did enjoy Nagi no Asukara and I'm grateful that I came across this anime when I was looking for another satisfying roadtrip through the feels. If you find anything hindering, I'm sure you will come to overlook it and if not to its fullest extent, enjoy this exquisite piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Nagi no Asukara is a show where you can calmly watch the perks and flaws of human nature unravel before your very eyes. The characters are startlingly relatable and enjoyable to root for as they try to follow their heart's desires. The art is pleasing to the eye and enhances the beauty of nature itself and our civilization. The sound is like watching a personal film of your life that only you know all about, but through your ears. It's the perfect option for pulling over from the fast lane and onto the sidewalk for a nice stroll through another take on what our life really looks like.\\n",

            "content": "There is NOTHING I can tell you that can prepare you for what this series brings to the table, emotionally, symbolically, morally, everything. I did a slight preview of this show before, but that gives it no justice it deserves., so this time I\u2019m going all out on what all this series did right, and the very little it did wrong.\r\nI\u2019m not doing my typical genre review, because this is not my typical type of review, but just know that everything correlates fantastically (also no sub-section scores).\r\nStory: \r\nI hate reviewing story. If I am or am not the audience that this is directed at, cannotlet me speak for everyone. However, there were some parts of this series that were too much to let go. Although it just ended as a simulcast, future watchers who have not started it yet MUST know that this series is broken into two \u201cseasons,\u201d so to say. These \u201cseasons\u201d are VERY different when it comes to the mood, tone, scenery, and character\u2019s going from verisimilitude to a very ominous and serious story-telling. I believe it was eloquently done, however some may complain that there is a large dissonance between these two seasons, which is completely understandable. A small complaint from a small part of the audience, but nit-picking happens on near perfect shows. \\n\r\nOther than that, execution was handled beautifully. Not once did I feel the story was too slow or fast-paced, nor when I finished it did I need more (in contrary to wanting more, which I DEFINITELY do).  The story does have a tendency to hit you with the metaphorical baseball bat often, almost exclusively in the second season, which brings me to my biggest point\u2026\\n\\n\r\nClannad, right? Now, in no means am I saying this series is done as flawlessly as Clannad: After Story, but they have some similarities that instantly hit me: aloof and light-hearted first seasons, intense and emotional second seasons, strong (very) emphasis on symbolism, especially of water and color, and a very strong lead protagonist. I\u2019m sure many of you have watched Clannad, and have experienced the Clannad Void: where you constantly search for the next series that can emotionally entice you like Clannad. It might be a shot in the dark, but I strongly feel like this series is one of (now) 2-3 series that can and maybe will fill this void for you; one being AnoHana, and the other being maybe Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo and maybe even Kanon (2006). It does everything Clannad does right on terms on emotion and story, but there is something that gets me a little angry that I\u2019ll talk about soon.\\n\r\nOverall, this series is beautiful in the way it is conveyed in almost every way I know, and can help fill the Clannad Void. It also contains one of the biggest love polygons I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn my other review, I talked a lot about na\u00efve assumption. How that at the beginning the characters were a bit shady due to lack of time invested, and will blossom into something amazingly fruitful later. I do not have the opportunity to say this often, so I will say it proudly: I was absolutely right. I believe that if the series has strong characters who have time invested into them to create emotional bonds, it will be an amazing series. Sure, plot is nice, but if there was no plot and there were amazing and enjoyable characters, then I could care less. Good thing here, Nagi goes the full nine yards. You get your tragicomedy story, throw on some wonderfully developed characters, bake at about 350 degrees and you have yourself a really good looking cake. Not to mention, this cake was made with high production value, so the art on it looks amazing. Anyway, only one thing bothered me, and that was the character of Tsumugu, almost exclusively in the first season of the series. Although I got used to his cold-heartedness, I realized that Tsumugu was used more as a ragdoll by the producers than anything else; he was a brick wall, seemingly created to create an ominous feel and be onerous himself. Although I know now why he may have acted the way he did, viewers at the beginning may start to hate him, which I don\u2019t feel like the producers aimed for. Nevertheless, look out for that, and be open-minded about Tsumugu and you\u2019ll appreciate him more.\\n\r\nOverall, the characters were written exquisitely and were imbued with passion and emotion that created believable and natural characters that anyone could love, with Tsumugu being a little late to the party.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound:\\n\r\nI have almost nothing to say here. The art is the best I\u2019ve ever seen, and you should definitely experience the wonders and the scenery that are brought to life by the art. The sound, after getting a strong listen to all of the OST, I can confirm that it is orchestrated within context and marvelously done overall, especially OP 2, Ebb and Flow, which captivates the second season perfectly. The voice actors fit their characters, and did a fantastic job at conveying the characters emotions through themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Nagi grinds down to what we believe is right and what love can accomplish within our own hearts. There are LOADS of symbolism that I could explain, but it\u2019s be easier if I just wrote a book on it, just keep an eye out on the symbolism if you can, it greatly empowers the series. The series has taught me that love is understanding; love is loss; love is the driving power behind our actions; love is what we sacrifice for others; love is why we live, and we strive to find that one love that makes all the difference, one we will find sometime, somewhere; and that truly speaks volumes to me.\\n\r\nAnd in the end, I believe that everyone should watch Nagi no Asukara, not only to watch something to enjoy, but to really think about who you love, and hold it dearly.\\n\r\n\u201cThe Color of the Sea. The Color of the Earth. The Color of the Wind. The Color of Your Heart. Your Color.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Plot 10/10 \r\nSummary: Nagi No Asukara (NagiAsu) takes place in a time and place where humans live like we do now in addition to people who live under water. Long ago all humans lived under water due to an extra layer of skin called Ena which allows them to breathe underwater. Some people remained there under the sea and some left and live on land. The story centers around a group of middle school students from the ocean who come up to the surface to go to school since their school has been abandoned. On the surface, the people can tend to be quite racistof those living in the sea. \\n\\n\r\nIt may sound a bit silly at first but the plot to this anime is simply wonderful. It\u2019s hard to even explain why without spoiling the anime. The story is told in such a way that you bond to almost every single character emotionally and when things happen to them you connect to it and really feel it. There\u2019s many twists in the things that happen that take you on a wonderful rollercoaster of a journey with these characters. The other great thing about this anime is that it breaks the barriers for its genre. We have your typical school-aged kids with their usual drama that goes along with them. Yet the story has a much deeper plot than that and they take it in an unconventional way. After watching so many shoujo animes, this one was a breath of fresh air. It really pulls on your heartstrings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime makes you feel something for almost every single character. Unlike some animes, I really cared about the fate of each one and wanted them to accomplish something by the end. The relationships between characters were much stronger than others I\u2019ve seen as well. The pacing of this show was great and I felt that it really allowed you to get to know everyone in the right amount of time; not too rushed and not too drawn out either. The characters themselves were extremely likeable to me. There was one in particular that I really wasn\u2019t crazy about in the first half of the show, but later they develop beautifully and really grow on me, becoming a favorite. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Nagi Asu was pretty darn perfect. The music did a perfect job of making you feel the tone they were trying to get across. It brought suspense, sadness and happiness at the appropriate times. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10 \\n\r\nIf for some crazy reason you don\u2019t find yourself enjoying this anime, the animation is one thing that you can\u2019t deny was stunning. The detail and use of color, especially in the underwater scenes was just beautiful. The attention to detail is what made this special. You can tell the animators really took the time and effort they needed to make this show look good. No random outsourcing for the animating on this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show I thought was phenomenal. There really wasn\u2019t much of anything that I didn\u2019t like. The ONE thing that didn\u2019t quite please me was the ending. It was a solid ending and it felt like the show came to a proper end. I just wished that there was a bit more of a definite explanation of how the characters end up. But it wasn\u2019t enough to make me dislike it at all. It\u2019s really a great show that not so many people know about as of when I\u2019m writing this. It\u2019s one you should definitely give a try especially if you like the shoujo, romance, or supernatural genres.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asakura is focused around a group of four middle schoolers who live in a village under the sea and go to the surface for schooling, even with some hostilities between humans and sea dwellers for the former's abandoning of the seas to live on land. The series starts off focused on exploring the tensions between the sea dwellers and humans, with the four children learning to adjust to life on land and accept being among both races. This is mainly shown with Hikari who at first hates humans until his increased understanding of the close connections between his kind and humanity lead himto accept bonds with humans, even trying to prevent them from being affected by an old prophecy from his village's god that would lead to humanity's extinction.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does start off a bit slow as it's mostly focused on the everyday activity of Hikari and his friends interacting with humans at their school, while hints are dropped of lingering hostilities between both races. It does have some developments with characters like Manaka becoming less dependent on others and Hikari showing less prejudice towards humans, though nothing too significant occurs. The plot does pick up in the second quarter of the series when the prophecy concerning the sea god begins to manifest itself onto the humans and affect the sea dwellers. This leads to events building up as Hikari and his friends try to help the human residents of the seaside village in trying to halt the oncoming calamity, which they do at a great cost to one among the group.\\n\\n\r\nA timeskip occurs which focuses on the four children learning to come of age as they come to terms with their feelings for one another and any lingering doubts they had from the events that came from the sea god. The character developments that take place throughout Nagi no Asakura's felt natural for me and I could connect with the issues faced by the characters as they try accepting any changes they experience and overcoming any doubts they are facing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, these developments do come at the cost of the title's plot quality. The events of the timeskip lead the focus on the tensions between humans and sea-dwellers to get shafted and later developments involving the sea god up to the show's finale were not as engaging as the events in the second half due to the lack of huge risk affecting both parties compared to the first half's events and it seemed a bit too convenient in its resolution with the fates of humans and sea-dwellers.\\n\\n\r\nAs to be expected from a PA Works title, the visual presentation of Nagi no Asakura is high quality with plenty of vivid color and detail shown off in the title's gorgeous scenery shots with character designs getting similar treatment. While not the prominent element of the series, the show's animation is still quite fluid in showing off the movements of characters as they walk or swim, with animated highlights coming off both the events that involve the sea god spurring up disastrous events like whirlpools and huge waves to those within the sea.\\n\\n\r\nIssues aside with its plotting and slow start, Nagi no Asakura is still a solid series that offers up a nice amount of character drama faced by its young cast coming to grips with growing up and the first half events with the sea god offer up some genuine suspense over what would happen with both humans and sea-dwellers. It's not perfect, but it is still worth looking into if you are a fan of PA Works' titles.",

            "content": "At first I didn't have any interest in watching this anime. Probably because I disliked  the idea of 'underwater' world. Damn I was so stupid. This anime is amazing and absolutely remarkable. This anime is my #1 favorite, no kidding. It beats AnoHana and Clannad (it's my opinion tho).\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nNagi No Asukara has a very complicated drama, I must say. But is it confusing? Don't worry, it's not. Yes, it is complicated but the show won't make it that confusing to you \r\nAlthough something is bugging me. Towards the end I feel like there is a little bit of 'Ex Machina' moment. But thatdoesn't prevent me to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm out of words for the art of Nagi No Asukara. The art is so exquisite, I'm still dying to live in Nagi No Asukara world. Sometimes I paused in the middle just to stare at my screen computer in awe. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the OPs and the EDs are all pleasures to my ears. But the second OP has a special space in my heart. Funny story, in the beginning of this review I said at first I wasn't interested in watching this anime. What changed my mind is this song. I heard it on a website and I got blown away. The intro of the second OP is so beautiful. The soundtrack in Nagi No Asukara is good to and they put every single soundtrack in the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very stereotypical, that was my thought. Once again, I was wrong. The characters have their own stories, and we get to see each of them in different aspects. Each character has their own problems and in the end it all comes down together beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is for you who love drama and romance, with a little bit of fantasy. I love those 3 genres therefore I enjoy this anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Yes. Big yes. I also love the message this show left me with. 'Everyone loves someone. Sometimes the person doesn't love you back. Or maybe you do, but you just don't know. But in the end, you will end up with the person that fits you well, even that means things change and you have to let go.'\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara, one of the most innovative shows presented in the anime industry, is a story of youth and their emotional turmoils as they grow older. This story contains all the elements you could possible require of a ground breaking and masterful story.  There\u2019s romance, betrayal, guilt, jealousy, regret, grief. If you are interested in watching an anime that will leave you on the edge of your seat, then this is for you. The anime's strong point is focusing on relationships of all kinds. Not only is the story breathtaking, but the OST and the animation is truly out of this world. Youhave not watched a masterpiece until you\u2019ve watched Nagi no Asukara.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 11/10\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is impeccable. The pacing was excellently executed. I was seriously on the edge of my seat and had to watch back to back episodes. It takes a superb story to get you hooked. The first few episodes introduce the main cast of characters and instantly set the mood. You\u2019re introduced into this beautiful world where humanoid mermaids and humans live together. Although the anime never really establishes a clear history and how they came to be, it really doesn\u2019t matter as the point of the story isn\u2019t the world building. The point of this inspiring story is clear as the episodes go on. You are exposed to real life struggles and problems that the modern youth are experiencing in this day and age. The story is so incredibly captivating because of how relatable it is to the audience. What I love about this show is how it portrays real problems such as acceptance of a new family member, isolation from society, moving on from a loved one\u2019s death\u2014in a stunning manner. The emotions are all there and with the animation and soundtrack supporting this story wraps this masterpiece with a giant bow. My absolute favorite part of this anime is how the show didn\u2019t manage to drag on forever without a real plot. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t help but love the story. It had all the elements of a tragedy, and surpassed my expectations. Don\u2019t let anybody fool you; this anime is the cr\u00e8me of the cr\u00e8me. The ending of the anime was very satisfying, not leaving any room for confusion or loose ends. There are some things that some people might complain about but they just can\u2019t appreciate a true coming of age story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Shakespeare, the parallels between Hamlet and Hikari (the male lead) are a sight to behold. If I may be so bold to say, I believe Hikari surpasses Hamlet with his humanity. We see very human characteristics when we watch Hikari from episode to episode. He grows stronger as a character as the show goes on. Why do I compare him to Hamlet? It\u2019s his indecisiveness. For the majority of the show, we see Hikari\u2019s internal monologue: His jealousy, his guilt, and his motivations. It was a little frustrating at first as he never took any action but kept complaining that things weren\u2019t working out. There were times where I wanted to punch him in the face and actually do something. But this was short lived as he stepped up and became a real man. Well, eventually. Of course, the point of this story was to highlight the emotional struggles of a growing young man, so he wasn\u2019t supposed to resolve anything quickly\u2014if at all. The female lead of the series is one of the most fleshed out characters I have ever had the pleasure of watching on the screen. Manaka is a beautiful young girl who is the ideal leading lady. She is the picture of perfection and will draw in anybody watching. She is the young and helpless Ophelia who just wants to be with the man she loves. She\u2019s not a very interesting character, nor has clear motivations, but she\u2019s very pretty to look at. She\u2019s exactly what you want from an anime heroine: Pretty, shy, submissive and every boy\u2019s dream. The side characters are fleshed out to the extreme, where they all reveal that they all like each other. The most dramatic situations between them unfolds. Hikari likes Manaka. Manaka likes Tsumugu. Tsumugu likes (?). Kaname likes Chisaki. Chisaki likes Hikari. A complete full circle could not have been perfectly formulated. Not only is this a winning formula, but add in the fact that none of the characters have the confidence to confess to the person they like. This is a plethora of drama that you\u2019ll be expecting from this masterpiece show. Why didn\u2019t anybody think of something like this before? These characters were so realistic and memorable that I will forever have them in my heart.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, Soundtrack 11/10\\n\\n\r\nI decided to combine these categories because of how superb they are. Even if you didn\u2019t like the story, which is blasphemy, you will find yourself having an eyegasm with the animation and respectively an eargasm with the soundtrack. The first thing you notice while watching this anime is the quality of the animation. The animation is so clear and high quality, you\u2019ll be swept into the world of Nagi no Asukara and believe you live and walk with these characters. You\u2019ll probably even be convinced you can breathe underwater like them (Caution: do not try this at home). The episodes are all consistent and smooth, the fantastical mood for it successful. The backgrounds were very memorable and breathtaking as it would leave you curious to see more of the world. Sometimes I wished the show would focus or give us more beautiful shots of their world than these close ups of their distraught faces, but it\u2019s a very minor complaint. The soundtrack, which I\u2019m listening to while writing this, is truly one of the best in anime. The music fits the mood perfectly constantly. It complimented the story, the characters, and the animation perfectly. It\u2019s cheerful when it needs to be and it fills you with emotion in dramatic parts. The first ending song for Nagi no Asukara is one of my favorite endings of all time. I love the OST so much that I will probably continue to listen to it by itself. It\u2019s nice and calming when you\u2019re sitting back trying to relax.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 12/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I hated this anime at first. It took some passionate debating, re-evaluating my life choices, meditation and a deep look into myself to truly appreciate this story. This will be my favorite anime of all time. I\u2019ve just never watched something that impacted my life in such a unique way. The combination of winning drama, animation, soundtrack and overall enjoyment is just out of this world. I would recommend this anime over any Shakespeare play as it depicts human nature and struggles in such a realistic way. The use of a unique setting gives these stories such a nice twist, like you\u2019re looking at life in a new light, giving you a raw look at human (or humanoid merman) indecisions and struggles. The objective of this work was clear, a depiction of real life in an unrealistic setting. Many shows have tried to achieve this but failed miserably. I believe this show wins on all accounts. This unforgettable masterpiece will resonate in my heart forever. I strongly believe it will appeal to everybody, even people who don\u2019t usually watch anime. I hope this show becomes even more popular and receives recognition as the work of art that it is. I said in my intro paragraph that this anime was innovative and I stand by that whole heartedly. This is the breath of fresh air which will rejuvenate and save anime. The only issue people really have with this anime is the MC-kun\u2019s \u201cstupidity\u201d, but the same argument could be said about Hamlet\u2019s indecisiveness. Except with Hamlet, his inaction was short-lived. Unlike these long (blissful) 25 episodes. \\n",

            "content": "The first truly romance anime I've watched and it was stunning! From the animation, to the music, to the characters, they were all perfect! I really had a hard time rating this anime, because the story was a little confusing to say the least. Fortunately, after some thinking, I've finally decided on what score to give the anime in spite of it's confusing story.\r\nMINOR *SPOILER ALERT*\r\nStory: Basically the story is about sea vs land, at least until episode 12/13. The first 12-14 episodes were really confusing, especially with the hibernation and time-skip part, and I was pretty much ready to score the story a 6-7.Fortunately, the 2nd half of the anime saved the story with it's somewhat I-can-follow-the-story kind of feeling. I especially loved the ending, with Hikari and Manaka finally getting together. Speaking of love relationships, this anime is really love triangle heaven, with so many complicated love relationship clashes that I really got confused as to who liked who so I went to the MAL and Wiki site to check(and spoil myself in the process). The complicated love stories can really be made into a good movie someday if someone is brave enough to make one\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: BEST ANIMATION EVER!!!! The detailed character design, the stunning special effects, the beautiful scenery animation. Will never forget this animation and P.A Works please make another stunning animation like this for your next anime please.\\n\r\nRating: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: I LOVE the openings and endings of this anime, really beautiful and soothing. Add that to the sounds of the ocean it really relaxes a person. \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters for this anime are wonderful and they performed their roles very well, almost too well when it comes to the relationship parts\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Basically it's Hikari X Manaka X Chisaki X Kaname X Miuna X Sayu X Tsumugu, all entangled in a love relationship with each other. Although the true pairs whom I ship is Hikari X Miuna and Chisaki X Tsumugu. As for my favorite character(s), gotta be Chisaki and Miuna cuz they're beautiful! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Conclusion: I truly love this anime a lot. The best animation I've seen coupled with a very good character cast and beautiful music. My first true romance anime and well it's pretty much guaranteed that I MAY(not WILL) watch another romance anime sometime in the future. And I will definitely rewatch this anime again in the future!\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 10/10",

            "content": "One word; beautiful. The serie has been on my list for quite a while. I found it sometime at recommends from some Slice of life genre. However, when reading the details it didn't totally appeal to me. An underwater world? How in the world would they make an anime with underwater effects. Thinking it wouldn't be so great to watch I found out one of the songs I like(Ebb & Flow) was used in this animes opening. So yeh, it got me interested enough to start watching it.\r\nThe first episode, the first opening, already was surprisingly good to me. The sound and animations enhanced me.They really did a good job on creating the underwater world. The details and quality were amazing, not to forget gorgeousl colors were used. It gives you some feeling you find yourself in some magical place, which it has to represent.\\n\r\nNot only the animating, but also the sound is really good. It was mostly the music of this serie I found, which got me watching it. The opening and ending perfectly fitted into this animes theme. I also loved to hear the sea, birds or the rustling leaves during the convos. It gave some realistic thing. As for the voices, they fit the characters and their personality perfect imo.\\n\r\nThen the story itself, it started as some fantasy Slice of life with the people of the sea visiting the surface. I couldn't totally understand why you would create such circumstances. But getting deeper in the story it's all about the bonds between the underwater world and the surface. In the beginning it had a perfect pace, not too fast so the story couldn't become dull. Not too slow, it will never bore you. Although mid-season it get's some fillers, they don't seem as a filler since it fits good in the storyline.\\n\r\nAlong with the drama and romance you will experience a beautiful story in a magical setting. And that is what makes it outstanding from other animes. For a drama-fantasy-romance, with this special setting, amazing atmosphere and the elaborate effects, it seems like a perfect anime to me. If you like the slife of life / romance genre, this is a Must watch anime.",

            "content": "My expectations have been completely and utterly shattered. I was expecting a generic harem show with a slightly unusual setting (under the sea) that would serve as cheap entertainment until I came across a masterpiece that offered real enjoyment. This tale of relationships was one such show. If you are considering to take up the series, be prepared to be thrust straight into a drama-heavy, emotionally-intense and beautiful venture.\r\nStory:\r\nTake the red threads of fate of a handful of people, tangle them, tie dead knots and entangle them further. Only be satisfied once you get an excruciatingly messy ball of threads lumped together that is seeminglyimpossible to undo. There you have it: Nagi no asukara. The story depicts the lives of a group of friends who struggle with their relationships and resulting emotions. Love, jealousy, guilt and fear. They attempt to deal with these painful and conflicting emotions and the show captures their inner thoughts while they do so, making them all the more lifelike. While they do battle with their feelings, we get to see obstacles after obstacles thrown at them to further complicate matters, be it discrimination and conflict between the people of the sea and of the land, or an infuriating deity that appears to enjoy taking that which is most precious to our characters. I will reveal no spoilers about the plot, just be prepared for an emotionally-heavy ride throughout the ups and downs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe strongest selling point of the show; the characters are what makes Nagi no asukara come alive. They just seem so real, having thoughts and feelings that anyone would have if placed in that position, particularly the selfish and negative thoughts. Lets take the mc, Hikari Sakishima, for an example. I will be honest, I had considered dropping the show within the first few episodes when I saw the mc. He was rash, inconsiderate, he wasn\u2019t exactly the sharpest and certainly wasn\u2019t the most charming. His character irritated me. But, he grows. Throughout the show, Hikari actually develops and matures as a person. And watching that growth was oddly satisfying. He eventually matures to a person that is able to place the feelings of others before himself and control his emotions. How he interacts with the other characters was especially interesting to watch. I have a suggestion, knowing that this is a love drama, perhaps those intending to watch Nagi no asukara should decide on a pairing they like in the beginning and then watch to the end to see if that pairing comes to fruition. The character's relationships are exceedingly complicated and things might not just turn out they way that they appear to. The suspense and surprise is exciting, you should try it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about the visuals. Just know that the animation of this show is one of the best I have seen. The characters look splendid, especially the eyes that are unique to anime. The scenery was truly beautiful and fairytale-like. The art of the sea and the underwater village is particularly pleasing to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI am not much of a music person, I usually skip the OP and ED of shows to watch the content :p but the ending theme of the first half was soothing to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe show was definitely an enjoyable experience. I found myself enthralled by the dynamics of character relationships and development that I finished it within a short span of three days. The characters appeared so lifelike, the plot so compelling that I always had to know what happened next. And the intriguing previews didn\u2019t hurt either. However, that is not to say the show did not have its flaws. I suppose a potential issue that viewers might have would be the airy fairy depiction of love. It would seem a bit ridiculous that a childhood crush could last for several years. Or that love was always merely described as only an emotion akin to a passing crush. Another flaw could perhaps be the repetitiveness near the end. I had binge watched the series so it had gotten slightly repetitive when the characters deal with the same emotions over and over again. But those who watch the episodes in moderation should be fine. Other than these, I don\u2019t recall anything else that might ruin the enjoyment for viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nNagi no asukara has made in to my list of favorites and will be one of those shows that I will definitely remember after a while, unlike those that fade into the sea of generic anime. Those searching for something intriguing, something that evokes feelings of the viewer and a satisfying conclusion, you have found a potentially enjoyable experience. I know I have.\\n",

            "content": "I've been deciding if I should write a review for Nagi no Asukara. I asked myself, what if I get carried away? What if I give it too much credit? What if I don't credit it enough?\r\nIn the end, I realized that I had to, somehow, try to convey how amazing this anime is.\r\nStory: 8/10.\r\nI'm going to start and say that Nagi no Asukara isn't for everyone. The story is set up in a different world, where some people from the sea (not mermaids, just regular, ol' humans) left their home to live on land. The two different kinds of people became more distant afterthat separation. The story itself revolves around 4 14-year old friends who lived in the sea. They went to school on land, however, because their school in the sea had to close down. The plot then takes off as they try to acclimate themselves onto living on land. The plot may seem like it's heavily fantasy laiden - and it is - however, romance is the most prominent element in this story. If you're not into romance, Nagi no Asukara may be a turn off for you because there isn't just a love triangle, but a love decagon going on. I myself am not an avid romance-genre watcher, but I still found myself completely in love with this anime. Nagi no Asukara focuses the most on the goodness of people when it comes to their friends and those they love. Instead of showing the negative side of human nature that comes with love - envy, greed, selfishness - this anime allows the positive nature of human nature to shine instead. We see the beautiful love and sacrifices that the 4 sea children have for each other. Though the plot may be simple, there is so much more the lies just beneath the surface of the plot, which is what makes this anime so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\r\nThe very thing thing that I noticed when I first started Nagi no Asukara was art that took my breath away. The first scene immediately catches your attention, with beautiful drawn food laid out befre your eyes. Not a single detail is missed. Usually in animes, the background of the scene is neglected and half heartedly drawn. Nagi no Asukara puts that to shame. The backgrounds are all painstakingly drawn, colored, and painted to perfection - from the largest scale waves to the the the smallest detail. Each coral polyp and mountainous treae is there. I spent as much time paynig attention to the background as I would with what's happening in front of me. The background, however, is not the only aspect of Nagi no Asukara's art that should be commended.  Not only are the backgrounds drawn to precise beauty, the animation is nothing short of impressive. Focusing on just things drawn underwater alone, the animation (the movement of fish and other aquatic life) is fluid and dynamic. The colors are vibrant and contrasting, enough to compliment the palette that is introduced on the screen. This animation is truly top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAside from the forgettable opening and closing themes, the sound of Nagi no Asukara is what really moved me to tears. Instead of having a powerful and overbearing OST, with epic pieces and dramatic crescendos, the soundtrack for this anime is subtle and graceful. The notes caress you like a wave; every note is in place. The soundtrack doesn't just contain lyric-less pieces, it includes all types of music. The music matches the tone it tries to create in the scene - no, it SETS the tone itself. From deep voice chanting to delicate operatic pieces, the music is a wide arrangement that makes Nagi no Asukara so refreshing to watch. To me, the music touched me deeply. The pieces are distinct and beautifully composed. The music for Nagi no Asukara should not be taken lightly because it tells so much of the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI have to admit, that when I first started Nagi no Asukara, I didn't like half of the main characters introduced. However, my prejudice quickly fell away as the plot thickened and developed into something I could never imagine. Each characters broke the stereotypes I had against teenagers in love; in fact, they completely and successfully contradicted where I would think their actions and feelings would lead to. As I said in the story portion of my review, the characters' pureness and goodness shine radiantly. The most refreshing thing about this anime is the innocence and selflessness of each of the characters that you will come across. During 26 episode, you will experience joy, laughter, tears, and heartbreak right alongside with them. These characters are so incredible that whatever moves them will move you. Even though, as the series progresses, new characters are introduced, they are not the type of characters to be forgotten easily; rather, all of them will be part of your memory for a long time. They will be a part of you not because of how they're drawn or the words they say, but by their unsaid feelings and their sacrificial actions. Instead of some cliche romance story that you might be familiar with, Nagi no Asukara breaks away from that cliche and creates something to be contended with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved, loved this anime. I absolutely loved it. The story is a beautiful work of originality that creates something so paramount that it makes it unforgettable. It's just a memorable anime because of its unprecendented characters. The art comes no where near the animation you will see with the most popular animes. The delicate sounds brings another layer of feelings and emotions that you didn't think are possible, yet they're there and you welcome it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI mean, I think I've said it all, really. If you have another doubts about Nagi no Asukara, then let me help you out: Go and watch it. You won't be disappointed at all. :D",

            "content": "Okay, okay, yes this is one of the few anime that I believe is a 10 but there were also some cons so let me start:\r\nThe story I thought was pretty simple at first. It takes place underwater and I thought it would just be pretty calm and something to watch when I was bored but somehow, it got me hooked. Let me just say that it also changed about halfway through. I kept wanting to watch more and it seemed very original from where it took place to what was happening. The second half kind of shook me and took awhile for me toget used to but the story was still pretty good as it kept going without getting too out of hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is probably the BEST part in the anime. The way they just animate everything is beautiful. Their eyes, the towns, the ocean...it just mystifies me. It captures the setting and mood of the story and it fits for a shoujo anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing too. The opening and endings match with the drama and the music during the anime actually makes me want to listen to them outside of the anime. You actualy notice it and it adds to the sad feel to it when the time is right.\\n\\n\r\nNow...the characters. During the first half, I really liked them. I thought I had a clear thought of who was going to end up with who but then I kept changing my mind. I guess what really shook me was the second half and how the characters developed into what they did. I'm not going to spoil any more but yeah, the characters kind of confused me. \\n\r\nI really liked all of the characters though. The only problems with each one was:\\n\r\n1. Hikari was a bit too much in the first half. He always got angry so fast and it made him pretty dislikable.\\n\r\n2. Kaname was more of the side character even though he was part of the main five. I think the writers could've gone into more depth with him like the other characters. He was also sort of tossed aside by the end.\\n\r\n3. Manaka was too much of a cry baby and I really thought she could've been better than that even though it was part of he personality and all, it got pretty annoying.\\n\r\n4. Chisaki was one of my favorites but the fact that she sort of clung to _____ for such a long time made me mad. She also didn't help Manaka a lot of the time even when they were best friends. \\n\r\n5. Tsumugu didn't seem very in depth either, like Kaname. He did sort of develop in the second half but not in the way where you learn about him like  the others. His personality seemed sort of mysterious.\\n\r\n6. Miuna and Sayu...I had a lot of mixed feelings about them and I don't know why I became so irritated with Miuna in the second half and Sayu in the first. They did develop and add a pretty good prt to the story but sometimes it just seemed to make things more awkward as well. It ends up alright but they didn't get much time with the main four in the first half even though they became pretty important in the second.\\n\\n\r\nPhew, onto enjoyment. I really enjoyed it the way everything sort of came together and the first half was so sad I couldn't get over it..just like other sad animes you could think of. I kept wanting to watch because of all the good things about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I do give this anime a 10 because of all the good reasons I listed. I recommend this to anyone who likes romance, fantasy or drama because that's basically what the anime is about. It is definitely unforgettable to me.",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE REVIEW\r\nNagi No Asukara is an anime where your emotions will run all over the place. The description does not make Nagi no Asukara (Nagi for short) seem very appealing. However, do not let the summary fool you! The summary only gives you what the poster looks like. Nagi has a deep dramatic plot that will force you to continuing all 26 episodes in one go.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIn my opinion, I would say this would be a 10, however I want to stay unbias for this review. The story loses 1 point because the beginning shows a lot of what the summary provides and it isa tad bit slow. The story in the beginning goes through the generic idea of a romcom school anime. However, it will drift away from that and emphasizes on the themes of the anime. An important theme is the tension between two races. The humans of the land and the humans of the sea. The two races do the best they can to keep themselves seperate to each other. What is amazing is that the story will develop beautifully along with the characters. Another good reason the story is good is that it is hard to figure out what is going to happen in the future. There are many stories where we can make guess of how a story will progress and ends. This story is structured to where figuring out what is going to happen is a difficult task. After the first half of the anime, PREPARE TO BE AT THE EDGE OF YOUR SEATS, because you will go on a crazy roller coaster. I don't need to tell you that the story picks up speed on the second half. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\n Look at it. Nuff said. seriously though. The art is one of the most beautiful piece of work I've seen in any anime. this is probably the absolute best aspect of the entire anime. watch the anime and love the art.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:9\\n\r\nThis is just a bias opinion because I do love the opening and ending themes to this. the sounds are great but they don't appeal to me greatly. still, it is very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nthe second best aspect of the anime would be there characters. You will grow and love the characters of the story. The main protagonist, Hikari, may seem to lack the sort of personality that people would love. He is hot headed, stubborn, and he is an example of a character who looks towards his own race and no the other. however, like him and the other characters, they have shown amazing development. It is so rare to see such beautiful character development from each of the characters. this is why I give Character 10 and the development of these characters deserve it to be the second best aspect of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this anime. It might be slow to some people at the beginning, but I think it goes through a fair pace. However, the second half of the anime goes through a really huge change of pace where I get on the edge of my seat at each episode! I've watched it while it was airing and waiting for a new episode was killing me. This anime is absolutely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nThis anime gets an overall 10 because it is good for pretty much everything. the story was written well, the art is spectacular, the sound is good, the characters are amazing, and I completely enjoyed the series. \\n\\n\r\nTo close out my thoughts, I recommend this anime to anyone. it was executed really well and it portrays a good message. As people would always say, \"don't judge a book by its cover\" because this anime will go in different directions and you will see the huge difference and development from beginning to end. \\n",

            "content": "I should preface this by saying that I have seen this show multiple times, and I will try to be as impartial as possible. \r\nNagi No Asukara begins as a happy-go-lucky slice of life riddled with romance that evolves seamlessly into a dramatic (even more) supernatural drama. You come for the art, ambient sounds, and music, but stay for the character development.\r\nThe primary focus in this type of story should be to make sure your audience empathizes with the characters and I really think that this show hits the mark in that respect. Some characters are very obviously intended to be unlikable in the beginning,or visibly lack weaknesses, but each of those barriers that prevent us from empathizing with said characters is weakened as the show progresses, and when it's happening, it feels very natural. This creates a very multi-dimensional feel. As a result I could never forget Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, Kaname, Miuna, Sayu, or Akari. Each of these characters has to fight their own battles, and each of those battles feels like it has significant weight. Every single thing that happens feels like it has a real impact. You become easily emotionally invested in all of them, literally every single one (at least of the ones I've listed), and that is VERY hard to do with as many main characters as there are. \\n\\n\r\nThe art can't be described as anything but beautiful and organic, but most notable are the underwater scenes. Home to the people of the sea, Shioshishio is a town most likely inspired by the cliffside houses of Cinque Terre, Italy. As crazy as it seems to us, to live underwater, they make it feel alive and cozy. The muffled ambiance of being in the sea is so calming and immersive, and it really makes you want to live there yourself. \\n\\n\r\nLast of all, the music is my favorite out of all the shows I've seen. Each song has a specific feeling it tries to convey (tying into what's happening in the show), and I believe that they succeed in that. There really are no skippable songs on the OST. \\n\\n\r\nThis was actually the first anime that I watched where I didn't expect much. I didn't expect to get emotionally invested. I was just looking for something to watch in bed at the end of the day to wind down and have some good vibes. Boy did it prove me wrong. The pacing is perfect and there is really 0 filler. Sure there are laughs every now and then, but you will audibly gasp, you will cry, and at some points you'll just have to take a few minutes after it ends to process what just happened. Also, a plus, it has 26 episodes instead of the usual 13. \\n\\n\r\nI tried to not give this a 10, but I have to. It's my favorite show for a reason, and I will always come back to it.",

            "content": "Going to a new school is never easy.  Having to uproot your life and leave behind everything you know just to satisfy whatever reason your parents have that you\u2019re too young to understand is hardly fair for anyone, even though sometimes there\u2019s no choice in the matter.  But what\u2019s even more unfair is when your family\u2019s situation has nothing to do with it...  When your school closes down, and without a formal establishment left to provide you with an education, you have to either go to a neighboring school where you\u2019ll have the immediate disadvantage or to home school where you maynever have opportunities to see your old friends again.  this is the dilemma that\u2019s been posed to Hikari, Manaka, and their friends Chisaki and Kaname, who\u2019ve been forced to abandon their failing Nami Junior High and migrate to Mihama Middle School, and to make matters worse, they face discrimination the minute they set foot on campus...  Not because of the color of their skin or the way they speak, but because of WHERE they\u2019ve come from...  Shioshishio, the village under the sea.\\n\\n\r\nNo, that\u2019s not just a bizarre local catchphrase...  Our four heroes are basically amphibious mermaids without tails.  They can breathe with ease both in and out of the water, but need to be periodically drenched in salt water to keep themselves from dehydrating.  At Hikari\u2019s insistence, they all come to school wearing their old uniforms, a show of pride and resistance against their new day-to-day environment, which is an attitude their new classmates are all too willing to share, making comments about them smelling fishy and rejecting them as inhuman beings.  On the surface(Pun not intended), this separation could be seen as a good thing, because if a surface dweller and a sea dweller ever cross the line with each other, the latter will be banished from Shioshishio and forced to live the rest of their lives as a human, which is a curse that has become all too common in the recent past.  With vitriolic prejudice tormenting them on one side and the charms of one open-minded boy tempting them from the other, will these four fish out of water be able to balance their lives between home and school, or are both surf and turf headed for a new ice age hundreds of years in the making?\\n\\n\r\nWhile Studio Bones may be my favorite animation studio in terms of content output, PA Works is probably the best one I\u2019ve seen in terms of quality and visual consistency.  I\u2019ve commented before on how Kyoto Animation, Studio Gainax and JC Staff can put out great looking shows that break down and become really cheap looking whenever the budget gets cut too thin, but PA Works is the few where I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this happen.  I can easily say the same thing for their 2013 offering, A Lull in the Sea, because the budget doesn\u2019t really drop until the second half, and even then, it\u2019s a pretty difficult drop for the inexperienced to notice.  Visually, this series is just as teeming with life as any ocean, and this is especially clear in the ocean, where there are schools of fish swimming around through the environment, in both the background, foreground, and once in a while they even interact with the sea dwelling humans on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter animation is also crisp and fresh, with little pieces of extra effort sprinkled in here and there to make their movements underwater feel more realistic, and to make their lack of practice moving above water feel a little more awkward.  The character designs are nothing too extravagant, especially with most of the nameless adults looking more or less the same, and the only character who doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019d been pulled from the real world being the Sea God\u2019s remnant, Uroko-sama.  The kids look fairly generic, but for the most part, their personalities are so distinct that you won;t have any trouble remembering what each one looks like.  Their facial expressions are also very fluidly animated, highly expressive, and full of either youthful passion or adult stoicism, depending on the character.  I did of course mention the animation budget drops in the second half, and thankfully, there\u2019s a canonical reason for this.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil what happens halfway through the series, but what I will say is that there\u2019s a reason for the underwater setting to lose all of it\u2019s fish and most of it\u2019s people, and there\u2019s also a reason for both sea and surface to a more intensely white color palette.  The lack of underwater visual effects cannot be explained, however, but the lack of diverse expressions and extra movement can be traced back to a major shift in focus and tone, as there\u2019s just a lot less going on in the second half than there is in the first half.  More on that later, but I\u2019m pretty sure a huge chunk of the budget in the second half must have gone to the 3D visual effect of salt-flake snow falling in both the sea and surface settings.  All that aside, the point that\u2019s most worth remembering is that the series may lose some of it\u2019s flair, but it never gets so bad that it looks cheap, which is one thing you can always say for PA Works.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, for the most part, sticks to piano and string instruments, played in such a way that they almost sound like they\u2019re echoing underwater.  It\u2019s music that, for the most part, that reminds you of the sea, even if it wasn\u2019t attached to this series.  There are some exceptions, like Ofunehiki no Uta, which draws upon a fictionalized Japanese tradition, and thus falls back on a much more traditionally eastern sounding orchestration, complete with backup singers and what might be the only wind instruments in the show.  Another odd standout is Uroko Sama no Monogatari, a tune that plays around the character of Uroko-sama, and oddly enough, it almost sounds like the extended beginning to a country song.  I can\u2019t really say that it\u2019s a memorable soundtrack, and there really aren\u2019t any standouts that you\u2019d get any enjoyment out of without having the show to put them in context, but there are quite a few of them that can move you to tears if you listen to them while remembering the scenes that they were used in, especially in the case of Ofunehiki no Uta.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening, named after the anime itself, is a bit on the generic side, an upbeat pop song that you could find attached to pretty much any slice of life anime.  The visuals, on the other hand, are nothing if not stunning.  While the song fits the mold of slice of life, the video that accompanies it breaks that mold, offering a beautiful look at the two towns and their inhabitants, all while remaining consistent with the animation quality from that half of the series.  On a related note, there\u2019s water animation in this opening that could hold it\u2019s own against Free!.  The first ending theme, Aqua Terrarium, is also somewhat generic, albeit with it\u2019s visual accompaniment being lingering shots of one of Manaka motionless in the sea.  So, yeah, standard ending animation.  The second opening, Ebb and Flow, carries a much more somber tone than the first one, and it\u2019s imagery of time having passed can possibly tug at your heart strings for an episode or two, at least until you realize what direction the rest of the series is taking.  The second ending theme, Mitsuba no Musubi, is just as unremarkable as the first, albeit with an unexpected shift in art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe english dub was produced by Bang Zoom, and I just want to say off the bat that I\u2019ve been turning into a HUGE Max Mittelman fan lately.  He\u2019s still relatively new in the industry, but as I mentioned in my One Punch Man review, he deserves all of the lead roles he\u2019s already been getting.  He\u2019s playing a character who starts off angsty and confrontational, and if we\u2019re being completely honest, he\u2019s also kind of an asshole.  He develops over time to become much more reasonable and understanding, and throughout the whole process, he plays off of Michelle Ruff\u2019s Manaka(Can I call her Monica from here on?  Screw it, I\u2019m gonna anyway) beautifully.  While Monica is the target of both Hikari\u2019s aggression and later affection, she\u2019s no hapless Yamato Nadeshiko type character.  She responds to his behavior the way any actual girl her age would respond to a close friend acting like a bully, by chastising him for being aggressive and threatening to stop hanging out with him if he doesn\u2019t cool it.  They become much stronger characters by the halfway point, and the actors have more than enough chemistry to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t speak as glowingly about the rest of the main four, as Kaname and Chisaki aren\u2019t quite as interesting as their floundering friends.  They\u2019re not unlikeable characters...  At least, not at first...  But it\u2019s hard to describe them outside of their looks and their positions inside of the show\u2019s love polygon.  Brianna Knickerbocker and Bryce Papenbrook perform admirably in these roles, but still feel quite underused.  Xanthe Huynh and Erica Mendez have a much more rewarding turn as Miuna, a little girl from a damaged home, and Akari, the woman who\u2019s found herself tied by fate to Miuna\u2019s single father.  Their efforts to overcome prejudice and unchecked emotional turmoil in order to come together as a family is one of the biggest driving forces of the first half of the series, a fact that wasn\u2019t lost on either actress, who put out some of the most genuine, raw emotion out of the show\u2019s entire cast.  Chris Hackney also does a commendable job as Tsumugu, a land-living boy who finds himself drawn into Hikari\u2019s group of friends.  He\u2019s not the first actor to give a stoic character personality, but he still pulls it off pretty damn well.  There aren\u2019t very many standout performances over-all, but it\u2019s still a solid dub that\u2019s more or less on equal footing with the original sub.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, A Lull in the Sea may appear to be another slice of life romantic comedy, with it\u2019s only distinction being  it\u2019s neo-little-mermaid gimmick.  Thankfully, the writers waste no time whatsoever establishing that there are real themes at play here, and that they\u2019re timeless themes to boot.  At the beginning of the series, the people of the land and the people of the sea are not on good terms whatsoever.  I\u2019ve seen plenty of fictional allegories for racism in my day, and while most of them amount to angry strawmen claiming \u201cWe round people shouldn\u2019t be getting mixed up with them circle people\u201d to the Disney version of Pocahontas sporting a song that blatantly states \u201cThey\u2019re not like you and me, which means they must be evil,\u201d Lull takes a much more thorough approach.  The differences between the sea people and the surface people has some serious depth to it, as it exists not only in real time, but stretching back throughout their long term geographicly close relationship with one another.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s true that the setting does feel a bit underdeveloped, and the idea of an undersea village living as neighbors to a realistic, modern land village does bring up a lot of questions that never get answered, these flaws in world-building are easily over-shadowed by just how uncanny the plot\u2019s resemblance to real life social issues can be.  with the exception of the Sea God\u2019s backstory, every single social injustice we see in this series can be drawn as a parallel to an issue that either occurs or used to occur in real life.  The idea of middle and even high school students instantly rejecting and tormenting other students for the simple crime of being different has been happening since the dawn of time.  It\u2019s practically a rule of being adolescent, regardless of how adult international relationships may or may not be influencing it.  For some minorities to want to rebel against this discrimination by being confrontational and having a bad attitude while others try to be on their best behavior in order to fight stereotypes through pacifism, and even for these two sects to clash with each other, is also disturbingly relevant to race relations in any society that\u2019s managed to diversify itself.  This is in stark contrast to Japan, a racially homogenous nation where this series oddly takes place.\\n\\n\r\nHarking back to Hikari\u2019s sister Akari(yes, those two names are put together in anime far, far too often), she originally had a job on the surface, until it was revealed that she was in love with her single father boss, and was harboring an intent to marry him.  She was rejected outright from both sides, with her boss\u2019s daughter not wanting the union to take place for certain spoiler reasons, but she was especially contested by her own people, including her father, because of a village rule stating that anyone who fell in love with a land lubber would never be allowed in the sea again.  It\u2019s later revealed that the legend of the Sea God was behind this rule, but even if he wasn\u2019t, this attitude still rings true today, as there are tons of parents out there who would rather die than see their offspring wind up in a relationship that might compromise their heritage.  Hell, one of my favorite scenes occurs long after the children have already put their differences aside, and the adults from both sides are coerced into a negotiation over a necessary ritual, which goes great until both sides start demanding apologies over perceived injustices of the past, an argument that almost becomes violent before the who kerfuffle is blamed on the kids, suggesting that racial differences are harder to get over for the older generation than the younger one.\\n\\n\r\nIf I hadn\u2019t made it obvious to you by now, the two biggest recurring themes in this show(at least the interesting ones) and prejudice and desegregation, themes that are told primarily from the point of view of four sea-dwelling middle schoolers trying to fit in at a surface-dwelling school, but when you take a step back from them, you can see the issue from the perspectives of the human kids, the hopeful teacher, the adults who\u2019ve lived through issues the kids can\u2019t fully understand, the young star-crossed lovers and more.  All of these different perspectives, almost all of  which are realistic and relevant to the viewer in their own way, give the series a sense of depth and complexity that most slice of life shows can never even hope to reach.  Characters grow and develop as their minds become more open and their hearts become more accepting, and yeah, even the bullies become likeable through the course of the story.  There\u2019s a sprinkling of developing crushes to add some spice to the main cast, but it takes a back seat to more important plotlines.  All of this leads to a climax that\u2019s equal parts inspiration and tragedy, and an ending that will have you crying your eyes out...  Halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this is pretty much where my praise of A Lull in the Sea ends, and the ravaging must begin.  I\u2019m going to try my best not to spoil the climax of episode 13, as I do believe everyone should be able to experience it blindly for themselves, but I will reveal some...  stuff, from the second half, so here\u2019s your warning.  If I didn\u2019t think it was important to talk about, I wouldn\u2019t be spoiling it.  For example, there\u2019s the fact that episode 14 starts off with a five year time skip.  One of our four main characters has aged naturally, but the other three are still 14, through some means I don\u2019t feel like explaining.  Considering how the first half ended, this isn\u2019t the worst way to continue the series, and there is some potential for the story to develop under these circumstances, but here\u2019s the problem...  The racial tension, by this point, has been completely resolved.  The people making the show must have realized they\u2019d written themselves into a corner, and the only way to continue was to abandon all the depth of the first half and instead focus on the love-polygon, which quickly becomes a love-dodecahedron.\\n\\n\r\nGoing forward, a lot of dumb decisions are made to get the writers out of their corner, but the one that instantly had me doing the hardest head-desk of my life was when, in a flash-back, we hear nine year old Miuna getting jealous over Hikari, a character she\u2019d never shown any special affection for throughout the first half.  I did the math on the time skip, and guessed on the spot that this show was about to rely on one of the creepiest, unrealistic, sexist ideas that anime has ever come up with.  To get a vague yet still accurate picture of what I\u2019m talking about, picture Keitaro Urashima, the boy who\u2019s pursuing a girl he knew from his childhood.  Now, instead of a male character falling back on a memory because he can\u2019t get a girlfriend through any other means, picture a female character who COULD get a boyfriend, but refuses to because she\u2019d rather end up an old maid than betray some dude she hada crush on as a child.  It\u2019s bad, and a lot of anime do it, but most anime don\u2019t go the extra mile of using a time skip to make the girl and her old friend the same age so it\u2019ll be okay.  Only it\u2019s not, because it\u2019s still creepy.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and it gets worse...  Her friend, the mischievous moppet Sayu, falls in love with another 14 year old because...  Get this...  He patted her on the head and called her a good girl.  Ooh, scandalous, right?  That has to be the most laughable catalyst for an \u201cI WILL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER\u201d that I have ever heard.  I wish I could go into deeper spoilers, but I\u2019ve already said too much, so let\u2019s summarize this:  The second half of the anime exists for two reasons.  first of all, it exists to explore and conclude the love dodecahedron, which it doesn\u2019t, and it also exists to ret-con the conclusion of episode 13 so that the series can end on a happier note, which...  Unfortunately...  is executed in a very fanficcy way that tears a massive plot hole in the lore of the story.  Basically, the entire second half of the anime didn\u2019t need or deserve to exist, especially since the first half ended on the perfect note, a beautiful tragedy that warranted no farther than one epilogue episode to wrap things up.  You came close, Lull...  You came close.\\n\\n\r\nA Lull in the Sea is available stateside from NIS America, which of course means it\u2019s ridonkulously expensive.  Luckily, it\u2019s also available in both dub and sub form on Crunchyroll for subscribers.  The original manga by Project - 118 is not available stateside, nor is the follow-up four-panel manga from the same writer.  Personally, I recommend the Crunchyroll subscription, if you can afford it.  I had to cancel mine after paying 1000 dollars on a car bill, but then again, i\u2019m an old ass adult.  Subscribe with your parents\u2019 money, kids!\\n\\n\r\nA Lull in the Sea is kind of like The Big O...  I fell in love with the first half, and then found my jaw dropping farther and farther to the floor as what was previously awesome and enjoyable became huge disappointments once they got over the hump.  Also like Big O, I wish to God that MAL would separate the two halves into their own entries, so that I could judge them separately instead of lumping them together.  Why does the second half of this show exist?  What was the point of it?  I\u2019m not going to sit here and stream the manga, so I have no idea how well this show holds up against it, but if they did the second half just for accuracy, then maybe they should have broke away from the source material and found a way to end it with episode 4.  None of these love interests needed to be resolved, which...  Oh, by the way, they weren\u2019t.  Nor did the perfect ending, which happened at the show\u2019s halfway point, need to be repeated under dumber circumstances to force a happy ending.  This show could have been good.  It should have been good.  Yeah, a bad first half can be saved by a good second half, but a bad second half can destroy a good first half.  This is a damn shame.  I give A Lull in the Sea a 5/10.",

            "content": "Alright, let's just get this over with...\r\nThe story (7) takes place in two towns; the one in the sea, and the one on the surface. Four of the main cast are from the sea but since their school closed, they go to school on the surface and endure the trials of discrimination because people are a**holes, but that isn't anything new. The fifth member of their melodrama band is a kid from the surface with a personality that is less than a square. But I'll get to that later. The idea of a town underwater was a good one, but it wasn't as expanded onas it could have been. It was just kind of there, like mostly everything in this anime, as a plot device to somehow prolong the drama to make a full 26 episode show. No, longer does not always mean better, but since the second half wasn't bad, just unnecessary, I'll deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's just talk about that ending! (I'm not spoiling anything, don't worry)\\n\r\nThe reason the anime's rating as a whole was so low is probably because of how it ended. Nothing was really tied up (except the hatred between the two sides and the sea people's hibernation) and it felt rushed. I'm not sure how an ending of an anime with so many slow and boring scenes could be rushed, but it was. None of the characters get with the person they were crushing on and it fell pretty flat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did like was the fact that they added in the discrimination and the drama between the two towns. You could feel the tension when both were on screen. The way the characters took the discrimination made sense as well. Also, the pacing was okay, although it was so god awfully slow at times that some of the episodes never felt like they were going to end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (10) was the best part about this anime. The animation was gorgeous. It was bright and colorful and the water was done beautifully. P.A. Works proved themselves yet again.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound (8) was very good too, although the two opening and endings are worthy of hitting the skip button. The songs were mostly light piano pieces that really helped set the mood. Yes, some songs were played a lot more than others but I liked the songs, so no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (5)\\n\r\nNow, here's where the most complaints will come from. The drama was so over the top and the crying never stopped that I just wanted to take out my earbuds, set down my phone and do something else with my life. The romance, or lack thereof, never got tied up and, honestly, most of the characters were annoying. There was little to no character development and in a show like this, you kind of need it. Let's go down the character roster, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTsumugu - This is that personality-less square I mentioned early. The only one born on the surface that wants so desperately to live with the sea folk. He's not really there for anything more than a plot device for our dear Manaka to like and stir up drama. I liked him better in the second arc, although his character doesn't change. He annoyed me the most because he rarely said anything and when he did it was emotionless. Some of the lines came across as funny that way but for the most part he was a static, flat character. At least he was the only one that didn't succumb to crying.\\n\\n\r\nChisaki - She spent most of the time debating on who she liked and cried a good majority of it. Again, little to no character development, although she gets props for (kind of) choosing a man in the end.\\n\\n\r\nKaname - Honesly, I was surprised he got any screen time. At first, I figured he was just going to be that one character that fits the role of the 'fifth friend.' He even said that he was the odd man out, and it was mostly true. Although he was interesting because he was level headed and also had some character development in the end, he was mostly just there for a plot device to confuse Chisaki.\\n\\n\r\nManaka - She was the cute little girl that had something happen to her that was supposed to give her character development but did nothing but cause more tears from the main character.\\n\\n\r\nHikari - The mainest of main characters, who hardly changes at all. It was sad, watching him never really change. Yes, he began to accept the surface people but other then that, he stayed the same. The way he acted and the way he felt never strayed from how he began. He never stopped loving the same person though, so props to that.\\n\\n\r\nSayu and Miuna - The latter is Hikari's sister. Nothing changes with her either. She comes to terms in the end, but thats it. Sayu is Miuna's best friend and she actually got development. *applauds* She goes from kind of a jerk to totally in love with a certain character, and I can see that relationship actually fairing out.\\n\\n\r\nNo other characters are really worth mentioning. They were the biggest disappointment because in a show like this, they are the most important.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment is an 8 because although the drama was over the top and irritating, and sometimes I was so mind-numbingly bored that I just wanted to quit, I did like it enough it get through it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: boring + melodramatic underwater hellhole = SeaWorld (no offense to those who actually enjoy watching animals doing tricks in cages)",

It is necessary for us to grow and evolve, even when we don't want it. Nagi No Asukara (\u51ea\u306e\u3042\u3059\u304b\u3089\uff09was a show that was overlooked by a large portion of people at the time of its airing. At face value, it looks like the typical slice of life anime but hidden underneath is a show that tells a heartfelt coming of age story of children who face the scary reality of growing up. Likeany anime, things are heavily exaggerated but the emotions expressed in the show are ones that all of us have encountered at one point in our lives.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a fantasy world where the people are divided in to two groups: the people of the land and the people of the sea. We follow the adventure of a group of 5 children from the the sea as they begin their new school lives at a middle school located on the land village Shioshishio. The two factions (the people of the land and the people of the sea) have been at odds for quite some time, and the discrimination shown by both groups is a common point of conflict throughout the show. The show contains subplots of romance/drama, which only complicates the conflict our main characters have as the show progresses. The series is split into two arcs, the first arc spanning episodes 1-13 and the second arc episodes 14-26. From the two, the second arc presents a much more serious tone as the anime dives deep into the characters' emotions after a major event that occurs at the end of the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIf only I could rate this higher. This series is animated by P.A.Works, a company known for their beautiful animations and settings. You immediately are taken by the beautiful scenery in episode 1 and I believe gets betters as the anime goes on. The characters are well drawn and have a good design, and the amount of detail put in to this is astonishing. Nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this anime. What makes the scenes so powerful and emotional in this anime is the OST. Each track is composed beautifully and they are placed in at the right time to the have the greatest effect on the viewer. You could listen to each individual track and you would love each and every one of them. The OP and ED for both the first and second arc are probably the best openings I've seen and heard. They both match the theme of each arc perfectly and is animated beautifully. The first OP is very light hearted and happy, which relates to the beginning, but then the second OP has a much sadder tone to it, emphasizing the seriousness of the second arc. It's just a very good OST.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are very good. All, except maybe with the exception of two(Manaka and Tsugumu), always develops every episode. One thing NagiAsu did right was develop the side characters as well. You get to see everyone grow and and change throughout the course of the story. I can't say much more about the characters, as it might spoil the anime, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime as every episode aired, but some episodes were just so packed with dialogue that it got boring on some parts. If if you aren't a fan of dialogue-heavy shows, I would recommend skipping this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, Nagi no Asukara was a fantastic anime. Almost everything was done right and the story kept you intrigued and interested the whole entire way. You really grow close to some characters and the way the show deals with deeper subjects is handled quite well, aside from the high school drama that is mixed in. This anime was overlooked and brushed over when it was airing, so if you happened to miss it back in 2013, I HIGHLY recommend watching this now, because you won't regret it.\\n",

            "content": "So I actually finished watching this anime around a half a year ago, which means I am not writing this anime at the time of my \"honeymoon\" phase (meaning I just finished it and loved it so much that therefore may make my review bias). One thing I have to say about this show is how well they wrote the story. Nagi No Asukara sets us a story of conflict between the people of the sea and land. Throughout the show we see that Hikari and his friends are accepted by some and discriminated by others. As if this conflict is not enough, we laterfind out theres this giant love triangle (more like a love octagon) going on which makes it that much more conflicting and dramatic (some of us may find this part of the show a bit cheesy). Despite that, I felt like they handled each relationship/friendship quite well in this anime as they experience jealousy and unrequited love, both which are relatable in the real world. We are also shown how different each character handles jealousy and unrequited love, as we have people like Hikari who clearly shows his jealous personality while we have Chisaki who is humble and hides her feelings for the sake of her friends. Or maybe Tsumugu, a person who is not afraid to show his feelings but at the same time is mature about it. What really sets this show apart from other dramas though is the fact they bring in the concept of a generation gap. Even when time passes, will your love always be the same? Or will you move on with life and find someone else? Are they allowed to like someone of the other \"race\"? These are the questions that are presented to us throughout the show and can be closely related to some of us as in real life. \\n\r\nEven after half a year I still can not seem to find a flaw within this anime that really stuck out to me. I felt like each character had value within the show and served a good purpose to both the theme and the plot. People may dislike a certain character's personality/behavior within this anime, but thats only because thats who they are and thats their purpose within the story. \\n\r\nOverall I actually give this anime a 10/10 mainly because of personal enjoyment and my strong connection towards this anime and its characters outshines the small, small flaws (if any). \\n",

We see the sea, with waves that are peaceful at one point but raging at another. The energy contained within the sea is a perfect representation of the feelings that Nagi no Asukara delivered.\r\nAn oceanic, fantasy setting dividing the land and sea is the place where the characters were introduced at. It's quite a fascinating concept as most anime that I'm aware of at this point took place on land. We follow a group of childhood friends as they attended a school on the surface,and this commenced the start of the story focusing on various aspects. Many of the plot revolved around the unsteady relationship between the people of the sea and land, as well as the history between those two environments. I'd say the fantasy aspect wasn't handled as well as it can be because there were some confusing explanations. One thing that Nagi no Asukara managed to do was to effectively stir up emotions within me from the characters' feelings. It can be a bit melodramatic at times, but I can feel their emotions as they experienced family drama or complex love relationships. Just as I said in the introduction, the feelings change just like the waves from the sea. You can definitely feel as the atmosphere transitioned from joyful to something more uneasy. While the characters can be annoying at first, they developed really well towards the end which is nice to see after everything they've gone through. Everyone had a purpose in the story and no one felt left out.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I find it really pleasant to see that the art was just as breathtaking as the sea itself. I'm not much of a sea person, but from the few times I've gone to the beach, I know how beautiful the sea can be. Definitely can say that this portrayal was from the astounding efforts that P.A Works did to give a memorable visual for the anime. From the undersea village where marine creatures swims by to the modern town atop the surface, the sceneries were attractive to look at. I really loved the cute character designs too which made me feel more attached to them. As for the voice-acting, the annoying first glance from the characters that I've mentioned partially comes down to the way they talked but I warmed up pretty quickly, especially during emotional scenes and after they've matured. There were many OSTs that contained happiness or sadness but what they all have in common is how soothing they all sound to my ears and how much they hit me right in the feels. All these gave more impact to the emotions, making a lot of scenes more meaningful to me.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, there were some issues that Nagi no Asukara had but this anime is still as wonderful as the sea. The anime encaptured many powerful feelings as they were awash by the waves, with an enjoyable cast of characters and a high quality in audiovisuals.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is a series that pushes your imagination with fantasy and supernatural plotlines, but keeps you rooted in reality through its impressive cast and character development. Furthermore, this series is extremely unpredictable because the characters undergo tremendous development that completely changes the way they think and love.\r\nThe story takes place in an underwater city and centers around a group of 4 kids. After the underwater school closes down, the kids are forced to go to school on the surface, where they meet new people that change their lives forever.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nI love fantasy storylines, as long as they're not too farfetched. Surprisingly, the wholeconcept of sea dwellers living in the ocean doesn't feel strange because the characters move, think, and feel like any other characters on land. The story has several subplots that revolve around the Sea God's will against humanity. The story can be extremely slow at certain parts, but ramps up speed at an alarming rate. Since there are essentially 5 main characters and 2 added main characters later on, it can be frustrating when the character(s) you want to see get less screen time in various episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10/10\\n\r\nThe art and oceanic feel push the boundaries of anime animation. The attention to detail and focus on creating a nostalgic feeling of change are so powerful in this series. The parallel between the surface and the sea is brought to life through this impressive display of art and sound production. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe character development is the heart of this series. There are 5 main characters and 2 characters become major characters later on. There's so much going on with each character and their thoughts and emotions are developed immensely as the story progresses. From love pentagons to accepting change, you're taken through the struggles of each character, and its amazing to see how realistic the characters become in this supernatural series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThis series has its ups and downs. Throughout the story, there is a somber and nostalgic feel that sometimes makes the series seem slow and difficult to watch. At other times, the series speeds up and the episodes fly by. It felt as though some of the plotlines dragged on for a long time, and the series really takes its time when it wants to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a great series to watch if you like unpredictable love pentagons and don't mind a slowly progressive storyline. The visuals and artwork make this at least worth trying out a few episodes.",

            "content": "--- CAUTION! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS! ---\r\nI don\u2019t know what I was expecting based on the synopsis when I started watching Nagi no Asukara, but I sure didn\u2019t expect this. \r\nOf course, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be dark and mysterious like some other anime, but I never knew I would wind up watching slice of life - one of the genres I avidly avoid because my action-longing heart just can\u2019t take it. Or, maybe I\u2019m too immature. Whatever. \r\nIn brief, at the start, Nagi no Asukara seemed to be just a slice of life with a little bit of fantasy and toomuch romance in it. Something that made me want to bang my head on the table. I support that, still, but only for half of the anime. But, let me elaborate on that in a less confusing way. So, as tradition goes, let us start with the story element. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m going to do for this review, in particular for this story part, is divide the anime into two parts. Part one, episodes 1 - 12 and part two, episodes 13 -  26. I have to do this because the parts are vastly different in many aspects. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with part 1. As I said before it\u2019s a slightly boring slice of life with a little bit of supernatural in it - there are some people who live in the sea. This causes some minor complications such as prejudice, getting a fish in your knee and Ena drying up. \\n\r\nThere were also some interesting but seemingly useless plot line points such as the preparations for the Ofunehiki which felt like plain filler. Well, not exactly in that sense - I felt like they were trying to use that to establish character relations, which may be a good thing, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was abundant in this anime was romance, so I will be focusing on this a lot. Whilst I did like it some of the time, the thing is that it was plain annoying the rest of the time. Right from the first episode a guy in my anime club said, and I quote, \u201cThose damn love triangles.\u201d And that\u2019s from the first episode. \\n\r\nIn truth, it\u2019s waaaaay past love triangles. As I like to say, love pentagons, but it\u2019s actually love heptagons. Seriously. All the characters have some ties in between them, drawing a complex web. It\u2019s very, very annoying, and I hate it. It had me bashing my head on the table and exclaiming \u201cSeriously?!\u201d more times than I can count, especially at times when nine year-old girls fall in love with fourteen year-old boys at first (okay, okay, maybe second) sight. That, I cannot accept.\\n\r\nThere was also an overload of mush in both parts. Characters talking about their complex feelings for other characters which just plain pissed me off. \\n\r\nSometimes, the romance did lead to other points - such as the apparent tabou of sea/surface relations - but once again, tastes like filler, not entirely, but mostly. Not that I\u2019m complaining though, because in the end, it does serve to something, I guess.\\n\r\nTo finish off my rant on how I hate romance, I\u2019ll say this: it wasn\u2019t all bad. Some parts were cute. I admit it. *tsundere style* But it\u2019s not like I enjoyed it or anything\u2026 \\n\r\nOverall, I found the first part of Nagi no Asukara a slice-of-life anime, which however has some complications coming up. I wasn\u2019t forcing myself to watch it, but the first episode didn\u2019t quite meet my expectations, and it didn\u2019t contain any of what I call the OMG factor. This is the thing that leaves you hanging at the end of one episode and you just have to see the next. \\n\\n\r\nOn the the second part. This is where things take a drastic change for the better. It suddenly acquired a good dose of mystery and thus OMG factor.\\n\r\nFirstly, it\u2019s not really slice of life anymore. It has more of the supernatural element in it and whilst the love heptagons still stand, I guess it\u2019s not as bad. It was great seeing some of the characters grown up. \\n\r\nThis was far more interesting because, as I just said, it abandoned the slice of life part, and added a little bit of mystery, I daresay. There\u2019s the whole element of the forced hibernation and the snow and all that. It is great when characters start reappearing again, but I find it a little weird that of course it\u2019s the main protagonists who show up. Why not the others? But then again, that would probably lead to some more wasted episode time.\\n\r\nEpisode thirteen is pretty much a bridge between the two parts, and it did get more interesting. I have a few complaints on the clich\u00e9-ness of the show which I just have to mention here, because I hated how Manaka offered to be the Ojoushi-sama. That \u2018unexpected\u2019 heroism has been done about a thousand times before. \\n\r\nBack to the topic. Whilst the general plot of the second part was a lot more interesting (incidentally I won\u2019t elaborate on it much because I would have to recount the whole story), it still had several issues. One was the Ena. I swear, suddenly all the characters have it. Just jump in the sea and almost drown to get free Ena. \\n\r\nAnother issue was that Miuna became the main character. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Miuna, but she became really annoying, especially how she keeps thinking about her love with Hikari and how he doesn\u2019t love her back and yadda yadda yadda tears and torment etcetera. I understand she is in love with Hikari, that was decided in the first part, but she just became so annoying with her thoughts that I felt like either shouting at her to shut up (or stop thinking) or slap her. Of course, I could do neither, so I bashed my head on the table instead.\\n\r\nThe final issue is the romance - it hasn\u2019t changed much. Hikari is overly obsessed with Manaka. Almost all the girls are in love with Hikari. No one but Sayu loves Kaname, who in turn feels like a third wheel (hahahahahaha third wheel). Everyone doesn\u2019t realise that someone else loves them because they are too obsessed with someone else. There is a general soppiness and love tangle, but not as bad compared to the first part. \\n\r\nThere also was one point where I just smacked myself on the forehead because pretty much the same thing was going on as in an earlier episode, but I won\u2019t elaborate for sake of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise the plot part in general, I feel as if I have been too sarcastic. Whilst it may not be exactly the genre that I like, it was slow-paced at the start and I found myself exclaiming \u201cSeriously?!\u201d a number of times, the plot was quite good, very sweet and funny at times (I laughed a fair bit), sometimes, especially in the second part, I felt very strongly about certain things. All in all, I did not force myself to watch it by any means. I really cannot decide on what I feel about the story. At the start, it wasn\u2019t so great, but I really enjoyed the second bit. I give the first part a 6 and the second an 8, which makes an average of 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt was really high quality - the animation was good, scenery was absolutely beautiful, characters as well. I absolutely loved the eyes. Some of the characters were so cute! It also fitted the context.\\n\r\nI was impressed with the art and thoroughly enjoyed it - for this, I give it 9.5. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, I don\u2019t have all that much to say about sound. It was good, and although I would have loved to hear more music, the music that was there was beautiful. Some of the themes were quite emotional. \\n\r\nOne thing that did bug me was some of the voices. Like how Miuna\u2019s voice is deeper than Akari\u2019s, who is an adult. But, since it does happen in real life (kind of), I\u2019ll let it slide. I really hesitate between 8 and 9, so to avoid too many decimals, I'll give it a 9, because I really did love the music.\\n\\n\r\nOn to characters. \\n\r\nCharacter development was very good. I feel like I got to know a bit about every character. Nevertheless, I feel like I just can\u2019t put my finger on some of the characters. Like if someone asked me to describe Chisaki\u2019s or possibly Kaname\u2019s character, I wouldn\u2019t be entirely sure what to say. For this reason, I just can\u2019t be 100% happy. Also, I didn\u2019t develop a favourite character until much later in the show, which isn\u2019t a very good thing.\\n\r\nAnother problem was how the characters were a little too similar. This isn\u2019t entirely true, but sometimes I just felt like they possessed too many similar traits.\\n\r\nThe final issue for me with the characters was Manaka. She was cute and nice and all, but I just could not stand her childishness.\\n\r\nMaking sure to include the positive things, let me say that I did feel quite strongly for the characters after a while. For instance, I was dying to see Hikari cry, for some reason. I also think I understand why all girls are falling for him. :3\\n\r\nI would give characters an 8 because they were quite good, and I liked them (in general), however I feel as if they could have been so much better. Because of this, I lower the score to a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wasn\u2019t all that high at first, I would give it a 6 or a 6.5, because as I said, it was a slice of life, and there was so much fluff that sometimes I felt as if I was eating cotton balls. However, the second part was much better, and I enjoyed it a lot. I watched quite a few episodes in a row every night and couldn\u2019t wait to get home from school to keep watching. Once, I even watched an episode at school. I would put enjoyment at a 7.5.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, to sum up everything I said in this review:\\n\r\nThis anime wasn\u2019t quite up to scratch for the first twelve episodes, being very slow-paced and sometimes a little melodramatic in my opinion, and there were a few clich\u00e9 elements, but after that the story became much more interesting. The romance was a little bothersome considering there were so many love triangles I was bashing my head on the table, but it wasn\u2019t all bad. Characters had good potential and good development but could have been better. Art and sound were great, but I wish there was a little more music. Enjoyment went up with the plot line. I\u2019m glad I watched this anime, and I enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10  \\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nA/N: I was actually originally planning to give this a 7, (and actually still think that maybe I should do so) but after having to rewatch a few episodes because my internet was really slow so it kept pausing every 5 seconds, I was surprised to realise that I actually liked it more than I had originally thought. \\n\r\nThank you to animele220! It is thanks to youthat I found out about this anime! *clap clap*\\n\\n\r\nOh, and thanks to all who take the time to press 'Helpful' or 'Not Helpful'. If you have some time on your hands and pressed the 'Not Helpful' button, please comment on how I can improve my reviews! :3\\n",

The animation / art style done by P.A. Works with the water is outstanding. The show is completely BLUEtiful and there are some scenes that are just straight up gorgeous. With so many characters in the show, each character gets amazing development, thus leading to amazing attachment to the characters. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack this show has, which I can not get myself to stop listening to. The transition from the ending of an episode to the endingis extremely beautiful and catchy.The romance in this show is done very well and can sometimes lead to happy moments, and sometimes lead to very dramatic moments. Though the story may seem like it starts off very slow at first, I took it a little casual. Halfway through, about ep. 13, I was hooked with the suspenseful plot and had to marathon it. This show is definitely a 10/10, and it is at the very least, a must-watch.",

            "content": "To describe this anime with a word, it would have to be \"breathtaking\". Nagi no Asukara, or Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea is a heartwarming tale about breaking the limitations of society and going against what is commonly believed in. While the story may seem similar to many other titles, Nagi-Asu takes an alternate method of telling it, by taking the perspectives of a wide but extremely charming cast of characters and allowing us as viewers to experience the thoughts, emotions, and values that each character holds so dear. \r\nVisually and audibly, Nagi-Asu does not disappoint, with stunning backgrounds and a beautiful soundtrack, furtheradding to the appeal of the anime. From the very first episode, the artwork of Nagi-Asu can easily be compared to those of a photograph, providing an \u00fcber-realistic representation of the supernatural setting, which allows viewers to truly immerse themselves in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you haven't yet, drop whatever you're doing and go watch Nagi-Asu, as an experience like this doesn't appear very often. \\n\\n\r\nJust sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be immersed in the breathtaking masterpiece that is Nagi no Asukara.",

I've watched hundreds of anime over the years that were mediocre and filled the anime craving in my soul - but Nagi no Asukara was what I'd really been looking for. \r\nWhat really makes Nagi no Asukara stand out are two main things. The first is the outstanding artwork and character development. The scenery porn in this anime is unbelievable and will have you gazing into the background of the main focus many times. On top of that, Nagi no Asukara's character development was extremely fulfilling and there was a strong sense of completeness inthe journey the viewer goes through in watching the characters develop. The second stand out reason that Nagi no Asukara is a must watch is the connection it shares with the world we currently live in. With the future of our planet being called into question with issues like Climate Change, rising sea levels and the impact it will have on future generations - Nagi no Asukara really hits home with a relevant and important message. \\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara will have you smiling, laughing, crying and yelling at your screen throughout all 26 episodes. As someone who couldn't stop the episodes from playing and binge watched all 26 episodes in a 24 hour period - give this anime a chance and it will fill your soul.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara was by far the most unexpectedly amazing show I've ever seen. The shaky first episodes made me think about dropping it, and I'm really glad I didn't. It's a spectacular show, and without a doubt the best romance anime I've ever seen.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nHere's the plot synopsis, if you haven't read it:\r\n\"Long ago, all humans lived in the ocean. But some who longed for the land abandoned the ocean, casting off the special raiments granted to them by the sea god to adapt them to life under the sea...\r\nThough mankind was divided into sea dwellers and land dwellers, each with different ways ofthinking, they were all still fellow humans, and they continued to maintain contact as time went on.\\n\\n\r\nSakishima Hikari, Mukaido Manaka, Hiradaira Chisaki, and Isaki Kaname live in an undersea village, while Kihara Tsumugu lives on land.\\n\\n\r\nWhen these middle school second-year land and sea dwellers meet for the first time, their hearts begin to undulate like the tides.\\n\\n\r\nThe youthful fantasy tale of these young people's lives unfolds in a strange and beautiful world.\"\\n\\n\r\nBasically, a small group of children from an undersea village called \"Shishishio\" begin to attend school on the land. They possess \"Ena\", which allows them to breathe underwater. The show follows each of these people, and has some interesting twists and turns throughout the way. The story is something new and interesting, and it is for the most part very good. However, it's far from perfect. There were times, especially during the end of the show, where it felt like the story wasted a lot of its potential. It's hard to explain in detail without spoiling it, so I won't try. Basically, the story is good but isn't the best thing about the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with P.A Works, you already know what this show is going to look like. The art, especially the backgrounds, is absolutely spectacular. The underwater setting led to some of the most beautiful backdrops I've ever seen in anime. If you're into watching shows for the art, look no farther than NagiAsu. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've given the soundtrack a few listens, and it's extremely good. Dewa Yoshiaki does a great job, and the music complements both the emotional and cheerful scenes almost perfectly. The cheerful music is pretty repetitive though, which I think is something I only noticed because I replayed the soundtrack over and over. Overall, excellent sound design.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Nagi no Asukara are developed masterfully. The main character, Hikari, starts as an insufferable prick and becomes increasingly interesting as the show goes on. The same can be said for most of the other characters. There are, of course, a few exceptions. There is one character who is important to the story and doesn't change at all throughout, and a lot of the characters can grate on you and get annoying at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara struck a lot of chords with me, and I enjoyed it immensely. The fantastic presentation always kept the show interesting, and the story was interesting enough to have me coming back every week wanting resolution. As stated previously, the characters can be annoying, which kept my enjoyment from a 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance anime that's more than a little out of the ordinary, then Nagi no Asukara will be a great watch.",

            "content": "\"Love is like the sea.\"\r\n          Love stories have existed for practically the entire existence of storytelling. They've been told countless times, in countless ways, with countless settings and characters. From the grand and epic quests to silly school rom-coms, the love story is the most enduring story of fiction, and even non-fiction in some cases. With that in mind, one would think that original ideas, or even ideas that haven't grown stale, are quite lacking in this genre. So, how does today's anime stand in therankings of the great love stories?\\n\\n\r\n          Before we get into the romance aspects of this anime, I want to briefly recognize the intense amount of world building that went into this anime. Every ounce of exposition was weaved seamlessly into either dialogues or inner monologues and provided an inside look into just how this world functions. Watching the people of the sea interact with both each other and with the people of the surface was always an interesting matter despite not being the main focus of the story. By the way, on the matter of the sea village, I hope you're not a big stickler about the laws of physics when you're watching a fantasy series, because they really don't give a crap what you're laws says about buoyancy and gravity. However, I will say that they break physics in a way that still feels believable somehow, and it's a very minor quibble.\\n\\n\r\n          On to the main matter of this story, this is definitely one of the better love stories I've seen in a very long time, and I honestly didn't expect that considering how it's set up. This is one of those almost convoluted love stories where everybody is in love with someone, but then someone else is in love with them, and the chains of love keep piling on from there. It actually reminded me a lot of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the play that has practically become the template for modern romance stories. Normally I would find this kind of setup almost gag worthy because it's basically nothing but angst and teenage drama, but Nagi no Asukara seems to be fundamentally aware that this is an unavoidable problem with this kind of story setup. In the midst of wallowing in the constant trade-offs of drama, it also takes time to give us deep and drawn-out introspectives into what each character thinks about both themselves and their love interest.\\n\\n\r\n          One of the central themes of this anime is the concept of change and how each of the characters deals with the matter. Coupled with the fact that our main characters are just beginning to enter into the age of puberty, we get to watch as each character struggles with their own opinions on change and, of course, their resistance to it, and the mechanics of the story really help to drive this idea home. Without spoiling anything, something really big happens about halfway through the series, and it causes the entire romantic landscape of character relationships to change drastically, and both the change and lack thereof in their world forces these characters to mature in ways that are sudden and uncomfortable, but also cathartic and relieving. I do have one little complaint though, in that after that romantic formula has its drastic change, things start to shift back towards how they were before, and why I was initially slightly disappointed by this, the way everything came back together with its conclusion refused to leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Even aside from the romance aspects, the story touches on all sorts of themes relating to growing up and maturing, and the struggle of the children to both grow up and not grow up is palpable throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\n          As for the specific characters, there are some that I can't discuss due to spoilers, so we'll just focus on the main five for now. Hikari is the group\u2019s leader and takes the bold and brash personality to the max, but his inner monologue still manages to make him feel sympathetic when he does things that I would normally hate any other character for. Manaka is the clumsy and childish one that Hikari is in love with, while Chisaki is the more mature girl that's in love with Hikari, but begins to loathe herself because of her strong friendship with Manaka. Kaname is the cool and aloof friend that seems to sit in the background a lot, and we actually get an insight into what that's like for him, and Tsugumu is a boy from the surface with an insatiable love for the sea. The chemistry for all of these characters is phenomenal not in how well they get along, but in how they don't, especially when confessions of love come out into the open, and this was probably my favorite part of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by P.A. Works, and this is possibly their best looking anime since Angel Beats! in 2010. The incredibly detailed environments combined with the high-gloss and super-moe character designs are unbelievably pleasing to the eye, and this is definitely one of the best-looking anime this year. Even the CG looked incredible most of the time, though this is almost negated by the fact that this anime is filled to the brim with CG objects, from boats and cars to fish and waves. I understand though that even with such a high budget anime you have to make cuts somewhere (I couldn't possibly imagine having to draws hundreds of individual fish in a single frame), and this is definitely a step towards making me feel more accepting towards CG. HOWEVER, I will still stand by the idea that animating a walking background character in CG sticks out like a sore thumb in the middle of someone's forehead, and is practically a mortal sin of animation.\\n\\n\r\n          There is no dub for this series yet, though I wouldn't mind a dub being produced. If it were to happen, it would most likely be a Bang Zoom! dub, and while I'm normally not super-excited by their work, I have a feeling they would be able to pull this one off well.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Yoshiaki Dewa, one half of the J-pop group Jyukai, whose only prior soundtrack work has been for Amnesia, yet his mastery of setting the right mood for every scene is nothing to trifle with. Most of the tracks consist of acoustic guitar melodies, a sound that I feel needs to be much more prevalent in soundtracks, though the occasional string swells and somber piano tunes add a nice contrast. Both opening themes \"lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~\" and \"ebb and flow\" were performed by Ray, and bring a relaxed singer/songwriter feel blended slightly with electronic ambiance, while both ending themes \"Aqua Terrarium\" and \"Mitsuba no Musubime\" were performed by Nagi Yanagi and play us out with some rolling ballads to heighten the emotional impact of each episode.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, Nagi no Asukara is an excellent example of how there is a great deal of innovation and heart to be found in the romance genre, and it's certainly one of the hidden gems of 2014.",

            "content": "Change is something that exists as a part of everyday life.  One day is different from the next, and people all over the world must adapt to the different circumstances or problems that are placed in front of them, such as having to deal with a suddenly harsh winter, food shortages, and the loss of a family member.  As one of the few shows from the Fall 2013 season that had a large episode length, Nagi No Asukara, or a Lull in the Sea, explains the topic of change extremely well, as contrary to its name, a lull it is not.  \r\nWriter'snote:  There will be a lot of water metaphors, puns, and stuff like that in this review.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8.32/10):  The story of Nagi No Asukara has a rather simple idea that its masterful plot stems from.  The story follows the lives of 4 kids who are Sea People named Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname.  Due to their school being shut down and having nowhere to get their \"edumacation\" from, the 4 must go up to the surface and start going to school there, all the while, meeting someone named Tsumugu who becomes part of their group.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get any further, I feel as though I should explain what a Sea Person is.  A sea person in this anime's rendition, is someone who lives in the sea as any normal person on land.  The only difference between a sea and a land person, is the fact that the a sea person has something called Ena existing as a thin, transparent, covering over their skin, which allows them to breathe water.  (They can also breathe air too.)\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at an idea like this, the first thought that can come to one's mind is slice of life, seeing as how the story is about the lives of 5 kids, 4 of which have a very close relationship.  This however, is not the case.  The expansive 26 episode length of this series is broken down into 2 halves, entailing what I dub a \"prologue\", and the \"real story\".  (I will cover each one of these separately)\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the story, or \"prologue\" is what the synopsis implies.  The first 13 or so episodes of the series introduces the audience to the characters and a base idea of the story.  The way it was designed is very reminiscent of childhood, seeing as how the characters are very innocent and unknowing of what is to come their way.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about the first half of the series, is the fact that it gives the characters room to grow.  In pretty much every episode of the first half, the some of the characters are given more of a three dimensional feel and are more aware of the different and more major things that happen around them.  It gives the characters a simple taste, a flavoring of what is to come, as they all have to deal with situations and circumstances, that they are not aware of.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the first half does have its problems.  First off, some of the characters don't get much of a three dimensional feel.  Some of them do, seeing as how they react to the situation, and are affected by what is happening, and other sort of just stand to the sidelines and watch everything happen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series was quite a big surprise to me.  I had my jaw drop when it happened because I was so into the story, and I was literally speechless.  The second half of the story takes place five years after the first half finishes, and truth be told, I was a bit skeptical.  In my time watching anime, the timeskips that I saw in certain anime, did not help at all because of the copious amount of missing information that we, the audience never get to see.  Nagi No Asukara pulled a marlin out of the water with this one, seeing as how this timeskip was handled EXTREMELY well, making the series benefit so much more from it.  \\n\\n\r\nI explained how the first half of the series had some tensions that I found to be quite interesting in an anime about middle school children.  (Yes, middle school.)  If the first half was a wave, the second half is a torrent, a hurricane, a tsunami of emotion.  This is the part where I found the series to be even better than it was before.  \\n\\n\r\nWith no change in cast and a completely different rendition of the setting to put them in, this second half was the pearl of the series.  Some of the supporting characters turned into main characters, the majority of the supporting cast disappeared, and the focus of the series narrowed itself down onto focusing onto a total of 7 or so people with little to no distraction or side plot from any members of the supporting cast.  This part of the series focused solely on the interactions between the cast with this timeskip in place, which provided some excellent character development and a very, very good plot line.  It's to the point that I even questioned myself while smiling, \"Am I still watching the same anime?\"  Because it was such a shocking twist to the series that I had once knew.  In a way the second half is like how Anohana plays itself out, but without anyone dying or having have died beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the series I think was a very fitting end.  Everything came together nicely, the series itself came to a wonderful close, and it made the story end on a very good note without any hope for an abrupt end, as everything calmed down into a nice, still pool.  \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there is actually a story of lore from the Sea people that at first, I disregarded as a simple explanation for certain elements of this anime.  As the series goes on, this story of lore becomes a more prominent plot point, that ends up affecting the characters, and adds in more and more development.  The lore was a nice addition to the story, as it mixed in well with the flow of the story, making up the final episode of the story and making it so much better.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the fact that in pretty much EVERY episode, there will more than likely be a cliffhanger.  As someone who viewed the series on a weekly basis, the cliffhangers I found were very surprising as they were quite unexpected, and to be honest, made me want to watch the next episode even more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like any pristine lake or ocean, there will be a bit of pollution here and there.  The main fall of this story however, was its pacing.  Setting aside the two completely different arcs that the story is comprised of, the story overall had a varied pacing, some with very fast currents, pushing us through a load of detail and content, while others were slow moving, gently moving us with the water's movements.  Because it had 26 episodes, the anime had a lot of time to create the story it wanted to, and in the end it did.  However, I felt as though the content didn't fit 26 episodes, more like 20-22 episodes, as some of the episodes felt really draggy and slow, focusing on one thing for the entire episode, while others pushed us through waves and waves of detail an emotion, ultimately making the viewing experience a little uneasy, but not unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I found the story of Nagi No Asukara to be one of the better written ones for a romance anime, as the mix of love, change, heartbreak, emotion, lore, and life all came together in a wonderful, and extremely satisfying solution.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Very good overarching story\\n\r\n+  Impressive amount of character development\\n\r\n+  Excellent use of time skip\\n\r\n+  Brilliant integration of anime lore\\n\r\n-   Unbalanced pacing\\n\r\n-   Some characters left underdeveloped\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.41/10):  When you have a good story, it's only natural to have good characters to back it up.  Nagi No Asukara accomplishes this goal, but there were still some doors left opened.\\n\\n\r\nHikari as the main character of this story is introduced to us as a very stubborn and narrow-minded kid.  He only thinks of certain values in life, and anything he doesn't like, he dismisses it in a harsh and reckless manner.  It's a very negative outlook on life that he has, and it's quite unsurprising to see how he acts at the beginning of the series.  However, this all changes.  By the end of the series, all of these traits that is mentioned before no longer exists by the end of the series.  Over time, you get to see how the life around him shatters and melts away, and how he has to deal with the new changes and additions to his life while he tries to grip onto the life that he once knew and loved.  He gains the biggest character development in the series, being the main focus, and overall, becomes one of my favorite characters in general due to the fact that he does a complete 360 on his outlook on life, and his goals and aspirations, while still maintaining the personality that is Hikari.  He always takes things to heart, and he always looks out for the ones that he loves, and I feel like that is what makes him so good as a character.\\n\\n\r\nManaka as the main female lead of this series is introduced as a crybaby in this series.  Manaka is portrayed as a very weak character, relying on her friends, mainly Hikari, or Hii-kun as she calls him, in order to get through much of anything.  At the beginning of the story, Manaka can be easily hated, seeing as how she follows the \"weak female lead\", needing the help of other people to live and prosper.  That is, until the creators pull a \"haha you regret hating her don't you  moment\" at the center of the series.  While personality-wise, Manaka isn't the best female character in this series, she does play an extremely pivotal part of the story.  Mostly, in the way of Hikari's development.  She drives the story in a way that I thought was near impossible, and really adds to the story in a very good way.  \\n\\n\r\nChisaki as the other female member of the original main cast is rather interesting.  For the most part, Chisaki rarely takes the spotlight, but when she does, she does it well.  Chisaki, although quite cheerful, has the fear of losing the ones she holds dear.  It doesn't matter who it is, anyone she's close to, she fears losing.  While for the most part she plays a more supporting role in the main cast, Chisaki displays how her life has been affected by the changes that she never wished for, affect her, thus adding in more of the emotional tension of the series.\\n\\n\r\nKaname and Tsumugu are the final two main cast members before the timeskip, and overall, get nowhere near as much development as the other cast members.  (Notice how the amount of text for each character was shrinking?)  These two are more or less the short ends of the stick, with Kaname being the supportive guy friend to the cast with not much else to him, and Tsumugu being the emotionless person that he is.  Tsumugu is my most disliked character in the series, due to the fact that there are many unexplained parts about him, and some of the development that he receives, feel somewhat forced and fabricated because of how ungenuine it felt coming out of him.  He rarely talks out of a kuudere-esque tone, and I personally don't like how he was created due to these facts. \\n\\n\r\nAs for after the timeskip, the characters known as Miuna and Sayu get added to the main cast.  While Sayu serves as much purpose as Kaname and Tsumugu, Miuna becomes a very prominent character later on.  (I'm not going to go into much more detail to avoid spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast for the most part don't serve too much of a role.  Other than a select few that have some plot significance, a majority of them become plot devices that explain what is going on, or just further exemplify in the latter part of the series that yes, time has passed.  Nonetheless, the supporting cast does do their job very well, and I in fact did enjoy some of its members seeing as how fond I am of this cast. (except you, Tsumugu)\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the cast doesn't have, is equal character development.  Rather than splitting the character development into equal parts among the main cast, the greater majority of it, goes to Hikari.  While yes, he is the main focus of the show, the fact that basically 75% of all of the character development that happened in this series goes to Hikari, is a bit unfair.  Still though, the cast of Nagi no Asukara is exceptionally crafted, with the main characters for the most part, becoming more three dimensional and life-like.  They all have interactions with one another, and there isn't any \"dense\" or \"dim-witted\" characters that are completely oblivious to one another's feelings.  Also, there are a lot of shipping that can occur in this series because every main character has at least one person they like, with 1-3 people liking that character back.  It's a love web essentially.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Great main leads\\n\r\n+  Well done supporting cast\\n\r\n+  3-D characters\\n\r\n-   Unbalanced character importance\\n\r\n-   Lack of character development for the majority of the cast\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (10/10 and 9.88/10):  No, your eyes are not tricking you, those are the real numbers.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works, you are a godsend.  The art in this anime is outstandingly gorgeous.  If you don't believe me, watch the first opening.  You know the phrase, \"you can tell if a game/show is good based on how they animate water?\"  This anime answers back a huge yes.  The fact that P.A. works could make droplets of water look good is an amazing feat in and of itself.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the amazing water, the series has incredibly detailed backgrounds for both underwater and on land.  Because the series has two towns as its setting, one on land and one in water, the animators created two completely sceneries and looks for both of them, each which have their own beauty and charm about it.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the note of character designs, we have a rather simple look to them.  The characters themselves aren't overly complicated, and they all have this light blue tint around them that adds in to the water imagery sort of deal.  Their eyes though, that's a different story.  All of the characters are quite distinguishable if you forget where they come from, since people from the sea have blue eyes, and all of them have these oceans, these ponds for eyes that sparkle and shine.  The amount of detail that they have for their eyes is amazing.  The actual flow of the animation was very flowing and nice as well, with no sign of any choppy parts.  Nagi no Asukara by far has one of the best aesthetics that I've seen in an anime for a while, and it was so refreshing to see such beautiful artwork to compliment an already well thought out story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also an extremely high point in this series.  Like a lot of series' that have a somewhat long time span, Nagi no Asukara has 2 OST's and 2 ED's.  All of which, are fabulously composed and written.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the OST #1.  This song is the main theme for Nagi no Asukara and is it's most noticeable track.  The song has a very watery and bright feel to it, sort of reflecting off of the childhood innocence and joy in which the half of the story in which it is played.  I like this track a lot due to how happy and calming it can sound, as if it could wash all of my troubles away.  The ED #1 is its contrast, having a more reminiscing and yearning tone to it, as if someone was crying out in anguish over remembering things in life that they regret.  Overall, the first half of the main tracks was set of very rememberable pieces that I still remember to this day.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST #2 and ED #2 do the same job as its first half counterparts.  The OST #2 has a very sad but somewhat hopeful tone to it as reflective to the tone of the half of the series from where it is aired.  While personally, I'm not as big of a fan of it as I am with the first opening, the second opening is still a very good track to listen to, and is still beautifully composed.  The ED #2 on the other hand is the contrast to its partner OST, having a very hopeful and bright feel to it.  The fact that this anime has such clashing sets of music, is brilliant.  It sort of reflects the tone of the story and the way the characters are dealing with the situation, and turning them into the OST and ED respectably.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the music of this series is beautifully composed and I personally would listen to it again and again like any other anime OST's and ED's I listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting gets special mention in this.  Aside from the main characters that don't have any emotion in their voice pattern, the voice actors do a really good job at conveying the proper emotion and feel to the situation that goes on in the anime.  None of the voices felt off, and overall, I felt like the voice casting was pretty top notch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  OUTSTANDINGLY beautiful artwork and character designs\\n\r\n+  Dat water\\n\r\n+  Memorable soundtracks\\n\r\n+  Majority of voice acting very good\\n\r\n-   There are none for this category\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.87/10):  Rather than watching the hyped anime of the fall 2013 season, Kill La Kill, I settled down my time to watch this show instead, because it had to do with romance, it had to do with the ocean, and it had to do with beautiful artwork.  Three of my favorite things.  As I got into the series however, I was very intrigued by how this seemingly innocent story was playing out.  Sure, it felt a bit side story at the beginning with the main focus being on a character that wasn't a part of the main cast, but I didn't care.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked though throughout the whole series was how they made the character relationships a main focus.  They constantly asked one another who they liked, what was going on, and made the experience very real feeling in this environment.  Above all, they had some really good cliffhangers that kept me hooked on the show.  With addition to the great storytelling, I found myself yelling at my screen to not go to a certain person as I had grown attached to these characters and felt somewhat furious when my ships sort of failed to come true.  (Yes, I am that kind of person.)  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I found this series to be a whale of a time, an enjoyable wavecoaster of 27 weeks, itching for the next episode to come out as I finished the most recent one.  Personally, I feel like this show was pushed to the side, (as kill la kill was taking over anime essentially), and I think that on the subject of romance animes, this is one of the best ones that anyone can watch.  If you are a fan of good drama, romance, artwork, and characters, this is definitely an anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.89/10)  \\n\\n\r\nWriter's note: Sorry this was such a long review.  I've just been itching to write this review, and I have a lot to talk about.  Heh heh...",

I wasn't that interested because i thought i couldn't relate to a bunch of kids but after seeing this anime i have to say that it was really good. It is definitely a must watch anime. I enjoyed everything from the artwork to the story. The story is great and it had great character development. I was always interested in each and everyone of the characters and i was intrigued by the characters. The most stand out characterand the one that probably has become one of my top ten anime girls is Chisaki. I was continuously confused about what she was feeling and yet i understood because that is what reality is like. The show was clearly a fantasy anime but the story of Chisaki and the other characters made everything believable and relatable. I definitely recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Do you know that moment when, I don't know, sometimes happens and you have to, bitterly, put a series you like on-hold, and then after a while you go back to it, with the good feelings that you left it with, and then you slowly realize that it's not as awesome as you remembered it, but still lying to yourself that the \"magic\" is still there, only to get those hopes crushed even more and realize the utter bulshit you have been watching all this time? This is exactly what happened here for me. \r\nStory - 3\r\nThe setting is, to say the least, and Ithink everybody can agree, the best thing of this anime, however all the potential and originality that it could have had fell flat on its own face with a plot that it's completely nonsensical and not justified. The first half of the show, the one which i had fond memories from, was actually quite fun to follow along; of course, ignoring the overall defying of phisics that Shioshishio village has (yes, you cannot eat soup underwater! also, the sense of gravity should be cut in half compared to the surface. Also let's do not forget salty water makes floating a whole lot easier than sweet water!), but after the first 10 episodes or so, I started to wonder what exactly was the point of this show. Love polygon between teenagers? Slice of life with a supernatural setting? Angsty teenagers and their misunderstood love? Around episode 19 I felt like it turned into a teen version of The Bold and the Beautiful and I really couldn't care less anymore and from episode 21 and forward I facepalmed so many times my forehead turned red. I don't know whether I was simply blind when I liked this or I was in a phase of my life where I actually believed that love was the answer to everything (what literally just happened in this show). It would have been so much more interesting if instead of any other slice of life, this show would have tried to concentrate more on the original setting, on Uroko-sama and the Sea God, which definitely intrigued me through the whole 26 episodes, instead it even took that concept and smacked a half-assed \"just because\" on it, keeping it ambigous and trying to mask its own nonsense with it. That just shows how desperate for a conclusion the author was at that point. Anyway, in other words, I was expecting something more similar to the Little Mermaid and instead I got some bratty teenagers bragging about love and pretty much nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nArt-wise it's pretty cute. I didn't like the overall characters' design as much as I loved the animation of the sea world in general. And then there is Uroko-sama. Let's all bow to Uroko-sama. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nThe OST was to say the least mediocre. The only song that I really liked was the opening song. As for the rest, forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nHahahahaha...hahaha..ha... Right. Do you remember when I mentioned that if the show would have focused more on the sea world and the Sea God /Uroko-sama, it would have been more bearable? I take that back. It ONLY needed to focus on Uroko-sama to be more consistent than this! The rest of the cast almost doesn't even matter as much in my eyes with all their very petty problems included. When a show tries to make the characters' development be the whole focus of the story, then I expect it to have a certain degree of coherence and be fairly justified. In this case, it was not justified and not coherent at all. Why would a grade schooler love somebody for 5 years and work hard for a person that they only just met a few times? We're talking about a GRADE SCHOOLER. At that age I was still playing with my dolls and wondering who shall I marry my Barbie with, not gawking over the next-door \"oniichan\". It could as well have been a crush, but a crush of a kid FOR a kid, crush triggered just for a bit of kindness, lasting so much just rubs me the wrong way. Brats! The whole cast can't be described any better than using the word \"brats\". Even those that got to 19 years old. STILL self-victimizing brats! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -  3\\n\r\nAt the end of the 26 episodes, I just had a \"wtf did I even watch\" expression plastered all over my face, so my enjoyment was quite poor for the most time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\\n\r\n\u10da(\u0ca0_\u0ca0\u10da) just.what.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, I'd like to start by saying A Lull in the Sea is aptly named as it did, indeed, lull me. Plain and simple, this is a boring show in which not a whole heck of a lot of anything actually happens. There are quite literally two major plot points in the entire 26 episode program and there's way too much nothingness leading up to them. This is a show I started out really liking, then liking, then feeling neutral about then near the end starting to actively dislike and be annoyed by. In the end I watched a pretty show with a great premisethat I cannot help but feel really botched its execution pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\\n\r\nFar and away the most visually impressive part of this show is its presentation of its underwater village, Shioshishio, and just its underwater scenes in general. They present the sea as vibrant, colorful, brimming with life and almost a bit magical. The visuals beyond that, while far from ugly, are fairly average and forgettable. It's largely just generic characters with unique hair or eye colors in a copy/paste school and/or small town setting that you've seen countless times before in other anime. The lack of effort/originality plagues this anime through and through, as even Shioshishio, while presented beautifully, is largely just a copy/paste of a generic village not unlike any other on the surface only with water and fish added after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nI found all four into and outro songs- two of each, respectively- acceptable but forgettable. There's nothing here I feel compelled to add to my playlist after the fact. Background music in this anime didn't stand out to me at all to the point where I almost didn't notice it was there. There definitely wasn't a track that stole the scene and commanded my attention. Perhaps the song at the very, very end was the best of the bunch but I'd also argue at that point it's more about the presentation as a whole as opposed to just the song you're hearing, as they really try to drive it all home when it's finally time to end this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting here was fine, though no one stood out, and the poor writing, which got quite repetitive as time went on, did not do any of the voice actors any favors. Likewise, there's just way too much crying in this anime. Literally EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE. and that is not hyperbole, at least one character cries, often multiple. It gets old after a while. Some of the younger female characters sound a bit whiny, but I think that was intentional given the stereotype they're supposed to be portraying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, by and large, quite likable. For the most part pretty much the entire main cast consists of nice people with pure hearts and good intentions and no one is just a massive insufferable jerk. That being said, character development is quite uneven with some characters ending up highly cookie-cutter and one-dimensional and not evolving much over the course of the show, despite a lengthy time jump. Miuna is likely the character I felt the show did the best job with as far as establishing and showing her starting point, her personal and emotional growth and ultimately her ending point. Other characters didn't do that. They were nice, they were there, they had an acceptable amount of screen time but ultimately they ended the show not all that dissimilar from where they started it.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the overall plot, while the premise of two distinct groups of people- those on the surface and those in the sea- is truly intriguing and has all the potential in the world, the execution here is just a wild swing and a miss. I could rant for a long time about all the things wrong with this world and all the nonsensical or unanswered elements of this story, but I'll abridge it and spare you. To be clear, this plot does not come remotely close to holding up under scrutiny. Here's an extremely small list of examples, of which I could whip up 25 more off the top of my head, of things that are just nonsensical with this anime-\\n\\n\r\n-How do citizens of the sea village have things like television, stoves, broth, phones, etc fully and permanently underwater?\\n\\n\r\n-When the main cast had their middle school close, forcing them to go to school on the surface, what happened to every other student that went to that school? Were there not any? There were literally four students in the entire school? Where did everyone else go?\\n\\n\r\n-How does one enforce \"a person from the sea marrying a person from the surface results in being banished from the sea\"? It is established in the anime there are ten sea villages in Japan alone, nevermind the rest of the world. If you were to banish a person from Village A, what's to stop them from going to live in Village B? And even if you were to wildly stretch it and say that, somehow, every single village in Japan was not only in communication but also in agreement and all agreed to ban a person, what's to stop that person from living in a sea village in Europe or elsewhere? Can you ACTUALLY enforce a ban from the entire sea?\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this is to say nothing of the fact that the sea village and the surface village, while supposedly soooo different and soooo divided and there's all this tension between them and blah blah, are more or less the same place. The people look the same, their homes look the same, they eat the same foods, do the same things... Like I said earlier, you can more or less copy/paste the surface village, add water and fish and you've got the sea village. It's just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil the specifics of the ending but it was a major, major letdown. The entire appeal of the show, established from the very first episode and shoved down your throat for the entire duration of the program, is the interpersonal relationships, crushes, feelings of love, love triangles, etc between the main cast members. In the end the payoff is garbage. I'll not reveal who ends up with who, but this show has zero balls. Zero kisses, zero mutual \"I love yous\", zero depictions of characters going on a date, zero shots of a couple cuddled up on the couch. The show gives you, at best, vague and ambiguous hints as to who may or may not be with who going forward and that is all you get. It was not satisfying at all. For all its buildup your reward for sticking the show out for 26 episodes is a pretty big slap in the face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI'm a huge sucker for romance, I generally enjoy the Slice of Life genre, I find the sea fascinating and beautiful and I generally respond favorably to works of fiction depicting the supernatural, so this show had all the makings of something I'd adore, but I just didn't. As mentioned in my opening paragraph my enjoyment as I viewed this program definitely decreased over time and by the time the ending rolled around I was absolutely ready to be done with the show. It's slow and boring, repetitive, has major plot/logic holes, has way too much crying, has too many moments in which character's reactions are not believable or realistic, it has way too much \"do nothing\" and overall it just wears out its welcome and becomes a slog to watch. I'm glad I watched it... I guess? But there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to ever watch it again and I won't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nThe target demographic for this show is probably people around 13-16 years old who are still figuring out their own emotions, the emotions of others, love, change and acceptance. Perhaps this would resonate more with those people than it did with me. The constant tears, repeated dialogue, force fed bigger picture message and plethora of logic holes largely ruined a pretty show with the utmost potential, leaving it forever resigned to absolute mediocrity as far as this reviewer is concerned. I didn't hate it, but this show is a mess and I have no desire to watch it again.\\n\\n\r\n+Very pretty underwater scenes\\n\r\n+Likable characters\\n\r\n+Occasional blips of emotional depth (ruined by ten immature, tear filled moments for every one of these)\\n\\n\r\n-Slow/boring/pacing issues\\n\r\n-MAJOR logic holes\\n\r\n-Unsatisfying conclusion\\n\r\n-Repetitive\\n\r\n-Too much crying\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 5.5-6\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6",

            "content": "Has anything ever caught you so off guard that even days later you find yourself at a loss for words? That's how Nagi no Asu kara made me feel. Except without the loss for words part, clearly, judging by this review.\r\nNo anime ever surprised me like Nagi no Asu kara. I would be remiss not to begin with the animation quality. This anime made me pause several times throughout the series simply to gawk at how beautiful it was. It was hard to focus on anything else, even several episodes in, as the quality never really flagged. The filigree sun filtering through the water, thepacks of fish floating through the water-air, ornate scrolls in sacred places, the gradient of clouds in the sky, all of it is stunning, saturated, and beautiful. Buildings have a distinct, vaguely marine architecture above water, and below the surface a semi-Mediterranean style creeps in as well. P.A. Works was the right studio for this, and their love of the pastoral filters beautifully into NagiAsa, with rusty old ships and street signs being given a life and beauty all their own. Art director Higashiji Kazuki (Charlotte, Angel Beats) should be given a lot of credit here for putting a 26-episode series on par with some of the best movies I've ever seen, never mind serial anime, in terms of lovingly detailed and ornate art. My only animation complaint is that the character animation slips a bit at the start of the second cour, but it's not enough to detract from the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe pretty pictures aren't just window dressing for a quirky moe slice comedy, which I feared from the previews -- that idea went out the window somewhere between Manaka's cursed knee-fish farting and Akari's confession in the especially-stunning 5th episode. Horribly unlikeable and un-compelling characters at first slowly develop depth and pathos with time until you forget that they ever seemed flat in the first place; Miuna especially went from near comic relief when first introduced to a deeply vibrant character, all without NagiAsa straining at any facet. Still, a few characters (Kaname in particular) had virtually no substance throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the each cour includes scenes as gripping as any to come out of anime, reminiscent of Made in Abyss or even bringing to my mind the ending of the old Berserk anime, such was the pathos they were able to bring out. The denouement of that scene to begin the second cour gives depth and gravity to the characters' suffering, though the time skip could have been handled slightly better. Inter-character interactions and relationships always are balanced on the knife-edge that separates the sentimental from the truly absurd (a love pentagon? hexagon? octagon? how many sides can this thing have?), but it somehow works for NagiAsa, and nothing feels forced. There are better works for character development and love polygons (Toradora comes to mind), but there is plenty to hold the series down and plenty of development to make every leg and every angle feel real and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nNagiAsa's soundtrack is ordinary, and a 26-ep anime could use a few extra tracks so we don't hear the same ones so often, but it is well-done and well-used. The first OP and ED are serviceable but the second of each, and especially the 2nd OP, truly shimmer and showcase the series' artistry. (And the second OP's subtle change after [REDACTED] is a nice touch.) The sound effects are fantastic, especially the low atmospheric rumble or faint whalesong just present in some of the underwater scenes, especially the ones accompanying the saltflake snow, that give them an eerie or forlorn undertone. \\n\\n\r\nThings like underwater echoes and the ability to speak naturally underwater are also the correct decisions for making a work of this kind, even though they don't necessarily fit known laws of physics. NagiAsa's fantasy setting is one that has the courage NOT to explain itself, and that's part of its charm. It has the guts to give you underwater newspapers, tomoebi (google \"sun dogs\" -- they're real, actually), and saltflake snow and not explain a goddamn thing about how it all works. And you know what? I appreciate that. And this isn't to say they skimped on worldbuilding -- there's an entire mythos, cultural stigmas, rituals, a world that grows and changes over time, hell there's even part of a god living in a shack outside town. What more could you want?\\n\\n\r\nThe message of the anime (as well as its protagonist) embodies this bold, almost flippant attitude as well: Have courage even in dark times, like Hikari's light, let your deepest desires surface, lest they be washed away with the tides of time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fantasy, slice of life, romance, or if you just want something a bit different that's also a feast for the senses, you'd be remiss not to check this out. I know I gave it the maximum score, which in MAL-world means I must be biased and delusional, but it's anime the way it should be -- gorgeous, poignant, deep, original, without fanservice, queerbaiting, or miscellaneous pandering. It's an anime that stands on its own two feet and is proud of what it is -- just like its own characters.",

You may be wondering, then, why am I bothering with an older anime, dragging it back up? Because I despise that people told me it gets better when it doesn't. If you don't like it in the beginning I honestly doubt you will enjoy it late on. I hated the story, which took brilliant ideas then burned them at the stake while throwing shoujo sparkles and love stories all over the charred remains.\r\nOh God, the characters. All of them suck. The main foursuck, the human sucks, the kids suck, the sea God sucks. They. Just. Suck. The main female lead, the one who screeches like a banshee, is the worst offender. She's extremely irritating, gets into trouble all the time and honestly was the worst character I've seen. This doesn't make the other better around her though. In fact, they're dragged down by the black hole of a personality.\\n\r\nThe only credit I can give it is that the art looked okay, that's the only reason this isn't a 1. Slight spoilers, the ending sucks. And that's the best thing because now all those characters are suffering with a crap ending which is fair payback for my suffering in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 5/10 (By which I mean, it was extremely forgettable)\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n",

            "content": "Let's face it, the animation and art style were the two things that really drew me into this show. They were able to combine elements from lots of different movies and make it into something unique. The story starts off with 4 middle school students who live in the sea. They are forced to attend school on the surface after their school closes. What follows is an immense adjusting to the life in Oshiooshi. At first, the sea and the surface are tense and upset with each other, but somehow this anime tells the tale of how they are able to finally have the twovillages coincide. Alongside that, there's a growing climate change that will affect the two worlds unless something is done. \\n\r\nThis anime has it's positives and it's negatives. I'll start with the positives.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nStated above. Probably the MOST beautifully animated and drawn anime I've ever seen. That made up for the negatives in the show! I can go on and on about it. I mean, just look at the screenshots and the pictures!\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nA beachy/sea anime has to have good music that makes you feel like you're at the ocean, and A Lull in the Sea does exactly. The soundtrack is so well written, and it will have you connecting with the sounds of the ocean. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFor me, this one was impressive, the character development was amazing. Since this anime was focused on changing, you could tell they put a lot of effort into how the characters adapted to their new enviornment. Probably my favorite out of all the characters was Hikari. He just really changed for the better, and it was so nice to see that progression, while still mainting his stubborn character that made him lovable. \\n\\n\r\nStory Progression\\n\r\nThey split it up into two arcs, and it was very effectively done. The pacing was great and I didn't ever feel like it was moving slowly. \\n\\n\\n\r\n~Neutral~\\n\r\nThe love triangle...or Polygon... \\n\r\nI do like romance, and I know this was a big part of the anime. I did enjoy the romance but at times it got me kind of irritated since most of the love was unriquitted and it just didn't seem to get anywhere. It had me feeling annoyed when things didn't work out. It was really big mess of this person liking this person, but that person liked another person and so on. Most that stuff doesn't get resoved until the end. I still found the drama and the feelings that the characters went through relatable and it did keep me hooked as I wanted to know who ened up with who. \\n\\n\r\n~Negatives~\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending\\n\r\nThis may be just me but I was a little sad at the ending. It wasn't terrible, per say, but I wish things had been different. I won't spoil anything, but I did finish the anime and say \"man, i wish that ____ happened\". That's more just personally. If you don't care about said thing, it is a nice ending. They tied it all together and it was very cute! (sorry this makes no sense)\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can see it was a very great expirience. It's a good length and if you like romance, and drama, this will be the anime for you because there's lots of it! I hope you enjoyed my review, congrats if you read until the end haha.I had a hard time rating this anime a 9, to be honest it should be a 9.5 or higher in my book. Definitley one of my top 10!",

The anime which I will be reviewing today \u201cNagi No Asukara\u201d (A Lull In The Sea) is no exception with the original story from the studio and an amazing anime overall.\r\nNagi No Asukara (Or NagiAsu from now on) is a story which follows the story of our 4 core characters: Hikari Sakishima, Manaka Mukaido, Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki that lives in a village under the seacalled Shioshishio that are forced to study in a school on the surface after their school was forced to shut down. You could say this is a coming of age story with a love HEXAGON relationship but eventhough this is probably one of the most complicated love drama I\u2019ve seen in a long time, P.A Works did this drama right.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most drama, NagiAsu is one of the few drama anime that I feel attached to every character (except for the extras of course lol). P.A Works has made every character have enough screentime to help develop their character and make us feel closer to them, to know about their feelings and thoughts. This makes the anime has multiple leads with their own story not just one protagonist like most anime. The pacing in the first few episodes was a bit slow but it was to focus on the world-building aspect of the anime, how everything works, the story behind the Sea God, Shioshishio and the town on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of NagiAsu is phenomenal, within 5 mins of watching the first episode, I was completely in awe of the world that P.A Works have made, the character animation they made is really solid throughout and the water animation was great as well. I really love the attention to details in this anime. Though most people won\u2019t notice it but besides the animation, the sound element plays a pivotal point in the story progression as well. The echo that every character makes under water, the piano, guitar OST of the anime, etc. At first, I skipped the opening and ending sequence, however, the OPs/EDs grew on me after time and became more emotional the more I watch through it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is for people want to see beautiful scenery and a drama anime that was done right. It utilized many elements of anime to make the viewers connect to the characters, making them feel for the characters, not only just the main characters but for the world the people living in it.",

Love isn't just an affection is this series. It waits, sacrifices, lets go, cares, and protects. We can see the development of the characters as they mature from episode by episode.\r\n::Overall, the anime is best for anyone who wantedromance and drama well baked with each other.

            "content": "Nagi No Asukara in my opinion is one the greatest anime I've ever seen. There literally isn't an anime like it. I mean seriously what drew me into this anime was the first scene of the first episode. There is literally a male cooking with freaking fish swimming in the air. That already made me hooked into the anime. \"Why is their fish? How is their fish? What the heck is this world?\"  I had so many questions just by the first second of the anime and was already so entranced.  I could tell by the first few frames that this anime wasgoing to have really beautiful artwork. Anyways the storyline is really original. It is about a world in which the world is born from the sea but then people decided to go the surface because of reasons that is better explained in the anime. I don't want to spoil too much of the details but basically four children from the sea gets transferred to a middle school on the surface because their school is closed down. There is a more complex storyline but its hard to explain without spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the characters. Every single character loves another and just seeing their relationships and dynamics is the best part of the anime. There isn't character plot line that I didn't enjoy. Each of them is unique in its own way. Hikari, the main protagonist of the show, was really a true protagonist. He really drove the show forward. If he wasn't in the anime there wouldn't be an anime at all. All the other characters, Manaka, Chisaki, Kaname, Tsumugu, Sayu and Miuna were also all essential to the story but not as essential as Hikari is. At least that is for my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful artwork and sound track is really what brought the story to life and that's something that not a lot of anime does.  This anime really was just outstanding. Because of the originality of it's storyline, the amazing development of the characters and the beautiful aesthetics of the anime this anime deserves a 10/10. There is no mistake about what other reviewers say this anime is truly a treasure that everyone must see.",

            "content": "-SPOILER FREE REVIEW-\r\nThis is my first and probably only review of an anime and only because this is an anime almost any avid anime watcher must watch. I do not consider this to be a proper review by any means as I believe I'd have to spoil the anime for that. So for someone who hasn't watched this... I don't like cutesy romances AT ALL. This anime blew my mind and although it may initially seem cutesy... it's not.\r\nTo put it simply, this is a 'cute' romance that aligned transitions, animation and sound beautifully throughout the anime. \r\nIt is a character driven anime and isalso significantly impacted my the plot. The best word to describe the plot is 'unique'. I loved it so much because to someone like myself who is extremely analytical, I wasn't able to predict what was going to happen in future episodes, which I personally love in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one scene that I will never forget in this anime (end of episode 23) and it's because it was done so well that it was legitimate masterpiece quality.\\n\\n\r\nI am someone who still hasn't and probably never will rate an anime a 10 other than it being in sarcasm. This is to me the highest quality anime I've ever had the pleasure of watching and I give it a 9 because of that, a definitely great anime which will give you feels but mostly appreciation for actual quality among other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I want you to watch this is because it has absolutely brilliant moments which most other anime do not have. This was easily one of the best anime ever created which took full advantage of the impact transitions have in an anime, in both the domains of sound and animation.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch, enjoy and appreciate the beautiful creation of Nagi no Asukara.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I enjoy watching slice of life rom-com anime. They sometimes tend to be relaxing, especially after watching something that is full of action. However I am always sceptical about watching romance anime. I always worry that the show will follow the path of every stereotypical series under that genre. So it's always good to see something different, that makes it just a bit more unique. Has Nagi no Asukara steered away from the stereotypes? Yes. Has it done it well? Definitely. \r\nSTORY\r\nLong ago, humans lived in the sea. However many of them wanted to live on the surface, and so they moved, causing a splitbetween the two groups. \\n\r\nNagi no Asukara follows the story of four children from the underwater sea village, Shioshishio. Due to some reasons, their school closes, and they must transfer to the school on the surface, in a village called Oshiooshi. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a really good setting to the story, as the four characters (Manaka, Hikari, Chisaki and Kaname) begin meeting new people and slowly, but surely attempt to reunite the two villages. \\n\r\nFor the first ten or so episodes, the anime is enjoyable, following the school-slice of life genre. It's around the midway mark, where the anime steers away from the stereotypes and continues with a darker tone. \\n\r\nThe show is a bit slow at the start, but once it hits into overdrive near the halfway point, it has an effect, that will glue you to the screen. Can't say anything else about it without spoiling it! \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nBefore the aforementioned turn at the halfway point, our main characters assume the roles of slice of life character archetypes. Manaka is the emotional one, Chisaki is the loving one, Hikari is the loud and energetic one, and Kaname is the handsome, smiling one. There's also Tsumugu, a new friend from the surface, who is the calm and collective type. \\n\r\nIn the second half, the characters each become unique, leaving the cardboard cutouts that most slice of life characters are. Their true colors are revealed, and so are their emotions. \\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a romance anime, the characters have crushes on their friends, and I must admit, I did get a bit confused at one point, as there are love triangles, and there's this one thing that this show does, which I haven't seen much anywhere else. This anime will not give you the final \"layout\"  of the couples very early on. The show likes to create moments where you think, \"Oh no wait, she has a crush on HIM, and not HIM.\" As a result, we are left wondering how these affections will conclude. Really a good job on that. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has no definite one main protagonist. The title gets passed around throughout the episodes, from one character to the next, which in my opinion is excellent, as it leads to brilliant character development, not just for the main five, but others too. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND \\n\\n\r\nThe animation... What can I say. Nagi no Asukara has the potential to have the best art style of any show I have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThe sheer amount of detail in everything! Rust on ships and old metal buildings, paint peeling off houses, the reflection of light off the water surface at night, snow isn't just a flat sheet of white, I could go on forever listing where there's a huge amount of detail. \\n\r\nIn the first episode alone we are shown how well the sea village is animated. It is like something out of a dream, going around a little village, other people swimming past, living in a house with fish around you... It is perfect! \\n\r\nThe characters are also really well animated. All residents of Shioshishio have the same turquoise eye color, as well as the shine of their Ena (a layer of skin that allows them to breathe and live underwater). When it comes to animation itself, I cannot find a single flaw. Full marks here. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack mainly consists of piano and guitar music, and even though it isn't the best soundtrack in the world, it seems to fit the anime. The openings and endings are quite good too, I like the shows second opening, \"ebb and flow\" which is conveniently put in directly at the beginning of the second half. The beginning of this song really nails it, high reverberated piano notes with a smooth vocal. \\n\\n\r\nI prefer the sub to the dub, even though I had a tough time deciding between the two. However as soon as I saw The names Kana Hanazawa and Ai Kayano, I decided almost instantly. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is an excellent anime. It has a similar approach to every other romance comedy anime, but steers away, and does its own thing. It really was great to watch, and the shows ending was very satisfying. Its animation is just a masterstroke, and gives this show its own charm. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy would you watch Nagi no Asukara? \\n\r\n-awesome characters \\n\r\n-great story\\n\r\n-AMAZING art styles\\n\r\n-very good cast for Japanese dub \\n\r\n-a very good take on the romance genre\\n\r\n-if you enjoy shipping characters \\n\\n\r\nWhy would you NOT watch Nagi no Asukara? \\n\r\n-if you don't like the slice of life rom-com genre\\n\r\n-if you hate moe.",

            "content": "Well, you're going to see my score and think to yourself, this person is pretty much insane. How can this person not see how \"beautiful\" this anime is? Well, please allow me to write up a review that may or may not justify my score.\r\nSTORY: (3/10) The premise is actually what pulled me in, and seeing that it had such a high score on MAL as a romance anime and was brimming with 9 or 10 starred reviews, I went in thinking I wouldn't be disappointed. The first thirteen or so episodes actually don't disappoint, and I kept waiting for them to explain pointers andplot lines which, unfortunately, to the end remain unexplained. As you can read in the synopsis of NagiAsu, the premise is very interesting, what with people who live on land and in the sea, but as the episodes progress you begin to notice the plot holes that just continue to become bigger and glaringly obvious to the point you can't just ignore them and that is the downfall of NagiAsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is the romance, it is one of the most poorly done romances I have ever come across in anime. There is NO development whatsoever and every episodes just seems to add new characters to the list of the complicated as heck \"romance\". The romance of this anime doesn't move an inch from the first ep through to the 26th ep. No. Frickin. Development. It's all just a very big, very complicated LOVE OCTAGON if I had to summarize it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the romance completely shadows over the actual plot and everything is so half-baked and sloppily handled in the story department I don't know how it ranks on #160.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is redeeming feature about the plot, it is the feels that this anime sometimes manages to provide. Of course if you love the romance, you'd find yourself getting feelsy over it loads of times, but what got me to shed a tear; one tiny little tear was a certain incident concerning Akari and her dad.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it.\\n\\n\r\nART:(10/10) The art to say the least is breath-takingly beautiful with the backgrounds and the character designs showing such detail and intricacy it makes you wonder if they ended up focusing on the art rather than on the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (6/10) The sound was decent. The OP and ED songs might be considered beautiful and touching by people who enjoy slow songs but I don't so that's that I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: (7/10) In my opinion, the feature that saved this anime from being a complete train wreck were it's characters. They aren't anything original what with Hikari being your typical tsundere who yells at anything and everything but he gets better; though not completely cured of his jerk habits. He is my least favourite. \\n\r\nMy most favourite character is Chisaki because I could relate to her in a way I didn't relate to any other character. Everything she stands for as a person, I find those traits in myself which makes her a character close to my heart.\\n\r\nIn the same way, the other characters were all somehow relateable and you don't particularly end up hating anyone except if you have no patience for indecisiveness you might end up hating these characters alot.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT:(5/10) I can't really rate the enjoyment portion in a linear manner. The first 13 episodes have an enjoyment rate of 7/10; the later half rapidly deteriorates to a 4/10 because it just gets so annoying and frustrating, the stupid love octagon where everyone is in love with the other who is in love with someone else and so it just continues in this frustrating manner until a happy ending is slapped into our faces with an inconclusive love octagon.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a feature I forgot to mention, what was with all the \"running away after learning a shocking truth\" writers? It made me laugh and really destroyed whatever mood the situation had managed to get me in.",

Lets start!\r\nFirst of all, the introduction, as the main character of all history, we have Hikari, a 15 yeared old boy, which at the end you will really love (no BL, please, seriously, like just as a person \u00ac\u00ac ). We have also other main characters, but this one is the guy who (in the future) will change the society. Other main characters like Chisaki, Sayu, Kaname, Tsumugu, Manaka or Miuna are also really important in the timeline, but it could be better done (I don't say It hasbeen done badly :P ), but Hisaki is the name I will remember at every day I will live next today.\\n\r\nAll the history happens in two \"slides\", the sea and the \"exterior world\", and at the middle of the history is really confusing, anyway.\\n\r\nThe art is fabulous, and its over 9000 at the sea!\\n\r\nThe sound/music is just love ;) .\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is lower because you are more interested about what will happen next.\\n\r\nAnd its a 9 because I didn't cryed at anytime. \\n\r\nGood day!\\n\\n\r\n(You may not be able to read the rest, because is in my other lenguages, please, for my followers, don't report it.

El personatge principal \u00e9s Hikari, un noi de 15 anys al qual acabareu estimant ;P (No Gay \u00ac\u00ac )Tenim altres caracters, pero la historia es desarrolla al seu voltant. Com a altres personatges tamb\u00e9 tenim a Chisaki, Sayu, Kaname, Tsumugu, Manaka o Miuna, que s\u00f3n igual de impoprtants en la linea temporal! No obstant, es podrien haber fet millor els personatges :P .\\n\r\nL'art \u00e9s fabul\u00f3s, i t\u00e9 \"m\u00e9s de 9000 unitats de poder\" al mar ;) .\\n\r\nEls sons i la m\u00fasica s\u00f3n pur amor.\\n\r\nLa diversi\u00f3 o entreteniment \u00e9s menor ja que t'estas pensant m\u00e9s que passar\u00e0 despr\u00e9s que disfrutant de l'anime, no obstant, al final et queda un buit dins teu increible.\\n\r\nI es un 9 perqu\u00e8 no m'han vingut ganas de plorar, sin\u00f2, potser m'ho pensava!\\n\r\nPer cert, Nagi no Asukara significa en catal\u00e0 \"Un per\u00edode de calma al mar\".\\n\r\nBon dia!",

            "content": "I have not yet completed the anime, so please let me sink in. However I am at a point where one of the major climaxes have hit and I feel that it will only get better from here so I will write this short review, and edit it after I have completed the anime. \r\nWhen I had first started the anime I didn't really know what to expect. The synopsis had led me to believe that it was a classic romance anime with a twist, but I was completely and utterly wrong.\r\nGetting into the anime, the first few episodes I was fairly right. This mademe stop, don't get me wrong it was not because it was bad. But because I could not get into the mood of another \"S-senpai, dai-sukiiii\" moment. There were simply too many. However the story, the plot, and even the romance is much deeper than expected. There have been some scenes where I did not expect one to like the other. The romance was tremendously exceptional, I could not believe how deep and thought out the romance was. It was not the simple rooftop sunset \"senpai, SUKIIII!!!\" It was much more thought out, and had a much more deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nGetting onto the story and plot. Again at first you will expect it to be a classic SUKIII anime. However later into the story you can feel the rising tension, the unexpectedness, the curiosity forcing you to watch the next episode. And once it hits, everything just shatters. Not in a bad way though, its more like an arrow. The further it travels the more of a force it creates, (or maybe I just play too many video games). The story, and plot, also go much further and deeper than I had ever even expected of this anime. Incorporated with the romance, it has officially become one of my top 10 animes, that is, to wait until I have finished it. Except, I won't be expecting anything less from excellence. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI've successfully finished the anime, and I must apologize. This anime is 10 times better than what I had predicted it to be. It did not fail, even at the last few seconds, to disappoint or fail me. As I had expected it had only gotten better from there. It does not fail to disappoint, the surprises, the tied connections that all lead to romance. Everything. Even the new Op had given the arch a proper feel to it, and what you were going to expect. As did the first Op. The whole show was amazing. Every scene was deeper and everything was much more complex but at the same time simplistic. Maybe it was simply simple with deeper meaning, and honestly, who doesn't prefer that. This had been one of the greatest animes I have seen and honestly if this isn't on your top 10, I don't know what else could be.",

Coming from P.A Works the art was beautiful and never did drop in quality. The underwater scenery was beautiful and the land counterpart was nothing less than spectacular.\r\nThe rising trend of romance is prominent in today's time, but this takes it to another level. With the love intertwining to make drama happen and issues through out the series, the characters feel heart break and happiness. They're all really well developed and really shows true character development inthe way they feel towards the differences between the two ways of living and their friendship grows overall. The second half led up to a really good time skip which is usually over done and fails to show purpose in most anime. With it coming to an end it made an impact on the slice of life genre and an innovation in romance.",

Surerly can\u2019t believe \u2018cause, from the beginning you are absorbed in character\u2019s heart and emotions! Love stories are great, and the plot is simply but efficative! In the second Part (starting from ep. 14) the anime improves, it becomes deeper and it makes you think a lot! You\u2019re into every character\u2019s heart, and that\u2019s beautiful \u2018cause you can feel every emotion! It seems that you are living along with the characters! \r\nTechnically is supreme, graphic is amazing and so are OSTs and Openings/Endings! Overall, Nagi no Asukarais an underrated pearl and i strongly reccomand to watch it!",

This anime is about how love can be all sorts of different things for everyone, but that at the end of it all, it's better to love and have loved than to not have known love at all, even if it is one-sided.\r\nI rate this anime 8/10\r\n-Felt a bit too generic attimes.\\n\r\n+The art is exceptionally pretty\\n\\n\r\nAnd, overall, it's well-made, and didn't feel like it wasted too much time on pointless things.",

The sound, art, storyline, HECK, everything was perfect in this anime for me. This is not just some stereotypical high school slice of life, even if it may appear so at first.\r\n      The soundtrack is probably one of the best in any anime i have watched- granted that's not a lot but still. I love how the music echoes the sea themes throughout as well. I fell in love with almostevery character- and cried with them all too. They are beautifully designed; i just cannot express enough how gorgeous PA Works managed to make Nagi-Asu look.\\n\r\n      If all that wasn't enough to convince you (seriously,come on) then if i tell you the storyline is brilliant too you have no choice but to watch it. It isn't just some soppy teenage romance- struggles of all age groups are dealt with. Not to mention the massive plot twist which left me physically awestruck.\\n\r\n      So, go ahead, if you like the themes of this anime then i struggle to see why you won't adore it just as much as i did.",

            "content": "Don't be dissuaded by the immaturity of the characters upon a first glance: despite their seeming like an annoying bunch of teenagers, things get better. We have Hikari, who starts at a low point but grows significantly throughout the show, while there are several other characters (Tsumugu, Kaname, Sayu) whose initially auxiliary appearance gives way for their gradual blossoming. In fact, I think anyone can find at least one character worth rooting for in this show. But characters aside, the technical icing is what makes Nagi-Asu the gem it is \u2013 in terms of visuals it has been one of the most gorgeous series I'veseen. The creators managed to fill their work with sublime moments through a conjunction of masterful artwork, a good script and a tastefully-employed OST. Each of these is wonderfully used in a way that suffuses important scenes with true anime magic and a special atmosphere. It's a world which is familiar to us but is also unique in its own way, tinged with nostalgic, faded blue hues coating the man-made parts of the world, and a marvellous underwater life that makes for some very pleasurable watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe universe isn't the only thing of note. I'll warn that the relationship dynamic is quite the leviathan, with an octagon of unrequited feelings emerging that inevitably won't satisfy everyone once the end is reached \u2013 if you are a person who needs a resoundingly conclusive ending in romantic drama, this might frustrate you. However, I was always happy with how the creators explored their characters' feelings when they open up to each other, as unlike in couple-based shows there are plenty of important characters here, and all are treated with respect by the writers. An apt blend of subtleness and direct dialogue is used to let us know what people are thinking. For a good amount of the show there is a real, ominous feeling of threat as we notice that in this world, much like in ours, people have difficulty seeing through barriers imposed between communities and oppose the right of others to pursue love across them. I'll conclude that on the drama front Nagi-Asu managed to be poignant and tasteful in its execution, and is usually brimming with feels and understated, softly brilliant moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the effect of these was often watered down by tears. Yes, Nagi-Asu indulges too much in the trope of having girls break down in tears or start wailing uncontrollably in order to convey drama, which I just roll my eyes at most of the time, personally. This is something distinctly related to the four primary female characters of the show, who possess interesting facets but sadly end up not breaking free of the conventions of being fragile, exaggeratedly sensitive Moe maidens and therefore not feeling as real as they could. The less well-executed drama of the show usually involves them sobbing or running away, though to be fair they aren't universally bad and have plenty of good and endearing characteristics to compensate for Moe blandness \u2013 there just isn't a single one of them who breaks free of this uninspired basis, which I found unfortunate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll conclude with the following: Nagi no Asukara is a labour of love that has a lot to offer, and I'd recommend it to people looking to give anime romantic drama a go. It has a strong emotional impact with potent storytelling, memorable scenes and characters who are generally endearing and evolving. The artwork, score and dialogue are all first-class. You might be let-down if you are very particular about resolution, and if a slew of brittle female characters aren't your thing. If you want to watch it, please don't write it off immediately based on initially flawed characters or their age, and eventually the waves of this world might just lull you.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10",

It kinda gets bland  after the time skip.\r\nThe anime's animation is such an eye candy, it has a lot of bright colors that makes it bright.The character's design is simple with  characters having big eyes  that makes them quite cute.I did like the color of the eyes,Since I am fond of  color blue. \\n\\n\r\nI also love the OP and ED song of the anime especially OP2 and ED1.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good. I wish they put more emphasis to Tsumugu because I didn't really get to know him as a characters besides that he is not close to his parents, He loves the sea and fell in love with one of the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWell overall, I enjoyed watching it but It could have been better.\\n\\n",

I was pleasantly surprised as it turned out to be better than I had expected.\r\nStory: \r\nI thought that the story was very unique and interesting. When I had originally read the synopsis I was intrigued to see how the story  would unfold. \r\nThe beginning was a little bit slow, and I wasn't sure how it was all going to play out with the typical love square/rectangle element but they managed to keep the story intriguing enough, leaving me wanting to know how it would allend. \\n\r\nFor me personally, I was able to connect emotionally with the story, and was even able to tear up many times throughout the series. P.A Works were able to create some beautiful, emotional and touching scenes which I was very grateful for. \\n\r\nThe only thing I would of enjoyed more was if the ending was a bit more romantic, with clearer final pairings between some of the characters. But overall I was left very satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful in this series. Especially the scenery above all else. They did a great job with the artwork especially of the sea and the towns. \\n\r\nOne of my favourite things of this show was its gorgeous scenery so it's definitely a memorable aspect that fits perfectly with the storyline and its characters. \\n\r\nI liked the characters designs and thought they matched each individual personality well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nFirst off I thought the OP's and ED's were quite tranquil and okay to listen to. I'm usually into more energetic and fun soundtracks, so they weren't my favorite type of opening and ending tracks.\\n\r\nI thought the voices matched well with each individual character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nWith this series I really enjoyed a lot of character development and off course I have my favourites. Throughout this series I always rooted for chisaki more than Manaka.  I found Manaka could be quite annoying with her naivety at times. I kind of found some scenes a bit childish as in a character's way of thinking in a specific scene, but overall I thought that all characters developments from start to finish were satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this series and if a series manages to achieve emotional reactions out if me like Nagi no Asukara did, then that's always a really good sign. \\n\\n\r\nSo I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who wants to enjoy a cute and interesting love story progress between multiple characters set in a stunningly created mix of land and sea beauty.\\n",

Centered primarily around Hikari Sakishima, the story dives into the connections between characters and unveiling the mysteries that inhabit the divided land. As the small circle of friends become exposed to the surface world, new challenges emerge and romance blooms, playing an integral part to the grander tale of acceptance and the inevitabilityof change. \\n\\n\r\nAs part of this new world, the sea people have a special ability called \"Ena,\" which allows them to live and breathe underwater. Their dwindling population and their distrust towards the surface world are the main sources of conflict that take sometimes drastic turns to overcome. Much of the story focuses on the tension between the two peoples and the character's actions in the larger scale of things. The \"Ofunehiki,\" a type of festival to honor the Sea God, plays a central role in the story, tying together the myths and legends that will inevitably affect both the sea and land. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a certain mysteriousness to the series, much like the sea is vast and sometimes difficult to understand. Though the school lives of the characters are fun and lighthearted, dealing with things like first loves and crushes, there is a darkness that is added to the story drop by drop. Hints at the true extent of the dire situation the sea and land people find themselves in are revealed piece by piece, until the legend of the \"Ofunehiki\" finally ties it all together. Through the friends' struggle with maintaining the status quo among themselves and trying to help their dying community, they realize just how powerful change can affect both themselves and the world around them. \\n\\n\r\nTying in with the aquatic theme of the series, the artwork and setting is quite simply, stunning. Everything in this world revolves around the ocean. The sleepy seaside town on the surface is beautifully drawn and animated, with details radiating just as bright as the sun reflecting on the ocean. The water sparkles and illuminates patterns of swirling color and a certain clearness that looks very refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe real treat however, is the scenes underwater. Taking advantage of the setting completely, fantastical lights and water bathe the underwater village Shioshishio in a beautiful light. Look closely enough and images of the sun will appear, schools of fish will swim by and saltflake snow will fall from the surface. Certain scenes left me amazed. The water is manipulated in whatever way the mood demands, whether it is used to reflect the sun peacefully or surround us in a violent prison of crystal and lights. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly cannot fully describe the setting perfectly with only words; it's that beautiful. Look at a few screenshots yourself and see just how much attention and detail are put into the animation and setting! The Ofunehiki was one of the most visually stunning scenes I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\r\nEven the music is centered around the ocean. The opening themes are \"lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~\" and \"ebb and flow\" both by Ray, and the endings themes are \"Aqua Terrarium\" and \"Mitsuba no Musubime\" both by Yanagi Nagi. All of the songs have a certain aquatic sound to them that reminds one of the ocean. I really enjoy \"Aqua Terrarium\" the most out of the songs. Hearing this song at the end of every episode, with its brilliant buildup and vocals gave a very satisfying end to another amazing visual and end revelation. \\n\\n\r\n\"Nagi no Asukara\" is an amazing series that has a lot of ambition to go along with it. It is a story of learning to deal with change and accepting our differences. Just like the wave of the tide, the ebb and flow of change can sweep us underneath it and overwhelm us. Other times it will peacefully pass by us without a care in the world. We see how each character deals with their confused thoughts of love and friendship as the world around them starts to collapse.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it all begins to be too much to bear, whisper your secrets to a red bellied slug and let your worries drift away like the shifting ocean tides. \\n",

            "content": "People have told me that Nagi no Asukara is P.A Works' one of -- if not -- their best anime that they have ever produced. Since I'm not the kind of person who jumps in the hype ship right away and that the cover totally put me off because I thought this was going to be some mermaid crap, I ignored this show for a while until I finally decided to watch the series. I can totally say that this is one of P.A Works' best anime ever. \r\n[Story]: (8.5/10)\r\nWhen I first looked at the cover and read the synopsis, I thought this series wasgoing to flop from the start. I mean, I thought this was going to be a high-school romantic drama cliche expect they live underwater. Now that I have finished the series, what I got was different from what I expected. I expected mermaids and shit and what I got was a show that explores themes like racism and a beautiful (but not the greatest) romantic drama that made me shed tears a few times. \\n\\n\r\nTo some people, the early first half of the series was extremely boring and honestly, I don't blame them. I understand that they're setting up the world, the characters and a lot of expositions so we can understand why there are people in the surface and in the sea. They surprisingly did a good job explaining the history behind the 2 separated human race. That doesn't make the early first half of the series less boring so that's what you gotta watch out if you're planning to watch this series.  \\n\\n\r\nYou know how in real life, even though we're all humans, we still hate each other for absurd reasons such as different cultures, different skin colours, and etc? Nagi no Asukara did not ignore that part of our reality. Even though both races in the show are humans, they're still different and are divided because one can breath underwater and one cannot. As such, the underwater people are always frowned upon by the surface people since they think they are a superior race. Just like how the white people, back in the day, thought they were more of a superior race than black people. \\n\r\nAnyways, the show did a great job exploring the strained relationship between these 2 similar yet different human races. For example, when the main characters' underwater school shutdown, they transferred into a school that's in a surface. The students in that school would constantly make fun of/bully the main characters just because they're a bit different than them. \\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't afraid to make changes...huge changes to advance the plot and we clearly see this at the second half when a show did a time skip because of what the characters did in the first half. The world around them changes significantly and it looked like they were hit with an apocalypse.  Honestly, I have a love and hate relationship with the second half of the series. I love the second half because of how much the characters are explored and developed. Literally every single main characters in the second half was developed to a certain extent and no one, and I mean no one was left behind in terms of character development. I also have a hate.......hate may be a strong word so I'll use; I disliked the second half's love triangles.   \\n\\n\r\nIf I were asked to summarize Nagi no Asukara's romance in one sentence then I would say something like this:\\n\r\n\"Sometimes we love the person who ignores us and we ignore the person who loves us\". \\n\r\nI have never seen so much love triangles in an anime before..The maximum amount of love triangles that I have seen is about 2 and that's it. In Nagi no Asukara, most of the main characters are in love with someone and there's like over 5 love triangles..Gah, I don't even know because there's a lot and when I try counting, it confuses the hell out of me. The love triangle isn't as simple as other romantic shows out there like Toradora. Just by looking at one of the love triangle maps for this show, you'll see it's spread out like a goddamn spiderweb and don't even bother trying to trace the line because it will cause you major headaches. I'm actually not a fan of love triangles so I can only handle about 1 or 2 and that's why I was pissed off when they introduced countless love triangles in the second half. There is a reason why I didn't hate it though (Note: There's a difference between me hating something and disliking something). It's because all love triangles eventually got solved at the end, meaning someone will be with somebody. Be it being outright shown to the viewers or are just implied/left to the viewer's speculation. \\n\\n\r\nAnother small issue that I have with the show is because of the amount of love triangles in the series, there are melodramatic scenes here that are way too unbearable for me to watch. Unbearable in a sense that I would sometimes skip it because it's way too dramatic and sometimes unnecessary because they could have done it the other way instead of all the shouting and running away. There's only so much drama that I can handle. Nonetheless, they still did a pretty good job with most of the dramatic scenes which is one of the main strengths of the show. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nOne of the many things I've heard about this show is its amazing and boner-approved \"Scenery Porn\". I agree with them..The art looks gorgeous as f*ck, the animation is smooth and it's consistent all the time and the character designs are your usual P.A Works \"Character Design style\". The surface looks almost realistic and the underwater city and the water itself is simply amazing. The studio is really living up to their name. \"Progressive\" Animation Works. Progressive....sound's about right. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the show's soundtrack since none stood out for me..Though, they were all pretty decent and they weren't that bad. Especially the OSTs that plays during the dramatic/emotional scenes. Now the OP and ED theme song(s).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~\" by Ray and \"ebb and flow\" by Ray . The ED theme songs are \"Aqua Terrarium\" by Nagi Yanagi and \"Mitsuba no Musubime\" by Nagi Yanagi. I've heard Ray's songs before and after hearing both OP's, I have now come to the conclusion that most of her songs sounds almost the same but I honestly don't care. The 1st OP is pretty relaxing and captures the atmosphere the 1st half has and the 2nd OP fits with the changes that occurred in Nagi no Asukara's world. It's like you know something sad or dramatic is going to happen. I could care less about the ED theme songs because both are just plain average to me and didn't really catch my attention. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nJust by watching the first half of the series, I can guarantee you that there is a 100% chance, not 99%....100% chance that you will hate the main protagonist of the series whose name is Hikari Sakishima. Honestly, I almost dropped the show because of this little f*cker who has a serious anger management issues and to make things worse, screaming at the girls for absurd reasons. The latter was so uncomfortable to watch because it was like watching a father abusing his wife except Hikky is just shouting and not using his fists at the girls. His over protectiveness over Manaka is also super annoying and this relates to Hikky shouting at the girls which in this case is Manaka. Puberty was hitting him like a bitch in the first half. In the second half, he did turn out to be one of the most likable main characters in the series. In the second half, his character matured, his personality got better and he turned into a guy who will sacrifice (not literally) himself to save the people he truly cares about. He still have some few anger management issues that he needs to deal with but at the end, he turned out to be a great and likable character. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the major things I love about Nagi no Asukara is its character relationships. It's evident how much they explored the character relationships in the first half and even more so when a time skip occurred and explored more of the character's relationships. For example, in the first half, they explored Chisaki and Kaname's relationship and in the second half, they explored Chisaki and Tsumugu's relationship. Since the show had 26 episodes and a slow pacing, the show had abundance amount of time to do all the exploring they need.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nIn the end, I still enjoyed this series even though some of the elements in the first half pissed me off that almost caused me to drop this show. The visuals are really amazing, the story is great and I ended up liking most of the main characters in the second half. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is a visually appealing series that does a good job at both romance and drama even if both aspects have something in it that I disliked.  It also does a great job at building and exploring the characters and the relationships between them. The show might not be as sad as AnoHana or Your Lie in April or it might not be as romantically engaging as other romantic shows out there but nonetheless, it's still an anime worth watching if you're interested in a romantic drama series. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+One of P.A Works' best anime that they have ever made\\n\r\n+Does a great job handling subjects like racism\\n\r\n+The show isn't afraid to make huge changes to advance the plot and develop the characters \\n\r\n+One of the best visuals and animation I have ever seen\\n\r\n+Great OP theme songs\\n\r\n+Character development for every single main characters in the series\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Too much love triangles\\n\r\n-Some melodramatic scenes\\n\r\n-Hikky is a dislikable main character in the first half",

Our main protagonist hikari likes makana but hikari thinks that makana love tsumugu but later on in the near end it was reveal that makana love hikari and their still two females that love our main protagonistand that's chisaki my bias for hikari and miuna also want her for hikari 'cause she reminded me of sugu of sword art online and yui as well and also if feels like i'm watching sword art online 'cause both 2nd half of the story are very similar you will recognize it as soon you see it..\\n\\n\r\nI'm very disappointed in the pairings at the end 'cause chisaki was not chosen by hikari nor miuna 'cause both love hikari very deeply but the problem is hikari he only wants one girl and that's manaka but still hoping that he choose chisaki 'cause i don't want chisaki to end up with tsumugu nor kaname ... i hate if someone trying to steal hikari's harem hahaha and also want some twist pairings that the writer and director will shock you that another girl was chosen not the main female lead... like in fairy tail natuxerza..... still hoping.......'cause you'll never know what might happen.. but then again hikari still choose manaka 'cause maybe they don't want to pair another incest nor older women to hikari 'cause hikari and miuna are niece and uncle while chisaki was not involve in the hibernation process and live at the surface and that's why she is know 5 years older to hikari 'cause hikari was asleep and didn't age at all 'cause hirkari wakes up after 5 years...\\n\\n\r\nPS: This anime will be 55x very awesome if Hikari and Chisaki end up together..... to bad it didn't happen 'cause they are perfect for each other and very suited for each other :-( ahhhhhhhhh....I'm very disappointed 'cause I'm rooting for Chisaki and Hikari all the way 'cause i want them to be together forever ..,...............,....................4ever Happy Together.................",

            "content": "(Mostly spoiler-free but be wary if you're one of those people that hates any type of spoiler)\r\n\"This world is filled with so many shining feelings.\"\r\nNagi no Asukara, an original story by P.A. Works is an unequivocal tale about harmony and relentless sacrifice. Now, Nagi no Asukara was not something that I was expecting nor hyped up for. It was just a series that was there, had an interesting unique premise, and an original story which was the selling point for me since most anime these days are adaptations of manga and light novels. The series in my opinion, was quietly hiding behind the giants ofGolden Time and Kill la Kill (both of which were great shows of the season by the way) like a diamond in the rough. I started watching it and the first things that caught my eye were the amazing visuals and poignant story line I felt it was going for. The visuals stayed true but I could have never been more wrong about the story. After watching more episodes because of these factors, I had begun to realize that this show was something more; something that constantly managed to draw me in like the ebb and flow of the sea. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most important thing of any show, the story for Nagi no Asukara is simply put, outstanding. The setting is just amazing. When I first got into the show, the premise immediately stuck out to me. A quaint little town at the bottom of the ocean in conflict with the people of the surface? Why not. Most shows these days, despite the occasional great ones, have very drab and predictable story lines because they follow almost every anime trope in the book. With Nagi no Asukara however, the story plays with your emotions from start to finish and it always leaves you wanting for more just to see how the characters might develop next or to see how the main plot might progress. The heroes of this tale are five friends who in essence just want to stay together. Much like the tumultuous sea however, they soon realize that it's becoming increasingly harder for them to relate. Nevertheless, from overcoming simple obstacles to massive tribulations, the gang does whatever it takes for them to stick together, no matter the cost. That is my summary of the plot without spoiling too much and I feel like this story is one of the most unique and memorable narratives I have ever seen unfold, ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are key and rest assured, Nagi no Asukara doesn't pull any punches when it comes to this category. The characters are the soul for this show. They breathe life into this beautiful world which otherwise would be dead without them. Watching the characters that you sympathize for and love is like magic. They were all so equally developed and perfect that I could not pick out my favorite or best girl for that matter. Hikari like his name, is the light and strength of his friends, always headstrong but maybe a little stubborn with his will to protect. Manaka is the innocence and purity exemplified out of this group, constantly worrying about her friends and loving them all unconditionally. Chisaki symbolizes maturity and sensitivity. She is logical unlike a lot of her somewhat immature friends but she is sometimes blinded by sheer emotions which is shown many times throughout the series. Kaname, the voice of friendship is the friend who always has everyone's back even though it might sting like cold iron for him. Tsumugu, the only one from the surface, is depicted as stoic and sympathizing. Although he suffers from showing a lack of emotions, he is always the one that can talk to the others and relate to them in some way. There are many other prominent characters like Sayu, the sarcastic but strong-willed lady, and Miuna, the one who is like the sea, but the five friends are definitely in my opinion, the inseparable five that really make the show shimmer and gleam. There is quite a bit of romance in the story and you can see how love triangles and what not can be formed with these characters but I believe that friendship and just being there for one another is more noteworthy and important as the story goes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nUnparalleled eye candy, just plain gorgeous. P.A. Works must have pulled out all the stops for this one because the visuals for this show are just jaw-dropping. From the beautiful sky shots to the shimmering refraction of light underwater, the animation and cinematography in this show are top-notch. The character designs are amazing as well especially the characters from Shioshishio (the underwater town) with their unique uniforms and their deep mesmerizing azure eyes. I don't think there's much to say about this category other than that the visuals are outstanding. I definitely recommend you to watch it in the highest quality available to truly immerse yourself underwater and into this gleaming world. The architecture is also very interesting in my opinion and the OP's and ED's are just so damn beautiful. Underwater in my opinion, is difficult to depict well and I feel like P.A. Works really outdid themselves in providing an immense amount of detail from the glistening bubbles to the glimmering reflections of the sky. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good. The songs for the two OP's and the two ED's are both amazing, the OP's done by Ray and the ED's done by one of my favorite singers, Nagi Yanagi. The soundtrack as well does an excellent job in translating the feelings shown on the screen. The voice acting is great too featuring Hanazawa Kana (I love anything done by her) and many other extremely talented voices. The detail from the echoes of voices under the deep to the ambiance of school and city life, really shine through and you'd be surprised to hear many pleasant sounds and songs. As for favorite ED and OP's, the second OP is my favorite OP of all time this season and the second ED is extremely beautiful as well. You do not know how I excited I was to watch the second OP premiere for the first time; I was like the kid in the candy store with $50. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n11/10 is impossible but my overall enjoyment was immense. Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much from it but I watched this weekly, never missing an episode because everything about this show was so wonderfully done. Now there might be some hiccups here and there for some people since not everyone can have the same opinions but in my humble opinion, this show was simply amazing. As strange as it may sound, this show gave my eyes a new light on certain perspectives and how relationships are so important and how they can be so damn powerful. The rewatch value is immense as well since the story has so much detail that you definitely might not pick up the first run through. I'm sure as hell gonna rewatch it soon to immerse myself into this atmosphere once more.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Nagi no Asukara is an endearing tale about love, friendship, and prejudice. The characters are amazing and the setting is all too amazing coupled with great writing and music. I cannot stress enough that this anime is just plain stunning and is going to my top five favorite anime of all time. I know this review wasn't too great and I did not elaborate too much on the logistics of the actual plot and what not but take my word for it and dive into the amazing world of Nagi no Asukara and I promise you that you won't surface without being pleasantly surprised at the sheer amount of detail and thought-provoking complexities Nagi no Asukara has to offer. Thank you for reading my review and I really hope this gave Nagi no Asukara a chance for you. \\n\\n\r\nLike a lull in the sea, the ebb and flow of my mind ties into a trefoil knot in this aqua terrarium.",

            "content": "This anime had me tearing up and loving one of the side characters who didn't get as much love. It's an anime about humans and sub humans who live under water. They breathe underwater but can also be on land. It doesn't make them look any different than the humans but it still put a huge rift over something that happened a long time ago. \r\nThe story is about four kids from under the sea and a human boy going to school. The slice of life aspect of it is sweet and entertaining. It's a typical anime in that genre. However, the whole living underthe sea makes it different. The main girl (the red head) falls in love with the human boy the instant she sees him. The romance is typical as well in it for the most part but towards the end it takes a lovely twist that you don't really expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is emotional and pulls on your heart strings. The characters don't really stand out too much but together they are all so lovely. The story is rich and one could easily get lost in the world. The animation is beautiful though they do look a bit too childish for high school kids, it's a style the animators and manga picked. The backgrounds and scenery's are honestly the most beautiful things other than the story in the anime. I found myself staring at the surroundings sometimes more than the actual characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is a great anime with a lot of twists and drama. They have a lot of characters and all of them feel for the most part developed. Though I would have loved to see more of certain ones. If you want an anime that will probably make you cry then I suggest giving this one a try.",

            "content": "The first time I watched Nagi no Asukara (from now on, NagiAsu), I thought it was the best thing ever.  I gave it a 9, putting it in one of my favorite shows ever.  I waxed poetic about the deep messages, the compelling story, and the well-developed characters.  \r\nThen I watched it the second time and I peeled my eyes to look for things I could say to convince others to watch it.  I didn\u2019t find any.  My opinion of the show dropped through the floor.  Why?  I didn\u2019t notice this the first time, but NagiAsu is actuallythe most annoying show ever.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the good parts: P.A. Works is probably the best studio, in my opinion.  Its art features a level of detail and fluidity unmatched by any other studio, save for maybe ufotable.  Where it excels past ufotable is in character design: ufotable\u2019s characters look like they are mannequins, but P.A. Works\u2019 character designs are just perfect.  As a result, NagiAsu\u2019s production values are exceptional.  In addition, the story has one of the best settings I have ever seen.  NagiAsu is set in a modern world where a segment of the population lives in the sea, since they can breathe underwater, and the other segment lives on land.  It\u2019s a setting that is brilliant, and P.A. Works really makes it come to life in the beautiful backgrounds it makes.  Finally, NagiAsu has one of the best soundtracks I have listened to. \\n\\n\r\nWhere NagiAsu fails is both in its plot and its characters.  I thought the story and the characters were good the first time around, but on second thought, they were actually just annoying.  Here\u2019s an outline of what goes on during the show:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tPeace\\n\r\n2.\tSome character has to start shit\\n\r\n3.\tDrama ensues\\n\r\n4.\tDrama resolved\\n\r\n5.\tReturn to beginning\\n\\n\r\nThere are interesting developments happening behind this that are related to the amazing setting of this show, but in the end, the plot revolves around this outline.  So the characters ruin the plot and the plot ruins the characters.  It\u2019s a never-ending cycle of doom.  However, rather than getting you to hate these annoying characters for doing annoying things, they invoke the power of cute girls/guys and convince you that they are actually nice people.  But the moment you start asking \u201cwhy\u201d, you\u2019ll find it all deeply unsatisfying.  People are crying, things are sad, you feel bad for them\u2026all until you realize it is entirely their fault and they actually deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s annoying how so many anime use cute as an excuse for problems in the show.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with cute; I like cute things, but it shouldn\u2019t be used as something to cover up flaws.  It should be used more like a finisher, a topping.  But if cute is continually successfully used to cover up flaws, what are writers assuming about us?  I don\u2019t like that they\u2019re looking down on us like this.  We\u2019re not this easy to impress.  We want actual quality.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you get annoyed at people being annoying, don\u2019t watch.  If you\u2019re tolerant toward bullshit drama, by all means watch.\\n",

Having many episodes downloaded is somehow irritating to me to 'drop this anime!', knowing how much money I spent in Internet cafe downloading this show. Well, just a preface, but then, I am not sure how to put it, I began to love it.\r\nThe story progresses well, very well indeed. The port town isn't something new, still the show makes it possible to 'renew' the usual plot port town concept. A remarkable thing in the story is the romance progress, makes it even greater (Is it possible someone much youngerthan you and loves you, then she/he becomes a peer to you?).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is commendable, I should say. Just take a look at the cover or simply watch the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme song as well as the ending theme song never cease to amuse me every time I listen and hear. The voice acting goes well, the female leads, primary my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime develop greatly. You'll definitely like it the time you start watching. Not to mention their cute expressions.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll enjoy the anime to the fullest starting the new opening theme comes, of course with some new features added in it.\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is a worth-watching anime for you who loves teenage romance, fantasy-yet-realistic life, and stuff. It's a great anime, a master piece indeed.",

            "content": "Well to start things off, I'd just like to point out that this is my first review, so don't go all salty on me if i say something wrong.\r\nStory:\r\nWell everyone pack your bags because we're going on a feel trip! \r\nThe story is centered in a fantasy world where the sea just about the most important thing. Everyone comes from the sea and those who still live in it worship the sea God, as do those on the land, but not as greatly. The story is deeply driven by the characters. Personally, I love these types of stories. This anime was an emotional roller coasterfor me, which I haven't experience anything similar to it, since I've watched Clannad and Anohana or anything similar. One last thing, if you think love triangles are insane, you're in for a treat! I won't say anything else about it or else I'd consider it a spoiler, but you'll realize it if you go ahead and just watch this work of art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Art:\\n\r\nI'm just going to mix these two categories together since I don't have too much to say about the art. The art was amazing, they did not get lazy on the detail. I am a big stickler for art, yet I don't really know how to describe haha. Well onto the characters, at first I though they weren't anything special, the hot headed hero and the childish girl, okay maybe I didn't think it that lowly, but bear with  me. Hikari, Manaka, and the rest of the cast proved to be very likeable characters. Oh did I mention? The cast was HUGE! Maybe not as insane as some people would picture it, but it was a pretty good size. For the most part, the main characters had each developed in their own way, for the better. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs had really fit the bill in this anime. I didn't really find them too special, but that could just me. Don't get me wrong, they were fantastic, but they did not stick out too much for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm sure you couldn't have guessed by my high scores and praise, that I love this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime had everything for me, but though it was really good for me, I definitely don't think this anime is for everyone. I do recommend for anyone looking for a deep story and character development to pick up this anime. Don't just watch the first couple of episodes and decide if you'll watch it or not, give it some time and you'll be sucked into the series just like was. Well, that was my first review, thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Before reading this, bear in mind that a review by its very definition is supposed to include the writer\u2019s opinion. While it is impossible to be completely objective in writing this review, I\u2019ll back up my opinions of this show with appropriate reasoning. \r\nStory 7/10 \r\nThe premise of Nagi no Asakura is that humans originally began as sea dwellers, having a thin membrane called Ena around them that enabled them to breath underwater. However, some humans started settling on the surface where they discarded their Ena. Thus, two different communities were created. Our story beings in the underwater sea village Shioshishio. The local middle schoolis being closed for some reason, which results in four middle schoolers having to go to school on the surface.  They face issues adjusting to the surface, and the interaction shown between them and the surface dwellers seems to be a very clear reflection of the differences between people of different cultures. They even have the equivalents of racial epithets; 'pig' for the land dwellers and 'fish' for the sea dwellers. With the basic synopsis out of the way, lets try to evaluate the story. The premise is quite unique, and the relations between the sea and surface dwellers, and their differences, provide an interesting dynamic in the start. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it seems as if the major plot developments only took place to make the already contrived love triangle(s?) even more contrived. Its more of a love hexagon than a triangle. Never have I seen or heard of such a messy and silly love triangle in any form of media. At a first glance, it seems that the anime wanted to drive home the message that change should be accepted, and that some things are beyond our control, but in the end the message devolved into shounen style antics which basically say that screaming and willpower can change anything and everything. The ending was conclusive as far as dramas and romances go. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime has multiple main characters, Hikari is very obviously the protagonist. He gets the most screen time, and the viewer gets to hear his inner thoughts. The main reason I\u2019m giving this anime such a low rating in the characters department is Hikari. Hikari was the typical stubborn, loudmouthed, determined protagonist that has been done to death in anime, and frankly, I find myself quite tired of them. The other characters weren\u2019t bad, but they didn\u2019t particularly stand out either, with almost every other main character having the annoying tendency to be a martyr for the sake of others, only to create more misunderstandings. Though Tsumugu did serve as a very good foil for Hikari.  One thing very annoying in this anime about the main characters was that when a character would hear anything that they didn\u2019t want to hear, they would \u2026 run away. It happened too many times to even count, and it ended up being extremely annoying . While I am aware of the fact that this is a fantasy anime, a drama relies on the characters and the interactions between them being realistic and natural. In this case, they were unrealistic, and felt quite unnatural . Who runs away at hearing something a little uncomfortable?!  Yes, they pull it once or twice in drama heavy animes, but it was done wayyyy too many times here. One good thing about the main characters was that they weren't forgetful. Despite having so many main characters, it was surprisingly easy to keep track of them all. Furthermore, the side characters were great. They performed their role of aiding the character development of the main characters quite well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound really made this anime seem better than it really was. While I found the rest of the soundtrack to be well done but forgetful, the first ending is one of the best endings that I have ever heard to an anime. During the first half, as the episode would near the end, you could hear the beginnings of this song and given the situation, it just went perfectly with the anime. The voice acting was pretty good though, although I personally found the voice for Manaka to be a bit too childlike and high pitched at times.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very colorful, and quite beautifully animated. I really liked the underwater sections. However, it was also a bit too cutesy, with the characters having very huge eyes, and the females having an inexplicable, constant blush on their cheeks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, it became a chore to watch this anime. I had to finish it, because I was invested in the story, but I grew increasingly frustrated by the characters by each passing episode, especially by Hikari, which sucked since he was the main character. Oftentimes, it felt that the characters liked Hikari only because the plot required them to like him. I tried to like this anime, but I really couldn\u2019t. While I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that I regret watching this anime, watching it felt somewhat of a waste. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is primarily a drama romance, with fantasy only existing to serve both these story elements. It had an interesting story , but the whole love hexagon felt pretty convoluted. There were many cliches in this anime that are unfortunately found way too often in dramas. It has some pretty art and interesting music which serves to make this anime look better than it actually is, but I found some parts of the story and a few character to be lacking in depth. It also suffered from poor pacing in the start. However, viewers who aren't annoyed by your typical protagonist, and generally like drama heavy romances will probably like this anime. I personally think that that the 8.43 avg rating this anime has on MAL is way too generous. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to pm me if you think I missed something in the anime, or if there was something really wrong with the way I wrote this review",

            "content": "An interesting series with an unusual twist -- people living like fish underwater -- but fails to deliver quality in so many ways.  \r\nReally, I wanted to love this series.  The characters are really interesting and well developed in the story line, and we come to know a lot about many of them.  But that's one of the few positive comments I have for this story.\r\nSo what didn't work?\r\n1.  Basic science.  You cannot cook with flame under water.  You cannot see tears on people's faces underwater.  You cannot see clouds clearly underwater.  The whole idea of livingunderwater being exactly the same as living on the surface, except that you have fish in the sky instead of birds -- is a real stretch to accept, but okay, lets accept it and move on...\\n\\n\r\n2. The whole interaction with The Scale of the Sea God.  It never really made any sense.  How can we accept that everyone's fates are ruled over by a moody vengeful sea god who communicates through an arrogant, haughty, lazy shrine spirit?\\n\\n\r\n3. Too many love triangles.  This show was love triangle OVERLOAD.  Every single one of the main characters was dealing with an object of affection that was either actually or perceived to be in love with another person.  It was just too much to swallow, and frankly turned an otherwise really good drama into a tragic parody of one.\\n\\n\r\n4. The main character Hikari is too loud and too angry most of the time.  Its very hard to really like him as a person when he's always fighting with everyone.  It is only late in the series does he become nice enough to actually like.\\n\\n\r\n5. None of the main circle of friends honestly shares their feelings, which creates even more problems for everyone.  Ok, this is a personal pet peeve about Japanese anime of the romance/drama genre.  People are too afraid to be honest, and the story goes from tortured bad to tortured worse.  Incredibly frustrating for the viewer.  Kind of like watching the girl in a haunted house decide that its a good idea to go down into the root cellar.   Come ON!  Give us a break.  Please!!\\n\\n\r\nHere's my bottom line.  If you like high-school romance stories, you will probably enjoy this series, at least a little.  It does have some interesting and unique moments, especially involving time travel into the future by some of the group.  Just be prepared for lots of loose ends and tortured turn-downs during confessions of feelings.\\n",

            "content": "For the first time ever I have decided to submit a review for a anime.\r\nWish me good luck!\r\nWhen reading my review it's good to keep in mind that my own love life is lacking severely and have been for a really long time.\r\nIt's impossible to adress the faults of Nagi no Asukara without getting into\r\nthe couples and how it all ends up so don't keep reading unless you are ready for spoilers.\r\nIt all begins in a interesting setting and I really liked this show at some points as well as for the most part.\r\nMy problem with Nagi no Asukara you ask?\r\nFacts that gets established inthe beginning part of this show will be twisted to go with the lackluster ending of this trainwreck concerning almost all of the love interests.\\n\\n\r\nManaka loves Tsumugu in the beginning, right? Nope, not according to this shows second part anyway. It almost pretends it never happened, or certainly doesn't adress it very well. \\n\r\nRemember the part where Hikari holds Manaka and she rejects him or the part where she screams that she \"doesn't understand that\" after he told her he loves her?\\n\r\nNever adressed properly either.\\n\r\nEven after all of this the show still insists that she does love Hikari.\\n\r\nIT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!\\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't bad enough Tsumugu that you slowly accepts as Manaka's love interest then falls in love with Chisaki and she also falls for him.\\n\r\nI was speechless, what the heck where the creators thinking?!\\n\\n\r\nSince they completly ruined the possibility of a happy ending with Manaka and Hikari with the Tsumugu-bit could they at least end the show with Hikari and Chisaki? Nope, also ruined with the Tsumugu-bit. Ok then... so Hikari and Miuna would be cute together?, Apparently not!\\n\r\nThat would give the viewer pleasure, and we couldn't that have that now could we.\\n\\n\r\nI am probably trying to hard with finding hapiness in love in anime shows\\n\r\nbut the sensible way of pairing in this show would be as follows.\\n\\n\r\nManaka and Hikari (until Tsumugu appears)\\n\r\nManaka and Tsumugu (After Tsumugu appears)\\n\r\nChisaki and Hikari (After Tsumugu appears)\\n\r\nChisaki and Kaname (After Tsumugu appears would also be fine)\\n\r\nMiuna and Hikari (After having decided to keep watching this show to the end even though it does what it does at every turn)\\n\\n\r\nThe only pairing I liked was Sayu and Kaname. \\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor when watching this show, do NOT expect Hikari to end up with anyone because he won't. \\n\r\nHe simply goes on with his feelings towards his love interest.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and goodnight!",

            "content": "Love is just like the sea, full of change, motion and sadness.\r\nAnimated by PA Works, Nagi No Asukara follows a group of middle schoolers as they transfer to a dry land school when their own one, located in the underwater village, is forced to close due to a lack of attendance. While the visuals and setting suggests a slice of life type of show, it is an engaging and emotional drama about people coming into terms about their feelings and relationships. In terms of storyline, the 26 episodes runtime is spread with racial tensions, love triangles left, right and center and a supernatural element thrownin. There are mundane events that happen, which is are shared among all the anime of this type, but it is always in service of driving and developing the characters and their relationships with one another.\\n\\n\r\nHaving done work on fan favourite shows like Angel Beats! and The Eccentric Family, PA Work's visuals do not disappoint in the least. The background art is lavishly detailed and colored to match the season, whether it take place in the summer or wintertime. The surface town is based off a real seaside town in Japan and is faithfully recreated in the anime. On the other hand, the underwater village of Shioshishio is created to resemble a Greek seaside villa, completed with pristine stone white houses that layered on top of each other. What makes this show stand apart from its peers is the way the lighting and water effects play with the scenery and characters from the way the sunlight filters through the seawater and the reflective light as it interacts with various materials. Equally important is the way the animators portrays the lack of lighting, which translates into detailed and shifting shadows, heavy contrast between lighted and shaded areas and the muted sun of the wintertime.\\n\\n\r\nA drama lives and dies by its characters. Otherwise it just become another show with pretty background work. Thankfully, Nagi No Asukara also boasts very well-designed and realized characters in spite of the fact that the main cast consists of a bunch of 14 year olds. Each character contribute their own identity into the group dynamics and drive it in their own unique way. At the same time, their flaws also come into play making it feels a lot less in the cast being  shoehorned into pre-established archetypes and more like a group of real teenagers struggling through their trials. Initially, a few characters are bit annoying and unlikable but as the series ran its course, good execution of character development makes it much easier for the viewer to attach and identity at least one redeeming trait in everyone. For example, Hikari's bullish and aggressive nature put him at odds with many people and more often than not, ends up in direct conflict. At the same time, his traits allows the story to propel forward and tries his absolute hardest in everything that he does. The same thing can extend to all the other main characters in where they excel and where their imperfections lie.\\n\\n\r\nAs flawed and complex as each character is, there are some logic gaps in some of their actions and thought processes that may annoy some viewers. However, this being a show where emotions run high and painful memories weight heavily, logical reasoning is probably in low supply all around. Supporting characters that are not part of the five core characters do a commendable job of interweaving their own experiences within the overall narrative. Standouts include Hikari's sister, who offers an adult experience in completing her coming-of-age stage of life and two elementary schoolgirls who play a much bigger role than what it might initially seem.  \\n\\n\r\nEqually as strong as the characters being portrayed are voice actors performing in their own respective roles. The female VAs give off a soft tone and match up well with their characters while the male VAs are more diverse in playing the hot-headed Hikari, and perceptive Kaname and aloof Tsumugu. By using the piano as the basis for much of the soundtrack and being supported by string instruments, the musical score is rather melancholic whether it is playing during a day of shopping or one of the series' more intense moments. As a result, the soundtrack flows through and with the scenery and never becomes overbearing. In particular, the two openings and closings are well-put together as the first OP and ED is reflective of the carefree and mysterious atmosphere of the first half. In contrast, a dark and ominous presence permeates the second OP and ED as the story comes full circle to its conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara shares many traits with the 5 Centimetre per Second movie in terms of glorious visual and subject matter. One of the strongest connections that these two pieces of work share is how they handle relationships on a physical, emotional and temporal level. Instead of physical distance being portrayed in 5 cm, being measured in kilometres, Nagi's physical distance is based off of the biological divide between surface and sea dwellers. Those with Ena (something that allows people to breath underwater) are always in tension with those that do not process Ena as they compete for relevance and relationships. Unrequited love is another main theme in which all characters experience, as they long for someone else who has eyes for another. Out of the three relational levels, this is the most prominent as it forms most of the tension in the character interactions and is underlying motive for plot progression. Finally, the passage of time plays a big role in having certain characters coming to terms that relationship do change over time and feelings will shift from one person to another. Where 5 cm per Second methodically goes through each form of distance over its one hour run-time, I find it fascinating how these three forms of distances comes together constantly in Nagi no Asukara and its effects on a much larger cast. Much like the sea, the themes swirls and moves from one characters to another, flowing differently for each individual. \\n\\n\r\nIn the ocean of anime being produced in recent years, Nagi no Asukara stands tall and unwavering in both its genre and the Fall 2013/Winter 2014 season.\\n",

I also loved how they expressed their feelings since most anime's usually beat around the bush but not this one! really great anime in every factor. There were a good mix of funny and sad moments and also plot twists that you would not expect. The character growth is really balanced and great as well. The only thing you have to getused to is the underwater living style. The ending was also absolutely great. This is a must watch anime and would recommend to everyone!!",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara was a pleasant surprise.\r\nI watched one episode a long time ago, but then I realised it was still airing so I just waited untill it had finished. Once it finished, I started watching, the first few episodes were OK. But then came the big plot of the story and I got really addicted to this anime. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nI don't want to tell too much about the story because then it wouldn't suprise you as much and maybe it wouldn't touch you as much as it did me, not knowing what would happen.\r\nWhat I will tell you:\r\nHikari, Kaname, Chisaki and Manaka live ina sea village, but go to school on the surface. They get to know Tsumugu and other people from the surface. In the beginning, Hikari finds it hard to accept that they will have to get along with the people from the surface. Hikari, Kaname, Chisaki and Manaka slowly start to fit in with the people from the surface. Then, there's a threat coming closer. The people from the surface and of the sea village try to prevent the threat from happening. What will happen to them?\\n\\n\r\nI won't tell you any more, because after this a big part of the story will be spoiled. It's really good and very touching.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nWhy do I like this art so much? Maybe because everything looks so alive. The sea looks almost real, everything is well-drawn. The colour of the eyes of the people from the sea is blue, while those of the surface isn't. The art gave this anime a special touch, and I really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI suppose I just can't help it that I like the songs so much, especially the ending songs. The sound also fitted the situations really well, and I think some music gives a 'special feeling', just like the art did.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEveryone is different, and so were the characters of Nagi no Asukara.\\n\r\nHere's a short discription:\\n\r\nChisaki is very mature but also gets really emotional over some things, she always wonders, 'have I changed?', 'I don't want to change, I want to stay the way we are now'.\\n\r\nKaname, he is the smartest of the group, even though he's not a geek at all. He observes and is concerned about others.\\n\r\nHikari is short-tempered and has trouble getting along with the people from the surface. \\n\r\nManaka is pretty child-like, a bit dumb and scared she does things wrong.\\n\r\nTsumugu is the guy from the surface, he is very calm and knows what's right to do when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThere are way more people who are pretty important, but I'll just keep it with these five people.\\n\r\nTo be honest, there wasn't a single person I disliked in this anime. (Just thinking this later, maybe I did while watching the anime but it was pretty long ago.)\\n\r\nAll characters have to deal with their own problems, and you can actually sympathize with every character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIn the very beginning of the anime (episode one) I didn't like the anime that much, it had potentional, but I was disgusted by the curse Manaka had in the beginning  (a fish on her knee). Putting that aside, the story got better as the episodes continued, after some point it was REALLY addicting, I really couldn't stop watching. The character development, the trial they have to overcoming, changing, love triangles, deep problems that exist for generations, it's all in this anime! I really loved it, it was funny at some times and really touching too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime had a great storyline with love problems, family problems, different opinions on deep problems, and other problems you will see once you start watching the anime. It's really good, I sympathised with the characters, it's really addicting, because the story is just so good. Start watching, you really won't regret it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara or A Lull in the Sea is an original anime that aired in 2014. I heard about this anime a while ago but I never considered watching it until recently where I wanted to watch some romance animes in general.\r\nStory: This story overall wouldn't be considered to be linear where all the events in the story cannot be anticipated by previous experience of anime. One of the genres 'Romance' cannot be overstated in this anime, the romance that was expressed was a lot more impactful to the overall moral of the story when comparing to other animes.\r\nArt: I finished this anime atthe end of 2017 where a whole bunch of amazing animes with magnificent art has already been released such as Kimi no Nawa, Koe no Katachi, Made in Abyss and Violet ever garden which is coming out soon. Nevertheless, this anime had comparable art that is a pleasure for the eye. In some particular scenes, the art looked absolutely fantastic and I can clarify that it's better than some recent animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OSTs fit perfectly in this anime, there are a few particular moments where the background music was able to enhance the overall scene and make your watching experience that much better. The OPs' and the EDs' were really nice and fitting as well. Especially from the first to the second opening, the difference in tone can easily be differentiated. The second ending changed a bit in a certain episode where a certain turn of events occur in the anime, I thought that was a nice little touch and the same can be said about the second opening as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this anime are full of emotions and are 'colourful' (Britsh spelling BTW). The main cast with the addition of a few secondary characters contained some sort of romantic feeling that can be noticeable. With all those feelings the genre 'Romance and Drama' can shine and be recognised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was really an enjoyable anime that contained many notable elements that were just simply outstanding. I would personally recommend this anime to people if they're not busy with real-life activities and such.",

            "content": "I've been recently watching a bit of PA Work's catalogue after loving Shirobako and now Kuromukuro from them.  After also watching Kiznaiver this season, Okada's drama grew on me.  NagiAsu, with its high rating and writing by Okada, seemed like a decent bet for me.\r\nStory (4/10) - Unfortunately I may have overestimated Okada's knack for drama in her earlier works.  The story to NagiAsu is certainly an interesting one in theory.  It has some compelling themes to explore such as racism, what it means to be an adult, and the value of loss that comes with love.  The underwater townvs. the one on land is certainly a rare story that doesn't come up much either, so the show had a real solid setup for success.  Unfortunately rather than actually exploring any of its themes in depth, or even explore the lore of such an interesting world, the show saw fit to wallow in teen melodrama and go no further.  Compared to Kiznaiver though, it was uninteresting melodrama.  I found the first 13 episodes rather difficult to get through because of this, and it wasn't until the 2nd half of the show that I actually found the story somewhat more mature and redeemable as it started to actually deal with some of its themes proper.  It's a shame the entire show wasn't more like the last half, as I would have enjoyed it much more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - This is one area where NagiAsu absolutely shines and a big reason I kept watching.  The backgrounds in this show are absolutely beautiful to behold.  Just... stunning.  If nothing else was to get your attention in this show, the art is really worth the price of admission.  The animation itself isn't too bad, and some of the sea scenes really are quite pretty.  I could literally pause some scenes and just sit there absorbing the backdrop for minutes on end.  It really pulled you into the world and made you want to learn more about it, which makes it a damn shame that it wasn't explored enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - The music to this show wasn't anything spectacular, but it was competent at setting the mode and occasionally heart-warming and inspiring.  I would often find myself leaving the OP on while I did other things so I could listen to it in the background before the show started in earnest.  I was quite productive during it :P.  Both the sub/dub are fairly good for this show with the VAs giving it their all, and the sound effects were quite engaging as well.  The sea sound effects especially were enjoyable and often unique.  That being said, I can't say anything from the sound design ever stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10) - I have a difficult time rating this one, as I found some of the characters rather interesting (at least on the surface) and others absolutely irritating.  A couple characters especially made it difficult to keep going at times with how frustrating they could be.  Oftentimes they would act a certain way just to fit the archetype of their character without and logical reason for behaving as such.  Many, many times the dialogue between them especially would falter and make them feel particularly unrelatable and inhuman, directly in opposition to the point of the story; however, occasionally there would be fleeting moments of some truly inspired script work.  It was these moments that could occasionally touch your heart and I think why this show is as well-liked as it is.  It isn't enough to prop the show up in my eyes, but I do appreciate the show for those rare moments.  It may unintentionally have been one of the stronger points of the show, making the characters seem to accidentally have more depth than intended by the script.  So often they'd come across as frustratingly stupid/naive children, even the adults, that when they finally managed to break-through to one another, a part of your heart couldn't help but be happy for them.  I do think this show really did waste the potential of its characters though, in the same way that it mishandled the premise.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10) - I enjoyed the last half more than the score I give this particular section belies (it really was an improvement), but unfortunately I can't forget that the first half existed.  The ride was an interesting one, and I really enjoyed the gorgeous artwork and occasionally pleasing song, but I couldn't help but feel like the show was missing the mark by the end.  It almost made me sad because I know this show could have been better, it *should* have been better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) - NagiAsu was a story of so much promise.  Its premise was ripe with depth, its artwork begged for you to immerse yourself, the pleasant tunes entranced you, but unfortunately it all ended up just being mishandled.  It was certainly still enjoyable by the end and I didn't feel like I had wasted my time, but I can't see what blew everyone away about this series either.  I really feel like Okada was still trying to figure out her melodramatic writing style here and it shows.  All that being said, I do think it was worth a watch still for most anime connoisseurs, especially if teen melodrama is your thing.  If it isn't, just relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery and turn off your brain a bit.",

What i really liked about thestory was that it's based around the central theme of love and relationships with friends and the person you may/may not like.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is visually stunning to look at and can sometimes leave you breathless.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds is so amazing that you may/may not want to hook it up to an surround system. i really like all of the openings and endings to the show as there is always some kinda message hidden between the lyrics and also this may be a small nit pick but i really like the echo in some of the scenes really makes it feel like you could here that characters voice from to and fro.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which the characters of Nagi no Asukara have such lovable personalities and you can immediately like a few of them from the get go or hate them depending on your point of view on them. however as the anime goes on the relationships between the main characters grows to the point where someone might like someone in the friend group and etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nagi no Asukara is a really intriguing show from start to finish and quite frankly i enjoyed it and if you really like your romance anime or fantasy anime with an intriguing story then this is the show for you",

This series has an amazing cast of wonderful characters whose weaknesses and fears are extremely well incorporated into their personalities. The series is also blessed with a fantastic soundtrack along with the amazing atmosphere created by the world built around it. \r\nWhat this show does amazingly is showcasing each character's emotions, and by doing so, plays with the audience's empathy. Though the characters go through so much strife, the problems that they face can make anyone sympathetic. \r\nThis isone that I truly think anyone interested in Anime should see. It offers so much of what makes a masterpiece - a good storyline, mixed with an AMAZING soundtrack, world, likable characters, and a sublime atmosphere.\\n\\n",

When I came across this anime I didn't know what to expect, as the cover looked like a typical high school anime, but Nagi no Asu kara is actually really good.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis anime revolves around love drama, but there is also an interesting plot going on. So many ships, when I was watching this anime I genuinely had no idea what ships will end up sailing. Very unpredictable. There are plot holes, but they don't hinder the story e.g. why do people walk in the sea village when they can swim around?\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIt's so beautiful! I especially love the sceneryand ambience of under the sea, it's so mesmerising. The smallest details of facial expressions are captured well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack. It's relaxing and calming. The OPs and EDs really suit this anime well, and grow onto you. The ED always creeps up on you without you realising it's the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe character development is good and the characters are relatable. The characters aren't just cookie-cutter stereotypes. There is no set main character, but if there was it would have to be Hikari.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime! Each episode kept me yearning to watch the next one, to see what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI love this anime. Beware that there is a ton of love drama happening (there's like a love hexagon going on). Literally everything about this anime is good. Don't hesitate at the cover image, and start watching this anime!",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nIf you're looking for a light-hearted and chirpy anime, turn away.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe whole setting was fascinating, and the plot was very interesting. The discord between the surface people and the sea people could easily be linked to some of the world issues that is going on today, which was impressive. If a typical melodramatic anime is a slap on the face, Nagi no Asukara is a punch to the gut. It was brimming with drama, but not in a cheesy way. In fact, the drama was dealt with rather maturely, considering that the revolved around junior high students. The pace was very consistent,and their foreshadowing kept the story fresh.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was laudable, especially some of the stills used. The colour palette was soothing, and the animation smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack was very good, especially the first ED. Background music complemented the art nicely, evoking emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nIf I had to pinpoint a lead, it would probably be Hikari. Then again, every important character had a level of development that was comparable to Hikari's, which is saying something. Really, the depth of each main character was scarily impressive. The web of relationships was confusing, but propelled the story even more. Definitely a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nA very compelling watch, engaging at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, I would recommend this anime. However, a word of advice would be to go with the flow of the anime, and not pick favourites, as to avoid disappointment.",

            "content": "Nagi No Asukara was my favorite anime from the last season. It is very beautiful and moving, specially if you have a thing for people doing their best for love. That's the biggest point of the show: how love can make you push yourselft to the limit, even if it hurts a lot, you want to see the one you love happy.\r\nStory - 9: The story is inovative and brilliant. The connection made between humans and nature is something we tend to forget this days, but the autor made it so passionate that is impossible to not relate. I mean, I want an Ena now!The conflict presented on the anime is also something to relate: people of the sea are getting sort of extinct, working to protect their home, and people of the land underrating tradition, nature and gods. In our reality, almost all humanity has become \"people of the land\". Nagi shows how a few kids with really strong feelings can change the faith of a whole race: they made what every grown up couldn't or was too stuborn to do, they fixed the relationship between nature and human, the land and the sea, just for love.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10: simply one of the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. Shioshishio is amazingly well drawn, the characters as well. Everything in the anime moves like the see, gracefully. I fell in love with Nagi's art, it was actually why I decided to watch it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: I didn't like a loooot of the opening, I just liked it, but the ending was really strong. But what was the most beautiful, was the sounds of the sea, the shells crumbling with the drift; the sound track was pretty good. I don't pay much attention to sounds, I confess, so I wouldn't trust me so much in this one :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9: CONTAINS A BIT OF SPOILERS. Even though I hate Manaka e find her extremely annoying, all the characters construction was good, they were all very consistent and their developments and changes as well. They were all hard working, intense (except for Manaka) and heartwarming. Hikari overcame his childish ways to deal with things, he grew up a lot and it was fun to see him trying really hard to admit his feelings. I find Manaka annoying, bland, a 5 year old with a body of a 14 year old, although she got a little better in the end. But that's just me.  Chisaki was so empathic it made me angry, but I think she learned a lot after  having to live with Tsugumu, without the others, I mean, being excluded and growing up all alone. It must've been really hard on her, specially giving up on her love for Hikari, which was the only thing that held her with the others and the sea. Miuna was just the most freaking awesome girl in that anime. She was really strong and mature, even as a child. Her relationship with Akari was inspiring, and the way she delt with Hikari after he woke up all freaked out, working so hard to make him feel better was just amazing to see. Kaname and Tsugumu are awesome as well. Kaname was the only one who as able to deal with the fact that the one he loved, loved someone else, I mean, he gave up and started seeing Sayu, giving her a chance. THING THAT NO ONE ELSE DID. Tsugumu was so charming, racional and determined, I can't even. Please. Sayu was the one who didn't call my attenttion that much, she was ok, nothing special. But I really liked her determination towards Kaname, even though she was really scared. The secondary characters are all good, Akira was awesome. And Akari was really brave, passionate and sweet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: I was loving everything so much until the end. I didn't like the end for obvious reasons. Also, it ended and I was like \"ok, but what about that and that and that THERE'S STUFF MISSING\". But all the anime made me happy, I cheered a lot, cried and laughed. I shipped like I never did before. It's a love story with a lot of strenght, which is unusuall. I specially enjoyed the way they put the love in the center without leaving the background story fade away, they merged both into one in an excellent way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: It was a pretty great experience. There's not much to say without giving a lot of spoilers so, if you didn't watch, watch it, it's totally worth it, specially if you are a soft heart like me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. And it's my first review, I'm a noob, please don't hate me .-. And critics are really aprecciated, I want to write better reviews :D\\n",

But my problem with this anime is that it is the epitome of \"I love y-\" syndrome, where a character almost says something affectionate and plot moving and then someone interrupts it all and they go back to square one. This happens about 20 times in various combinations of people, by the end I couldn't take it anymore. The ending was relatively unsatisfactory but I suppose I'll accept it.",

            "content": "Let me kill two birds with one stone and review Glasslip (anime from the same makers):\r\nGlasslip was the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen, and worst anime to date.\r\nOkay, now that I got that out of the way, let's continue to Nagi no Asukara.\r\nOne of the main things that might put you off from this show is that the description says the characters are all in middle school. I think I was at one point awhile ago. I believe this is one of those shows where all the kids kind of act like they should have been a tiny bit older to me. Theyact and feel like they have a lot of dramatic tension that no middle schooler should have. Characters do grow older in this show too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor the setting, I thought it was really neat. Really creative. Sea people? Awesome. How do they make sushi underwater and dry their clothe real quick? NO PROBLEM, you just gotta look past these goofy thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is one of the most unique ones I've seen to date, it has a small sense of magic when it involves the Sea God. Something crazy happens to the plot midway through the anime that blew my mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama is CRAZY in this show. I wanna rename this show Running Away no Asukara, because they run away so damn much, it's funny. Nothing is wrong with this, just wanted to point it out... I love it.\\n\r\nThere is barely resting in this show. Whenever you see two characters 1 on 1, you know shits about to go down. \"Oh, brb I forgot my bag at my house!\" (leaves two alone) BAM, SHIT GOES DOWN.\\n\r\nI'll have you all know I love super over dramatic tension, so this show does me wonders.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLove is a huge part in this show. You will see LOTS of triangles, so much triangles that it becomes one big, orgy web. Friendship and racism is show a lot too, but love is the king here. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this shows will hit you in the kokoro. They know how to make you feel. Your feels got a giant bullseye on it, homing seeking missle and all. The music comes in perfectly most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing, just because this show has 26 episodes and you will grow with them till the end. You take a journey with them and wish there were more. They have drama hearts, so anything will set them off to run away (lol).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending (good or bad) was a good one, but wish they could have gone with a tinyyyyy bit more info, but that's just me being selfish and wanting more out of it. It's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this show 9 out of 10 run-aways. \\n\\n\r\nI would put Kokoro Connect higher than this as a 9.5, but want to compare because this comes close.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is a drama about four children that live under the sea, and their merge as they are forced to attend sea on the surface. A lot of romance, tensions, and events unfolds to leave an extremely memorable and impactful series. As a person that usually doesn't go for dramas, starting this series at first seemed a little risky. It's not unlikely that I would get bored with a similar series as far as the genre goes. However, Nagi no Asukara proved me wrong and thereafter. This turned out to be a stunning work of art and definitely the most underrated show ofthe Winter 2013 season. Nobody is talking about this enough! Anyway, I'll get this started:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9) - NnA has a very deep and meaningful story which includes entangled love hexagons and profound themes of racial tensions between the people of the sea, and the people of the land. This results in a fantastic and modern coming of age story across the board. The events that unfold makes for an enticing storyline, full of heartbreaking moments and a huge sense of friendship and togetherness. This really had an impact on me. The love interests for one another as the story develops creates a huge web of love which kept me emotionally invested and interested in the story. Only criticisms that keep it from getting a 10 would be that the show throws a lot of material out in the beginning, which was a tad confusing, and the ending dragged out a bit, even though I can see their reasons for it based on the way it ended. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10) - Right off the bat from the first episode, you cannot deny the AMAZING artwork, especially the colors, which really enhanced the viewing experience. The way the underwater village was animated visually tells you the story of a magical and stunning place with a lot of history, and that was amazing to me. At first I thought the huge blue eyes were pretty corny, but they really grew on me, and I understood that the eyes represent the visual differences between the two races of people. Eye color is no different than skin color. Oh, and I loved the facial expressions and smirks, they were precious. Art was definitely outstanding. No flaws. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9) - This is the section that I have the most trouble reviewing, but I can confidently say that NnA had great sound. Beautiful voices, beautiful underwater sound effects, only thing keeping it from a 10 is the OST, I think they could have beefed it up a bit. Still great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9) - Incredible development. The unique relationships between these childhood friends leads to a very beautiful understanding of the characters, even though you won't see their kind of relationship in any other show. You really get to empathize for the characters as they express their feelings, since they share such deep emotions with another. Each two characters have their own, unique relationship, but was not hard to keep up with. The relationships felt very realistic in this sense. After some time, it almost seemed like I had my own relationships with each of them. You get to see true transformations and watch these people evolve, and that results in a very profound sense of investment and love for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - I very rarely marathon shows as fast as I watched this one. One episode after the next, watching this show never got tedious or old. Thankfully, I watched all of them and caught up on the day that the last episode aired, so I didn't have to wait between episodes. Otherwise it would have been incredibly frustrating. This is definitely the type of show that you can knock out in a few sittings, and it's hard for me to find those. I also rarely cry, ever, but I did once or twice during this show. It's amazing how emotionally invested I got in only 26 episodes. Amazing amazing amazing \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - One of the most memorable and  amazing shows I've seen, and I will be recommending this to everyone. Even if you're not sure how it sounds (even after this review), at least watch the first episode, because it WILL capture your interest. This is a truly beautiful and profound story that won't be forgotten. Nagi no Asukara truly did not disappoint. High notes all around",

            "content": "This is one of the rare anime out there which exudes poetic brilliance. It is very disheartening to see when people talk about anime, they think mostly action/shounen. I think the slice of life genre is much more bountiful and enjoyable than those popular shounen anime that people watch. And this anime reiterated that view.\r\nWhile I rate an anime the order of rating is Animation, Music, Story, Characters, Enjoyment. There is a reason behind that order. It is in this order that an anime catches my attention. And it is in the reverse order that an anime \"continues\" to catch my attention. Nagi no Asakuracaught my attention due to its out of the world visuals. They are nothing like I had seen before in any \"completed\" anime. I realized it had huge similarities to Glasslip, a currently airing show and I was right. They are from the same studio. However contrary to Glasslip, this anime is not slow and the fantasy elements are interwoven with the story beautifully. The opening music is beautiful, the in-anime music captivating, both of them caught my attention while watching the first episode. But by the end of the 1st episode the animation and music took a back seat in my mind, it was the story and lovely characters that stole the show, as it should be. This is a story where \"fantasy meets reality\" was portrayed at its best. Clannad after story was a better as a story but the fantasy part was not portrayed very clearly and that led to many complaints. However this story does not pretend to an ordinary slice of life. It starts off underwater with clear indications it is more of a fantasy story. However there are subtle elements of real life that make it rise above a children's fairy tale. Hints of class divide, the changing environment of earth due to human activities, the fundamental difference between childhood and adulthood and coping with the everchanging surroundings are magnificently and subtly included in the fantastic plot. The plot features a time leap as well and the social difficulties arising from it is shown in a very beautiful way. All said and done, its the characters that stole the show. They may be slightly stereotyped but that does not make them less lovable. The complexities of adolescence of kids are included in the character traits of each character and you feel you have seen them before somewhere in real life. However the greatest feature of this anime is the climax which occurs at the very last episode. You go through all the emotions of joy, sorrow,hopelessness, optimistic, despair and end up with happiness. When bad things happen you seem to be always hoping against hope that in the end it will be alright. However at the very end of the 2nd last episode I had honestly almost given up, but then the ending tied everything so beautifully that I was amazed. It was the most heartwarming ending I have seen in any anime, ever. People complain that status quo was reverted but for me the ending showed how people moved on with their lives in spite of all the difficulties.\\n\r\nVerdict- My longest review should tell you by now how influenced I was with this one. It is the best Slice of Life I have seen in the last few months after Usagi drop. Everybody will thoroughly enjoy this one, thats a gurantee.\\n\r\nRating? Well lets see, I am a bit overwhelmed but still.. Animation-11/10, Music-9, Story-9, Characters-9, Enjoyment-10 (47/50) which puts it in my top 20.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Nagi no Asukara. The underwater setting was gorgeous along with the character design, and it's genre of romance drama was right up my ally.\r\nIt started off fairly well-I enjoyed the first couple of episodes. But after passing the 5th, I began to like the characters less and less. Manaka became annoying and overemotional, Hikari became nonsensical in his actions, and I still wouldn't be able to tell you s*** about Kaname (who's name I had to google to remember) because while the show gave decent amounts of development to its other main characters, Kaname didn't even have enough screen timefor me to have the slightest idea what his personality is like. Chisaki remains the only decent character in my book, but even she can be overdramatic/nonsensical at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot- or rather, the drama surrounding it- was overdramatized in every aspect and felt extremely forced. That in combination with characters that have little likability made for a show that ceased to be enjoyable for me after I got over the \"ooo pretty ocean village\" aspect.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I couldn't make it past the 6th episode, so maybe it does get better. But the part I did watch was quite \"meh.\"",

            "content": "I give Nagi no Asukara a 9/10\r\nWhat an emotional journey this has been. Nagi no Asukara has shown us the ups and downs of a healthy friendship. The fear of change, and moving on. The fear of loving someone and not knowing if they love you back. Where two social societies meet and can't work together hand in hand.\r\nThis anime teaches us to love our friends, no matter how far we may drift apart. Change will always happen as it is destined, so make the most of your time together as friends to create memories that you will cherish forever.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows 4 main characterson their journey throughout high school in a society where land and sea people don't mix together. The character's who which are from the sea have been friends forever, ever since they were born. The story is really unique because it binds the viewer in a series of love triangles, almost making this anime look like a harem. the most unique point is that there is no lead protagonist, as each character has their own feelings that they express throughout the progression of the story. These friends try to live their lives out together, to support each other as they grow. My only problem is characters such as Hikari, got ALOT of screentime compared to characters such as Kaname. Also no one really listened to kanames feelings which I feel like he was left out of the group of friends,\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art has to be one of the most amazing and mind-blowing art styles I have ever seen in an anime. The scenery is breath-taking and makes the viewer really engaged with every little detail that this anime has shown. Each transition is fluid and smooth, with correct smoothness across all scenes. This is a prime example on how art should look. Not only is it beautiful, but its immersive.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love both the OD's and ED's for this anime, especially the first OP. This anime has one of the best soundtracks, both background music and the OP's and ED's. It represents the anime as really cheerful, and gives us a glimpse of their childhood as well as reminding us of ours. It really engaged me into watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWe follow 4 characters by the names of Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki and Kaname. The character development was done perfectly for this anime. Each character got their own back story on how they feel. As I said before, there is no main character in this anime, each character gets their own spotlight. Each character has their own unique personality that makes them stand out of the crowd. These characters, have traits and feelings for other characters in this anime. Apart from the main 4, side characters (or some can be considered main such as Miuana and Tsumugu) also get to express their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed every single moment of this anime. I loved watching every episode as it always had something new to show. I love animes where characters grow up, with a love story and comedy behind it to back it all up. I truly will miss this anime now that it's over, with no hopes for another season or an OVA (as of right now).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 9. It COULD have been a masterpiece but there were some problems that made this anime a 9. The first is that throughout the second half, the anime felt like it was rushed, like as if the creators wanted to cram the story all in 26 episodes. Another is the lack of screen time on the main characters (Kanames in particular). He wasn't my favourite character but he felt left out, both in terms of screentime and feelings wise. He was the only one that actually didn't get his feelings touched on by the others. The ending wasn't really in my favour either, that too felt it was rushed. There was no 'real' ending because their was no confession. (Maybe it could be hopes for season 2) There could have been so much room for improvement but I guess they didn't look at it. However, this anime is definitely one of my favourites and I will cherish it forever.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 9.4\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch this anime if you want to be inspired to do something with your life as you may be at a point of not knowing what to do.",

            "content": "This show was definitely a roller coaster for my opinions for characters. This show does something fairly well, and to me it made me consider and reconsider which characters I liked and disliked. Throughout the show the land and sea people slowly start to get along, and feelings of love are in the air. At fist glace the show takes on a love triangle type of feeling, but I was glad that the triangle actually started to fade away. One thing that did bother me was that some scenes try a little too hard to make you feel inthe moment.\r\nStory; The story was alright, Ienjoyed the team work that the land and sea people brought forth to accomplish a goal, which both land and sea hoped for the same outcome. As the show reaches episode 13 or so there is a new story to be told. The story is mainly about feelings of love and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nArt; I was actually really surprised on how amazing the art was all all throughout the show. The tiniest details to some of the designs, and even the designs alone were top notch for just a love story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; The characters were great, even if some of them come off as a little stereotypic for an anime. The whole \"Who loves who\" thing for the characters was a little interesting considering their feelings actually change throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nSmall Spoiler\\n\r\nThe end was just a tad bit unsatisfying. Sure it was a happy ending and all but it ended so conveniently that it was just a little odd. I know there are others who love the show and will probably want to justify how the ending was beautiful, I understand. These reviews are all just opinions anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wanted to rate 7.5, The show wasn't so amazing to get an 8 but wasn't plain enough to get a 7 or less.\\n\\n\r\nPros; Beautiful art and design, characters progress\\n\r\nCons, Some scenes try a little too hard to make you feel for the moment.",

            "content": "Nagi No Asukara is simply beautiful. This anime is extremely well done, from the extraordinary artwork to the magnificent plot. There is nothing more that can describe this piece of work except for the word: Perfect. This story exists because of curiosity. Curiosity is something humans don't understand. Why do we want to know? For Power? Knowledge? For fun? The artwork makes us want to see more, to watch this piece of work that was able to captivate many hearts. Nagi No Asukara is a piece of work that is on a completely different level than that of many others. \r\n-Story-\r\nTwo different types of people.People of the land and the People of the sea. From the ocean comes people with an ability to exist underwater, caused by Ena, a skin that they were born with, allowing them to live underwater. Originally, all people lived in the ocean. However, as curiosity developed, humans abandoned the ability to exist underwater, and left the ocean to live on land. Now, centuries after, two subspecies of humans live on the land and in the sea. And despite that they were once friends and families generations ago, the hatred between them as grown so much, causing them to live isolated from each others lives.\\n\r\nThis story takes place in a town underwater called Shioshishio. The story of a boy named Hikari Sakishima and his three childhood friends. Unfortunately, their local middle school shut down, leaving them the only option of transferring schools. Since the only school close to them was above the surface, they had no choice but to transfer schools to there. As the story progresses, they meet a boy who is curious about the people of the sea and befriends Hikari and his three friends. Together, the five of them work together to change the hatred between the land and sea. As they do, they also strengthen their bonds of friendships and dares to change the relation between the people of the sea and the people of the land. \\n\r\nThe story follows the mysterious and tragic consequence of the four friends that left the sea to join the people of the land. The plot revolves around a mysterious aspect, which is the ancient story of the Sea God and the development of Ena. There is also a love drama in Nagi No Asukara. This part of the story completely exceeded my expectations. \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nAnimation and artwork are extremely important in anime. It can change the mood, feeling, and enjoyment of the whole story. Good animation can really change the outcome of the anime. That being said, I must say, the artwork was literally beyond perfect. Few anime really succeeds to capture the beauty aspect of art. That includes Nagi No Asukara. It completely grasps onto the colors and figures, ultimately creating one of the anime with the best artwork. As someone who studied art for many years, I must say that I am extremely impressed with the artwork. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe OP/ED themes went well with the anime, and I really enjoyed it a lot. It was nice to listen to, and it was a few of those OP/ED that I actually didn't skip throughout the show. Not to mention that the soundtrack was amazing too, though I expected more of a melancholy sound at times.\\n\r\nThe voice acting did not disappoint. In fact, all the voice actors really did created a perfect voice to go with each of the characters. No one really stood out as one, but together, it definitely created a different atmosphere. That said, the voice acting definitely did the best anyone could possibly ask for.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nThe personalities of the characters in this anime varies a lot. The main protagonist is the short-tempered Hikari Sakishima. Hikari Sakishima seems like on of those people who wouldn't get well with anybody, but deep inside, he is really caring and protective of all his friends. He appears to dislike anyone from above the surface, and would constantly ignore or name call them. However, as time passed he fit into the rest of the group perfectly fine. Then there was Manaka Mukaido, who would usually cry over trivial things, which caused Sakishima to constantly keep watch over her so nothing would get out of hand. Although she appears to love Tsumugu, she actually has feelings for Sakishima, but is afraid to admit it, thinking that if she did, the friendship between the four friends from underwater to be broken. Tsumugu Kihara was the calm and collected boy from above the surface. He also loved the sea, wishing that one day he would once again meet someone from the sea, and loved learning about the sea more than anyone else from above the surface. Later, he meets the four friends and befriends them. Chisaki Hiradaira is shown to also have feelings for Hikari, but like Manaka, she is also afraid to show it. As the beautiful and cheerful one among the five friends, she often smiles a lot and would try to cheer people up or stop fights among the friends. Sayu Hisanuma is the smart and sharp one among the group of friends. Like Chisaki, he is also shown smiling a lot, and is later on shown that he loves Chisaki. He also notices that Chisaki loves Hikari, but still goes ahead and confesses to her.\\n\r\nNagi No Asukara is full of romance and love among the five friends. Even so, the love aspect in the show is awesome, and the characters are also well developed.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- \\n\r\nI personally enjoyed it a lot. Rarely am I frustrated that there isn't an option to rate 11/10, and this is one of those times. This was also one of the anime that once I watched an episode, I couldn't stop watching until I finished the whole show. Each episode makes you curious. It makes you want to dig deeper, to know what's going to happen next. This anime also caught the supernatural aspect of it pretty well too. It is extremely interesting, and once you start watching it, you will most likely get hooked to the end.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nThe story is very also very interesting, and makes you curious and want to know more about what is going to happen next. Nagi No Asukara also really captures the beauty of art and animation. The soundtrack is amazing, and goes hand in hand with the animation. The characters are well developed, and makes you want to know more about them, and who they end up with. Watching this show will most likely make you glad you watched it, though I cannot guarantee this for everyone. Overall, this show is 100% worth watching. \\n\r\nNagi No Asukara completely exceeded my expectations, and grasped onto the beauty of it all. This show is probably the best anime I watched yet. How should I describe it...  Anime as good as this only appears once in a blue moon. \\n\r\nNagi No Asukara truly touched my heart. It is one I truly will never forget.",

            "content": "I'm so glad I didn't give up on this series. \r\nIt's been getting some great reviews so I thought I should see what the fuss was about. At first I didn't understand what all the hype was about. I watched the first couple episodes and got bored with it. I stopped watching it for weeks. Every once in a while I would watch another episode just to try and get the feel of the story. \r\nI was supposed to give up on this show entirely but I decided to give it another chance. I had a Nagi no Asukara marathon from episode four. I haveto say, it's one of the most beautiful stories out there. Sure there are a lot of angst and the characters can be quite annoying. But as a whole, it's a beautiful beautiful story. \\n\\n\r\nFrom different kinds of people being able to put their differences aside and get along to showing how to give love to someone unconditionally. \\n\\n\r\nIt's about community, family, friendship and romance. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters have depth, even the supporting ones. The people in the community all feel so present. Usually in anime they are there to serve as a background for the main characters. Not in here. In Nagi no Asukara they play a huge part in the story. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the relationship of the main characters is like a tangled web somehow it worked out in the end. Somehow, it made sense and it felt right in the last episode. None of it felt forced. \\n\\n\r\nLet me just say that the Sea God and Ojoshi-sama's story is really heart breaking. I felt sad for Uroko-sama. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I don't know any more. I wanted to cry after I finished the last episode. I'm glad that the anime had a proper ending. I'm glad that I pushed through with it or else I might have missed a really amazing anime. All 26 episodes are full of emotions and it draws the viewers in and make them empathize with the characters. I can't remember how many times I cried while watching. Actually, I'm writing this review because I have so much emotions right now and I can't really express it.",

            "content": "I myself always think that when it comes to fantasy, I'm not really a fan of it but not for this anime right here. I can say this will go at the number one spot in my favorite fantasy/romance anime to watch and once again, I'm just a romance anime fan but not an otaku.\r\nStory :\r\nI'm not really a fan of fantasy but this fantasy/romance anime here, was easy to understand and I end up watching all of 'em without me realizing it. The story is about two groups, one that lives in the sea and one that lives on land. 4 childhood friends goingthrough their lives whilst the sea and the land having their own disputes towards each other. Although I'd like to say that this anime was quite unexpected actually. Usually most anime goes with a main characters and some characters around him/her but not this anime. It's hard to say which one is actually the main character since all of them are in it. The romance in this, I just love it. Love triangle? Nah, I'd say, \"Love that is quite a lot of angles to look upon\". But still, I really wish that this anime will produce another sequel for this series. Although the ending was epic but still it might be better to have more on something like this.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nArt? I love the sea's art. It feels real like I don't think that's animation though. But still, it appears to be great to look and enjoy upon. This is the kind of art that I want.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nI love the music. It feels like the music is actually perfect for the series. The OP and ED is great, like Ray - Ebb and Flow, before I watched this, I thought the Ebb and Flow song was just a soft song to enjoy in the winter or to relax with. But quite to my surprise, this actually quite a sad upbeat song that was used after 5 years later of hibernation in the series. But still, unfortunately the songs that were used in the series only sounds good within the series. But when you try to listen it as an entertainment or like individually, the songs doesn't really enjoyed too much but still good to my ears. Yeah still, the music's good and perfect for the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nCharacters huh? I'd say each of them are just perfect. \"Manaka has round cute eyes\", happens to be my thought every time I saw her in the series. I don't think I have much to say in this because I don't see any flaws in the characters. It's just perfect\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAs a guy who actually not really fond of fantasy/romance anime, I'd say I enjoy watching this. It's not too stressful despite being a drama series too. I can say that this anime is good for those of you are like me, who hunts for only romance anime. No ecchi, pure romance and great storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nI wish I could give a ten but I didn't because I believe that this anime will go better than this. I personally put this for a ten but I put 9 because there are some flaws but still acceptable. For those of you are romance anime fan like me, I'd say go for it. Watch this anime and save this anime for last. The best is keep for last.",

            "content": "Nagi No Asukara is an Anime I often put up their with my favorites. It's not a 10 in my book, but there is a lot to love. \r\nTo begin with, this is a beautiful story of a group of \"aquatic\" kids, who live in the sea, and their transfer to a school on land. Some of them adapt well to this shift while others dont. The show heavily revolves around tribal customs for the sea people, and how the coming together between sea people and land people affects their lives. \r\nThe story is compelling and well written for the most part, with a fewhitches along the way. I found it beautiful, but from time to time I found myself going really? some characters felt artificially stiff to change, while others felt to gung hoe about a different situation. The love connections also were a bit to much for me at times, but overall a very nice touch that I found myself smiling over. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, overall I loved the characters, they weren't as life like feeling as some shows, but they were enjoyable none the less. This show is often one of my favorites because of the way they interact, and how fun each of them is. On top of this, their charecter models are very well handled, as is the setting which the story swaps between fluidly. \\n\\n\r\nSound was nothing exceptional, but in no way hindered the production value of the show. Overall I awarded this show an 8. I think it was very good, but it had some flaws. Some episodes my attention wandered more then others, but in the end i still recommend this to my friends for the lovable cast, beautiful scenery, and just a touching and heart warming story. Even side charecters capture your heart, and that is a sign of a well made show. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, these are just my thoughts, go out and explore for yourself! Happy watching! I hope Nagi no Asukara may end up on your watching list soon!",

I bet many people was thinking that this is only a fun, cheery, bright anime for kids with little kids romance. Because that was what I was thinking. But I must say you're wrong.\r\nNagi no Asukara creates a very deep story with soma fantasy touch to it. It tells about different 'races' of people in a cute but touching way.\r\nAll characters have unique backgrounds that completes each other. The art is really good, as well as the sound.\r\nThe story itself is really good. It may seemed an anime thatwould be suited only for kids, but as the story goes, the plot become more intense and beautiful with some plot twists and mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nI have never watch such a beautiful anime that centers kids, but able to watched by all ages before.",

            "content": "Nagi no Asu kara has many of the tropes present in adolescent romance anime, but it is a shining example of why these tropes exist in the first place.\r\nIf you were to go down a checklist of tropes, Nagi no Asu kara checks most of the boxes.\r\nStandard moe, shounen, and straightman characters?  Check.\r\nFantasy or supernatural powers and/or setting?  Check.\r\nRomantic love triangle, or more?  Check.\r\nAnd yet, not once did I ever feel that any of the characters of situations felt like common tropes.  The world, characters, and personalities all felt very fleshed out and well developed.    The characters wereactual characters, not soulless cardboard, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe story moves at a fairly quick pace in the beginning, but only if you pay attention to the timestamps.  While watching the show, the pacing was excellent, and I never felt as though the story was progressing too quickly or slowly until the very last episode.  The latter half of the show does slow the pacing down a bit, but it works very well for character progression, which is by far and away to main focus of Nagi no Asu kara.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values are quite solid, with great art and good sound.  The voice acting is fantastic.  I did not watch Nagi no Asu kara with English dub, but I can't imagine any dub comparing to the Japanese voice acting.  As for the music, it was decent and fit the tone of the show very well, but the soundtrack isn't really anything special.  The OPs and EDs are nothing to write home about, though I did quite enjoy the first ED.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Nagi no Asu kara is a fantastic watch for anyone looking for an emotional story.  The world that is presented is beautiful, but the characters and the relationships between them are what make Nagi no Asu kara truly shine.",

            "content": "Wow there's a lot to say about this anime, but let me just first say, this is one of the best anime series I've ever watched. The series tackled more genres and themes than I could even imagine possible in a single series. Discrimination, change, love, friendship, you list them. A beautiful romance tale that includes a fantasy world, and showing how fate can be changed, and that it's okay for change to happen. The love triangles were strong in this anime. There were so many love triangles that it was hard to keep up with. And with that fact in mind, it is reallydifficult to satisfy all the viewers, as everyone has their own view on the character relations. With a heavy emphasis on feelings and emotions, honestly I did think some parts were pretty sappy and cheesy. But I was really satisfied with the ending, having the characters mature emotionally. While I can't say I cried, I definitely teared up at parts. More than anything, this anime isn't sad, it's just really heartwarming. Watching this series felt like watching a fairy tale movie, like something from Disney. I loved the fantasy world aspect they threw in, as well as the whole \"prophecy\" aspect of it. The art style was also just amazing. I haven't watched that many works by PA, but this series has a super similar art style to TARI TARI (if you watched it you'll definitely notice the similarities). Overall, if you love the romance genre, you must give this one a watch.",

            "content": "Animation:\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n The animation of a Lull in the Sea, or Nagi no Asukara offers a high level of visual enjoyment. A lot of the animation is fluid providing an excellent example of movement. With that in mind, the show does a good job at highlighting the underwater world of Shioshishio; the home of the characters, Manaka, Hikari, Chisaki, and Kaname. The underwater animation provides the characters with a sense of buoyancy. I believe that this is done better than other anime that have underwater scenes because I find that a lot of animation doesn't take count for buoyancy. With this anime, there's rarely any fastpaced animation, not to say there isn't any at all but you will feel the show is lacking in fast paced scenes if you are watching this show for action.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nChisaki Hiradaira: \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nChisaki's character seems to have the most subtle change. While the show undergoes all of the main characters and their struggles with adolescence, Chisaki's character development stems from natural growth and the feeling of change that's been persistent throughout the show. Out of all the characters, Chisaki is seen as a mother figure. Her personality consists more of nurturing and keeping the rest of the group from harm.\\n\r\nHikari Sakishima:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Hikari can be seen going through vast changes throughout the show from being a bratty adolescence to someone who's understanding and calm. His character can be seen as the leader of the group of kids from Nami Junior High. Hikari shows a lot of pride for being someone from the sea. He's shown as someone who's quick to start a fight but as the show progresses the character goes through a lot of character development that allows Hikari to mature.   \\n\r\nKaname Isaki:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Kaname's relevance is questionable. His character is a bit overshadowed by the rest of the cast. However he's a gentle character, and although he doesn't say much, his actions prove otherwise. Kaname can be seen more as support for the rest of the characters. He tends to act like he's okay when he's not; in others words, he puts on a smile. He's quiet and reserved at first and a lot of his development doesn't take place until the second season. In the second season, he becomes more hot-headed and jealous and learns to confront his own inner issues.\\n\r\nManaka Mukaido:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Manaka is a ditsy girl who can be seen as the heart of their group. Without Manaka, the group doesn't feel whole. Manaka is the most optimistic out of all of the characters. She's a nice girl who tends to put others before herself. Often, she's seen just trying to fit in, trying to co-exist with the people on the surface. At some points in the show she can be seen as the main focus. During the series she goes through some character development, but not as much as the other main character Hikari. There is a noticeable amount that allows her to become a developed character.\\n\r\nTsugumu Kihara:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTsugumu is a quiet and reserved character who befriends the group from Nami Junior high. He's the grandson of a fisherman and spends a lot of his time out at sea. Tsugumu is very fond of the people of the sea and knows much about them. His character is often seen helping the group in anyway or form when they're in need. His character receives the least character development as he is the quiet and collect type. He tends to only say things that are important. He can be seen as the brain or the hands of the group because he's always thinking ahead.\\n\r\nMiuna Shiodome:\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Miuna is seen to be a lot like Manaka. She can be ditsy and often is seen as support for Hikari. She tends to be emotional and loves the whole cast. Miuna is a character who's born from a human and a person from the sea. Her character goes through a large amount of character development over the two seasons.\\n\r\nSayu Hisanuma Sayu is the best friend of Miuna and is often seen trying to help Miuna in the wrong way. She tends to be a character that becomes easily irritable and can be seen sometimes lashing out because of jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe story follows four kids from the now closed Nami Junior High in Shioshishio. The plot takes place in the fictional settings of Shioshishio and the surface world. Their school closing forced these kids to go to school on land where they meet a boy by the name of Tsugumu. They're often seen hanging out with one another. For the most part, the story is their day to day lives and learning to balance out life between the sea and land. The pacing of the story is rather slow, but filled with drama for the characters to work out.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe music was overlooked due to the story itself. It intensified the sad, the happy, and the various other emotions like any other anime. It was a bit overshadowed by this fact but it allowed the emotions for the scenes to do their work. The opening and ending themes for both seasons are very calm and collect. It's very mellow and the emotions for the scenes tend to work for each of their respective seasons.\\n\\n\r\nLevel of Enjoyment \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAlthough this show requires a bit more patience, it's full of enough memorable moments and likable characters for you to enjoy. It is enjoyable and has its moments but this show is not set up for anyone who enjoys lots of action. That being said if you like characters talking, solving problems, and so forth it's an enjoyable watch. This show is full of drama and romance and it's a good watch for anyone who enjoys those genres. It's a very calming show that requires a lot of patience to enjoy because of how the plot is set up.\\n\\n",

So, I did what anyone else would've done, I binged it (while fast-forwarding the slow parts). Well, I would've just dropped it if it didn't have such a high rating on MAL.\r\nAnd holy fucking cow! What a messy romance. A love-triangle? No.  Quad-? Penta-? No no. It was a freaking love Octagon. I don't want to watch anime like this again. I was really looking forward to see how the seaand the land people interacted more and the dynamics between them. But no, we just have to deal with this messy teen romance.\\n\\n\r\nBut I would definitely be lying if I say that I didn't appreciate some of it's moments though. They were really well done. The artwork was pleasing. The story had a poetic undertone. The characters weren't your typical-anime-level dense. I can definitely appreciate all that. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was also pretty conclusive and I think it made most of the audience satisfied. But as for me, the one lesson I think you should take from this story is... FUCKING COMMUNICATE. The sea god didn't do it. His wife didn't do it. And they are going to suffer all of eternity for that. Sure. That's cool. But even at the very end, the two characters who should have learnt from this eternal mistake don't freaking say it out loud. Haha. Are you kidding me? What was the point really? Don't tell me, \"Oh you have to just feel it and understand it\". Fuck no. Communication.

            "content": "Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the \"genre stereotypes\" and then judging the anime only around that? Just want to know the important stuff and if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nI can already feel the wrath of everyone who adores this show coming down on me for this review, but I am not going to pull punches just because everyone else is up this anime's butt.\r\nNagi no Asukara is a romance anime by name, but in reality it is barely a romance because barely any happens. Instead, itis a GREAT story-driven anime about a fictional world where humans originally came from the ocean, and at some point half of them split off to live on land (giving up their ability to breath and live underwater). The story is more about prejudice, racism/cultural differences, adults vs. kids way of thinking, religion and modernism clashing, and a whole host of other things that have almost nothing to do with romance in the traditional anime sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is amazing. I was blown away with how great the visuals were. Not really for any specific thing, just the overall finished work was beautiful. The underwater stuff and the scenes looking out over the ocean, etc, were all breathtaking and I wish that all anime's could share the obviously high production values that this one did (especially in the art department).\\n\\n\r\nThe story, minus most of the romance stuff, is also a home run for me. So many topics are covered, and they do an admirable job of fleshing out all the characters that move these plot points along throughout the 26 episode season. Everything about this anime is amazing...\\n\\n\r\n...until you focus on the romance. The romance in this show borders on INFURIATING. Like, I literally had to pause the show a few times, because I had to say out loud \"THIS MOTHER F^$%#ING SHOW!!!\". Every freaking character likes a different character. Especially for the first half of the show, it borders on unwatchable. It goes a little something like:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter A likes B\\n\r\nCharacter B likes C\\n\r\nCharacter C likes D \\n\r\nand Character D likes A.\\n\\n\r\nThat's only SLIGHTLY exaggerated for effect. EVER so slightly. And even after A TINY BIT of progress is made... AMNESIA!!!!!!! Yes, a bout of CRIPPLING AMNESIA makes almost 100% of all romantic progress reset MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, just when you think things are about to resolve and get interesting, the show ends. The last scene of the show (nothing is going to be spoiled by me telling you this) is literally the two (arguably) main characters deciding that NOTHING EVEN NEEDS TO BE SAID to CONFIRM THEIR FEELINGS. You LOSE. You get NOTHING. GOOD DAY SIR!\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far my longest review just because of how much of a disappointment this anime was in the romance department. The non-romance part of this show is 10/10. Heck, even the non-main character storyline of this show is 9/10. But the love-pentagon that is going on in this show that barely gets resolved, and only in the most annoying and roundabout way, kills it for me. The romance between the main character's older sister and a VERY side-character is 100x better than the main romances. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this show for literally EVERYTHING OTHER than the romance.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: The Art (10+) and non-romance storyline and plot points are a 10/10 anime. I love everything about this anime...\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: ...except the romance. The romance in this show by the main characters is terrible, unfulfilling, annoying, and stupid. And if your reasoning for WHY it is stupid and bad is \"because it's middle-school kids\", then you obviously haven't watched Tsuki ga Kirei (easily one of the best romance anime I've ever watched, and it is a middle-school setting).",

None of the characters seem that interesting and the development seems so forced. Not to mention that all of the \"drama\" is just ridiculous melodrama that adds no real emphasis to anything going on in the story.Its worse than an old telenovella because at least the telenovella was interesting.",

            "content": "Love is like the sea...\r\nNagi no Asukara! An anime about drama, secret love, and the sea. The setting for this anime is quite possibly the most unique I have seen in a while. It's based around a small village, which is under-water, called Shioshishio. It's said to be one of, or if not, the last sea village there is. The people who live there are very peculiar as they have developed another layer of \"skin\" called \"ena\" which allows them to not only breathe under water, but also adapt to extremely cold waters.\r\nThe story is about four kids who live in Shioshishio where they usedto go to school. However, for unspecified reasons, their sea-school got shut down, resulting in the four of them migrating to the surface. From there many memories would be made as the infamous \"Boat-Drift Ceremony\" would take place. There's a lot that happens in this story, so much so that it's hard to explain. But lets just say that there's a lot of tears.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction here is simply amazing. There were times that it almost seemed that I was looking at a painting rather than watching an anime. Absolutely breathtaking work. As for the sound, both OP's were top notch and fit really well with the vibe that the anime has. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, however, always had a sense of development. But at times it fell short to the generic cycle that many anime follow. With that, the characters here have a lot going on. There's a lot of emotions here, and many cliche types, but I always had the inclination to look past that because of just how interesting the story was. There's a lot of crying, a LOT of drama, and so many different emotions present.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to say that I'm happy with the way this anime turned out. At first it seemed like a generic slice-of-life with decent characters, but a very interesting premise. It kept my interest for most of the time, and there were some really great moments that had me on my seat. Overall if you enjoy a lot of drama, and a good slice-of-life, then I recommend you watch Nagi Asu!",

            "content": "[ALERT]: Throughout this review you will see references to the show that get EXTREMELY vague. This is done on purpose to avoid as many spoilers as possible, even the small ones. I hope it doesn't inconvenience you. \r\nWhen I began the first episode of Nagi no Asukara, I started it believing I had stumbled across the next anime gem. The product I was treated to, was very good, with lots of exquisite details- IF you can keep up with it. There were so many twists and turns, all coming without warning, some seemingly thrown in at random, that I practically felt sick by the endof the series just trying to keep up. In these following paragraphs I'll explain how Nagi no Asukara may not have always been the smoothest ride, but it still was the furthest thing from boring.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nI consider the story the most crucial element of this anime. This anime is only three genres: Romance, Fantasy, and Drama. Drama relies heavily on story and plot. So, therefore, story was extra crucial to this anime. In my opinion, based on how they wrote the story, you're either going to LOVE it because of its incredible depth and attention to detail and curveballs and whatnot... OR you're going to find it annoying at the very least because of all the massive plot changes that come without warning or the major plot events that just don't... make... sense... and the unanswered questions and I could go on. Personally, I see a little bit of both, but I tend to lean more torwards that second group. The fact that they never really explained that time jump really bothered me. It takes little effort to put in a simple flash forward but apparently everyone putting together Nagi no Asukara was too lazy. Due to this time jump as well, it breaks up the anime into multiple parts. Once again, depending on your point of view, this can be good or bad. There are essentially three parts to this series: Part 1 (Episodes 1-13) center around the unexpected weather calamity and the tension between the sea people and the land dwellers. Part 2 (Episodes 14-19) center around recovering from the weather calamity and preparing for people awakening from their hibernation. Part 3 (Episodes 20-26) is essentially all about Manaka, rather directly or indirectly. Even for a drama anime, that's probably too many plot twists. If the plot was hard to follow, the romance was even harder to follow!!! A had such a hard time trying to keep track of who was crushing on who because it seemed like they kept changing it. Every time I was sure I had it straightened out, they would change things up. And it was annoying. I'm STILL not sure if anyone likes anyone at the end or not.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nThe look of this anime kind of frustrated me at times. The most obvious example is with the two lead male characters, Hikari and Kaname. Other than hair color, I found them to look identical. So much so, in fact, that I could not remember who was who. It took until Episode 13 before I was able to start getting them straight, and NUMEROUS things happened to help fix that. This gets annoying as it's one reason why I had issues keeping crushes straight. When Kaname would confess, I would think \"wait a minute... I SWORE Hikari was hitting on her??? Why is he confessing to this girl???\" It would take half the episode for me to realize that \"Hikari\" had been Kaname that whole time. It wasn't the only time I confused them, but it was the most notable. Another piece of art I wondered about was the salt-snow, or salt-ice. Was it supposed to resemble more snow, or salt??? Depending on the answer to that question, determines how good of a job they did animating it. The ONE THING that truly stuck out as looking absolutely amazing from this series was the ena. They way they got it to shine just right when the light reflects, and when it does... it's BEAUTIFUL. They nailed the ena. For what it matters, they did a great job with the first opening credits visual as well. As for the rest... let's just say the end credits always felt lifeless and with the second opening credits... don't fix what ain't broke. They had no need adding in Manaka that late in the series. It just made things feel awkward.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is where Nagi no Asukara did its best work (although admittedly not by much) I'll briefly touch on the sound effects (mostly because I'll butcher the breakdown) and then I'll get to the music. So first... the sound effects. When the characters were underwater, or having a scene that was somehow impacted by water, the effects seemed so much better. There's a night and day difference between the land and water sound effects. It's odd, in a way. Just about every unusual or interesting noise or effect happened underwater. The best and most creative of them all, the sound that eventually led to the discovery of Manaka during Part 2 of the series, was heard underwater. I know the main characters came from underwater, but still... they could have cooked up cool sound effects for above ground as well. As for the music... during most of the series, they would feature music that happened to be also used for the opening or closing credits (which I'm pretty sure is common) The original opening credits song was borderline FLAWLESS. Really got me thinking positive about the series. Both closing credits #1 and opening credits #2 were very solid as well, just not quite that great. I have no recollection of closing credits #2 and when you have no recollection... you know there is a problem. A couple times, albeit rarely, Nagi no Asukara would break into a song during the show. Those songs were decent, but once again, I've heard better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara could've done so much better here. I've already brought up the issue about how characters look too much like each other. Another issue that got under my skin was three of the most central characters all had major issues with their personalities. That is fine if you look at it this way: \"These characters each have a unique weakness. Will they be able to conquer their weakness by the end of the series? Tune in to find out.\" But if you instead look at it more matter-of-factly: \"Each one of these three characters has a weakness. And NONE of them did ANYTHING to work on improving themselves AT ALL during the ENTIRE SERIES.\" No, I don't expect perfect characters. I just don't like characters who don't work on improving themselves. ESPECIALLY where they're weakest. The examples are: Hikari always would let his emotions get the best of him. He would get carried away, overly critical, too harsh when it's unneeded, he would even get in fights with friends. If he was truly trying to work on controlling his emotions (and he needed to) he wouldn't end up storming off every single time things get the slightest bit tense. But he fly's off the handle more than I do. Next is Manaka and how weak and unstable she was emotionally and mentally. But mostly emotionally. She was TOO nice. So much so to the extant that she couldn't handle ANY negativity. Too much stress, pressure, confusion, worry, too much to think about, something too important eating her alive on the inside... any of these could get her to break down in tears uncontrollably. The fact that she kneed Hikari in the crotch and immediately broke down in tears because Hikari was hugging her shows you what kind of girl she is and how much she can handle. She was just as flighty and paranoid in Episode #26 as she was any other episode too. So, like I said... she doesn't improve. she remains without a backbone for the whole series. Finally we have Chisaki, the one who's always sacrificing for her friends. ALWAYS. She's always afraid that if she does something to try to make herself happy it'll get in the way of one of her friends becoming happy. She could potentially ruin their life because she got impatient and selfish. So she constantly bottles EVERYTHING up until EVERYONE else has their happily ever after. Throughout the series there have been NUMEROUS chances for Chisaki to break free of her own chains and enjoy something, but she always stubbornly refused. And that is unhealthy. And also shows zero character progress. A character I did like, however, was Uroko. Sassy, egotistical, a flirt with all the young ladies, yet still wise and helpful... most of those traits remind me of me.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\r\nThere were some episodes that were just way too plot-driven and I struggled to get through them. I truly did enjoy the more entertaining episodes, with action involved, but those were too few and far between. There were way too many dialogue-driven episodes in this series. It made things slow and dull. Considering, on top of that, you always had trouble keeping up with the story and knowing exactly what was going on now, That only made it worse.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\r\nAll things considered, Nagi no Asukara is a decent, balanced anime. The writers must have worked hard putting that story together because they came up with some incredible twists and U-Turns. And they also went to incredible lengths to put great detail in the story. Too bad they didn't leave a road map for others, because plenty will sadly be getting lost!!! The art could've been improved with the characters looking more unique. The sound was actually good. A couple improvements here and there to the music and it could've been great!!! I forgot to even mention how thin the cast was. I mention that here, in passing. So, clearly Nagi no Asukara could've been better. But that doesn't mean I consider it a poor anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am not a big fan of romance or melodramatic shows, because I am a sensitive person. I tend to build a world around me through straightforward flashes or delusions. I feel very uncomfortable seeing multiple relationships going on, especially if there is nothing there to take my mind off of it. I want to become a part of what is going on, by projecting myself onto the themes; by design, this would distract me from many things that other people see, since their point of view is probably different than mine; therefore it makes me ignorant.\r\nA fantasy world, built around the invisible andunrealistic themes revolving around human emotions and relationships. As someone who is inexperienced in these realms, talking about love and friendship confuses me and sets me off. But, from what I can see, love is seen as either a holy light in respect to personal attachment, or a blinding darkness that sets people off from what original opinion they have and completely changes humans. I hope that these 2 are what people worship from love, and to what people refer to when they either explode, or succumb to whatever light or darkness there is that sprouts from impulses.\\n\\n\r\nDecisions are quick to occur, and we often mistake the effects for the causes and vice versa. We always manage to avoid pain, discomfort, anxiety; we say that we have contracted a disease just as we have hidden or escaped from it, only to feel its aftermath or memories that remind us of that pain. YOU didn't actually 'enjoy' reading the book, rather you felt touched upon by a mysterious inanimate object. The joke never 'grows old', but we say it and therefore it ages.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we can forgive is the beautiful, and this is a jarring effect, because the light we see is what we are drawn to, and therefore, the darkness from love is a black hole. The light blinds, and time goes by as a flash, leaving invisible wounds, the residue of a person that has changed. Yet, we want more of this, and we open up to  the 'open mind,' but close up to the 'closed mind.'\\n\\n\r\nPersonal attachment determines how certain things are interpreted, so whatever criticism is invalid for what future opinion holds for the genre entity. So, you should keep and hold dear whatever darkness or light that you hold, or picked up, from watching this show. This is another show that adds to the mind a new opinion, or enhance the already fixed mindset.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5 - I tried not to mistake stories for other elements such as 'relationships,' so not much substance here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6 - Not sure what defines a good character, whether a realistic element is meta defining, or the personal attachment that resonates with the individual.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 - So beautiful that we are blinded to whatever flaws could have been here. Goes with the music very well and we shift our perspectives to the beautiful. I could write forever, about how beautiful the sea is, and the world built around the beauty.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 - Some of the best music I have ever heard, goes with the art very well. I listen to the soundtracks on Youtube occasionally when doing homework, depending on what mood I am in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7 - Despite how beautiful the artwork was, the beginning was sort of slow and may annoy the impatient audience who is in anticipation of something that is quick paced\\n\r\nOverall: Of course you know what studio did this art....despite how under-appreciative I sound, this show made me cry in the second half and I spent half a day thinking about the show, rolled up in layers of blankets.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Watch if you are extremely lost/bored; watch a couple of happy shows to prepare for this one, or wait a few months and soak in some research. Commitment to this show only, I felt like dropping at first but second half made it worth watching. If you hate it, please drop it; but if you feel annoyed, keep watching.\\n",

Needless to say, I started watching it without reading a synopsis and only having a brief idea that it involved fishes. This turned out to be one of the most beautiful series. The story, interesting and unique, paired with wonderful character development. It's relatable, and has a beautiful soundtrack. I personally liked the art, it's simple yet complex and fits the story very well. I highly enjoyed watching this anime, the way thestory turns and twists is brilliantly crafted. I loved this anime, and would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a romance that really leaves you emotional.",

The story and the relationships of the characters are not the predictable type I saw in all those moe type high school anime. and it was a nice change. All the characters are lovable, which is rare for me since I always have one or two I dislike for some reasons. \r\nThe story also focus more around the relationship between the charactersand the fear of change more than the supernatural setting it occurs in. \\n\r\nTo be honest I think this anime just took the place of best slice of life anime I ever watched since anohana. \\n\r\nIf you liked Ano hana, this anime is for you and might probably top it.\\n\\n\r\nwell, don't know if it helped much but it is pretty hard to write a good review without spoilers",

My enjoyment of it looked a bit like a bell curve, peaking in the middle, however, I think this is something that will depend on the viewer to a large extent. The art in this series is absolutely beautiful and so is the sound design, the way the voices move in the water is particularly engaging. Lets not forget the music either, its one of the best parts of the whole series! The characters are wonderful and their development is believable and memorable. This really is agreat series that I can't quite compare to anything else, I would highly recommend it. I would also recommend building expectations of it based on the show itself and not what you read. I feel that this show will resonate with people very differently even though most will still love it.",

However, who is to say that there isn't another horror/thriller enthusiast who wants to try watching Nagi no Asukara?\r\nNow before I begin, allow me to describe what I enjoy in a story. I like it when death lurks just around the corner for as many characters as possible. It\u2019s just one false step away from the snatching the life from them and they know it. I want to see characters tortured and bleeding, mentally-wise, and still persevere to the end. \r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love and adore good endings anddetest bad endings where all die or feelings are left unrequited. That\u2019s why I dislike slice of life or drama anime that kill characters in the sweetest way possible in the end. NO I\u2019M NOT HAPPY FOR THEM THEY\u2019RE FRIGGIN\u2019 GONE.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to invest time to get depressed. What I like is when characters work and struggle for that happiness at the end. For that, I would watch.\\n\\n\r\n*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\n*Before episode 13*\\n\r\n\u2018Yeah, yeah. Happy, happy. Oh, you love this boy, and he loves this girl and such determination wow.\u2019 \\n\r\nIn other words, I was bored out of my skull, so much so I dropped the anime at the 12th episode. It was weeks later when I continued to \\n\r\n*Episode 13*\\n\r\n\u2018Yes, same substance as before, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll miss each other but I don\u2019t care. You haven\u2019t managed to-WHAT A TURN OF EVENTS! What are you going to do now, huh? What are you going to do?\u2019\\n\r\n*50 hours and 13 episodes later*\\n\r\n\u2018Hoorah! One of my ships hit the port!\u2019 Although the later episodes touch on some darker themes, the tone remains relatively sunny. BUT THAT BIT OF DARKNESS IS DELICIOUS. \\n\r\nThe conclusion is satisfying enough. That\u2019s all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not one to care much for art, but I suppose the background and scenery was well done, since I would consider using it as my wallpaper.\\n\\n\r\nSound: ?/10\\n\r\nI watch anime with low volume, in case the weird sounds the female characters make when talking cause my parents to think I\u2019m watching porn.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nHikari: The \u2018active\u2019 character. Keeps the story flowing but can be a dick at times.\\n\\n\r\nKaname: The \u2018nice guy\u2019 (no, he really is) whose character is presented vaguely to the audience but gets more and more solid as the story progresses. Plastic smile for at least 10 episodes until his true feelings start to seep through.\\n\\n\r\nManaka: The character who seems to exist in every slice of life anime. Curious, innocent and I skipped over bits of her monologue. (Sorry, not interested in saints like you)\\n\\n\r\nChisaki: Most conflicted character, in my opinion. Often described as composed but becomes turbulent quite a few times.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugu: The \u2018stoic\u2019 character who prefers not to drape his issues on other people\u2019s shoulders (like Kaname, hence these two share quite some personality). My personal favorite. Bold and competent for most of the time. I\u2019m a guy and I can say that he\u2019s hot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, it got me shipping so that's pretty good already.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nBoring first half, exciting second half. \\n\\n\r\n+Pro\\n\r\n*Scene containing a more realistic reaction from surprise hugging your girl friend (notice the spacing) In other words, you might want to ask first :D\\n\r\n*No \u201cI want to confess but then someone butts in and interrupts\u201d scenes. The characters get it done, loud and clear.\\n\r\n*The final couples remain a mystery for most of the story. Really, it\u2019s not easy to tell from episode 1 like many anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Cons\\n\r\n*Characters running away when things get tough (Annoying, but not too bad)\\n\r\n*Characters occasionally making foolish, life threatening decisions",

            "content": "What is love? In what ways can love be expressed? And who can you love?\r\nThis are the few questions I have been asking myself after finishing Nagi no Asukura, one of the best romance Anime I have every seen.\r\nIt is a story about five teenagers experiencing the fight between the undersea village and the village on land. It is a story about growing up and making difficult decisions, about failing although having done everything possible, and about undergoing changes. And it is of course about love.\r\nThis is Nagi no Asukara.\r\nIn my opinion, in the beginning the story was a bit too slow developing and atsome point even boring. But although it was straight forward, there were some important issues to be thought about and it was conveyed in a way the viewers would feel with the main characters. Up to the middle of the Anime it was more or less slowly pacing until the story twist came. This was a really interesting and unexpected aspect of the story. After that the whole Anime became even more emotional and was concentrating more on the characters feelings than on the actual plot which was a bit of disappointing to me however expected since this is romance.\\n\r\nWhat also disappointed me a bit was how the producers decided to tie up all the loose ends. It was too complicated and not reasonable so that you just had to agree with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show so enjoyable are the art and the sound. \\n\r\nOf course, for those who only watch Anime with more or less realistic art will be horrified by the huge eyes of the characters. But I must say that it has one of the most beautiful artworks I have seen in the Anime that have been aired in the last year. \\n\r\nThrough this whole ocean themed artwork the show became very atmospheric and emotional. The underwater scenes were well animated and gave you the feeling like you were actually in it. \\n\r\nFurthermore the soundtrack was great, the opening and ending themes also had that whole emotional and bright feeling you could expect from a romance Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the less good aspect of this Anime. There is your regular set of people: The courageous and loud male lead, the all moe-moe, clumsy female lead, the very friendly and sometimes spirited girl, the friendly boy and the calm boy. \\n\r\nAnd that is also what they stayed till the very end. There was almost no character development at all. \\n\r\nHowever, you get to know about the character's feelings a lot (except about the feelings of the more or less important side characters which seem to be only important in the last ten episodes).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I did enjoy this show as it made me cry several times and made me ask why we actually need love, if it just hurts us. \\n\r\nIf somebody asked me to recommend them a romance Anime, I would tell them to watch Nagi no Asukara for sure.\\n\\n",

I'll just say this, they really caught the feeling of a premium through thought anime with a story of gold!\r\nThe art of the anime is great, they really made the visuals look good and they've really donea great job on it! And all the characters are likable,  It really is an emotional/beautiful art style of the show which fits the genre of this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound is well done and the music in the show is never to much it's well balanced with the events of the show. they really catches the moment with the music at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of the show were all really well thought through, I loved them all especially a certain scale ;), but yeah I think that all characters had their fair share of screen time and the event of the series and the evolution of the characters through out the story line was perfect, really nerve wrecking to the end, got really stuck on this anime since the story developed all the time it never got boring as so many other smaller anime series tend to do!\\n\\n\r\nOverall one of my favorite anime series of all time, the characters were all fit for their rolls and their voices were perfect for them all, and the story was gold all the way to the end!\\n\\n\r\nTrust me it's worth watching!\\n\\n\r\n10/10, Will watch again!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely",

I was also amazed by the quality of the graphics as well as the music that this anime presented, very beautiful. Seen that the workmanship is very totality.

Shioshishio, the marine village, is like a dream. hardly a spectator would not feel the desire to arise in that reality. But I would like the culture of this people to be more unique and not so close to the people of Earth, which would make the quarrel between the two worlds much more interesting.\r\nAmong the conflicts experiencedby the characters, what most caught my attention was the fear of change. Time can take away people, moments and feelings, but there comes a time when we have no choice but to embrace the present, otherwise we would be stuck with something that no longer exists.\\n\r\nAll characters are unique and go through an evolution that is enjoyable to keep up with. Especially in the second half of the anime, where a very important event happens.\\n\r\nStrongly recommend to any fan of fantasy, drama and romance.",

            "content": "I guess this is how women feel when they have a one-night stand with a charming guy who discharges during the foreplay and goes limp for the rest of the night. Climax came in episode 13 and we still had 13 more to go. Oh, boy, what a pain.\r\nI don't know what to think about the story in this one. The \"sea folk vs land folk\" concept seemed to have a lot of potential, but author was like \"Screw that, I would rather make a bullshit love story featuring a sea god and a random land girl. God will then suddenly decide to throw achildish tantrum and destroy the world for no good reason. Genius.\". Well, more importantly, the story focuses on the romantic relationships between the members of the main cast. You could describe it with a scheme similar to a protein metabolism pathway. I dare you to google it. One would think that developing so many connections would take a lot of time, but nope, we are practically presented with all of them in the fist half of the show, which means that the whole point of watching the later 13 episodes is basically just to see the final confessions and to see how the relationships relate to the gods affair.\\n\\n\r\nEverything besides the story, pacing and structure is quite remarkable.\\n\r\nLandscapes and environments are spectacular, animation is good enough and visual character design gives a decent impression, even though characters do look pretty generic, but that's a problem of the source material.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and ambience are well utilized. There seems to be quite a lot of atmospheric volume alteration during the important scenes, which is a nice touch. It is a pleasure to listen to the OST album even outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are weak in terms of having plain personalities, but they do work pretty damn well together. Everybody feels as a character instead of being just some kind of utility used for progression. Also, many characters are actually relevant from start to finish, which is a great thing to see, romance genre seems to have the problem of disregarding many usable characters for the sake of MC and his/her love interests. There was still plenty of stupid and unnecessary melodramatic interaction, though... sometimes less is more.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sad to give it such a low score, I had the impression this can get as high as 9/10 during the first half of the series, shame they decided to numb it down with the way they executed the later parts.

Okay let's get straight to the point.\r\nThe Story:\r\nThe story is quite predictable, as they give extreme foreshadowing in while watching. What i really enjoy was actually how the characters reacted to the problems in the anime, and how they deal with it. Some reactions of the characters are quite typical, in drama romance anime though. I also like the concept of the sea people, and the surface people. \r\nThe Art:\r\nThe art is quite beautiful, as blue as its most color in the anime. I really love the colors in theanime, as in the character's blue eyes and even looking into the sea. i also like how the characters match with the background. Looking at the backgrounds also made me feel like i was swimming in the sea with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nThe music in the anime, is quite beautiful. Though some soundtracks are quite forgettable. It also makes the atmosphere of some dramatic scenes memorable or emotional.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nI really like the character designs, and voice acting. As some really do sound like young children, although some characters voices sound like adults through the child arc. The personalities of the characters are very likable, but can be very unrealistic. If you don't really enjoy happy-go-lucky kind of characters, or if you don't really like super dense characters. They characters also have a little of moe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, it is quite an enjoyable anime. As the music changes the mood of the anime deeply, and atmosphere. The story is somewhat predictable, while foreshadowing this but still somewhat entertaining the audience. The character's are quite likable, but at some points are unrealistic. The drama could also give you an headache, but is not too overwhelming to the point were you give up on it. And that's it! I really enjoyed this anime as it's very cute, and fun to watch. I recommend it to people who really like to watch dramatic anime, although i don't really like too much drama. I found it quite enjoyable, and not too annoying of what the characters do. <3",

            "content": "\"The heart that doesn't change for eternity. The heart that changes with the times... The gentle and kind, the rough and painful... And yet the sea is forever kind. Love is like the sea\"\r\nNagi no Asukara is a series that is easily overlooked, but proves to be a true diamond in the mainstream rough. Nagi no Asukara is a series that would either be forgotten or always be remembered. But for me, it proves to be the latter. It is simply an anime that describes love in its purest form. Love as happiness amidst the sadness. A kind of happiness that can only be foundbeside sad and rough emotions. \\n\\n\r\nI just loved how it's not a rollercoaster lesson as any other love story drama there is. It doesn't make you experience a heartattack, but it makes you experience a subtle heartbreak. It tells you what love really is all about. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime is like being in love. in true love. It is where you stay for the ride, you don't stay and wait for something to happen because that just leaves you disappointed with your expectations. It is why most people who probably dropped this show is missing from their lives (although maybe they just didn't like the artstyle, or do not believe anime is something for deep subjects such as pure love). Do you really know what love is?\\n\\n\r\nStory: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, the story is a very simple tale of growing up with a supernatural twist. I can say that this plot isn't really complicated nor it is in that category of serious mindrape (which earns applauds from people who think a masterful plot is a logically stable one). No, this series is about love and love isn't about logic, it's about reason and feelings. And what better way to judge a tale of feelings and emotions than to see and understand it's story telling. The storytelling is the real star of this anime as it feels alive, it feels like love itself that cannot be rushed. It is very datailed but it's not boring. The plot is not forced on to you, but keeps you interested , if not hooked. You completely UNDERSTAND why everything is happening and why those love and reactions and feeling swirling around the characters happens. \\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]:\\n\r\nPA Works brings another beautifully done series in Nagi no Asukara. Very pristine backgrounds and character designs that just looks natural. It doesn't have much in the animation department because it's not really an action series, not do I think it is necessary so I gave it a stable 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]:\\n\\n\r\nThe OST in this anime is just satisfying for me, and a bit on the average side. Although I was really moved by the soundtracks when they performed the Ojioshi-sama rituals. The opening and endings were treasures too that makes this series so lovable. The first opening clearly dictates an atmosphere that is all fun and cheery that reflects a child's positive coming-of-age experience while transitioning to the second opening by episode 14. The second opening is slow and a bit emotional, very right for the more dramatic half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: \\n\\n\r\nThis has to be the most outstanding aspect of this series. The characters are very well-written and you can almost see everyone (even the sub-main characters like Kaname and Chisaki) in a 360 point of view. Some might question their behaviors as either being too bitchy, being too un-understandable, being too good or too stubborn. But in the end, all I could say is that they are all just very human. 14-19 year old humans that knows happiness, sadness, angst and pressure. The characters might look a bit cliched at first but their reactions and the time it takes for them to react is just real. They're not idealistic, they're not all just about love, they're not all smart and understanding. Because that's how the world works. They get exhausted and tired, they get up and go for it in another try; that's just how reality is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]:\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this series varies from each watcher really. As with any other anime, but if you are someone who came to this series because you love drama-romance anime, if you love character-based series and innocent romances, you'd definitely enjoy the ride. If you're up to series that is full of heartattacks, drama and shoujo-type romance, this might not be your cup of tea. I for one enjoyed this series because of its very refreshing pacing and characters that are loveable and unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime would not have been so successful if it weren't for it's really precise execution. The art style and unique undersea plot is already a plus but the core of this anime, the lessons it bring (no matter what age you are in), and the set of characters that makes this plot work and make the gears turn. Those are the real treasures of this anime that if not blended correctly, this anime could have been a bit of a flop. But it wasn't because it had good chemistry. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize it all, this series is the perfect example of a good chemistry of a well-written plot, the diversity and richness of each of the characters and an outside factors that make the plot turn. Watching this series is like being in true love: you need a good mix of chemistry, quality time and nice pacing you have with each other and simply the chance and the devotion you have in watching it to the end.",

            "content": "Nagi is something of an oddity. Maybe not in story, or in characters, but in visuals and settings. The setting is basically a harbor town and the bottom of the ocean. The story is so-so, and the characters are pretty straightforward. But it does bring something new to Slice of life and Romantic Dramas. Let's figure that out right now with our first topic, Romance.\r\nNow it's been a while and I'm sure you missed me explaining my thoughts on Romance to you guys, but I feel it's appropriate. Romance to me has to be done perfectly, or I won't like it. I'll respect it, butI won't praise it anymore than it should. So if I review an anime where two main characters obviously fall for one another and you know how the series ends I won't give that section a good review. So with that being said let's talk about this anime's romance in particular.\\n\\n\r\nNagi has a very straight forward romance. It's got a very basic love story, but what it introduces is the weirdest love.... pentagon? (Would that be the right word?) I don't know. This is the biggest downfall of the series. It's hard trying to keep up with who loves who, and who has another person to fall back on if they get rejected. It's an original concept I guess, since I've never seen a love story this entangled in emotion and confusion. Watching it was like trying to play Elite Dangerous without autopilot. At moments you get your ship steady, but sooner or later you're going to go spinning in circles and get really confused again. That's the romance in Nagi to a T. Now, is it absolutely the worst? No, I think you could easily sit and watch this and have fun with it.. you also get bonus points if you bring a girlfriend/boyfriend along with you. It's romantic atmosphere really can be appreciated by everyone though. When you aren't confused you kinda can see yourself in some of these characters. If you've ever been hopelessly in love with someone when you were younger you will connect to this series. Obviously, these characters get the unrealistic anime trope ending, but you still relate to those feelings. \\n\\n\r\nSo next up let's talk about animation. The animation in Nagi is extraordinary. It's simply eye candy to the eyes and it's all very natural for this anime style. We do have the obvious art tropes with this too.  For example, all the characters are insanely beautiful. This obviously isn't a problem, but for this anime in particular the characters are all so attractive that I've ditched real women all together... I'm 100% lines now...hawt! Besides the characters, the scenery is inanely gorgeous. It's like watching a painting come to life. The simple look of the backdrops are insanely detailed. Not as much as a Miyazaki film, but they're damn close. There are also not a lot of panning backdrops, at least not from what I noticed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about those tunes? I'm glad to report it's all good. The tunes in the first half is easily what makes the series special. You get calm songs, while at the same time you can feel the emotion and intent behind them. It adds to the romance sub-plot a little in the first half as well. Other than that the second half is either ambient or it's full boar on the string tugging. It's got a lot of soul put into it, and a lot of care where it was placed. If it has a soundtrack I would pick it up if you enjoyed the anime enough. It's not something everyone can get ahold of though. You need to be really into the story and have emotional connection to consider it a purchase.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nagi no Asukara is special. It's got it's flaws, but that's what makes it so special. Like Angel Beats or Attack on Titan, the flaws in a way help it remain fresh and new. Which is great, because you can watch this on Crunchyroll for free. The Characters are almost blank states at point and are the weakest point to be honest. The story helps flesh them out a lot, but the music helps push their motives forward in dramatic scenes. It also helps that the visuals are insanely beautiful. They remind me of Miyasaki, but in a weird way where you can sense that they used some techniques he made popular. Overall Nagi no Asukara is something you don't want to miss. Nagi no Asukara easily bags an 8/10.",

First of all, this anime has an amazing story line. The art is perfect, it's refreshing and it made me feel like I actually in the setting. The character are also animated very well! Overall the art work was breath taking and unique. The story line, theme, plot, setting, and character development is well thought out in this anime. If you're looking for an anime that makes you want to watch the next episode right away, Nagi no Asukara isthe anime for you. There are some teary moments here and there but this anime takes \"slice of life\" to another level. The imagination of the author is a gift from God. This anime is truly a masterpiece and I'm blessed to have experienced it. Take my word and watch it, fall in love with the story and characters. You will not regret it!",

            "content": "In my opinion, it is my belief that most anime that have been hyped beyond belief (at least the ones that have been airing recently) are of significantly poorer quality that most would've hoped. This happened with Sword Art Online, Kill la Kill, and for what has been shown already, Black Bullet (keep in mind I've only seen 4 episodes of that show at the time of writing this review). The worst thing about hyped shows are not actually the shows themselves, but their effect on other anime airing in the same season as them. Many anime that are arguably better than those shows areoften overlooked by the general populous. This happened with shows like Shinsekai Yori, Golden Time, and the anime I will be reviewing today, Nagi no Asukara. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I like the most about the story is how it has a multitude of themes and messages to send to the viewer, but it does it in a way that feels very subtle. Even during the dramatic moments, nothing really feels too overbearing, and has a more lighthearted scene (but not completely comedic and out of place, mind you) almost directly after that to ease you out of it. It almost feels like the pacing and timing of the story was trying to mimic that of a wave crashing onto shore. A dramatic moment would resemble a strong wave full of emotion, and, most of the time at least, retreat back to where it comes from. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously said, there are a multitude of themes and messages throughout this anime, ranging from rascism, to climate change, unrequitted love, and of course, change. Focusing on the first half and the \"rascist\" aspect, the thing I liked about this was that it didn't shove the theme down you're throat like you're mom forcing you to eat brussel sprouts. It's not like the two villages were on the brink of war or anything, just a very bitter relationship.In this case, it works with the atmospheric mood of the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOne really weird thing to talk about concerning this anime is that of character development. I say this because of the whole \"change\" aspect of anime. A lot of the anime focuses on how the various characters want to stay how they have been. This is actually one of the best parts of the show, as the characters are noticeably aware of their own \"character development\", and they want to stop it from occuring. I won't spoil how that actually turns out, but it's rather enjoyable to witness.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to individual characters, let's start of with Hikari (Hii-kun as Manaka would say). There is one line in the anime that Miuna, Hikari's friend and another main character, says. She says that Hikari is straight (among other verbs, but I can't bother to find the particular line). Now, I don't mean in the sexual preference kind of straight. He fixates on one particular goal, and never stops until that goal is complete. He brash, and speaks before he thinks, but he truly cares for his friends (and his love interest). Although the way he goes about things is not really the way I would do it, it's interesting to see how he reacts to the various occurences that happen during the course of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to drag on much longer than I already have, so I'll just give brief sentence summaries for each character, and then you can witness each of their greatness for yourself. You have Manaka, the bright and bubbly girl, and Hikari's main love interest. Kaname, the more logical of the group, who always tries to be in control of the situations and his feelings, even though thats the root cause of his pain sometimes. Chisaki, a busty purple-haired girl who is fairly silent (and probably my least favourite character of the bunch, but I won't go into detail on that). Tsumugu, the land dweller that has a strong passion for the sea. Last but not least, you have Miuna and Sayu, the two younger best  friends who are also troubled with love.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the amount of screentime and focus of some of these characters (mainly Kaname) is very inconsistent, you really do feel their dilemna, and you have a strong sense of really getting to know who they are. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nAtmospheric. That's the best term to describe the animation of Nagi no Asukara in my opinion. The backgrounds are absolutely stunning, the movement, albeit a little limited at times, is fluid and precise, and the distinct look between land and water was phenomenal. At times, it almost feels like this anime had the budget of a movie. It's something that is pretty hard to match.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the least enjoyable thing about this anime. Not to say that the music is bad, because it isn't. It's just that everything else is so great that the sound kind of gets buried by it all. A lot of the music is very simplistic, sometimes only using one or two instruments for any given song. This can be seen as a pro and a con. It fits the atmospheric and scenic tone of the anime to a T, but most of it is really that memorable in the slightest. Fortunately, it knows when to kick it up when you have more dramatic scenes coming up to play. Lastly, the openings and endings. To be honest, I found almost all of them to be pretty generic. The exception to this would be the second opening. It still wasn't great, but it was a good notch above the other OP's and ED's this show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about this show is how well it knows who it is, and how every single aspect of the show has a place. There are very few moments where the characters, music, pacing, etc. stray off from what the show is. What this show is is a feast to the eyes, portraying an enjoyable romance, relatable characters, and a well written story, all while doing it in such a manner that feels natural and realistic (well, as realistic as you can be with a tribe of people living underwater). And to discuss the ending, I can safely say that it was very well done, if not just a tad unsatisfying. I won't spoil a thing, but let's just say there is a major point in almost any romance anime shown near the end that the show forgets to add, and it just made me a bit sad. Overall, this anime gets a high recommendation from me, so make sure to watch it sometime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, remember me saying how every single aspect of the show has a place?\\n\r\nWell, there is one line in the first episode that breaks that, but in the most hilarious way possible. SMELLS LIKE YOU'RE OVULATING. Like seriously, I laughed for a good ten minutes on that shit.",

            "content": "{ spoiler FREE review }\r\nGoddammit, man.... I just have to say you must have a re-bound anime handy for after this show, because it will leave a gaping hole in your heart, begging for so much more!!\r\nStory:\r\n     The plot in Nagi no Asukara is very well-rounded, in that it blends all sorts of elements from a wide variety of stories so well that the product is truly, amazingly synthesized and unique. It takes a look at over coming segregation, and how all kinds of people can learn to not just get along, but to love one another with great magnitude. Loveis the other highly touched on topic in this show, and it shows just how magnificent the power of loving someone with all your heart can amount to, even in the face of the most seemingly impossible and challenging situations. This is a story that is an absolute MUST to be experienced by both fresh eyes to the anime world, and well-watched veterans. Please don't make the mistake of missing out on this one. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n     The artwork in this show was absolutely phenomenal, and is especially noticeable within the backgrounds. They're all so vivid, and almost like you're living in a dream world! Without even bringing the story into account, your eyes will definitely NOT be at a loss while watching this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSountrack/OPs and EDs/Ambiance:\\n\\n\r\n     Something that really put me into the show at first was the very cool atmosphere which the audio created for me. When the characters are in the sea, you feel like you're in the sea. When the characters are up on land, you REALLY feel like you're there listening to the soft hum of cars drive by and crying of seagulls in the air. As for the soundtracks and theme songs, well the emotion in the music of both just really went hand-in-hand with the story unfolding before your eyes. Even if you wanted to, I'm not sure how easy it would be to bring yourself to skip either the Openings or Endings to be completely honest. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development:\\n\\n\r\n     The character development in this show can in no way shape or form be over-stated. I had fallen absolutely in love with each and every one of the characters just after a few episodes. Trust me, you can look for one not to like, but it ain't gonna happen ;) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n     While I do have to say that this anime was a whole lot different in that instead of being very happy and carefree all the time, it actually kept a somewhat tense and sad atmosphere for a majority of the show. Don't get me wrong though, this was a very interesting change of pace for me and kept me hooked on watching the next episode right away to find out what would happen next with the characters. I think you'll find though that this atmosphere is very suited to the show, and it wouldn't really feel right any other way. This anime was thoroughly enjoyable for me, from start to finish. I finished all 26 episodes in a matter of two days for goodness' sake! I think that should speak for itself. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Um 10/10, duh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter-thought:\\n\r\n....*sigh*. I tried hard to write this review without saying it, but I guess it has to be said after all. This is SUCH a better love story than Twilight ;)\\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nI can't think of any other show that has disappointed me more than Nagi no Asukara. Not because it's bad, but because it genuinely could've been a masterpiece. In fact, for the first 3/5ths, it was. If you asked me to review this about half way through I would have been glorifying it as one of the best shows I've ever watched. Sadly, it lost its hold on me.\r\n(scroll to the bottom for a summary)\r\nMain review:\r\nI was not joking. Until a point, it's hard for me to really pinpoint anything I disliked about the show apart from a certain somebody being a moron. Even then,said somebody tyrbed into someone I liked and respected. The majority of characters were likeable and felt individual - the exception being Tsumugu, who might as well have been piece of cardboard. Until a point, might I reiterate.\\n\\n\r\nIt all starts to fall apart in one particular episode. Honestly, I think the writers gave up a little in order to fit everything into 26 episodes. This (at least for me) completely ruins the show. In this particular episode, what happens is quite possibly the most illogical thing I have ever seen. I simply couldn't get my head around how bad it was given how amazing it had been up to that point. It's hard to go into depth without spoiling it, so I won't, but it was literally the worst piece of character interaction I have ever seen. To summarise, something major occurs and they act as if it never happened - as if it had been there all along, even. It was so bad I felt betrayed, like I'd just had my time completely wasted. Everything amazing completely shattered in the space of a few minutes. It's hard to make it sound as bad as it is without spoiling it.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, it then gets even worse. They acknowledge a vital moment for character development and then skip over it completely. What's worse, in subsequent interaction between the characters who are now supposedly \"in love\", they barely act as if they have any interest in one another. You can't blame this on personality - it's just shoddy writing. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough these events take up a small amount of time that is the very reason this show fails to be a masterpiece. It's hard to describe how painful it really is. The worst part about it is the fact it actually looks like it's delivering. If something is bad from the very start at least you don't have any expectations. When something is excellent and building up to something special it's by far the most painful experience to have it turn into drivel in front of your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the show, the artwork was definitely impressive. It was very vibrant and aesthetically pleasing. The first OP was good although I didn't like the rest of the music. Nothing that strongly impacts my view of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a potential masterpiece undermined by shoddy writing. It's hard to enjoy a show when it suddenly goes from being amazing to terrible. Most people don't seem to share the same opinion, but watch at your own peril. I can't give it any lower than this because... well... it was genuinely amazing for a while. I can only exclaim my dissatisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review. If you have any comments please let me know - it will help me write better reviews in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Ok. So I don't like this genre but I do love the ocean.\r\nABOUT THE OCEAN/ART:\r\n8/10\r\nBut that's the thing... this isn't really about the ocean. It's about some other similar environment.\r\nThis anime break too many rules in order for me to believe that they are actually underwater.\r\nI'd love to believe it but the immersion was broken from such things as:\r\nCrying underwater, Fire underwater, Talking underwater, Hair not being \"floaty\", Drinking fluids underwater, etc.\r\nI know some of these are needed for the plot and whatnot but it really takes away from what it's trying to portray. They did do a few things right but all of theseweigh against it.\\n\\n\r\nNow it did look really nice, it was gorgeous to look at. But if you look at one scene without any context you couldn't tell if they were underwater or not. And that is a serious flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThey made above and below water so similar that it didn't even seem like there was a difference.\\n\r\nSure, there were some interesting plot development due to it and some world building (I enjoy the Ena [how they breathe underwater] idea and all that is required to sustain being above the surface) but you could pretty much change the ocean to the air and still have the same anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything to solidify that it was the ocean. It was almost like a different village in the country instead of a different village in a whole new environment.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am being a bit harsh, it was still underwater and the plot had a lot to do with that fact but the way it looked was too similar to the above ground.\\n\\n\r\nWas well animated though and beautiful to look at. I find myself questioning if I should rank higher than 8 but I feel like the portrayal of the ocean does add some negatives.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did like some of them and the interactions were really nice, I found it a little unbelievable that everyone liked one of the characters when he seemed like a tool. He later proved himself to be more but they didn't do a good job of introducing him as someone who is likable.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions though are pretty great. Although some of the reactions are very silly but that comes with the genre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nI only remember one song from the show clearly and it was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but there was a nice variety of instruments like piano, strings and whatnot. Pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is not my favorite genre. I don't generally like this genre and as a result the story gets a low mark. It probably isn't a bad story comparatively to others of the same genre but it wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Love > Everything logic that ruins it for me. And there was the addition of magic and gods and that all had a big part of the story too and I feel like it just muddied things up.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it made it more dramatic and gave a serious issue but I never found myself too enthralled.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably wouldn't watch again and the rewatch value isn't that great.\\n\r\nWhat really killed it I think was all the little things that just made everything seem fake.\\n\r\nHad they been more convincing that they were in fact underwater I might have enjoyed it but all the time watching that was bothering me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR, Not my genre but I love the ocean. This is not an accurate and realistic portrayal of the ocean.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Nagi no Asukara is a whirlwind. It's beautiful and breathtaking, like the tide crashing against the sand, the sunset reflecting off the ocean's glassy surface. But it's also chaotic and brash like a tsunami wave. P.A Works has created an anime that is charming, sparkling, and can reach into your heart.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe premise of Nagi no Asukara is 4 childhood friends, Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname live in the sea village of Shishishio. They are able to live underwater thanks to the layer of protective 'skin' called ena. With their school closing down, they must attend school up on the surface, where they meet newclassmates who were born and grew up on the surface. In comes Tsumugu, a child of the surface, who puts pressure on the group of friends, stirring up feelings that were trying to hide. Nagi no Asukara seems like your typical shoujo romance, but it's much more than that. It's a dramatic tale of the sea, love, and everything in between. It carefully pulls on your heartstrings and makes you relate on a painful scale. Truly, the story is well sculpted in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nP.A Works has a way with animation. A show like Nagi no Asukara is right up their alley. They use the right colour pallets at the right time. They vibrantly set the scene. It's a sight to admire and respect. Work is put into every aspect of art and animation. The backgrounds and scenery are beautiful. A new world comes alive on screen. Animations are almost always fluid, and natural. It is everything Nagi no Asukara deserves.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara actually has some really good music. The OST is soothing, and fits just where you need it. It sets an atmosphere. It's almost the opposite of a horror movie, where the music makes you feel on edge. The music flowing from the speakers is a calming tune, a dramatic tune, whatever floats the boat of the scene taking place. It has a way of making you feel like you are at home. And in a sense, it makes you feel calm.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in Nagi no Asukara are really something. Some I liked a lot more than others, I'll say that much. But either way, I cannot help but admire the differences that make them all special, unique, and quirky. All the characters balance each other, playing off of one another, and growing and maturing because of each other. Hikari is a childish, immature boy. Manaka is a sweet, innocent girl. They help each other mature, and change over time, whether they realize it or not. Chisaki lacks confidence and self-esteem. Kaname and Tsumugu try to push her to be brave. However, not all is happy and good. What I appreciate most is that each character has their flaws. That's what makes them real. That's what makes them human. That's what makes them relatable. Sometimes so relatable that you almost cringe, because you know you are the exact same way. They're the kind of character that grow throughout the series, and for some, you can get so emotionally invested in these characters, it's like your growing alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is frustrating. It's relaxing. It's heart breaking. It gives you an immense feeling of joy, and an immense feeling of sadness all at ones. It plays in tune with your emotions. It makes you laugh. It makes you cry. It makes you want to rant forever, or it makes you want to rethink your entire life. I believe that Nagi no Asukara has the ability to cater to it's audience. I was engaged right from the beginning, I was engaged throughout, and to the very end. I enjoyed Nagi no Asukara. It is one of my favourite animes of the fall/winter season. It's definitely enjoyable. For me, at least. I think anyone should give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Nagi no Asukara is what it is. A drama, a romance, a story. What you perceive to be another child romance story changes into much more. It can be playful and safe, like a child wading pool. Or it can be as deep as the depths of the oceans. It all depends on whether you take the first step and dive into the story with an open mind. Overall, I believe Nagi no Asukara is a beautiful anime. Would I recommend it? Well, yes. I'm recommending it to you, aren't I? So give it a chance, or you may just miss out. \\n",

I myself only got halfway into the first episode and put it on hold for a while, bad move.\r\nPROS \r\nNagi no asukara does what it sets out to do in a measured fashion. It's this measured fashion that made me feel like this anime wasn't worth watching however once you delve into it, it does becoming something entertaining and unexpected. It's romance is more or less good and so is it's storyline. Nagi's true highlight is in it's character development, it's wonderful array of it's characters really do start to shine through during the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\nIn saying that Nagi no asukara had great character development, I did feel somethings that one character lacked this development. Yes some things didn't make sense, it's a hard theme to keep up with (fish people) but nothing ever got to the point where it affected my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch?\\n\r\nI think Nagi no asukara is worth watching. It's true that it doesn't do anything spectacular but it's story is interesting and compelling, I wouldn't call this a true slice of life anime but more of an adventure romance.",

            "content": "I watched the series nearly a year ago after reading rave reviews. This was my first P.A. Works anime, and I came in with high-ish expectations that were crushed both quickly and dismally.\r\nSome spoilers ahead.\r\nStory / World-building (4/10):\r\nBy and large, the biggest disappointment. Let's start with the world-building: the concept of Nagi no Asukara was definitely intriguing; an underwater community directly adjacent but socially barred from mainland community. Naturally, this opens an opportunity for great world-building and a chance to see a unique take on unfamiliar territory.\r\nUnfortunately, nothing is really unfamiliar. The underwater community of Shioshishio almost has no difference with the land world. Itis literally a regular human town - just underwater. The residents have no fishy traits and look like normal land people - just underwater. After a while, it really seems that the only other marker constantly reminding you that Shioshishio is \"different\" is the constant narrated callback to imposed social barriers. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the plot. The chosen heroes are young children from both Shioshishio and land world. Their fates are tied to the ancient origins of their homes. Normally, this can make for a compelling plot, but the way the series inputted typical slice-of-life with homespun myth and magic just...wasn't satisfying. If anything, I found it melodramatic and at times senseless. The \"impending doom\" scenario loses its edge. The twists and turns in the plot are presented in a predictable manner; at times, they even seem overly convenient (the end of the first arc and the beginning of second arc was particularly unappealing, even a little confusing). How things \"work out\" is even more lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major downfall was the **heavy** emphasis on the romantic notions all throughout the series. Never mind the fact that these are children in puberty - the series' take on romance is, in a word, absolutely infuriating. The standard average of the love triangle takes on more dimensions as it turns out everyone in the hero-group has feelings for, you guessed it, the person that doesn't seem romantically interested in him/her. As you observe how the \"romantic gestures\" are carried out, you might, like me, become angrier at how incredibly shallow, hackneyed, or annoying many of them are. This will be explained more in the \"character\" section.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, story had great potential, but was not carried out in a way that shows the same level of promise as its concept.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nThe visuals are wonderful. The landscapes and environments glitter and glow. Character visuals are fine and animation is great. P.A. Works seems to have a trend in producing fantastic art. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nFantastic; the soundtrack is my favorite part of the series and its variety is wonderful. You should definitely give the OST a listen even if you choose not to watch the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3-4/10):\\n\r\nWhew, okay. This is where most of my upset with the series comes from. Usually, when I watch any anime, there is at least **one** character that I genuinely like or can at least empathize with. Unfortunately, I did not find myself feeling this connection with ANY character in Nagi-Asu. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the protagonists just has some deep flaw that seriously mess with how they interact with each other. Hikari loves Manaka but is in crucial need of anger management classes along with an ego-relief. Manaka is clumsy, silly, frail - another damsel in distress type with nothing much to offer. Kaname is kind and keeps his feelings to himself, which apparently gives him the boot in terms of romantic pursuit. Chisaki is annoying and desperate and her priorities are not well-placed. Tsumugu is a silent and stoic rock which automatically means he must catch the feelings of some foolish girl.\\n\\n\r\nI supported no one in their romances because of how the set romantic pairs interacted with each other. The depths of their innocent friendship is bludgeoned by the frantic pressure of hormonal interests and consistent indecision - while this may be acceptable in some romance anime, it was plainly frustrating to see it played out by the Nagi-Asu characters. Yes, feelings can be confusing, but my goodness they do not have to be as complicated as they appear in Nagi-Asu. \\n\\n\r\nMiuna and Sayu are no different. They first showed up as younger, bitter brats and, by stroke of narrative magic, are shown in the 2nd season at the same age as their respective romantic interests. How wonderfully convenient that time worked in their favor - by progressing for the two girls, and stopping for their boy crushes. Their antics in the 2nd season are unremarkable. Miuna especially felt like a wrench thrown into the love polygon; I disliked her the most because she received so much emphasis as a \"side-liner\" that you're supposed to sympathize with. I did not at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, characters felt one-dimensional and none of them had appealing personalities. No character was really fleshed out in a way that made me appreciate them on a real level. For the most part, their unwavering annoying behavior was all that I saw in them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nI watched the whole series out of both a sense of duty and deep frustration. I just wanted things to play out okay, and was hoping that with each episode SOMETHING will change my opinion of anything. Well, nothing like that really happened.\\n\\n\r\nI did not feel good watching throughout, and did not feel satisfied at the end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLast comments:\\n\r\nOverall, I can sum up my experience with Nagi-Asu in two words: exhausting and frustrating. The melodrama was painful. The romance was awful. The story was disappointing. Only the art and sound gets points from me, which is sad, because I don't want to contain my positive opinions of any anime to just these two aspects. I believe the biggest issue is with the characters that are chosen to be the bearers of the story. I felt the same way with another PA Works anime, Hanasaku Iroha - beautiful art, but characters lack appeal. \\n\\n\r\nBut, this is just my personal take. Perhaps you will more things enjoyable and delightful in Nagi-Asu that I either ignored or couldn't see in my blind rage. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

But that isn't a fail-safe, and this series if nothing else is a representation of what decent plot pacing and exposition have to show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow add a charming and confident story, powerful themes and metaphors, diverse and endearing characters and beautiful artwork to top it off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about love. Plain and simple - although it proves to be much more than that. It is a coming of age story about families and friends who struggle with change and the love they all (and some eventually) find.\\n\r\nIt is shameless in it's raw convictions and it does not shy away from engaging with the realistic truths that are faced when life, love and people, inevitably change.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a protagonist or two of course, but even so each and every character has a role to fulfill and to the best of its ability, the series connects all it can together - with almost flawless success.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork are superb and immersive, and the music only raises this fact to new heights - as any score should.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuch heart and quality are seldom found so closely bound and developed in a series of this nature. But if you are of any inclination to fall into such a story, I am giving you my promise it is worth the experience.",

I still don't understand how people of the Sea Village can cook, eat, and conduct normal routine while underwater but hey, since when did things in anime actually make sense? But while I was a bit mesmerized by the fantastical underwater life, I was disappointed that the story line was mostly focused on the lives of a group of students and ended up being more of a slice of life rather than fantasy anime. \r\nArt- 5/10: While the setting of the Sea World was beautifully drawn the characters all looked identical with the same eye shape, eye color, facial features, etc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10: No particularly interesting character was introduced in this series so yeah...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10: I didn't have the patience to watch all the episodes because after the first 6-10 episodes the plot dragged and the entire series became too boring to continue. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say this anime was a HUGE disappointment.

            "content": "Britt: Disappointment. What more can I say, other than \"dis-a-ppoint-ment\"? It was just....it was so bad! This show had so much potential, and that potential was WASTED here! Seriously, what the hell?? God. I guess I should actually review the freaking anime before I start ranting on and on about how I didn't like it. As usual, we're going to start with the story. The mess of a story here I might add.\r\nStory: (Copied from \"My Anime List\")\r\n\"Long ago, all humans lived beneath the sea. However, some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently. As a consequence, they were stripped of their god-givenprotection called \"Ena\" which allowed them to breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the denizens of the sea and of the surface widened, although contact between the two peoples still existed.\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara follows the story of Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido, along with their childhood friends Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki, who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea.\\n\\n\r\nHikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet me point out all the problems I see here: What exactly does it mean by \"some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently\"? Is it like a \"Little Mermaid\" scenario where they just said \"forget my family and friends! I'm going to abandon them to live up on land with strangers!\" or some crap like that? And how were people born in the sea when they could just so easily live on land where there's honestly more to do there anyway? Is this a religious thing? Like how at the beginning of the worlds creation there was nothing but water? Is that the direction they were taking with this? They could've also been a little more specific with it. Like, I wouldn't have minded knowing who actually decided living on land was better than living in the ocean, and if the anime could explain their reasoning. That brings me to another problem I have here. Why are the sea dwellers and land walkers racist towards each other? No seriously, why? They're almost the exact same! Only difference between them is some people have blue eyes/eyelashes and live in the sea. That's literally the only difference. They both have school, they both eat and cook the same, they both read the same, sleep the same, open pickle jars the same, live in the same type of houses, they even have FIRE and STARES underwater, so what the hell is the difference between them? They hate each other for NO. FREAKING. REASON. Is this just a way to create some forced drama and conflict? Because it didn't work. Their ways of living are too similar to even say this is a real issue between them. Shioshishio is the underwater village, while Oshiooshi is the land peoples village. The creators were even lazy enough to make their village names damn near anagrams of each other! It's just a case of people bullying one another for no reason whatsoever. That's all. Also, the world-building wasn't good. Like. Seriously bad here. The little bit of the oceanic world we got to see was beautiful, but are you actually expecting me to believe that there's only ONE village in the ENTIRE ocean? I don't understand why we couldn't explore it a bit more. And why is it that Hikari and his 3 friends were the only children in their entire village who had to be sent to land school? Heck, they're the only children ever SEEN from their village! You absolutely cannot tell me with a straight fact that that little village takes up the entire. ocean. Why aren't there any other villages? And their middle school was the only one they had so they had to go to land middle school and they're the only middle schoolers living in Shioshishio? That's freaking retarded. And for the limited amount of \"plot\" they actually had, it was glossed over to make room for contrived romance. Which I'll get more onto in a second. Seriously, who wrote the script for this mess of a plot? (Mari Okada) Okay. Yup. That makes sense now.\\n\r\nThe story gets a  4/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWanna know what's worse than the story of this anime? The freaking characters, that's what! Most of them were unlikable and most of their decisions were stupid and unbelievable. I can easily sum up the main 4 in one word: Hikari-->tsundere, Manaka-->crybaby, Chisaki-->b*tch, and Kaname-->bland. The other characters aren't good, either. Tsumugu is almost exactly like Kaname, except he shows even LESS emotion than him, and the most reaction we ever see from him is probably in episode 14 or 26. Miuna is a bit difficult to describe in a nice way. She just seemed to be there just cause she can be, until the last episode where they made her more relevant than I thought possible. Same with her best friend, Sayu. Akari is Hikari's older sister, who was best friends with Miuna's mother, but then her mother died, and Akari and Miuna's dad started dating....Which I find...not right, for lack of a better word. I don't want to imagine it this way, but it felt like she was just waiting for Miuna's mom to be out of the picture so she could be with her dad. They even have a kid together and Miuna starts calling her mom, and it feels like NOBODY saw anything wrong with this. I know this most likely was NOT the intention, but it certainly felt that way. And I guess since the same thing basically happened in RWBY, it's just considered \"normal\" *shudders*. Really, the main issue I have with the characters is that they all seem to be in love with each other for whatever reason, they're indecisive as hell (and you should all know how I feel about that from my Vampire Knight review), and they cry too damn much. Think Lucy from Fairy Tail and Dawn from Pokemon cry a lot? Well you ain't seen nothing yet! They cry way too much for me to even feel sympathy for them. Most of the time, their tears are unnecessary, and are only there for forced drama. I also bet you're wondering why I said they fall in love too easily and they're very indecisive, huh? Well even if you weren't wondering, I'm gonna explain it anyway! You've heard of love triangles right? Heck, you've probably heard of love polygons too, haven't ya? Well, have you ever heard of love \"squiggly lines\" before?? Well if that's what you've been after, look no further cause this anime has got that squiggly line for you! Let's put this in a way you'll perhaps understand: Hikari likes Manaka, but it seems Manaka might have slight feelings for Tsumugu, but it's later revealed that she actually likes Hikari. Chisaki also likes Hikari, but didn't tell him because she knew he liked Manaka. Kaname likes Chisaki as well which he randomly told her out of the blue because he showed NO signs of actually liking her in that way beforehand, but it seems Chisaki may have started developing feelings for Tsumugu as well despite acting like she hated him earlier on. Tsumugu likes Chisaki back, but it's so hard to tell with this guy since he's like stale bread who spouts words of wisdom every now and then, but has the personality of a rock. Miuna ALSO likes Hikari, and this is probably the strangest one considering logically Hikari is her uncle now, since his older sister married her dad (that's creepy as hell.) Miuna's 3 year old brother has a 3 year old crush on Manaka, random boy A likes Miuna, and random girl B likes Kaname, the lamp post loves the stop sign, the garbage can loves the bucket of water, and lastly, Sayu likes Kaname, and it felt like he was playing with her emotions when she told him. Did you get all of that? Need a diagram for this crap don'cha? I also find them indecisive because they hardly EVER make up their minds about something. This is mostly for Manaka and Chisaki, ESPECIALLY Chisaki. The reason I called her a b*tch at first is because that was pretty much her whole character. She acted sweet and innocent, but for some reason started hating on Manaka because the guy she likes is in love with her...? Excuse me, but how is that Manaka's fault? She never forced or even TOLD Hikari to like her, he decided that on his own! Manaka even tried to hook the two of them up, yet Chisaki was STILL being salty! Are you jealous because he likes someone else? Is that your problem?? And I'm sorry, but she basically hated Tsumugu's guts earlier on in the series, but as time went on, it felt like she developed feelings for him and started living with him, but was still in love with Hikari at the same time. I should also mention that in episode 13 when Tsumugu fell off the boat into the ocean, she screamed his name in terror and worry, despite telling him to \"shut his mouth because he doesn't know squat or understand what she's going through\" a few hours, maybe even a day before. She also let Kaname fall into the ocean right after saving Tsumugu, and you can just see the jealousy in his eyes as he falls into the water staring and her. I mean, she might've only saved Tsumugu because he's a regular human being who would've drowned had she not saved him (at least, that's how it was in the beginning. He and Miuna get plot armor later on in the series), but the way she screamed his name made it seem as though she loved him. And in episode 17, you can just feel the envy flowing through Kaname's veins as he watches Chisaki getting along with Hikari and Tsumugu (and what even is episode 19...?). Kaname might as well have been added to her list of guys that she's trying to pick but can't decide on which one. Manaka was a bit indecisive too because she couldn't choose between Hikari and Tsumugu, but it became clear who she really wanted and was just in denial like everyone else. While that situation was annoying in itself, at least she wasn't on Chisaki's level of annoyance (and Manaka actually became a better character when the Sea God took her ability to love). Really the only person I gave a crap about was Lord Uroko (or if you wanna be a weeb, Uroko-Sama.) He was the only one who was actually likable in my eyes, plus he's cute as heck (CUTE=SMEXY). I honestly would've preferred watching him the entire time than watch the other characters being stupid and annoying. It's sad we don't go into his backstory till later on in the series.\\n\r\nThe characters get a 3.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nHere comes literally the ONLY good thing about this anime aside from Lord Uroko! I thought the art was beautiful, and while most people will consider the music to be dull and generic, I honestly loved it as well. I enjoyed the soft sounds playing in the background, and I actually reeeeeally like the first opening: \"Soshite Bokura Wa\" by Ray, and the first ending: \"Aqua Terrarium\", by Nagi Yanagi. Loved them enough to get the full songs onto my MP3 player. And The first OP sounded like a Vocaloid was singing it, and I love Vocaloid so...ya know. The second OP and ED were good, too, but if I had to choose, it'd be the first ones instead, cause I don't recall ever skipping them, and if I did it was probably only once or twice. I thought the sounds of the ocean were well done and realistic sounding, and I watched the anime dubbed. Think the voice actors did a really great job here. They really made Hikari sound like a tsundere, Manaka sound like a crybaby, Chisaki sound like a b*tch, and Kaname sound bland. So, props to them. The ocean was very pretty, especially when the sun was rising or setting on it (just wish it could've been explored more.) And despite not liking the characters, I thought their designs were very pretty. At least, the people from Shioshishio. The people up on land were boringly colored and designed, along with their village, so the ocean was the best. All in all, this was definitely the best part of the series, and I wish everything else was just as good.\\n\r\nGive the art and the sound both an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this series. Come on at me with your pitchforks and whatnot, but I just...did not like it. The best thing about it was the art and music, and art and music isn't enough to save a series from being bad (Looking at you, SAO.) I don't think this series needed 26 episodes either, as it seems most of their conflicts could've been solved in less time than that had the characters just talked to each other. I went into this show expecting to love it, and I was disappointed with it. The thing with the Sea God (that I kinda forgot to mention during the story part) was also pretty stupid. His reasoning's for wanting to freeze over the land killing off the land people and then putting all the ocean people into hibernation because he was lonely and wanted a girlfriend was petty to the extreme. And then suddenly letting land people breath underwater even though normal humans shouldn't be able to (logically) because REASONS was poor. Very poor. Hikari even called it \"childish\". Why were they suddenly able to breath underwater when the show specifically stated beforehand that they would not be able to do that even if someone in their family was from Shioshishio? And why did Manaka lose her \"Ena\" and then gained it again when Miuna grabbed her freaking arm? And don't even get me started on the magical, voodoo, \"ryu ga waga teki wa kurau\" crap that happened in episode 26. There was too much damn plot armor. The series could've been better, and I wish it would've lived up to the hype (still looking at you, SAO.) The characters were all whiny, indecisive, and annoying for the most part. Only ones who flat out spoke their minds were Kaname and Tsumugu, and Tsumugu is (as I mentioned earlier) like a rock.\\n\r\nI give the final score of: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if you enjoyed the show, but it just wasn't for me. It made me laugh a few times, and Lord Uroko will forever be bae, otherwise I didn't really like it.",

Not because I don't have anything to say about each of its sections, but because everything is so average in \"Nagi no Asukara\" that it's hard to choose something to start with. I'm not saying that it's bullshit (it isn't), but I do consider that it has little in what really stands out or in what differs from other animes.\r\nWell, actually I'm going to be truthful: probably if you're a fierce fan of romance you'll love it. And I insist on being a fierce fan because \"Nagi no Asukara\" is pureromance. Everything else, including the fantasy world created around it, is a simple excuse to develop loving relationships between the characters. Is this bad? I think the answer depends a lot on the person. I like romance, I think it's natural and it's logical that it's part of almost any story. But for me romance should be an addition, an extra to a main plot. In \"Nagi no Asukara\" it's the other way around. No discussion, in fact. You will know if it is your style.\\n\\n\r\nObviously in between all this romance (adolescent romance, by the way, with all that entails) there are also brushstrokes of a story that's not all bad. It seems a bit simplistic at first, but then it gets better little by little, even with some mythological \"lore\". It's no big deal, but at least it's dynamic and entertaining story. Even in a given moment there is a time leap with some characteristics... let's say.... \"special\". A very brave decision on the part of the scriptwriters and also very wise, because in these episodes is where the best level of the series is reached. Moreover, I would say that this section is of quite good quality in a general concept, not only within what is the \"Nagi no Asukara\" itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of characters is quite common. Nothing that hasn't already been seen a thousand times. The main character, Hikari, is a histrionic kid with a good heart but a bit immature. Other main character, Manaka, is an adorable and kind girl that everybody likes. I don't like histrionics. I also think there comes a point when something is so \"kawaii\" that it's no longer credible. That's why I'm not convinced by either of them, although it's fair to say that they both evolve for the better throughout the series. I also prefer characters like Chisaki, always in the background, but with a much more credible and better constructed personality. I would also like to vindicate Akari, a character that seems to me to be completely wasted. It's unbelievable (for bad) how they make a girl who doesn't reach 25 looks like a real middle-aged lady. It may have some logic because \"Nagi no Asukara\" is aimed at a certain section of the public that probably has that perception of people of that age, but... damn, it's shocking. Generational impact, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have the technical section and in this \"Nagi no Asukara\" does quite well. It has a cheerful and colorful artistic section, with a solid and detailed drawing, both on stages and in characters. The soundtrack is not far behind and has some melodies that sound very good. As for the openings/endings, I prefer the second opening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nRealmente no s\u00e9 muy bien por d\u00f3nde empezar con esta review. No porque no tenga nada que decir sobre cada uno de sus apartados, sino porque todo es tan promedio en \"Nagi no Asukara\" que es complicado elegir algo con lo que arrancar a comentarla. Que nadie se enfade antes de tiempo, no estoy diciendo que sea una basura (no lo es), pero s\u00ed considero que tiene poco en lo que realmente destaque o en lo que se diferencie de otros animes.\\n\\n\r\nBueno, en realidad voy a ser franco: probablemente si eres un fan ac\u00e9rrimo del romance te encantar\u00e1. Y recalco lo de fan ac\u00e9rrimo porque \"Nagi no Asukara\" es puro romance. Todo lo dem\u00e1s, incluido el mundo fant\u00e1stico creado alrededor, es una simple excusa para poder desarrollar relaciones amorosas entre los personajes. \u00bfEs esto malo? Creo que la respuesta depende mucho de la persona. A m\u00ed me gusta el romance, creo que es algo natural y que es l\u00f3gico que forme parte de pr\u00e1cticamente cualquier historia. Pero para m\u00ed el romance deber\u00eda ser un a\u00f1adido, un extra respecto a una trama principal. En \"Nagi no Asukara\" ocurre al rev\u00e9s. Sin discusi\u00f3n, de hecho. T\u00fa sabr\u00e1s si es tu estilo.\\n\\n\r\nObviamente entre tanto romance (romance adolescente, por cierto, con todo lo que ello conlleva) tambi\u00e9n hay pinceladas de una historia que no est\u00e1 del todo mal. Parece algo simplona al principio, aunque luego va mejorando poco a poco, incluso con algo de \"lore\" mitol\u00f3gico y tal. No es nada del otro mundo, pero al menos es din\u00e1mica y entretenida. Incluso en un momento dado hay un salto temporal con unas caracteristicas... digamos... \"especiales\". Una decisi\u00f3n muy valiente por parte de los guionistas y tambi\u00e9n muy acertada, porque en estos cap\u00edtulos es donde se alcanza el mejor nivel de la serie. Es m\u00e1s, dir\u00eda que ese tramo es de una calidad bastante buena en un concepto general, no solo dentro de lo que es la propia \"Nagi no Asukara\".\\n\\n\r\nEl plantel de personajes es bastante com\u00fan. Nada que no se haya visto ya mil veces. El protagonista, Hikari, es un chaval histri\u00f3nico con buen coraz\u00f3n pero un poco bastante inmaduro. La protagonista, Manaka, es una chica adorable y amable que cae bien a todo el mundo. A m\u00ed no me gusta el histrionismo ni un pelo. Tambi\u00e9n considero que llega un punto en el que algo es tan \"kawaii\" que deja de ser cre\u00edble. Por eso ninguno de los dos termina de convencerme, aunque es justo se\u00f1alar que a lo largo de la serie ambos van evolucionando para bien. Igualmente yo prefiero a personajes como Chisaki, siempre en segundo plano, pero con una personalidad mucho m\u00e1s verosimil y mejor construida. Tambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda reivindicar a Akari, personaje que me parece completamente desaprovechado. Es incre\u00edble (para mal) c\u00f3mo consiguen que una chica que no llega a los 25 a\u00f1os parezca una aut\u00e9ntica se\u00f1orona de mediana edad. Vale que pueda tener cierta l\u00f3gica porque \"Nagi no Asukara\" va dirigida a cierto sector del p\u00fablico que probablemente tenga esa percepci\u00f3n de la gente de esa edad, pero... joder, es chocante. Impacto generacional supongo.\\n\\n\r\nPor \u00faltimo tenemos el apartado t\u00e9cnico y en esto \"Nagi no Asukara\" cumple bastante bien. Tiene un apartado art\u00edstico alegre y colorido, con un dibujo s\u00f3lido y detallado, tanto en escenarios como en personajes. El apartado sonoro no se queda atr\u00e1s y la banda sonora tiene alguna que otra melod\u00eda que suena muy bien. En cuanto a los openings/endings, me quedar\u00eda con el segundo opening.",

But as the show progressed, you couldn't help but start to fall in love with him and all the other characters. The music was perfect for this anime also. I loved the beautiful, but simple animations, I enjoyed how it delved into the story about \"Ena\", the backgrounds of each characters and the story of the city they came from and how it all began. This show was a real tearjerker, especially after the time jump. There aretears, laughs and anger, but overall it was really great. I was kind of disappointed with the ending, but eh, what are you going to do.",

It gives back that feel of youth we all had (or in some peoples cases still have) and the feeling of regrets and what we could of done different. That youthful refreshing feeling is what made this anime so enjoyable, really wets the appetite ( pun intended ).  The characters are well developed, all getting their fair share of screen time and back story, while the unique art style of this underwater paradiseadds to the emotion of this feeling of 'Worlds Apart'. The soundtrack for this anime is a very sad one, one in which, I found myself hating it for the fact that it brought out so much emotion, sometimes lacking the happy feel which I look for in an anime, whether throughout the anime, or just the happy conclusion. As my only warning though, if you are intending on watching this, you should know that this is more of a tragedy anime than a feel good one, if you can't stomach the darker tones of romance, I would give this one a pass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBe it that I cannot put this anime into words, i'll just leave it at two! \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGoogolgon Triangle.",

            "content": "First off, let me just say that this show is fantastic. Based on the raw preview I saw (no subs), I assumed this show would be a cute, possibly surreal (maybe not, maybe just symbolism) slice of life show, similar to K-on...but with water. So I sat down to watch a subbed episode and see what it was about, thinking I was going to be watching a comedy or drama, and not really having high hopes for it as I originally thought it was a bit too cutesy. Wow, was I wrong! And I'm so glad I was!\r\nART: This show is anything but cutesy. Well,that might be saying too much. They push the cute at first, then club you in the face with realistic characters. The art is amazing. I can't stop staring at the characters' eyes, which look as watery as their own world. And Shioshishio (the underwater world) is just gorgeous! It makes you want to live there.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Rather than a slice of life similar to K-on, this is more like a drama in the vein of Kokoro Connect or Shinsekai no Yori (without the killing). While the characters are adorable, they have some serious issues. And the cute, young art style just emphasizes that they are tweens dealing with the drama of simply growing up as well as some more serious issues mixed in (dating a widower, falling in love, needing an outlet to express your emotions, wishing ill on your best friend because you're in love with the guy that loves her and all that will will makes you hate yourself, etc.). On top of all that drama there's the sea god's \"spokesman\" who may curse you by making your knee sprout a talking fish...like tweens need THAT kind of problem?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Well, most were very likeable. Hikari is your typical angry, angsty guy similar to InuYasha. I don't usually like characters like that, but Hikari seems to almost physically grapple with his feelings to the point that his anger is clearly a metaphor as he struggles to understand himself. Then there's Manaka, who seems at first glance to be the typical wilting flower that can't stand up for herself. Except that she grows as well to the point that she's not only standing up for herself, but protecting her friends as well (there's an episode where Hikari is utterly amazed by this). I don't know, sounds cliche but it isn't. There are two characters that were a little too much like what I've seen in every other anime like this, and that bothered me. One is Chisaki who loves Hikari and is sad all the time because he doesn't love her. Her character resolution by the end of the series was unexpected and it worked well. The other is Kaname who is the gentle, almost feminine support that compassionately loves the unobtainable female. He seems \"too nice,\" but definitely has a lonely, jealous side.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was great about the characters is that there aren't good guys and bad guys. They're just kids with a multitude of feelings. Having a negative emotion doesn't make you evil.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The show has a time skip, but it's different than most. And all the character resolutions and evolutions make sense and anticlimactic, but if they were done any other way it would have been a completely different show. There are major events going on in the world of this show, and that seems to make up for anything else that is lackluster in an an anime (but may seem over the top in the real world). A great show! Good for fans of moe as well as fans of drama.",

            "content": "Although this show falls into some common traps that make many romance anime bad, it's still worth a watch for anyone looking for emotional impact and closure. \r\nAs you can infer from the summary, the story has an intriguing premise, and the studio does fairly well in using its novelty. With people who are born from the sea and people who are landlocked, the story sets up an interesting dynamic between a society of divided people. While this is a main focus in the beginning, the show does slowly abandon this theme as it goes on, and decides to concentrate more and more on therelationship between the characters. By the end, this unique setting contributes little to the show; anyone who is looking for complex world-building or themes about society and human nature will not find it here. It really is mainly for romance fans, and while it does execute it better than many other romances I've seen, it does sometimes resort to cop-out solutions given there are many characters, and all of them are involved in the romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are extremely fantastic though. The visuals definitely helped a lot in my enjoyment of the show, and there are many beautiful scenes. If you're even a casual romance fan, the visuals will be worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nWith so many characters, this show does surprisingly well in handling each one. Many shows often just seem to forget about some side characters, so when they suddenly play a role, it seems forced and out of line. Each person has a role to play, and each has their own struggles, happiness, worries, and quirks. This show also doesn't employ the common tropes seen in harems, so there's a more realistic connection between each character. This doesn't mean every character is likable; many may find the main ones to be annoying, but they are well-developed and often relatable.\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear P.A. Works put a lot of effort into this one given the top quality visuals and sound, and for any romance fan, Nagi no Asukara is a good watch. The plot has some weaknesses, but none big enough to ruin the story, and the show's real strength is its ability to handle the relationships of so many characters without making it feel like any of them were unnecessary. People seeking in-depth development on its unique setting probably won't find it in this show, but anyone looking for an emotional story with a central focus on romance will find it here.",

            "content": "Nagi No Asukara is, for me, an example of a series with a great potential that was executed poorly. Althoguh people mark this show very highly, the story is really badly written, the characters are sketches and the fantasy aspect was just ruined. The best aspect of this show is the animation.\r\nThe series is set in a world in which there are two types of human: those who live under the water, and those who live on the surface. The story is about students from an underwater village who transfer schools to a school on the surface, and its main subject (as much as Iunderstood) is the racism between the two kinds of people. \\n\r\nNow, the story has a great potential, but it was very poorly written, and this is the main reason for my mean score. We don't get to know about the background and history of the world (which is essential for a fantasy books and series), so things like the strong racism between the water and the surface human, the sea god and her powers, the salty rain and many other are just left unexplained, although they play a very important role in the series. The characters often act stupidly and without reason (an example - Hikari hugs Manaka after she hears a very bad news. Manaka kicks him hard, and sees surprised of herself). The dialogues are stupid (the characters argue about whenether they should change themselves. But why do they have to change? What should they change in themselves? No clue). \\n\r\nThe turning point of the story was quite promising, but from there, it deteriorted quickly. When a disaster comes close, the people on the surface act normally - continue with their life as nothing will happen. The few dramatical dialogues between the characters did not sove this problem. And when they finally found a possible solution, it was just horrible and pointless  (I will not spoil), and if you ask me, it was added just for the drama. After that, I dropped the series, because I saw that it was not heading to a good direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are really one-dimensional. Hikari just keeps shouting and hitting other people (he is the only character who gets a character development, but it is too sudden and polar to be reliable). Manaka is just cute. Kihara is the only character that I found convincing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, is really good. The character designs, the school, both of the villages were done very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Nagi No Asukara is a rather dissapointing series. The story makes no sense, and although the fantasy setting sees promising, there is a lack of information about it, which is essential for the series. So if you try to find a fantasy series with a good story and not just a good concept, I suggest you to skip this one.",

            "content": "This isn't a review to critique the anime. I'm just gonna say what this anime has made me feel.\r\nIn the first half, the four friends were happy with their underwater life. Then changes with the introduction of Tsumugu happened, changing everything. The way to characters react to this change is just amazing as they do not want to change, and even get sad over the fact of it, but the change is inevitable. This anime just hits so close to home with the way Hikari feels about Tsumugu coming in and \"stealing Manaka\" away from him. It's so relateable, as I'm sure everyone has felta similar thing happen to them either with a crush or a close friend. It has happened to me personally so many times that it pissed me off. I didn't like the anime at first because of this, and how Manaka reacted really angered me. But it all makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half was just wow. The time-skip was so unexpected and how things changed on the surface was mind-blowing. The main thing that turned this anime from a 4 to a 10 for me is Miuna. She basically becomes the new Manaka, the new main girl if you will, in the second part. Her love for Hikari and her depressing nature makes her a tragic heroine in this part, and yet despite this she still gets along with her romantic rival Manaka very well. The second part of the anime opened my eyes to see how amazing this anime really is. The four friends, all not wanting change and wanting to keep things how they were, were the ones causing each other grief. It is so relateable because think about it. Feelings of depression and anxiety usually are caused by things such as love and closeness to other people. This idea was basically the main theme of the anime. They keep telling and showing how love hurts everyone surrounding it, but at the same time the anime shows it is a worthwhile feeling to have. It reveals the answer of if it truly is \"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\" And that answer is true. Even if you're crying and in pain from your current relationship, but understand that it is better to have that experience, and that you shouldn't trade it for the world. Even if thinking back to it makes you sad, be like Miuna and move on not regretting a thing, with a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Anime",

But I don't think that this rule applies to Nagi no Asukara.\r\nIn my honest opinion one of the best anime that I have ever watched; and I'm glad I watched it; even if it didn't start out the way it ended.\r\nTo pull myself together I'll just quickly articulate on how I believe the start and end felt in correlation.\r\nThe start felt rushed, it seemed as if P.A. Works wanted to push the entire story quickly onto the viewer, with as little time as possible. I bet they also quickly realized this wasn't gonna workout that way.\\n\r\nThe end felt extremely well managed, it didn't feel too rushed, nor did it feel too drawn out - an amazing balance was hit, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, characters and the art are all pretty unique in their own ways.\\n\r\nI can't say much to the story other than; watch it yourself - but the stuff I can say I'll say now.\\n\r\nIt was a nice change of pace, something I've never heard or thought of before.\\n\r\nA world where sea-humans and normal-humans lived separated and tried their best to keep it that way. Until four of the youngsters of Shioshishio need to transfer school, after the one in their home town closed. They had to transfer to a school on land, where - even though they got picked on at first - they quickly made a lot of acquaintances and friends. \\n\r\nI felt like this part of the story wasn't properly introduced to the viewer; they could've made so much more with that.\\n\r\nThe rest of the story was at a natural and good-to-watch pace, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are super unique in their own ways, although simple anime traits are to be seen in these characters, I still believe that they themselves are pretty unique, and I feel like their relationship to each other also felt natural - at least natural in the relation to their universe.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was outstanding, in my opinion. \\n\r\nIt was well drawn, detailed - but not too detailed, colorful - vibrant, and cute.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show more than I thought I would have when I started, but it quickly started to grow on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say it's a solid 10/10 for me, I don't see where the anime lacked else where - other than the rushed start.",

            "content": "So now that this show has come to an end, I feel like it is finally time to put my thoughts into a review to let you all know that you should watch this anime. Every singe one of you. No exceptions :)\r\nLooking back it's kind of funny that I just started watching Nagi no Asukara because I loved their uniforms on the picture, not because I was all to interested in it. What I expected was some lighthearted, cute and simple entertainment. What I got, however, was one of the best dramas I've ever seen, which also managed to get into my favorites listabout 5 episodes in and after this ending it is sure to stay there for a long time.\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed once I started watching was the breathtaking art in this show. The underwater scenery and the entire backgrounds look just downright stunning and even quite realistic sometimes. Definitely some of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in a TV anime. \\n\r\nThe characters are really cute and fit the show perfectly, I especially love the way they did the eyes. \\n\r\nAnimation was good as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, NagiAsu is faaar more than just the art, which will get you into the anime. What will make you stay though is the story which starts out looking like a casual slice of life/romance show but it soon adds some great drama into the mix. The whole love drama kinda put me off at first but that changed very soon because while we still have the relationship between the characters as a focus, we soon get a very interesting storyline that will probably tear your heart into pieces at some part. And while I know that the ending was kind of unsatisfying for some people, I personally felt like it was a perfect closure for this anime as it just made sense for the characters to act the way they did. \\n\r\nThe only thing that kind of bothered me about this show was the fact that there were some side plots that where either not necessary or not explored much further and therefore I felt like there was no need for them to be in the show (talking about Miuna and a certain person here for example). This is actually such a minor flaw that it is not able to lower my love for this show in the slightest.\\n\r\nWhat I think is amazing about NnA is that, while it is actually a show with a slow, calm atmosphere, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat, begging for more. For me it was pure torture waiting for the new episode week after week. So, if you do not like shows with a more calm atmosphere because it bores you, do not use this as a reason not to give this show a try. You might actually be able to enjoy it a lot more than you think.\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said above, the ending made sense in a way that it was really fitting the characters and here we go with another thing NagiAsu impresses. The characters. There's actually only one real thing to say about them: They feel real. The feel human. If you think about their actions for just a bit, all of them make sense, really. They all have their struggles to face, their strengthens and their weak parts, and they are delivered in a way that is just convincing. It also makes them loveable despite their flaws. Of course you will like one more than the other but I do not think that it is really possible to hate any of the characters. \\n\r\nBeing part of the thing that makes them as convincing is their development. At the end of the show you see some of that in every one of them. They all mature in a way, but in a realistic way instead of being a totally different person from one minute to the other. For some this development happens much faster while it takes almost until the end for others. What I did not like as much here was the fact that for some of the characters this development was HORRIBLY slow as they kept taking five steps backwards sometimes which could be a bit irritating. But then again, isn't it like that in real life as well? \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this show was pretty awesome as well. It did a great job putting across the atmosphere of the show. The tracks honestly made me shiver at times because  of how beautiful they were and how great they were fitting the scene they were played in. OP and ED were both fine though I think the last ED is the worst track out of them, while still not being bad. \\n\r\nQuite a lot of the songs in NagiAsu have made or will make it into my music collection because of how much I enjoyed them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I can say that for me, Nagi no Asukara is a must see if you like drama and slice of life shows while not being too put off by some love drama as well. This is one of the best anime I have seen in a while and totally my favorite out of the fall season 2013. I can barely find a thing they did wrong here and all I wish for now after seeing the last episode is to start this show over again, watch it all in one part and then continue with the second season that does not exist because I already miss all of the characters so much.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this was totally a show worthy of a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 Sound: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Enjoyment: 10/10 Overall: 10/10 :)",

I'm from Hawaii so seeing fish and the sea around the charecters made it feel like a dream.

            "content": "This was an anime that has captured my heart from the very beginning and very easily made its way to my favorites list! I am so thankful to have watched this. It was so beautiful in many ways and is absolutely amazing.\r\nSTORY ~\r\nThe story is a combination of drama, fantasy, and romance, which is always interesting if you execute it the right way. I've got to say, from my first impression of the anime, I had high expectations right from the start and had a general feeling of the type of anime this will be. However, it turned out COMPLETELY different from what I expected,but still very amazing. In other words, Nagi no Asukara was a pleasant surprise with many extremely emotional scenes. I didn't expect it to make me cry and tear up so many times. Also, what surprised me the most was the plot twist for the second arc of the anime. The overall feel between the two arcs are very different: first one being brighter and happier, second one being darker and mysterious. I was on the edge of my seat a lot more than I anticipated. Of course there were some (but very little) parts where I would have preferred it to be done differently; and there were also small parts that felt a little dragged. But these small things are not enough to bring the anime down. It has a great balance of genres. Very enjoyable and creative, with a beautiful ending!\\n\\n\r\nART ~\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara has the most gorgeous art and animation of any anime I have even seen/watched. It is simply breathtaking! The characters all look very pretty and handsome, and the best part would have to be the SCENERY. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful landscapes. The artwork was actually the first thing that grabbed my attention for this anime. Very well drawn and animated. Without a doubt, it deserves an A+.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUNDTRACK ~\\n\r\nAll I have to say for the music is that it is wonderful. I absolutely love the soundtrack! And I'm not just talking about the OP/ED, but also about the music throughout the anime. Beautiful and emotional soundtrack that really enhances the scenes. It's really rare for me to love the music of an anime so much, that I would constantly search for them through the internet. Excellent music choices!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER ~\\n\r\nIn Nagi no Asukara, there are a number of characters: all very diverse and have purpose. Character showings were very off balance, but I didn't mind at all. Some characters had a lot more time on screen than others. This allows the audience to connect more strongly to certain characters, rather than the other ones. However, the showtimes for some characters shifted over time.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I had a list of characters that I adored and a list that annoyed me. Character development was done very well and is very effective towards the storyline. I love how each of them matured and grew as a person. It was very rewarding to watch. By the end of the anime, I love every character! Very satisfying!!!\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara has left a mark on my heart and I am very sad it has ended. Truly a masterpiece in so many ways. This anime deserves a lot more attention than it gets. I am very happy and satisfied, especially with the ending. Nagi no Asukara is truly an anime I will never forget.",

Ending is 90% satisfying. 10% not.\r\nSpoiler ==>>\r\nBecause Miuna Shiodome ended alone. Everyone got their place with someone. Only Miuna Shiodome was left out. Even though she did so much for Hikari, she was the only one who did not find a good place for herself. That's the only part which took off the balance of the story.",

I don't know if its going to have a good or bad impression on people but here are my thoughts on Nagi no Asukara.I will try to make this review as small as possible and forgive me if i make any \r\nmistakes. \r\nFirst of all the story? Well it is actually a romance drama and as most people know these kind of anime contain love triangle but in case of Nagi no Asukara it is like a polygon.There were many love triangles and i really did love them but there was one triangle that i hated andit ruined the whole show for me and it also has some plot holes as there are may things unexplained at the end. I would not go into detail. So lets leave it at that.For Animation and Sound this anime was amazing.I loved the scenery and the sound was amazing.For me i enjoyed it a lot except for the love triangle i hate but i think it was worth the time.\\n",

            "content": "Most amazing anime pretty much. \r\nI started watching this anime and loved it. Partially because it's by P.A works, and the anime they make always ends up to be really good. Also because the art is beautiful/gorgeous. \r\nAt first, I thought the guy's school uniforms looked very girly, (Hikari/Kaname), but eventually I got used to it. \r\nTrust me, your feels will progressively become emotional each new episode. You'll grow to love this anime, and want more, to the point you finish it in one day. \r\nMy favourite characters throughout the whole series remain pretty much the same, which are Tsumugu, and Miuna :) (You gottalove Miuna!!!",

            "content": "**Spoiler free review**\r\nNagi No Asukara is one of my all time favorites. I got inspired writing this review while re-watching the series. Now that we're close to Christmas It's perfect time to watch this series.\r\nWhile It might sound silly, in Nagi No Asukara there are two races of people; surface and sea dwellers. They're practically the same but sea dwellers got this mysterious \"ena\" that allows them to live underwater.\r\nI'll tell a little about the beginning of the story so you'll get some kind of picture what this anime is about. \r\nThere's 4 childhood friends who live under sea in the village of Shioshishio. Thestory starts when their school gets closed and they have to go attend school on the surface. While they go attend school on the surface many complicated things start to happen, I won't spoil you but there's quite a bit of drama, comedy, some mystery, slice of life and romance. And I tell you folks, there Isn't love triangle.. It's a freaking love web, so pack your bags and get ready for feels train.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are exceptional compared to your ordinary anime. They all get tremendous amount of character progression and the four first episodes are all about introducing the characters and showing you what the world around them is like. One of the characters in the beginning might annoy you, but I assure you that after couple episodes he'll become your favorite. In the end there is not a single unlikeable character in Nagi no asukara.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the series is It's superior art and music quality, It'll make your jaw drop. Even now when I'm writing this review I'm drinking tea and listening the soundtrack. I love how they've created this lovely sea village which has this great atmosphere, waves splashing the docks, buildings slightly rusting from the salty sea wind and people doing their daily routines.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll talk a bit about the themes of this series. In my opinion the main theme of the anime is change and how scary it is and how it affects everyone. Not going more deeply into that since it would reveal slight spoilers. Other main themes are of course friendship, love and understanding in all of It's aspects.\\n\r\nThis series has some nice critique about racism. Land -and sea dwellers can't get along that well because of their history, but along the series they start to understand each other.\\n\\n\r\n** Slight spoilers**\\n\\n\r\nThere is a MAJOR change in tone of the anime about halfway the series. There's a timeskip and It'll get much darker and get's some refreshing themes like loss and well, the change. I very much enjoyed the second Arc of Nagi No Asukara.\\n\\n\r\n**End of Spoilers**\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nNagi No Asukara is underrated masterpiece that will blow your mind away when you give it a few episodes. It has some of the best character -and romance progressions out there. There's also deeper themes hidden in it, It's up to you to figure them out.\\n\\n\r\nNagi no Asukara is 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",
