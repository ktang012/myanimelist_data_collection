            "content": "Comedy is subjective. Some people prefer witty satire and others prefer blunt brainless nonesense. Well, Baka to Test is the latter of the two. Just like its namesake, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Idiots and Tests and Summoning Beings) is one hell of an idiotic show. But it serves its purpose of providing nonsensical entertainment, and I'm afraid if you are expecting otherwise then Baka to Test is not for you. \r\nTo many, the story is \u2013 to put it plainly \u2013 outright stupid. Students are split into classes from A-F based on their academic skills; A being full of smartarses and F being crammedwith quote/unquote \u201cthe mentally retarded\u201d.  Incidentally, what class you are in correlates to the facilities they have, much like an academic \u2018caste system\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nSo we have the idiots and tests out of the way, so what about the Summoning Beings? Evidently, there are ways to acquire these prestigious facilities \u2013 the obvious one being to score high on the mid-terms...and the other, Exam Summoning Battles.  Such battles consist of the student\u2019s being, which is a chibi version of themselves fighting other student\u2019s beings. Much like video games, they have points (which can be considered as health bars) that are knocked off through physical contact. There is little to no \u201cexam\u201d, or any such academic skills tested in these battles, but what the heck \u2013 anything goes in anime, more so in this one. The show is already incoherent enough to be questioned at this point. \\n\\n\r\nAkihisa and the rest of F-class duel in these ESB\u2019s to get the hotel-suite like facilities and prove to everyone that grades aren\u2019t everything! Along with that there are love triangles, mo\u00e9, traps, incest, lolicons, cross-dressing, yaoi, yuri and every anime clich\u00e9 under-the-sun.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd I for one love it for that.\\n\\n\r\nBrainless comedy is brainless.  Filled to the brim with slapstick humour and overacting such as the infamous anime nosebleed and much, much shouting to the point it is classed as screeching; dirty jokes and overall randomness Baka to Test helps the reviewer just sit back, relax and take it in all the over the top nature of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNot only does it spoof anime traits but it also parodies anime shows, the most recognizable ones being that from Gurren Lagann and Code Geass but they are quite subtly played. Knowledge of these shows aren't required to enjoy the show as they are only for minimal comedy relief.\\n\\n\r\nAnother wonderfully played clich\u00e9 are the stereotypical characters: \\n\\n\r\nAkihisa, the idiotic male lead completely oblivious to all the girls lusting over him;\\n\r\nHimeji, the big breasted intelligent yet timid beauty \u2013 and the most obvious love interest; \\n\r\nYuuji, strong willed and often in a comedic duo with Akihisa; \\n\r\nMinami, tomboyish though is actually quite the girl to heart;\\n\r\nKouta, the class\u2019 pervert;\\n\r\nAnd Hideyoshi, the \u2018trap\u2019 \u2013 often mistaken as a girl due to his appearances. \\n\\n\r\nThese walking stereotypes were all so superb at keeping the viewers laughing with their antics and traits. But as most stereotypes are \u2013 they are restricted. As progress throughout the show went on there was no doubt, a formula in the comedy. There were many spontaneous comedic moments as well, but most of it was rather repetitive. However, I wouldn\u2019t say it hindered the show greatly as it does not insult the viewer\u2019s sense of humour. It knows that we know this or that punch line or act yet it is delivered in such a way that it still stays fresh and funny. Much like a signature catchphrase, each character is assigned a certain quirk, habit or joke which we all come to know and love.  \\n\\n\r\nSilver Link\u2019s animation was impressive for an almost unknown company. The only other anime they have actually produced (Tayutama ~Kiss on my Deity~) is not very well known and since then their animation has improved. Although the art and animation is fairly average and similar to most other shows, it has subtle add-ins that would make it recognizable even amongst a hundred different anime, such as the colourful shadows each character has \u2013 all different colours, no less and the \u201cspotty\u201d inking in backgrounds and objects. Baka has no trouble integrating different styles of art for either comedic purposes or otherwise \u2013 using blindingly bright colours when needed and eerily dark when called for. Music is, just like the art, average. The OP and ED are very skippable and the background music is forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test does the job of using some very well known seiyuus as well as some not so very well known. All display a charismatic quality in their characters and bring out the character that they are. Akihisa is the loud idiot. Yuuji is the sometimes-calm-sometimes-not idiot. Himeji is naively sweet. Minami is an awkward idiot. Hideyoshi...does not sound like an idiot per se, but comes across as amusingly girly. And Kouta is perverted through and through.  Just hearing the voicing alone could tell you this. \\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018ending\u2019 of the show is much left to be desired for, in other words it was quite a letdown. Fortunately it has the opportunity to redeem itself with the second season announced to be aired soon. \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test isn\u2019t anything that hasn\u2019t been seen before. And honestly the excuse of a story isn\u2019t even well thought out or developed. But sometimes you will have to sit there, laugh it all off and say \u201cThat\u2019s just stupid!\u201d",

            "content": "There are tons of comedic styles to play on in anime, and Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu takes to it some of the more popular ones - and suceeds with it. Be it Kouta's excited peeping (and failing by nosebleeds), Minami's tomboyish behaviour and acts of violence against Akihisa, Shouko's yandere-esque violent obsession with Yuuji or the sheer over-the-top fighting with the Summoned Beasts. Or the rather subtle and rare allusions to various shows; Baka to Test has it in itself to bring out laughter from everyone and nobody.\r\nBaka to Test is the kind of comedy where the characters themselves, and not necessarily the situationaround them, is what makes you laugh. The various character's personalities all have some sort of specific trait which an experienced anime watcher may recognize, to an extent. The totally kawaii moe girl; the tsundere; the yandere; the peeping tom. WHile they're all too apparent, they really do work; in the hands of skilled enough writers, overused character type can be fun to watch over and over again. And it does throw a few interesting turns at you; like the FFF (christ, I'm still laughing over them) - a cult like the KKK; only that they go after those who have girlfriends (or guys who receive obentou from girls, for that sake).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the two male leads, who are actually refreshingly deep - for comedy male leads, that is. Akihisa is rather wimpy, and a total idiot, and has tons of quirks which one may or may not recognize oneself in (they're all over-the-top, though). All his quirks are a constant fuel for humour; seeing one's own problems made fun out of is something most people can recognize.\\n\\n\r\nThe other male lead, Yuuji, is totally hilarious to watch. He is in no way a sidekick character, like Kouta; instead, he takes on more of a 'group leader' role; being class rep and the one in charge of planning for the summoning battles. Truly, when he is at his peak, he is like Kamina (TTGL) in attitude; over-the-top spirited and spouting loads and loads of bull concealed as meaningful and supportive words (who can forget Kamina's \"believe in you, who believes in yourself\"?). Even those who don't recognize the Kamina-esque personality will probably find his adamant personaltiy hilarious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as settings go, you don't experience anything new. School humour show is school humour show, meaning pool days, theme park trips and that stuff are obligatory. Not to mention the school hallways; which are used as the base for the ESBs. The school does, however, have a few pleasant surprises (like the ESB server room, and the exam paper vault). And of course, the school's roof, where the more serious moments typically take place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't stand out much on its other fields; while above middling quality it's not much more. Backgrounds are tormented by an annoying, dotted style, which I see no apparent reason for having in the show. Character designs are average enough, but the hand-drawn effects which appear at the 'heroic goodbye' talks between Yuuji and are hilarious; likewise is their increased face complexity featured when they are shocked or have any similar reaction.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is standard-fare humour; themes fit the humour setting, the few 'dramatic' moments, and that is about it; there's no memorable theme or likewise to set your mind on. The opening theme is standard upbeat crazy j-pop style, and unfortunately lacks any interesting animation. Same can be said about the ending theme; though it's more j-rock than j-pop.\\n\\n\r\nSUmmarized, Baka to Test is your everyday absurd humour show with a few quirks thrown in to make it refreshing enough to be truly enjoyable, and anyone who's looking for an easy no-brains laugh may find it pleasing.",

Then, I watched it after watching a lot of anime, and I still laughed because it brought back so many memories.\r\nYou have the cute, perfect, sexual magnet, (who can't cook) innocent girl that the hero seems to havea thing for- there's the pretty, flat-chested, violent, smart common sense-wise, tomboy who gets made fun of way too much and has a thing for the hero and people seem to dump pity on her-there's the pervert who has a nosebleed about everything and can't seem to put down his camera- the main character's hot, smart, tsundere friend who's relationship can be mistaken as gay with the main character- there's the quiet, dangerous, mysterious, extraordinary girl who hunts down the main character's best friend- the gay, smart one who just can't keep a cool head around his crush- the crazy, stalker chick that can't stay away from one of the heroines- the one that's made fun of for being both sexualities at once...\\n\r\nAND THE MAIN CHARACTER WHO'S INSANELY OBLIVIOUS AND STUPID. A perfect insert character for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the Archetypal characters of anime and whenever you revisit them, you can't help but laugh your head off. \\n\r\nThis anime makes fun of any anime with any of these characters, this plot of starting from the bottom and getting to the top, summoning beasts, high school, and every genre in between.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that you don't need an insanely deep plot and you're looking for something light-hearted to watch: this is the anime that I recommend you watch!",

            "content": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, the show with one of the least creative names ever seen. Just calling it Idiots and Tests and Summoned Beings... can you imagine if they called Avatar Blue guys and Forest and Environmentalism, nobody would be able to take the movie seriously (well... you can't really take it seriously anyways...). Anyways, silly titles aside, Baka to etc, is a simple show that illustrates how funny anime can be. A juvenile sense of humor with lots of slapstick gags, that delivers in every way you expected it to, just like it should. With that said, lets look at Baka to bloobybloo. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this anime, is a deep and intriguing one if you look at it symbolically, and barely visible if you don't. A down trodden class of good for nothings is thrown to the bottom of the social ladder like yesterdays dinner, and its only after a young charismatic leader whips them into shape that they realise they must enter an spectacular struggle to climb up the food chain and defeat the high and elite who are squandering their power.\\n\\n\r\nOk well, bad literary synopsizes aside, the show doesn't really pull off anything spectacular in that fashion; as you would expect its a comedy. The plot (as with most comedies), is their to provide somewhat of a driving point for the story, but mostly just to help string along more humor. And it does it well, it seems like every \"summon battle\" they have something extreme and wacky happens. Really every episode is enjoyable and you'll get a good laugh. I think the main reason for this (aside from a great sense of humor) is that they like to mix up the episodes quite a bit in presentation. For example one episode is aimed like a RTS video game, viewed from above mostly where you watch the battle unfold. Another is set where you follow the protagonists friend Yuuji, while not exactly knowing what the rest of the gang is up to. So in summary, the plot is simple, but does exactly what it needs to to keep this show rolling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are... well pretty token for a comedy of this sort. They all are pretty one dimensional, usually only having one trait to go upon, but again it works in this kind of situation. And despite there being some cliche in most of the characters, you can't help but feel that theirs something special about each and every one of them. For example, Yoshii, the protagonist. He's weak, dumb, useless, clumsy, poor, and has 2 beautiful women chasing after him (ummm and a guy, but don't think about that too much). Yawn you might think, that's been done a million times before, but what I like about Yoshii is that he isn't a wimp. Most leads of this sort, are pathetic not because they are terrible at everything, but because they are pansies who bend to every whim and have no mind of their own. Yoshii on the other hand, seems to accept that he's completely useless and strives instead to just enjoy life as much as he can. All in all, the characters are rather interesting for a comedy troupe, and I don't think I really hated any of them (something that most shows can't say). There are a tonne to pick from so you are bound to find at least a few that you find hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the art and sound are actually really fantastic. Looking and sounding good isn't such an achievement nowadays, as computers have streamlined everything... but you really have to enjoy the artistic style of this anime. It always feels like there's a weird fluffy feeling to it I find, not really sure how to describe it. Needless to say, it gently massaged my eyeballs with quite nice art work.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it all up as quickly as possible, Baka to *omg this title pisses me off* to Shoukanjuu, is a fun little experience, that I definitely recommend to anybody who needs a few good laughs. Might not be for you if your a sad lonely critic who can only watch anime if it stimulates some part of your brain, but hey give it a try at least.",

            "content": "Stupidity, one of the main concepts of comedy. Sometimes it can be annoying, other times it can be hilarious. For this anime, it's the latter.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nNot a lot of things goes on in this anime, but sometimes that doesn't matter for some anime such as this. In the anime, a lot of things happen randomly and that can make it funny, such as unexpected situations and unpredictable responses from each character. The comedy overpowers the romance genre in this anime. Whenever there are ecchi scenes, 90% there would be Kouta having nosebleeds. The ecchi genre also adds more to the comedy, and not a lotof scenes that are indecent. The main point of this anime is mostly randomness, and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is detailed and the animation is smooth. The colours in the anime is vibrant and attracts the eye easily. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nEach soundtrack fits its role, but the main thing I would like to point out is the OP. The OP perfectly fits the theme of the anime, having a happy, cheerful and catchy tune. The ED fits its the theme for how stupid the main character is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAkihisa Yoshii, I would dub \"The King of Idiots\". A very dense protagonist, which you would think would be annoying but that adds more comedy. A pervert but is very friendly.\\n\\n\r\nHimeji Mizuki, a bad cook who forces everyone to eat her cooking. You would think that she is good at cooking, but you are very wrong. Also has that aura of a \"yandere\".\\n\\n\r\nShimada Minami, the flat-chested tsundere, the very violent type but can easily show her feelings to Yoshii. A good cook that would fit best to be a housewife. She also understands English and German.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Yuuji, a delinquent-type character who used to be really smart, but never cared about anyone but himself. Shows very little hints of him liking Shouko. \\n\\n\r\nKirishima Shouko, a girl that would do anything to be with Yuuji, such as electrocuting him or tying him up, to make sure he is with her. If you haven't realised, she's a massive yandere.\\n\\n\r\nTsuchiya Kouta, a massive pervert who rarely gets caught for taking pictures. Very knowledgable in Health and PE and also knowledgable at cameras.\\n\\n\r\nKinoshita Hideyoshi, the 'trap'. Still questioning if 'he' is actually are scenes where his chest area is censored. You can easily mistake 'him' as a girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery funny, to the point where at 5 minute intervals I would laugh. There's 2 seasons of anime but I wished there was more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance+comedy x100, then this anime is for you.",

We have overly sized breast and also the flat chest. We even have a lily trap. We even have incest sister. Anime clich\u00e9s are all up in F graded class, and combines with digimon. That\u2019s what this anime is about.\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu is full of anime stereotypes and otaku appeals, yet managed to become a fantastic random comedy series. It is quite unbelievable that cliche tainted anime can be this enjoyable. However, you should knowthat there are no such animes that exclusively collected every single of clich\u00e9s we can imagine \u2018intentionally\u2019. Making anime unique by bringing all the commons, it\u2019s the key of this anime\u2019s success. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I know, this anime is an adaption of one of the most successful light novel ever made, with same title. I haven\u2019t read it, so fuck it.\\n\\n\r\nStory of this anime\u2026 um, story? Was there a story?... No way. Like most of other slice of life style comedy shows, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (aka. Baka to Test. I don\u2019t want to type this long title over and over again) has no plot. You need to enjoy things as what it is. Blah, if you wanted to watch something \u2018DEEPPU\u2019 and \u2018COMPLEXUED PLOT\u2019 or whatever, go watch End of Evangelion and enjoy mind twisters. Even the comedy itself is extremely shallow; most of the time, they use the same gags over and over again. We can call it \u2018gag spam\u2019. But thank goodness, the timings are just amazing. Those humours never get bored but get even better as it goes. It continues until the half of this series and after that, it starts to focus on uniqueness of comical elements again. Aside of those gag spams, most of humour is random and placed in much unexpected points. You cannot possibly imagine which colour of mammoth will be waiting to burst your stomach off. Sometimes, things that we missed are reminded in the next episodes, so we can say there is at least some kind of plot\u2026 well random plot. There are lots of fan-services, but blah. We always like it; service means free snack.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of this show is that it has ridiculous supernatural aspect of summoning chibi-beasts with attack point of their grade. This is \u2013 as I mentioned \u2013 ridiculous. This makes absolutely no sense, and creates RPG appearance overall; that\u2019s most of people will guess. Too bad that it is so well executed in Baka to Test. It could have become really lame, but in this anime, like those repeated humours, shoukanjuu summoning is so well place with its circumstances. Everything we call \u2018absurdity\u2019 in other animes, becomes \u2018clever\u2019 in here. \\n\\n\r\nEven with those random humours, Baka to Test keeps itself on the boundary of \u2018slice of life\u2019 genre. Some brilliant moments that actually makes you think in this ridiculous anime. I can say this kind of element also comes randomly at the time it fits. Climax of the episode is also in random position due to the double twists of twist always happening right before the episode ends. Mood and tone also swings like typhoon, yet manage to be great. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I can say is consistency. Some episode is just brilliant; others are somewhat boring and pointless. Even some was only consist of the used humours and fan-services in the past and fills up the time. Repeated gags are \u2018not always\u2019 in the best timing, sometimes it is not funny any more.\\n\\n\r\n One thing I\u2019m really surprised at is art. \u2018Silver Link\u2019 where produced this anime was pretty un-known studio for me. Starting to watch it, I had same atmosphere in art directions I had when watching Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. It actually had correlation: Silver Link works with SHAFT. Not only having tons of typesets, but there are also some abstracts and brilliant-looking art elements. Most of them are really clever and intelligent. I can\u2019t do much comment on character design; it is quite cute and generic, but their uses of direction on those designs are fabulous. (*insert rainbow here*) \\n\\n\r\nSound elements are pretty much same; a lot of effects and random audios. It enhances the overall atmosphere pretty well. OSTs are brilliant and sometimes extremely funny. Opening and ending theme is one of my favourites this winter season, mainly due to the animation on those themes. OP is cheerful, cute and bright. ED is manly and shouts \u2018BAKA GO HOME!!\u2019. 2nd ending is girly and animation is basically the reflection of previous ending, except the gender of characters. (Please exclude Hideyoshi, since he has a third gender. ) Overall, generic but effective songs. I would say the animation was better than song itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, characters are tainted by clich\u00e9s. They are in anywhere. They are biased. They are nothing special whatsoever. However, the circumstance and techniques used in this anime makes everything goes upside down. It\u2019s like, \u2018breaking our stereotypes on anime stereotypes\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s go with Yoshii Akihisa. We mostly know his name as an imaginary dinosaur with long tongue ridden by fat guy with red hat and cool moustache. In here, he\u2019s just an idiot. There are tons of idiots around the anime universe anyway and the classic example is our extremely well-known Naruto. Only thing that makes him different from this shonen mascot is that there are tons of other \u2018BAKA\u2019s around him. So, he becomes \u2018THE BAKA AMONG BAKAZZ\u2019, king of all idiots. That\u2026 actually makes differences, surprisingly. He is a major laugh material around this anime, by exposing his idiocity in smart ways. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and another, we have this harem atmosphere towards Yoshii. Actually, there are three. First, classic moe voiced pink-haired big-breasted Himeji-san, and classic tsundere red haired flat-breasted Shimada-san; extremely clich\u00e9d as usual. Another lover of him is actually a guy, blah. The major reason that we can enjoy this clich\u00e9d triangular relationship, (or square) is due to the fact that Yoshii does not even notice that obvious atmosphere of love, due to his stupidity that no-human being can explain. This is why Yoshii is becoming the best character of the entire cast, even with being a classical idiot of all time. That\u2019s a brilliant way of \u2018breaking clich\u00e9 with clich\u00e9\u2019. When Japan is suffering from creativity crisis, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu recycles the elements that is overused for the past few years, and create whole new universe that is more creative that is any other anime\u2019s we\u2019ve seen. Really, amazingly clever thing.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s discuss more on characters. F class rep Yuuji, the classic \u2018cool guy\u2019 character, is the second best character in Baka to Test, and the only one who is \u2018not that clich\u00e9d\u2019 than others. He is energetic, cool and does some awesome speeches filled with GARness. Yet, he\u2019s intelligence is around the same level of Yoshii. He is sometimes overly serious on things and gets punished by various characters, especially by Yoshii or Yandere. He\u2019s the major source of manliness among these unmanly characters, which makes him very special. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a trap, Hideyoshi. Well\u2026 he\u2019s a guy who looks like a girl. He is a good character still, but imo, he was the worst of all the others in this anime. I\u2019m not saying he was bad. However, he didn\u2019t really stand out from limitation of lily stereotype, like Yoshii and Yuuji did. Same goes with Yandere, ninja pervert and yuri. Saying that, random humours from those characters are actually intelligent. For example, Hideyoshi unexpectedly appears with trap outfit, ninja pervert randomly do-the-nozu-bleed, yuri appears from nowhere to get Shimada. Baka to Test actually managed to make us laugh from that. Amazing?...\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime are the voice actors. Seriously, they were all extremely good; portraying the characters really well. Yoshii\u2019s voice is my favourite of all; reflecting his stupidity in effective way. The best part is the narrator. It\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s just me, but that dry and monotone sound was just hilarious, every single time hearing it. \u2018Excuse me; subtitles are taking my screen time.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nOverall I overly enjoyed this anime. (*loldoubleover)  Jokes are fun; endings of each episode were remarkably done, and heart-warming. Characters are funny as hell, even with the clich\u00e9d elements. I felt like happiness filling all through my body all the time, watching this anime. If you want something that is highly entertaining and ridiculously funny random comedy show filled with intelligence, here, baka\u2019s are waiting.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cF CLASS IS NOT GARBAGE!!\u201d",

It's mature enough for an older audience to enjoy with fan service that's only dirty if you want it to be. While at the same time it can easily keep the attention of a younger audience without giving them the wrong idea. Creative concept, and plenty of content with well developed characters. \r\nThe plot is a real fantasy that most schoolkids could die for. Highly recommend to anyone whoenjoys a hearty laugh and still has a taste for some interesting action. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the animation is splendid, with a touch of pop-art. Also, the artists are able to show their true talent when drawing the characters' faces in different styles depending on their mood/situation.\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test has to be one of my all time favorite animes, and definitely one of the best recent ones I've seen.",

            "content": "Ah, Baka Test...probably up there in the list of most random comedy series ever.  When this was shown in the first screening of the year at the anime club at my university, everyone agreed that this was the best anime of the season.  Yes it is idiotic and over-the-top, but it is one hell of a funny anime.  \r\nStory-wise it's quite...unique.  Set in a school dominated by a hierarchical structure of classes (A to F), it pretty much follows the school idiot Akihisa and the rest of Class-F (full of the dumbest kids in school) as they try to rise upthe ranks and prove that academic smarts are not everything.  They do this through a system of \"Summoned Being Wars\" where two classes fight it out using avatars with attack strength equal to their score in their last test.  At least, for the most part, the show follows this story.  The rest of it is filled with random events, running jokes and poking fun at every anime cliche in the book.  All of this combines to create absolute hilarity.  I almost fell off my seat laughing in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good to say the least.  It's simple and light-hearted, and fits the style of the show perfectly.  The base style is very bright and colourful but it switches styles dramatically to suit various scenes (and jokes).  The use of 2-D CG for the character drawings and also for the Summoned Being Wars adds an extra level of depth to the art.  Sure its a bit sugar-coated at times, but if anything this just enhances the comedy of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the sound is not that special.  The voice actors do a good job, but none of them really stand out.  The soundtrack typical of this style of comedy anime, although i did enjoy the ED \"Baka Go Home\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are this show's main strength.  A baka, moe, tsundere, yandere, lolicon, pervert and even an  incestuously inclined older sister.  Combine this with traps, references to yuri, yaoi, varying breast sizes and even Digimon and Gundam and you pretty much get Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu.  With such a variety of characters and personalities, each with their own running jokes attributed to them and their relationships with the other characters, Baka Test plays to its strengths very well.  Overall, the characters are incredibly entertaining and this anime is worth watching for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment level is very high.  Even the running jokes that are repeated episode after episode seem hilarious every time and cliches are abused left, right and centre.  Watch this one with a mindset to enjoy it as much as possible and you cant go wrong.  And if you like it, stay tuned for season 2!  Overall score: 8.0/10",

            "content": "This show serves one purpose: comedy, and in that regard it does very well.  If you're looking for a laugh, this is the show for you.  Each individual aspect shines (or doesn't) in its own way.  Note that (per my username) when I speak of voice acting talent I'm referring to the English voice actors (this won't have much of an effect on the review, but it's worth mentioning)\r\nStory: 3\r\nAlright, let's face it, this section doesn't even need much explanation.  The show has barely any overarching plotline, the romantic plotline takes a backseat for most of the show and is insteadtwisted as humor, and most of the episodes form their own little arc.  There's not much to say, the story wasn't really there.  Individual episodes also didn't explore particularly interesting plotlines, so from a perspective focused only on the actual interest the bare plotline has, the show doesn't do well.  Of course, that's not the purpose of the show, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very refreshing. Though the regular animation and character design are pretty standard (still good, however), the art choices in the show earn it a 9.  Backgrounds and shading are done with the help of color-coded dots.  As if the show wasn't fun and colorful already, the dots supplement the environment of the show.  These dots are a very distinctive art choice and were only jarring initially, afterwards you get used to them.  Characters have their shadows color coded when standing, and backgrounds are as colorful as can be.  All these bright colors just add to the fun atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Baka and Test uses animation and art style in a great way.  Animation changes from hand drawn, to chibi, to normal when appropriate and adds variety to the different ways to set the mood of the scene.  There is a perfect blend of all the different animation/art styles that are used, and they never really feel out of place.  Although the animation isn't stunningly fluid or impressive in a classic sense, the use of animation by the art director is consistently helpful to the mood of the scene or the way dialogue is being presented.  Great decisions all around and makes for a better experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing special here.  The theme song is pretty catchy, and the ending theme is nice, but there's nothing to fawn over.  Of course, the soundtrack isn't detrimental to the series.  The background music and sound effects fit to the scene well, but it's not anything worth writing home about.\\n\\n\r\nI'll mention voice acting here instead of in the next section.  The voice actors do a phenomenal job, I can't think of one voice that I didn't think matched the character.  All the voice actors do a great job and there was no lack of emotion in any of them.   The voice acting pulls the show's sound up from a 5 to an 8.  If you're planning on watching the English dub, you're in for a treat because it's truly one of the better ones out there.  Leah Clark has a voice that was practically crafted for tsunderes, Greg Ayres is always wonderful, Brina Palencia nails the androgynous voice of Hideyoshi almost too well, and Terry Doti is superb as your typical bad boy leader. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of this show gets an 10 for the voice acting, but the background music and sound effects get a measly 6,with an average of 8.  Take from that what you will.  If you don't plan on watching the English dub, none of this is applicable, and I can't comment on the Japanese voice acting, so you'll have to see how it is for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters fit into classic tropes, and a lot of them are represented.  There's no point in listing all the tropes that are fulfilled but for the most part the characters are lovable and quirky.  Though they may have a cliche personality, the characters are written very well, and regardless of if their main personality is a common anime character trope, it doesn't matter.  Stereotypical characters aren't a bad thing, poorly written stereotypical character are, and Baka and Test does stereotypes in a comical/satirical way, bringing each character over the top and beyond with their personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter interaction is where this show shines.  The banter forms most of the comedy, the personalities clash and mix in hilarious ways, and the relationships between different characters is funny to watch.  Some minor characters (and Hideyoshi) have unique characteristics that are almost always exploited for a joke.  One character gets his own gender, a group of characters punish boys who get into relationships (or get romantic attention from girls) with death, and another is a psychopathic girl who will do anything in her power to get married with her love interest.  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the characters are quirky and over the top, but they're hilarious.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember many moments during the show when I wasn't smiling.  It's just constantly happy and funny all the way through.  I came into the show expecting a comedy and nothing else, and got exactly what I wanted.  If you come into the show with that mindset, you will leave thoroughly satisfied.  If you're looking for an endearing love story, well, you're not going to enjoy it as much.  It's jokes 24/7 and I love it for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's a funny show, and I like to laugh.  Overall, there was some repetitiveness and some of the jokes lost their luster over time, but the overall hilarity of the show trumps that and puts this comedic goldmine at a solid 9/10.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys silly humor.  It's in no way sophisticated, and I love it for that.  If you have a generally open sense of humor, you'll love this show, but if you have a very specific sense of humor, you may end up thinking that most of the jokes are just plain stupid or not funny at all.",

            "content": "As we know school romantic comedies are not a new concept in anime, neither are kids with \u201csuperpowers\u201d, but recycling these dull ideas is what makes this anime unique. The easiest way to describe it, is to imagine a medley of cliched genres, characters, and plots thrown into one single anime. But the author somehow takes these overused ideas, and turns it into one of the greatest rom-coms ever. \r\nThe anime itself is quite a mess of ideas honestly, it's a pretty weird concept. It takes place in a school called Fumizuki Academy, a school where grades dictate which classes you are put in. Theclasses are lettered A through F, A meaning you\u2019re a genius, and F meaning you\u2019re not he brightest crayon in the box. The lower the lettering of your class, the more inferior your classroom equipment is. For example if you\u2019re in class A, you would have comfy padded recliners, and in class F you'd be sitting on broken stools. You get the idea. Thus the premise of the entire anime is pretty much for the class F troupe, which the story is mainly focused on, to try to reach the top of the ladder by taking over classroom A.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how would they do this you might ask? The answer is right in the ever so creative title, they of course, summon the beasts. Now don't confuse this with animes like Pokemon, or Yugioh, the beasts we\u2019re talking about are actually created by holograms of some sort. The \u201cbeasts\u201d are pretty much tiny chibi avatars of the students who control them. And they are integrated into the \u201cranking system\u201d of the school. So similar to the classrooms, the abilities of the beasts are also limited by the grades of the summoner. \\n\\n\r\nNow as boring, and as difficult to understand as that seems, if you put those elements all together with a complete imbecile as the main character, you get some top quality entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Akihisa Yoshii, is nicknamed the ultimate idiot, and guides us  through his misadventure of slapstick comedy, in which he helps guide his class through the struggles it to get to the top, complete with all his girl problems, and \u201clucky\u201d endeavors he incurs upon everyday. \\n\\n\r\nAs a wise fellow once said, \u201cno rom-com is complete without a charming cast of characters\u201d, this anime definitely is no exception. In fact it's arguable that the strongest point in the anime. Despite it\u2019s large cast of main characters, Its not hard to distinguish the characters from each other since they all have unique skills and personalities. But these characters at the same times display little to no character development, which isn't really surprising because if you watch this type of comedy there usually isn't much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime quite a lot and regardless of its flaws it still made me laugh a ton. It's aimed at more of a lighthearted feel, so don't go in expecting some deep, and intricate plot. And as far as the romance goes, there really wasn't much development, I think it included romance more for comedy than a subplot. And with only 13 episodes the anime leaves off with quite the cliffhanger but is quickly redeemed by its sequel, Baka to Test Ni. It's honestly a pretty dumb story but as far as entertainment goes, this is probably one of the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Baka to Test began as a series of light novels written by Inoue Kenji, of whom I could find no information. The anime adaptations currently consist of two seasons and an OVA, but The light novels are still going so there could be more of them in the future. For now, I'm just going to look at the first season. \r\nThe story is about a school where students are separated into different groups based on their grades with the dumbest students getting the worst room and equipment. The students can challenge each other to battles using summoned creatures with power based on their test scoresand lower ranked group can use this to take the room and equipment of a higher ranked group should they win. A young girl named Himeji ends up in the lowest ranked group due to having been sick during the test and the other students decide to challenge the other groups to get a better room, mainly so that she can have a better environment to recover. The premise is pretty stupid and the execution is extremely shoddy. The over-arcing plot is full of holes and the writer constantly forgets or ignores how the created world was set up which means that the rules for summons change several times for no apparent reason. But it's primarily a comedy, so the lousy story doesn't matter as much as the humour. Unfortunately, the humour fails on every conceivable level. There are three joke types that are frequently repeated throughout the series. 1. Gay jokes, which aren't funny. 2. Jokes about abusive relationships, which also aren't funny. 3. Jokes about how the characters are all morons, which are only funny once or twice. Aside from those you get a lot of repeated jokes, most of which aren't funny the first time but even those that are cease being funny almost immediately through being repeated over and over and over again. It's like a twisted experiment to see how long you can tell the same bloody joke before it becomes/stops being funny. Incidentally, the answers are it will never be funny/with jokes like these, once. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly flat. Most of them have a couple reoccurring jokes they're involved in and their characters revolve around those jokes. A few of the major characters get more than a couple jokes but they're still less compelling than wet cardboard. Another character issue is that every single character is an idiot, even the ones that the audience is told are intelligent. The only sign you get of intelligence is that they get a higher number for their summon. They don't act or say anything intelligent, ever. It's almost like the writer has no idea how to write intelligent characters, or even how intelligence works. Even characters of average intelligence don't exist in this. They're all absolute morons.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, for the most part, but there's this odd tendency to change the artistic method completely at random times. It's like the anime was drawn by someone who really needed a dose of Ritalin. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is atrocious. None of the characters show any depth or range of emotions. They all have one ridiculously exaggerated voice and either yell or whisper to illustrate \"emotional range.\" Which doesn't work that way, I might add. If I wasn't familiar with Harada Hitmoi, Kato Emiri, Mizuhashi Kaori, Miyata Kouki, and several others from other anime I would think that they just got people with the most obnoxious voices possible. But it's just that the direction is terrible. The music is also really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. There's an openly lesbian character who has a one-sided crush on one of the major characters. Of course, she's just used for highly problematic gay jokes and nothing ever comes of her feelings. So it just ends up being infuriating. \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test is an unpleasant, unfunny, uninspired and unintelligent series. I feel ashamed of myself, and less intelligent, for having watched it. It was painful to sit through. The humour is either problematic or lackluster, the characters are insipid and the sound is an assault on the ears. My final rating for Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a 1/10. The only aspect of it that any effort went into was the art, and even that isn't good.",

            "content": "Baka to Test is about a baka class in a very strange school. In this special school, all students are given some sort of miniaturized version of themselves (think avatars) whose \"fighting powers\" are relative to how well a student performs academically. Furthermore, the top class (A) is treated like royalty (think of accommodations like in Special A) where as our class F has cardboard boxes for desks. However, classes can engage in \"battles\" with their avatars (powered up by extra exams) to try to steal each other's class rooms. Obviously class F has no chance, but wait, an overly cheerful pink-haired girl (who isclass A quality but happened to not do well on the entrance exam) joins the class and suddenly they apparently have a fighting chance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this produces a very unique twist to the slice-of-life school series, it's overly light-hearted for my taste, with too much focus on trivial comedy, trading off character development and plot line progression. With the mini-battles, it almost feels like a strange incarnation of Pokemon in a school, you even get squeaky voices with the avatars.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for yet another light series with low-level comedy and a lot of random ecchi scenes or a series about underdogs trying to work their way up, this is your series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis show is fairly average in terms of drawing style. You get lots of vivid colors and quite a bit of CG. You also get a lot of battle scenes where each mini-character has a hit point counter (think Pokemon, the games not the show), and a lot of Who Wants to be a Millionaire as there is a lot of trivia. The actual characters are fairly average, if a bit simplistic. The backgrounds are also not as vivid as I'd like but I guess it fits the light-hearted mood of the series. Be warned that this is ecchi, one of the class males is always armed with a camera, trying to sneak pictures at certain \"angles\".\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a bit technoish, which fits with the \"electronic\" battles, and is light, which fits in with the tone of the series. It isn't particularly good though (contrast with ED of Ladies vs Butlers). ED is a guy song, which means insta-avoid for me. The VAs are very vibrant in this series, especially the male leads in the class, and they are pretty much all that keeps the series moving along through antics and over-dramatizing circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell I pretty much summed it up in the intro. A flunking class tries to out-play less-flunking classes through using a very smart pink-haired girl (who also happens to cook death). The plot is pretty linear but doesn't draw too much drama (focusing on light-heartedness) so even when the climax is reached the viewer is just like meh. There are some comedic moments but the majority are actually from Akihisa being taken advantage of (due to his unbelievable stupidity).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe point of the series is really that guts and willpower can be an equal match for just pure brain power. Behind this premise, you have a really dim-witted main character who happens to have the hearts of two girls in the class. Unfortunately, due to the light-hearted nature of the series, they don't really make use of this tension, instead forcing the girls into \"accidental\" ecchi situations resulting typically with Akihisa getting beaten up.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall, Baka to Test brings along one or two good chuckles and showing the spirit of an underdog. Perhaps this is enough for people as they're working on a second series. If you can't yet tell from this review, that is one series that I will not be reporting on, as one season was already one too many. The ratio of ecchi + pointless comedy to plot progression and character development was just too unbalanced.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a cheap laugh and a good theme song, look no further. Otherwise, best look elsewhere.\r\nIf the key to success in a comedy anime is the comedy, you could say that this is a great success. But I don't, unfortunately. While it was, at points, hysterically funny, I don't feel that this is the above-average anime that everyone says it is. The characters are bland and get little to no development, the plot is inconsistent and ranges from flawed to utterly nonsensical, and many of the jokes can be very problematic.\r\nFirst, let's look at the characters. There are only two that Iactually like as a character: Yuuji (and the show seems to really disagree with me on this, considering the abuse it puts him through) and Toshimitsu (who gets very little screen time). The rest are either bland stereotypes, horrible people or both. Himeji is your average Moe archetype, with nothing to make her actually interesting. Minami is the same, but with the Tsundere archetype. Hideyoshi is essentially a one-off joke (and a slightly homophobic one at that) that stops being funny after the first 20 times. Akihisa is a general creep and doesn't really have anything special about him other than that. Kouta you might as well tick 'All of the above' being a general creep, a bland stereotype and a one-off joke. But by far the worst character is Shouko, who to make a long story short, is a horrible abusive, cruel and manipulative arse that the show somehow expects me to like and feel sympathy for her. It doesn't help that she constantly abuses one of the only sympathetic characters in the show in a realistically abusive relationship. It also annoys me that everyone wants her to be with Yuuji despite all this.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a mess. Being a slice-of-life anime, there's no unifying plot and most of the episodes exist separately from each other, but even then, they're pretty bad. The main plot is about Class F trying to get up the class ranks in a nonsensical battling system at a school. There's already some problems here: first, why would the school implement the battling system in the first place? Yes, it rewards good test results, but there's no reason why being beaten should take test results away. There's also no reason why it uses whole classes instead of individual people: A worse class with one good person (See: Class F) could be carried all the way to the top without most of them earning it. There's also no reason why Akihisa's avatar should be special in any way. It's completely unexplained as well.\\n\r\nIndividual plots are bad as well. By far the worst is episode 7, where the whole of the main cast decide it's a good idea to give Yuuji and Shouko (who they know is abusive and horrible, and literally tries to kill Yuuji in the episode before, which is also a mess) a romantic Wedding experience. There is no reason why everyone would want that. Akihisa, Hideyoshi and Himeji all know well how horrible Shouko is. Muttsulini and Minami have a slight semblance of a motivation, but it still makes no sense how much effort they put into it. Then at the end of the episode, a random audience member insults Shouko's obsession with Yuuji, and then Shouko runs off crying. And we're meant to sympathise with her despite all the torture she's given Yuuji because of her obsession. The worst part is that it becomes apparent that Yuuji actually likes her, which is unforgivable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the jokes can be very problematic at times, as well as just being bad. I can't count the amount of jokes that are repeated over and over again: Hideyoshi looks like a girl, Muttsulini's a creep, Akihisa's an idiot, Shouko abuses Yuuji, Minami beats people up, Himeji's cooking is terrible, and that's only some of them. If you had a drinking game based on those jokes alone, you would die by the 5th episode. There's also the problematic jokes. First off, they turn the abuse of Yuuji into a joke. Which is not cool. Second, they portray lesbians as insane, creepy stalkers, and constantly assert that heterosexuality is 'Normal'. Again, not cool. As well as that, the show as a KKK expy. I shouldn't need to explain how not cool that is. This is just to name a few. This show has a problem with political correctness, it seems, and it kills it for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe main good features of this show are the theme song, which is really catchy and amazing, the art, which is nice to look at, and some of the jokes, but they really don't give this show substance. The plot and characters are bad and it's extremely offensive. I would avoid this show unless you really don't care about anything other than the jokes, and even then I'd say it's not for everyone.",

            "content": "From a show that literally has the word \u201cidiot\u201d in its title, Bakatest doesn\u2019t shy from flaunting its idiocy. From ten-cent slapstick gags to an utterly absurd premise, Bakatest is a silly comedic romp blown into a full-fledged series. While the recipe for disaster seems to be complete, Bakatest is strangely charming \u2014 and while the show basically makes no sense whatsoever, it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. All and all, Bakatest is a playful, harmless gagfest that\u2019s occasionally wildly entertaining, even sweet at times, and unbearably cheesy some other times. \r\nLight novels adapations are not foreign ground for director Oonuma Shin, more notable forhis work with ef: a tale of memories.  In Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, test results mean everything. Students are assigned into classrooms based on how well they score on the placement exam, with state of the art, luxury classrooms for the A class and a disheveled, dusty room with broken tables for the F class, our heroes in this show. Furthermore, classes can challenge each other over their facilities using a magical combat fighting tool called the Examinations Battle System (ESB), which draws power from test scores. The premise is cool, a little confusing, and results in extremely over-dramatic and absolutely inane fight sequences involving academic trivia. The combination of studying and RPG-style combat undoubtedly appeals to the show\u2019s Japanese demographic, though I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s quite silly no matter where you\u2019re from. If you suspend reason and simplify the plot to an extent, most of the show is actually really fun. The action is decently slick but awkwardly predictable, causing the show\u2019s attempts at high tension drama fell a bit flat on more than one occasion for me.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the idiots in a show titled about idiots, male lead Yoshii Akihisa (cv. Shimono Hiro) is by far the dumbest of them all. Absolutely helpless when it comes to school, and (even by anime male lead standards) totally clueless to signs of affection dealing with the opposite gender, Yoshii can get on your nerves fast, but his good-natured, peppy attitude manages to endear viewers. The two female leads, Himeji Mizuki (cv. Harada Hitomi) and Shimizu Miharu (cv. Taketatsu Ayana), foil each other nicely while Kinoshita Hideyoshi (Katou Emiri) doesn\u2019t do much of anything except bringing out our inner homosexual. The two female leads are relatively weak, lacking a bit of substance outside of being pretty, making the show very irritating with cliches on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s breakout character is Class F president Sakamoto Yuuji (cv. Suzuki Tatsuhisa), who is cool, clever, and well-written. His strong, supportive, demeanor lends confidence to Yoshii and all of class F. Teeming with street smarts, he\u2019s one of the most relatable characters in the show. His osananajimi relationship with childhood friend Kirishima Shouko (cv. Isomura Tomomi) is one of the bright spots in the series \u2014 fodder for violent physical slapstick gags while also being rather sentimental. Episode 7, which focuses on those two and fleshes them out as characters, is probably the best episode of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show performs well in a technical viewpoint. The animation is very good, and the voice acting cast gets the job done. The colors and very clear and the lines are nice and clean, and the aesthetic of the show complement the mood well. Some visual elements are reminiscent of director Oonuma\u2019s earlier contributions Hidamari Sketch and Pani Poni Dash, where he worked closely with Akuyuki Shinbou.\\n\\n\r\nAsou Natsuko\u2019s OP performance, Perfect-Area Complete!, is a fun bubbly anime song that has been rather well received. I find the second ending theme, Hare Tokidoki Egao really nice on the ears in that sweet, sentimental kind of way. Debuting after my favorite episode 7 (and capturing the moment perfectly), the song and ED animation mesh well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a pretty decent show that probably could have been much better. It\u2019s original, calmly liberal on the fan-service (more probably could have done well), and ambitiously attempts to mix incorrigible silliness with heartwarming romance. The show keeps it light, but weighs on us with laborious dialogue and plot situations. Everyone knows about the androgynous Hideyoshi, who has achieved a kind of cult status, but I wish we got to learn more about him in the context of the show. The characters are decently likable, but not enough character is there to go around. There\u2019s a great show in Bakatest, trust me, you just have to dig though some other stuff to get there.",

            "content": "So yes it is time for another review, I don't do many reviews, but when I do them I try to make them fun to read and from my point of view. Now let me get something straight with you (the readers), this is from my point of view, if you have a different point of view just click the disagree button and move on, or better yet create you're own review. I don't want any feedback from you, specially negative, that I can do without. Now that we have gotten that straight ( I hope, please oh please, I hope), on to the bestpart the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Baka is a school story with a twist which is the summoned beasts, well they are not beast more like a mini me of the summoner. The show is so hilarious though, that I can not stop laughing every time I watch an episode. The awkward moments between characters make it all the better. Every once in a while there will be a scene that will confuse you, but all you have to do is rewind and watch again and you should get it. The fights can get hilarious. See you have class A-F (F being most of the main characters), they have tests to determine which class they are in, but also tests to rack up life points for their summoning character to fight with.  There are various shounen-ai and shoujo-ai references but they are so minimal to the point where it does not even need to be on the list of genres.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- Eh there is not much you can say about the art, does anyone ever talk about the art? Really you do? *Sigh* ok I will try and come up with something. The art is average, nothing wrong with it, but nothing special if you get what I am talking about. I do like how sometimes it goes into a black and white, ads to the dramatic effect of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Well the opening is good, the ending is good. The sound effects are good. Overall I love the sound for this anime. The opening being my favorite of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Oh gawd, what can you not say about this funny bunch of idiots. You know when you get a group of Bakas and stick them into a room together there is going to be trouble. And there is just that a lot of downright hilarious situations of trouble. From romance troubles, to fight backfires, just about anything you can think of these, bunch have or will get into. You have a genius that has health issues and confidence issues whose cooking kills (not in a good way), you have a complete idiot that has to do work for the teachers, a guy with a perverted fetish, a guy who everyone thinks is a girl because he acts and looks like it, a girl who is obsessed about breast sizes (mainly ones bigger than her) and really likes the complete idiot, then you have the gang of idiots who where the weird outfits (yeah I know what they look like but I really don't want to say it), and then the leader of them all who is sort of a mystery, it is like he gets things wrong on purpose, but at the same time he gets himself in lots of idiotic situations, he is afraid of his girlfriend (sort of she basically owns him, and come to think of it If I was him I would be afraid of her too). Roll them all together and you have a recipe for disaster every time, but it never stops to entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Seriously if you have not already gotten it, you should go back and read the whole thing again. Of course it is enjoyable. If you are looking for a good comedy, or just need a laugh, this anime is definitely for you. You will LYAO throughout the whole entire show, guaranteed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I give it a 10, you may not agree but eh that is the way things go sometimes, not everyone can agree you know. This is a great anime, it is short but sweet. The only I don't like is that it is now licensed by funimation and is hard to find, plus funimation changed the name of it. Don't get me wrong FUNI is not a bad company, it is just a stingy one. It ends soon so get to watchin, lol\\n\\n\r\nSo after reading this and you want to check it out, there are still a few sites that are streaming it, including FUNI's. If you don't agree and don't want to watch it that is ok too.",

            "content": "This is a really stupid show, and with that, I freaken love it! It\u2019s pretty much a slapstick comedy with meaning behind it. I consider it like Hetalia, so stupid that it\u2019s funny and with a bit of heart put into it. Some of the jokes seem not to translate well unfortunately but when watching the English dub, they do add different things into it to make it a bit more helpful. As I watched the show, I had prier knowledge from the Five Point Podcast and they had rated it a bit low but I actually think that it\u2019s better then they made itsound. They talked about how the characters were rather stupid and made it sound more like Puni Puni Poemy but the characters actually do sound smart at times; weather they are or not, I will leave that up to you. \\n\\n\r\nBy the second episode, they hooked me and I already have my favorite quote from that episode! It\u2019s the one that Himeji and Yoshii are talking and she says \u2018They also are pretty sure that you\u2019re the doughnut to his banana.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help but start laughing and right then, I figured I would watch the whole thing. There are a lot of sexual tones with this and it dives both into yuri and yaoi as well as a lot of odd ideas. There is a hint of incest but nothing makes this show seem like it should be a Hentai or even creepy. It\u2019s just how characters are shown. All the characters are pretty much the extremes of school stereotypes and yet there are actually only a few that people care for and the rest become no name characters like a tower strategy game. \\n\\n\r\nNow as we talk about the characters, we should start with the main characters\u2026 and who better then the main idiot, Akihisa Yoshii. Yoshii is well, they call him beyond retarted but I actually think he is at least a little smart. He lives alone and would probably die if he didn\u2019t know how to do basics of life. Now some of the time though, I wonder just what goes through his head. For instance, he figured that if he cut a thing of raman in half over and over again, he would be able to feast forever. What he lacks in brains though, he seems to have it in heart. Almost everyone seems to fall in love with him and when I say everyone, I mean men and women alike. I consider him the Italy of the show if we want to compare this to Hetalia. A fun thing about his character is that he is a probationary student but what I would like to know is how the heck they were able to have his avatar pick something up. It just doesn\u2019t seem right. \\n\\n\r\nNext, I think I should talk about the transgender character character, Hideyoshi. When I call him transgender, it\u2019s not because he is one specifically. It\u2019s more because he is somewhat girly. He has to remind almost everyone time and time again that he is a guy and it doesn\u2019t help that his sister looks exactly like him. He is a actor, and always seems to get dressed up in woman\u2019s clothing all the time leaving a lot of room for fan fiction about him and Yoshii it seems. \\n\\n\r\nMizuki is the next character and she is the stereotypical girl next door. Pure, sweet, innocent\u2026 and sometimes gets on my nerves because of this. On top of that, she is pretty much a Mary Sue character. She\u2019s good with academics and almost anything she can get her hands on. What she isn\u2019t good at, she is very Moe about. All these thing would make me cringe but somehow, probably because she is surrounded by so many other interesting characters, she isn\u2019t that bad.\\n\\n\r\nMinami is supposed to be from Germany, although she never seems to speak German or have any signs that she is from a different country except for the fact she can\u2019t read kanji. It makes me wonder just how she got into the school in the first place but that is kind of beyond me. She\u2019s pretty much a bitch with a bad temper and almost the opposite of Mizuki. (You can tell that the character descriptions get smaller the less they have an impact on me.) She has a female suitor from another class which brings the yuri thing out that I was talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI think the last one I really should talk about is Yuji although it\u2019s hard to actually talk about him. Little is known about him and he seems to be only a close friend to Yoshii and some think a little two close. He has some sort of intention but it\u2019s not clear at all what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Avatars are really cute and look a lot like ones from the game Maple Story. They are little chibi versions of the characters themselves and sadly, the only ones you really see are the avatars for the actual main characters and some supporting characters but the others are all generic with letters painted on their faces. I wish they had more designs and I actually want to see a Avatar creator sometime with these characters. Sadly, it seems like you don\u2019t get much of the avatar characters, mostly its gags and strange slapstick. Sometimes they even add a battle sequence that really isn\u2019t even part of the battle. This show is pretty much just random for a lot of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning, bright and beautiful. The colors are almost brightened as a pastel most of the time. There is a lot of fan service with hetero, yaoi, and yuri stuff. I noticed that a lot of girl\u2019s breasts bounce a lot. It\u2019s really really annoying. I\u2019m normally fine with fan service but it was all the time and pretty noticeable. Now this goes for the most part at least. There are small parts that change really strangely. The artwork is not fully consistent but it isn\u2019t bad. It just adds to the strangeness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really interesting and reminds me of Hetalia\u2019s ending, how crazy it is. It\u2019s bright, colorful, with rainbows and it actually made me feel that it was more about yaoi romance then a hetero romance but it\u2019s pretty cute. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I didn\u2019t want to kill any of the characters because of their voices. Most seemed to fit rather well and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but only person I didn\u2019t really like was the first teacher who turned into a narrator. His voice just seemed really dull then everyone else\u2019s. I really loved Akihisa\u2019s voice where he did sound stupid but not in a way that was bothersome.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Baka & Test when I started watching the show. It looks cute, has a fun and colorful cast of characters, and I still really like the first ending song. But, by the fourth episode I was tired of it all. The story wasn't going anywhere and the same old jokes were coming up leaving me more irritated than amused. \r\nBaka & Test is primarity a comedy, and most of the time their jokes contain dark humor and or hyperbole. For example, one girls cooking is so bad it kills people, and when a particularly pervy boy catches a glimpse of a girls underwearthe resulting noseblead is so massive he is left lying in a pool of his own blood.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to Baka & Test besides it's humor. It's kind of like a sitcom. A school segregates their students by inteligence and has this virtural system where students battle each other using avatars who gain power from their test scores. Everything following the set up is more or less a string of jokes. I would have enjoyed Baka & Test a lot more if the characters were more likeable and if the show contained better jokes or at least ones that were less repetitive. But, because the show is what it is I was irritated by a majority of the show and find it to be below average in quality.",

            "content": "At first glance, you may think Baka Test is just another harem comedy anime and may wonder why you should watch this as oppose to harem anime number 233. You have only so much time to spare. The main point that makes this series stand out a head above others of its genre is its quirky, strong and consistent characters. \r\nThe story is nothing ground-breaking.  \r\nThe artwork is good but not particularly distinctive either, thought animation is very good.\r\nMost soundtracks suit the situation, though they're not really great. The ED is awesome though!\r\nHowever, when it comes to the character department, Baka Test truly shines.Baka Test boasts a large, colourful cast, each with their own distinctive personalities and most of its humour stems from the interaction of these individuals. Their personalities are by no means original, but you can always rely on them to never act out of their character, thus providing consistent, situational fun. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the characters are what make this show great and worthy of your time. Be warned that actual character development is minimal though!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Baka Test was a very enjoyable start to the year and it kept me coming back for seconds. I\u2019d gladly recommend this series to people who enjoy harem, slap-stick humour and light viewing and oh of course, Hideyoshi. Do not bother with this if you cannot withstand weak plots, lack of major changes in characters, nonsense or fun in general ;)\\n",

            "content": "Comedy is subjective. Some people prefer witty satire and others prefer blunt brainless nonesense. Well, Baka to Test is the latter of the two. Just like its namesake, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Idiots and Tests and Summoning Beings) is one hell of an idiotic show. But it serves its purpose of providing nonsensical entertainment, and I'm afraid if you are expecting otherwise then Baka to Test is not for you. \r\nTo many, the story is \u2013 to put it plainly \u2013 outright stupid. Students are split into classes from A-F based on their academic skills; A being full of smartarses and F being crammedwith quote/unquote \u201cthe mentally retarded\u201d.  Incidentally, what class you are in correlates to the facilities they have, much like an academic \u2018caste system\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nSo we have the idiots and tests out of the way, so what about the Summoning Beings? Evidently, there are ways to acquire these prestigious facilities \u2013 the obvious one being to score high on the mid-terms...and the other, Exam Summoning Battles.  Such battles consist of the student\u2019s being, which is a chibi version of themselves fighting other student\u2019s beings. Much like video games, they have points (which can be considered as health bars) that are knocked off through physical contact. There is little to no \u201cexam\u201d, or any such academic skills tested in these battles, but what the heck \u2013 anything goes in anime, more so in this one. The show is already incoherent enough to be questioned at this point. \\n\\n\r\nAkihisa and the rest of F-class duel in these ESB\u2019s to get the hotel-suite like facilities and prove to everyone that grades aren\u2019t everything! Along with that there are love triangles, mo\u00e9, traps, incest, lolicons, cross-dressing, yaoi, yuri and every anime clich\u00e9 under-the-sun.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd I for one love it for that.\\n\\n\r\nBrainless comedy is brainless.  Filled to the brim with slapstick humour and overacting such as the infamous anime nosebleed and much, much shouting to the point it is classed as screeching; dirty jokes and overall randomness Baka to Test helps the reviewer just sit back, relax and take it in all the over the top nature of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNot only does it spoof anime traits but it also parodies anime shows, the most recognizable ones being that from Gurren Lagann and Code Geass but they are quite subtly played. Knowledge of these shows aren't required to enjoy the show as they are only for minimal comedy relief.\\n\\n\r\nAnother wonderfully played clich\u00e9 are the stereotypical characters: \\n\\n\r\nAkihisa, the idiotic male lead completely oblivious to all the girls lusting over him;\\n\r\nHimeji, the big breasted intelligent yet timid beauty \u2013 and the most obvious love interest; \\n\r\nYuuji, strong willed and often in a comedic duo with Akihisa; \\n\r\nMinami, tomboyish though is actually quite the girl to heart;\\n\r\nKouta, the class\u2019 pervert;\\n\r\nAnd Hideyoshi, the \u2018trap\u2019 \u2013 often mistaken as a girl due to his appearances. \\n\\n\r\nThese walking stereotypes were all so superb at keeping the viewers laughing with their antics and traits. But as most stereotypes are \u2013 they are restricted. As progress throughout the show went on there was no doubt, a formula in the comedy. There were many spontaneous comedic moments as well, but most of it was rather repetitive. However, I wouldn\u2019t say it hindered the show greatly as it does not insult the viewer\u2019s sense of humour. It knows that we know this or that punch line or act yet it is delivered in such a way that it still stays fresh and funny. Much like a signature catchphrase, each character is assigned a certain quirk, habit or joke which we all come to know and love.  \\n\\n\r\nSilver Link\u2019s animation was impressive for an almost unknown company. The only other anime they have actually produced (Tayutama ~Kiss on my Deity~) is not very well known and since then their animation has improved. Although the art and animation is fairly average and similar to most other shows, it has subtle add-ins that would make it recognizable even amongst a hundred different anime, such as the colourful shadows each character has \u2013 all different colours, no less and the \u201cspotty\u201d inking in backgrounds and objects. Baka has no trouble integrating different styles of art for either comedic purposes or otherwise \u2013 using blindingly bright colours when needed and eerily dark when called for. Music is, just like the art, average. The OP and ED are very skippable and the background music is forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test does the job of using some very well known seiyuus as well as some not so very well known. All display a charismatic quality in their characters and bring out the character that they are. Akihisa is the loud idiot. Yuuji is the sometimes-calm-sometimes-not idiot. Himeji is naively sweet. Minami is an awkward idiot. Hideyoshi...does not sound like an idiot per se, but comes across as amusingly girly. And Kouta is perverted through and through.  Just hearing the voicing alone could tell you this. \\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018ending\u2019 of the show is much left to be desired for, in other words it was quite a letdown. Fortunately it has the opportunity to redeem itself with the second season announced to be aired soon. \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test isn\u2019t anything that hasn\u2019t been seen before. And honestly the excuse of a story isn\u2019t even well thought out or developed. But sometimes you will have to sit there, laugh it all off and say \u201cThat\u2019s just stupid!\u201d",

            "content": "There are tons of comedic styles to play on in anime, and Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu takes to it some of the more popular ones - and suceeds with it. Be it Kouta's excited peeping (and failing by nosebleeds), Minami's tomboyish behaviour and acts of violence against Akihisa, Shouko's yandere-esque violent obsession with Yuuji or the sheer over-the-top fighting with the Summoned Beasts. Or the rather subtle and rare allusions to various shows; Baka to Test has it in itself to bring out laughter from everyone and nobody.\r\nBaka to Test is the kind of comedy where the characters themselves, and not necessarily the situationaround them, is what makes you laugh. The various character's personalities all have some sort of specific trait which an experienced anime watcher may recognize, to an extent. The totally kawaii moe girl; the tsundere; the yandere; the peeping tom. WHile they're all too apparent, they really do work; in the hands of skilled enough writers, overused character type can be fun to watch over and over again. And it does throw a few interesting turns at you; like the FFF (christ, I'm still laughing over them) - a cult like the KKK; only that they go after those who have girlfriends (or guys who receive obentou from girls, for that sake).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the two male leads, who are actually refreshingly deep - for comedy male leads, that is. Akihisa is rather wimpy, and a total idiot, and has tons of quirks which one may or may not recognize oneself in (they're all over-the-top, though). All his quirks are a constant fuel for humour; seeing one's own problems made fun out of is something most people can recognize.\\n\\n\r\nThe other male lead, Yuuji, is totally hilarious to watch. He is in no way a sidekick character, like Kouta; instead, he takes on more of a 'group leader' role; being class rep and the one in charge of planning for the summoning battles. Truly, when he is at his peak, he is like Kamina (TTGL) in attitude; over-the-top spirited and spouting loads and loads of bull concealed as meaningful and supportive words (who can forget Kamina's \"believe in you, who believes in yourself\"?). Even those who don't recognize the Kamina-esque personality will probably find his adamant personaltiy hilarious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as settings go, you don't experience anything new. School humour show is school humour show, meaning pool days, theme park trips and that stuff are obligatory. Not to mention the school hallways; which are used as the base for the ESBs. The school does, however, have a few pleasant surprises (like the ESB server room, and the exam paper vault). And of course, the school's roof, where the more serious moments typically take place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't stand out much on its other fields; while above middling quality it's not much more. Backgrounds are tormented by an annoying, dotted style, which I see no apparent reason for having in the show. Character designs are average enough, but the hand-drawn effects which appear at the 'heroic goodbye' talks between Yuuji and are hilarious; likewise is their increased face complexity featured when they are shocked or have any similar reaction.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is standard-fare humour; themes fit the humour setting, the few 'dramatic' moments, and that is about it; there's no memorable theme or likewise to set your mind on. The opening theme is standard upbeat crazy j-pop style, and unfortunately lacks any interesting animation. Same can be said about the ending theme; though it's more j-rock than j-pop.\\n\\n\r\nSUmmarized, Baka to Test is your everyday absurd humour show with a few quirks thrown in to make it refreshing enough to be truly enjoyable, and anyone who's looking for an easy no-brains laugh may find it pleasing.",

            "content": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, the show with one of the least creative names ever seen. Just calling it Idiots and Tests and Summoned Beings... can you imagine if they called Avatar Blue guys and Forest and Environmentalism, nobody would be able to take the movie seriously (well... you can't really take it seriously anyways...). Anyways, silly titles aside, Baka to etc, is a simple show that illustrates how funny anime can be. A juvenile sense of humor with lots of slapstick gags, that delivers in every way you expected it to, just like it should. With that said, lets look at Baka to bloobybloo. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this anime, is a deep and intriguing one if you look at it symbolically, and barely visible if you don't. A down trodden class of good for nothings is thrown to the bottom of the social ladder like yesterdays dinner, and its only after a young charismatic leader whips them into shape that they realise they must enter an spectacular struggle to climb up the food chain and defeat the high and elite who are squandering their power.\\n\\n\r\nOk well, bad literary synopsizes aside, the show doesn't really pull off anything spectacular in that fashion; as you would expect its a comedy. The plot (as with most comedies), is their to provide somewhat of a driving point for the story, but mostly just to help string along more humor. And it does it well, it seems like every \"summon battle\" they have something extreme and wacky happens. Really every episode is enjoyable and you'll get a good laugh. I think the main reason for this (aside from a great sense of humor) is that they like to mix up the episodes quite a bit in presentation. For example one episode is aimed like a RTS video game, viewed from above mostly where you watch the battle unfold. Another is set where you follow the protagonists friend Yuuji, while not exactly knowing what the rest of the gang is up to. So in summary, the plot is simple, but does exactly what it needs to to keep this show rolling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are... well pretty token for a comedy of this sort. They all are pretty one dimensional, usually only having one trait to go upon, but again it works in this kind of situation. And despite there being some cliche in most of the characters, you can't help but feel that theirs something special about each and every one of them. For example, Yoshii, the protagonist. He's weak, dumb, useless, clumsy, poor, and has 2 beautiful women chasing after him (ummm and a guy, but don't think about that too much). Yawn you might think, that's been done a million times before, but what I like about Yoshii is that he isn't a wimp. Most leads of this sort, are pathetic not because they are terrible at everything, but because they are pansies who bend to every whim and have no mind of their own. Yoshii on the other hand, seems to accept that he's completely useless and strives instead to just enjoy life as much as he can. All in all, the characters are rather interesting for a comedy troupe, and I don't think I really hated any of them (something that most shows can't say). There are a tonne to pick from so you are bound to find at least a few that you find hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the art and sound are actually really fantastic. Looking and sounding good isn't such an achievement nowadays, as computers have streamlined everything... but you really have to enjoy the artistic style of this anime. It always feels like there's a weird fluffy feeling to it I find, not really sure how to describe it. Needless to say, it gently massaged my eyeballs with quite nice art work.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it all up as quickly as possible, Baka to *omg this title pisses me off* to Shoukanjuu, is a fun little experience, that I definitely recommend to anybody who needs a few good laughs. Might not be for you if your a sad lonely critic who can only watch anime if it stimulates some part of your brain, but hey give it a try at least.",

            "content": "Stupidity, one of the main concepts of comedy. Sometimes it can be annoying, other times it can be hilarious. For this anime, it's the latter.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nNot a lot of things goes on in this anime, but sometimes that doesn't matter for some anime such as this. In the anime, a lot of things happen randomly and that can make it funny, such as unexpected situations and unpredictable responses from each character. The comedy overpowers the romance genre in this anime. Whenever there are ecchi scenes, 90% there would be Kouta having nosebleeds. The ecchi genre also adds more to the comedy, and not a lotof scenes that are indecent. The main point of this anime is mostly randomness, and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is detailed and the animation is smooth. The colours in the anime is vibrant and attracts the eye easily. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nEach soundtrack fits its role, but the main thing I would like to point out is the OP. The OP perfectly fits the theme of the anime, having a happy, cheerful and catchy tune. The ED fits its the theme for how stupid the main character is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAkihisa Yoshii, I would dub \"The King of Idiots\". A very dense protagonist, which you would think would be annoying but that adds more comedy. A pervert but is very friendly.\\n\\n\r\nHimeji Mizuki, a bad cook who forces everyone to eat her cooking. You would think that she is good at cooking, but you are very wrong. Also has that aura of a \"yandere\".\\n\\n\r\nShimada Minami, the flat-chested tsundere, the very violent type but can easily show her feelings to Yoshii. A good cook that would fit best to be a housewife. She also understands English and German.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Yuuji, a delinquent-type character who used to be really smart, but never cared about anyone but himself. Shows very little hints of him liking Shouko. \\n\\n\r\nKirishima Shouko, a girl that would do anything to be with Yuuji, such as electrocuting him or tying him up, to make sure he is with her. If you haven't realised, she's a massive yandere.\\n\\n\r\nTsuchiya Kouta, a massive pervert who rarely gets caught for taking pictures. Very knowledgable in Health and PE and also knowledgable at cameras.\\n\\n\r\nKinoshita Hideyoshi, the 'trap'. Still questioning if 'he' is actually are scenes where his chest area is censored. You can easily mistake 'him' as a girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery funny, to the point where at 5 minute intervals I would laugh. There's 2 seasons of anime but I wished there was more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance+comedy x100, then this anime is for you.",

            "content": "We have baka protagonist. We have moe. We have tsundere. We have yandere. We have lolicon. We have both yuri and yaoi. We have pervert with infinite nose-bleed. We have overly sized breast and also the flat chest. We even have a lily trap. We even have incest sister. Anime clich\u00e9s are all up in F graded class, and combines with digimon. That\u2019s what this anime is about.\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu is full of anime stereotypes and otaku appeals, yet managed to become a fantastic random comedy series. It is quite unbelievable that cliche tainted anime can be this enjoyable. However, you should knowthat there are no such animes that exclusively collected every single of clich\u00e9s we can imagine \u2018intentionally\u2019. Making anime unique by bringing all the commons, it\u2019s the key of this anime\u2019s success. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I know, this anime is an adaption of one of the most successful light novel ever made, with same title. I haven\u2019t read it, so fuck it.\\n\\n\r\nStory of this anime\u2026 um, story? Was there a story?... No way. Like most of other slice of life style comedy shows, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (aka. Baka to Test. I don\u2019t want to type this long title over and over again) has no plot. You need to enjoy things as what it is. Blah, if you wanted to watch something \u2018DEEPPU\u2019 and \u2018COMPLEXUED PLOT\u2019 or whatever, go watch End of Evangelion and enjoy mind twisters. Even the comedy itself is extremely shallow; most of the time, they use the same gags over and over again. We can call it \u2018gag spam\u2019. But thank goodness, the timings are just amazing. Those humours never get bored but get even better as it goes. It continues until the half of this series and after that, it starts to focus on uniqueness of comical elements again. Aside of those gag spams, most of humour is random and placed in much unexpected points. You cannot possibly imagine which colour of mammoth will be waiting to burst your stomach off. Sometimes, things that we missed are reminded in the next episodes, so we can say there is at least some kind of plot\u2026 well random plot. There are lots of fan-services, but blah. We always like it; service means free snack.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of this show is that it has ridiculous supernatural aspect of summoning chibi-beasts with attack point of their grade. This is \u2013 as I mentioned \u2013 ridiculous. This makes absolutely no sense, and creates RPG appearance overall; that\u2019s most of people will guess. Too bad that it is so well executed in Baka to Test. It could have become really lame, but in this anime, like those repeated humours, shoukanjuu summoning is so well place with its circumstances. Everything we call \u2018absurdity\u2019 in other animes, becomes \u2018clever\u2019 in here. \\n\\n\r\nEven with those random humours, Baka to Test keeps itself on the boundary of \u2018slice of life\u2019 genre. Some brilliant moments that actually makes you think in this ridiculous anime. I can say this kind of element also comes randomly at the time it fits. Climax of the episode is also in random position due to the double twists of twist always happening right before the episode ends. Mood and tone also swings like typhoon, yet manage to be great. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I can say is consistency. Some episode is just brilliant; others are somewhat boring and pointless. Even some was only consist of the used humours and fan-services in the past and fills up the time. Repeated gags are \u2018not always\u2019 in the best timing, sometimes it is not funny any more.\\n\\n\r\n One thing I\u2019m really surprised at is art. \u2018Silver Link\u2019 where produced this anime was pretty un-known studio for me. Starting to watch it, I had same atmosphere in art directions I had when watching Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. It actually had correlation: Silver Link works with SHAFT. Not only having tons of typesets, but there are also some abstracts and brilliant-looking art elements. Most of them are really clever and intelligent. I can\u2019t do much comment on character design; it is quite cute and generic, but their uses of direction on those designs are fabulous. (*insert rainbow here*) \\n\\n\r\nSound elements are pretty much same; a lot of effects and random audios. It enhances the overall atmosphere pretty well. OSTs are brilliant and sometimes extremely funny. Opening and ending theme is one of my favourites this winter season, mainly due to the animation on those themes. OP is cheerful, cute and bright. ED is manly and shouts \u2018BAKA GO HOME!!\u2019. 2nd ending is girly and animation is basically the reflection of previous ending, except the gender of characters. (Please exclude Hideyoshi, since he has a third gender. ) Overall, generic but effective songs. I would say the animation was better than song itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, characters are tainted by clich\u00e9s. They are in anywhere. They are biased. They are nothing special whatsoever. However, the circumstance and techniques used in this anime makes everything goes upside down. It\u2019s like, \u2018breaking our stereotypes on anime stereotypes\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s go with Yoshii Akihisa. We mostly know his name as an imaginary dinosaur with long tongue ridden by fat guy with red hat and cool moustache. In here, he\u2019s just an idiot. There are tons of idiots around the anime universe anyway and the classic example is our extremely well-known Naruto. Only thing that makes him different from this shonen mascot is that there are tons of other \u2018BAKA\u2019s around him. So, he becomes \u2018THE BAKA AMONG BAKAZZ\u2019, king of all idiots. That\u2026 actually makes differences, surprisingly. He is a major laugh material around this anime, by exposing his idiocity in smart ways. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and another, we have this harem atmosphere towards Yoshii. Actually, there are three. First, classic moe voiced pink-haired big-breasted Himeji-san, and classic tsundere red haired flat-breasted Shimada-san; extremely clich\u00e9d as usual. Another lover of him is actually a guy, blah. The major reason that we can enjoy this clich\u00e9d triangular relationship, (or square) is due to the fact that Yoshii does not even notice that obvious atmosphere of love, due to his stupidity that no-human being can explain. This is why Yoshii is becoming the best character of the entire cast, even with being a classical idiot of all time. That\u2019s a brilliant way of \u2018breaking clich\u00e9 with clich\u00e9\u2019. When Japan is suffering from creativity crisis, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu recycles the elements that is overused for the past few years, and create whole new universe that is more creative that is any other anime\u2019s we\u2019ve seen. Really, amazingly clever thing.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s discuss more on characters. F class rep Yuuji, the classic \u2018cool guy\u2019 character, is the second best character in Baka to Test, and the only one who is \u2018not that clich\u00e9d\u2019 than others. He is energetic, cool and does some awesome speeches filled with GARness. Yet, he\u2019s intelligence is around the same level of Yoshii. He is sometimes overly serious on things and gets punished by various characters, especially by Yoshii or Yandere. He\u2019s the major source of manliness among these unmanly characters, which makes him very special. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a trap, Hideyoshi. Well\u2026 he\u2019s a guy who looks like a girl. He is a good character still, but imo, he was the worst of all the others in this anime. I\u2019m not saying he was bad. However, he didn\u2019t really stand out from limitation of lily stereotype, like Yoshii and Yuuji did. Same goes with Yandere, ninja pervert and yuri. Saying that, random humours from those characters are actually intelligent. For example, Hideyoshi unexpectedly appears with trap outfit, ninja pervert randomly do-the-nozu-bleed, yuri appears from nowhere to get Shimada. Baka to Test actually managed to make us laugh from that. Amazing?...\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime are the voice actors. Seriously, they were all extremely good; portraying the characters really well. Yoshii\u2019s voice is my favourite of all; reflecting his stupidity in effective way. The best part is the narrator. It\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s just me, but that dry and monotone sound was just hilarious, every single time hearing it. \u2018Excuse me; subtitles are taking my screen time.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nOverall I overly enjoyed this anime. (*loldoubleover)  Jokes are fun; endings of each episode were remarkably done, and heart-warming. Characters are funny as hell, even with the clich\u00e9d elements. I felt like happiness filling all through my body all the time, watching this anime. If you want something that is highly entertaining and ridiculously funny random comedy show filled with intelligence, here, baka\u2019s are waiting.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cF CLASS IS NOT GARBAGE!!\u201d",

            "content": "Ah, Baka Test...probably up there in the list of most random comedy series ever.  When this was shown in the first screening of the year at the anime club at my university, everyone agreed that this was the best anime of the season.  Yes it is idiotic and over-the-top, but it is one hell of a funny anime.  \r\nStory-wise it's quite...unique.  Set in a school dominated by a hierarchical structure of classes (A to F), it pretty much follows the school idiot Akihisa and the rest of Class-F (full of the dumbest kids in school) as they try to rise upthe ranks and prove that academic smarts are not everything.  They do this through a system of \"Summoned Being Wars\" where two classes fight it out using avatars with attack strength equal to their score in their last test.  At least, for the most part, the show follows this story.  The rest of it is filled with random events, running jokes and poking fun at every anime cliche in the book.  All of this combines to create absolute hilarity.  I almost fell off my seat laughing in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good to say the least.  It's simple and light-hearted, and fits the style of the show perfectly.  The base style is very bright and colourful but it switches styles dramatically to suit various scenes (and jokes).  The use of 2-D CG for the character drawings and also for the Summoned Being Wars adds an extra level of depth to the art.  Sure its a bit sugar-coated at times, but if anything this just enhances the comedy of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the sound is not that special.  The voice actors do a good job, but none of them really stand out.  The soundtrack typical of this style of comedy anime, although i did enjoy the ED \"Baka Go Home\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are this show's main strength.  A baka, moe, tsundere, yandere, lolicon, pervert and even an  incestuously inclined older sister.  Combine this with traps, references to yuri, yaoi, varying breast sizes and even Digimon and Gundam and you pretty much get Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu.  With such a variety of characters and personalities, each with their own running jokes attributed to them and their relationships with the other characters, Baka Test plays to its strengths very well.  Overall, the characters are incredibly entertaining and this anime is worth watching for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment level is very high.  Even the running jokes that are repeated episode after episode seem hilarious every time and cliches are abused left, right and centre.  Watch this one with a mindset to enjoy it as much as possible and you cant go wrong.  And if you like it, stay tuned for season 2!  Overall score: 8.0/10",

            "content": "This show serves one purpose: comedy, and in that regard it does very well.  If you're looking for a laugh, this is the show for you.  Each individual aspect shines (or doesn't) in its own way.  Note that (per my username) when I speak of voice acting talent I'm referring to the English voice actors (this won't have much of an effect on the review, but it's worth mentioning)\r\nStory: 3\r\nAlright, let's face it, this section doesn't even need much explanation.  The show has barely any overarching plotline, the romantic plotline takes a backseat for most of the show and is insteadtwisted as humor, and most of the episodes form their own little arc.  There's not much to say, the story wasn't really there.  Individual episodes also didn't explore particularly interesting plotlines, so from a perspective focused only on the actual interest the bare plotline has, the show doesn't do well.  Of course, that's not the purpose of the show, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very refreshing. Though the regular animation and character design are pretty standard (still good, however), the art choices in the show earn it a 9.  Backgrounds and shading are done with the help of color-coded dots.  As if the show wasn't fun and colorful already, the dots supplement the environment of the show.  These dots are a very distinctive art choice and were only jarring initially, afterwards you get used to them.  Characters have their shadows color coded when standing, and backgrounds are as colorful as can be.  All these bright colors just add to the fun atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Baka and Test uses animation and art style in a great way.  Animation changes from hand drawn, to chibi, to normal when appropriate and adds variety to the different ways to set the mood of the scene.  There is a perfect blend of all the different animation/art styles that are used, and they never really feel out of place.  Although the animation isn't stunningly fluid or impressive in a classic sense, the use of animation by the art director is consistently helpful to the mood of the scene or the way dialogue is being presented.  Great decisions all around and makes for a better experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing special here.  The theme song is pretty catchy, and the ending theme is nice, but there's nothing to fawn over.  Of course, the soundtrack isn't detrimental to the series.  The background music and sound effects fit to the scene well, but it's not anything worth writing home about.\\n\\n\r\nI'll mention voice acting here instead of in the next section.  The voice actors do a phenomenal job, I can't think of one voice that I didn't think matched the character.  All the voice actors do a great job and there was no lack of emotion in any of them.   The voice acting pulls the show's sound up from a 5 to an 8.  If you're planning on watching the English dub, you're in for a treat because it's truly one of the better ones out there.  Leah Clark has a voice that was practically crafted for tsunderes, Greg Ayres is always wonderful, Brina Palencia nails the androgynous voice of Hideyoshi almost too well, and Terry Doti is superb as your typical bad boy leader. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of this show gets an 10 for the voice acting, but the background music and sound effects get a measly 6,with an average of 8.  Take from that what you will.  If you don't plan on watching the English dub, none of this is applicable, and I can't comment on the Japanese voice acting, so you'll have to see how it is for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters fit into classic tropes, and a lot of them are represented.  There's no point in listing all the tropes that are fulfilled but for the most part the characters are lovable and quirky.  Though they may have a cliche personality, the characters are written very well, and regardless of if their main personality is a common anime character trope, it doesn't matter.  Stereotypical characters aren't a bad thing, poorly written stereotypical character are, and Baka and Test does stereotypes in a comical/satirical way, bringing each character over the top and beyond with their personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter interaction is where this show shines.  The banter forms most of the comedy, the personalities clash and mix in hilarious ways, and the relationships between different characters is funny to watch.  Some minor characters (and Hideyoshi) have unique characteristics that are almost always exploited for a joke.  One character gets his own gender, a group of characters punish boys who get into relationships (or get romantic attention from girls) with death, and another is a psychopathic girl who will do anything in her power to get married with her love interest.  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the characters are quirky and over the top, but they're hilarious.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember many moments during the show when I wasn't smiling.  It's just constantly happy and funny all the way through.  I came into the show expecting a comedy and nothing else, and got exactly what I wanted.  If you come into the show with that mindset, you will leave thoroughly satisfied.  If you're looking for an endearing love story, well, you're not going to enjoy it as much.  It's jokes 24/7 and I love it for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's a funny show, and I like to laugh.  Overall, there was some repetitiveness and some of the jokes lost their luster over time, but the overall hilarity of the show trumps that and puts this comedic goldmine at a solid 9/10.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys silly humor.  It's in no way sophisticated, and I love it for that.  If you have a generally open sense of humor, you'll love this show, but if you have a very specific sense of humor, you may end up thinking that most of the jokes are just plain stupid or not funny at all.",

            "content": "As we know school romantic comedies are not a new concept in anime, neither are kids with \u201csuperpowers\u201d, but recycling these dull ideas is what makes this anime unique. The easiest way to describe it, is to imagine a medley of cliched genres, characters, and plots thrown into one single anime. But the author somehow takes these overused ideas, and turns it into one of the greatest rom-coms ever. \r\nThe anime itself is quite a mess of ideas honestly, it's a pretty weird concept. It takes place in a school called Fumizuki Academy, a school where grades dictate which classes you are put in. Theclasses are lettered A through F, A meaning you\u2019re a genius, and F meaning you\u2019re not he brightest crayon in the box. The lower the lettering of your class, the more inferior your classroom equipment is. For example if you\u2019re in class A, you would have comfy padded recliners, and in class F you'd be sitting on broken stools. You get the idea. Thus the premise of the entire anime is pretty much for the class F troupe, which the story is mainly focused on, to try to reach the top of the ladder by taking over classroom A.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how would they do this you might ask? The answer is right in the ever so creative title, they of course, summon the beasts. Now don't confuse this with animes like Pokemon, or Yugioh, the beasts we\u2019re talking about are actually created by holograms of some sort. The \u201cbeasts\u201d are pretty much tiny chibi avatars of the students who control them. And they are integrated into the \u201cranking system\u201d of the school. So similar to the classrooms, the abilities of the beasts are also limited by the grades of the summoner. \\n\\n\r\nNow as boring, and as difficult to understand as that seems, if you put those elements all together with a complete imbecile as the main character, you get some top quality entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Akihisa Yoshii, is nicknamed the ultimate idiot, and guides us  through his misadventure of slapstick comedy, in which he helps guide his class through the struggles it to get to the top, complete with all his girl problems, and \u201clucky\u201d endeavors he incurs upon everyday. \\n\\n\r\nAs a wise fellow once said, \u201cno rom-com is complete without a charming cast of characters\u201d, this anime definitely is no exception. In fact it's arguable that the strongest point in the anime. Despite it\u2019s large cast of main characters, Its not hard to distinguish the characters from each other since they all have unique skills and personalities. But these characters at the same times display little to no character development, which isn't really surprising because if you watch this type of comedy there usually isn't much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime quite a lot and regardless of its flaws it still made me laugh a ton. It's aimed at more of a lighthearted feel, so don't go in expecting some deep, and intricate plot. And as far as the romance goes, there really wasn't much development, I think it included romance more for comedy than a subplot. And with only 13 episodes the anime leaves off with quite the cliffhanger but is quickly redeemed by its sequel, Baka to Test Ni. It's honestly a pretty dumb story but as far as entertainment goes, this is probably one of the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Baka to Test began as a series of light novels written by Inoue Kenji, of whom I could find no information. The anime adaptations currently consist of two seasons and an OVA, but The light novels are still going so there could be more of them in the future. For now, I'm just going to look at the first season. \r\nThe story is about a school where students are separated into different groups based on their grades with the dumbest students getting the worst room and equipment. The students can challenge each other to battles using summoned creatures with power based on their test scoresand lower ranked group can use this to take the room and equipment of a higher ranked group should they win. A young girl named Himeji ends up in the lowest ranked group due to having been sick during the test and the other students decide to challenge the other groups to get a better room, mainly so that she can have a better environment to recover. The premise is pretty stupid and the execution is extremely shoddy. The over-arcing plot is full of holes and the writer constantly forgets or ignores how the created world was set up which means that the rules for summons change several times for no apparent reason. But it's primarily a comedy, so the lousy story doesn't matter as much as the humour. Unfortunately, the humour fails on every conceivable level. There are three joke types that are frequently repeated throughout the series. 1. Gay jokes, which aren't funny. 2. Jokes about abusive relationships, which also aren't funny. 3. Jokes about how the characters are all morons, which are only funny once or twice. Aside from those you get a lot of repeated jokes, most of which aren't funny the first time but even those that are cease being funny almost immediately through being repeated over and over and over again. It's like a twisted experiment to see how long you can tell the same bloody joke before it becomes/stops being funny. Incidentally, the answers are it will never be funny/with jokes like these, once. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly flat. Most of them have a couple reoccurring jokes they're involved in and their characters revolve around those jokes. A few of the major characters get more than a couple jokes but they're still less compelling than wet cardboard. Another character issue is that every single character is an idiot, even the ones that the audience is told are intelligent. The only sign you get of intelligence is that they get a higher number for their summon. They don't act or say anything intelligent, ever. It's almost like the writer has no idea how to write intelligent characters, or even how intelligence works. Even characters of average intelligence don't exist in this. They're all absolute morons.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, for the most part, but there's this odd tendency to change the artistic method completely at random times. It's like the anime was drawn by someone who really needed a dose of Ritalin. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is atrocious. None of the characters show any depth or range of emotions. They all have one ridiculously exaggerated voice and either yell or whisper to illustrate \"emotional range.\" Which doesn't work that way, I might add. If I wasn't familiar with Harada Hitmoi, Kato Emiri, Mizuhashi Kaori, Miyata Kouki, and several others from other anime I would think that they just got people with the most obnoxious voices possible. But it's just that the direction is terrible. The music is also really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. There's an openly lesbian character who has a one-sided crush on one of the major characters. Of course, she's just used for highly problematic gay jokes and nothing ever comes of her feelings. So it just ends up being infuriating. \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test is an unpleasant, unfunny, uninspired and unintelligent series. I feel ashamed of myself, and less intelligent, for having watched it. It was painful to sit through. The humour is either problematic or lackluster, the characters are insipid and the sound is an assault on the ears. My final rating for Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a 1/10. The only aspect of it that any effort went into was the art, and even that isn't good.",

            "content": "Baka to Test is about a baka class in a very strange school. In this special school, all students are given some sort of miniaturized version of themselves (think avatars) whose \"fighting powers\" are relative to how well a student performs academically. Furthermore, the top class (A) is treated like royalty (think of accommodations like in Special A) where as our class F has cardboard boxes for desks. However, classes can engage in \"battles\" with their avatars (powered up by extra exams) to try to steal each other's class rooms. Obviously class F has no chance, but wait, an overly cheerful pink-haired girl (who isclass A quality but happened to not do well on the entrance exam) joins the class and suddenly they apparently have a fighting chance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this produces a very unique twist to the slice-of-life school series, it's overly light-hearted for my taste, with too much focus on trivial comedy, trading off character development and plot line progression. With the mini-battles, it almost feels like a strange incarnation of Pokemon in a school, you even get squeaky voices with the avatars.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for yet another light series with low-level comedy and a lot of random ecchi scenes or a series about underdogs trying to work their way up, this is your series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis show is fairly average in terms of drawing style. You get lots of vivid colors and quite a bit of CG. You also get a lot of battle scenes where each mini-character has a hit point counter (think Pokemon, the games not the show), and a lot of Who Wants to be a Millionaire as there is a lot of trivia. The actual characters are fairly average, if a bit simplistic. The backgrounds are also not as vivid as I'd like but I guess it fits the light-hearted mood of the series. Be warned that this is ecchi, one of the class males is always armed with a camera, trying to sneak pictures at certain \"angles\".\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a bit technoish, which fits with the \"electronic\" battles, and is light, which fits in with the tone of the series. It isn't particularly good though (contrast with ED of Ladies vs Butlers). ED is a guy song, which means insta-avoid for me. The VAs are very vibrant in this series, especially the male leads in the class, and they are pretty much all that keeps the series moving along through antics and over-dramatizing circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell I pretty much summed it up in the intro. A flunking class tries to out-play less-flunking classes through using a very smart pink-haired girl (who also happens to cook death). The plot is pretty linear but doesn't draw too much drama (focusing on light-heartedness) so even when the climax is reached the viewer is just like meh. There are some comedic moments but the majority are actually from Akihisa being taken advantage of (due to his unbelievable stupidity).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe point of the series is really that guts and willpower can be an equal match for just pure brain power. Behind this premise, you have a really dim-witted main character who happens to have the hearts of two girls in the class. Unfortunately, due to the light-hearted nature of the series, they don't really make use of this tension, instead forcing the girls into \"accidental\" ecchi situations resulting typically with Akihisa getting beaten up.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall, Baka to Test brings along one or two good chuckles and showing the spirit of an underdog. Perhaps this is enough for people as they're working on a second series. If you can't yet tell from this review, that is one series that I will not be reporting on, as one season was already one too many. The ratio of ecchi + pointless comedy to plot progression and character development was just too unbalanced.",

Otherwise, best look elsewhere.\r\nIf the key to success in a comedy anime is the comedy, you could say that this is a great success. But I don't, unfortunately. While it was, at points, hysterically funny, I don't feel that this is the above-average anime that everyone says it is. The characters are bland and get little to no development, the plot is inconsistent and ranges from flawed to utterly nonsensical, and many of the jokes can be very problematic.\r\nFirst, let's look at the characters. There are only two that Iactually like as a character: Yuuji (and the show seems to really disagree with me on this, considering the abuse it puts him through) and Toshimitsu (who gets very little screen time). The rest are either bland stereotypes, horrible people or both. Himeji is your average Moe archetype, with nothing to make her actually interesting. Minami is the same, but with the Tsundere archetype. Hideyoshi is essentially a one-off joke (and a slightly homophobic one at that) that stops being funny after the first 20 times. Akihisa is a general creep and doesn't really have anything special about him other than that. Kouta you might as well tick 'All of the above' being a general creep, a bland stereotype and a one-off joke. But by far the worst character is Shouko, who to make a long story short, is a horrible abusive, cruel and manipulative arse that the show somehow expects me to like and feel sympathy for her. It doesn't help that she constantly abuses one of the only sympathetic characters in the show in a realistically abusive relationship. It also annoys me that everyone wants her to be with Yuuji despite all this.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a mess. Being a slice-of-life anime, there's no unifying plot and most of the episodes exist separately from each other, but even then, they're pretty bad. The main plot is about Class F trying to get up the class ranks in a nonsensical battling system at a school. There's already some problems here: first, why would the school implement the battling system in the first place? Yes, it rewards good test results, but there's no reason why being beaten should take test results away. There's also no reason why it uses whole classes instead of individual people: A worse class with one good person (See: Class F) could be carried all the way to the top without most of them earning it. There's also no reason why Akihisa's avatar should be special in any way. It's completely unexplained as well.\\n\r\nIndividual plots are bad as well. By far the worst is episode 7, where the whole of the main cast decide it's a good idea to give Yuuji and Shouko (who they know is abusive and horrible, and literally tries to kill Yuuji in the episode before, which is also a mess) a romantic Wedding experience. There is no reason why everyone would want that. Akihisa, Hideyoshi and Himeji all know well how horrible Shouko is. Muttsulini and Minami have a slight semblance of a motivation, but it still makes no sense how much effort they put into it. Then at the end of the episode, a random audience member insults Shouko's obsession with Yuuji, and then Shouko runs off crying. And we're meant to sympathise with her despite all the torture she's given Yuuji because of her obsession. The worst part is that it becomes apparent that Yuuji actually likes her, which is unforgivable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the jokes can be very problematic at times, as well as just being bad. I can't count the amount of jokes that are repeated over and over again: Hideyoshi looks like a girl, Muttsulini's a creep, Akihisa's an idiot, Shouko abuses Yuuji, Minami beats people up, Himeji's cooking is terrible, and that's only some of them. If you had a drinking game based on those jokes alone, you would die by the 5th episode. There's also the problematic jokes. First off, they turn the abuse of Yuuji into a joke. Which is not cool. Second, they portray lesbians as insane, creepy stalkers, and constantly assert that heterosexuality is 'Normal'. Again, not cool. As well as that, the show as a KKK expy. I shouldn't need to explain how not cool that is. This is just to name a few. This show has a problem with political correctness, it seems, and it kills it for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe main good features of this show are the theme song, which is really catchy and amazing, the art, which is nice to look at, and some of the jokes, but they really don't give this show substance. The plot and characters are bad and it's extremely offensive. I would avoid this show unless you really don't care about anything other than the jokes, and even then I'd say it's not for everyone.",

            "content": "From a show that literally has the word \u201cidiot\u201d in its title, Bakatest doesn\u2019t shy from flaunting its idiocy. From ten-cent slapstick gags to an utterly absurd premise, Bakatest is a silly comedic romp blown into a full-fledged series. While the recipe for disaster seems to be complete, Bakatest is strangely charming \u2014 and while the show basically makes no sense whatsoever, it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. All and all, Bakatest is a playful, harmless gagfest that\u2019s occasionally wildly entertaining, even sweet at times, and unbearably cheesy some other times. \r\nLight novels adapations are not foreign ground for director Oonuma Shin, more notable forhis work with ef: a tale of memories.  In Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, test results mean everything. Students are assigned into classrooms based on how well they score on the placement exam, with state of the art, luxury classrooms for the A class and a disheveled, dusty room with broken tables for the F class, our heroes in this show. Furthermore, classes can challenge each other over their facilities using a magical combat fighting tool called the Examinations Battle System (ESB), which draws power from test scores. The premise is cool, a little confusing, and results in extremely over-dramatic and absolutely inane fight sequences involving academic trivia. The combination of studying and RPG-style combat undoubtedly appeals to the show\u2019s Japanese demographic, though I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s quite silly no matter where you\u2019re from. If you suspend reason and simplify the plot to an extent, most of the show is actually really fun. The action is decently slick but awkwardly predictable, causing the show\u2019s attempts at high tension drama fell a bit flat on more than one occasion for me.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the idiots in a show titled about idiots, male lead Yoshii Akihisa (cv. Shimono Hiro) is by far the dumbest of them all. Absolutely helpless when it comes to school, and (even by anime male lead standards) totally clueless to signs of affection dealing with the opposite gender, Yoshii can get on your nerves fast, but his good-natured, peppy attitude manages to endear viewers. The two female leads, Himeji Mizuki (cv. Harada Hitomi) and Shimizu Miharu (cv. Taketatsu Ayana), foil each other nicely while Kinoshita Hideyoshi (Katou Emiri) doesn\u2019t do much of anything except bringing out our inner homosexual. The two female leads are relatively weak, lacking a bit of substance outside of being pretty, making the show very irritating with cliches on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s breakout character is Class F president Sakamoto Yuuji (cv. Suzuki Tatsuhisa), who is cool, clever, and well-written. His strong, supportive, demeanor lends confidence to Yoshii and all of class F. Teeming with street smarts, he\u2019s one of the most relatable characters in the show. His osananajimi relationship with childhood friend Kirishima Shouko (cv. Isomura Tomomi) is one of the bright spots in the series \u2014 fodder for violent physical slapstick gags while also being rather sentimental. Episode 7, which focuses on those two and fleshes them out as characters, is probably the best episode of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show performs well in a technical viewpoint. The animation is very good, and the voice acting cast gets the job done. The colors and very clear and the lines are nice and clean, and the aesthetic of the show complement the mood well. Some visual elements are reminiscent of director Oonuma\u2019s earlier contributions Hidamari Sketch and Pani Poni Dash, where he worked closely with Akuyuki Shinbou.\\n\\n\r\nAsou Natsuko\u2019s OP performance, Perfect-Area Complete!, is a fun bubbly anime song that has been rather well received. I find the second ending theme, Hare Tokidoki Egao really nice on the ears in that sweet, sentimental kind of way. Debuting after my favorite episode 7 (and capturing the moment perfectly), the song and ED animation mesh well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a pretty decent show that probably could have been much better. It\u2019s original, calmly liberal on the fan-service (more probably could have done well), and ambitiously attempts to mix incorrigible silliness with heartwarming romance. The show keeps it light, but weighs on us with laborious dialogue and plot situations. Everyone knows about the androgynous Hideyoshi, who has achieved a kind of cult status, but I wish we got to learn more about him in the context of the show. The characters are decently likable, but not enough character is there to go around. There\u2019s a great show in Bakatest, trust me, you just have to dig though some other stuff to get there.",

            "content": "So yes it is time for another review, I don't do many reviews, but when I do them I try to make them fun to read and from my point of view. Now let me get something straight with you (the readers), this is from my point of view, if you have a different point of view just click the disagree button and move on, or better yet create you're own review. I don't want any feedback from you, specially negative, that I can do without. Now that we have gotten that straight ( I hope, please oh please, I hope), on to the bestpart the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Baka is a school story with a twist which is the summoned beasts, well they are not beast more like a mini me of the summoner. The show is so hilarious though, that I can not stop laughing every time I watch an episode. The awkward moments between characters make it all the better. Every once in a while there will be a scene that will confuse you, but all you have to do is rewind and watch again and you should get it. The fights can get hilarious. See you have class A-F (F being most of the main characters), they have tests to determine which class they are in, but also tests to rack up life points for their summoning character to fight with.  There are various shounen-ai and shoujo-ai references but they are so minimal to the point where it does not even need to be on the list of genres.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- Eh there is not much you can say about the art, does anyone ever talk about the art? Really you do? *Sigh* ok I will try and come up with something. The art is average, nothing wrong with it, but nothing special if you get what I am talking about. I do like how sometimes it goes into a black and white, ads to the dramatic effect of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Well the opening is good, the ending is good. The sound effects are good. Overall I love the sound for this anime. The opening being my favorite of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Oh gawd, what can you not say about this funny bunch of idiots. You know when you get a group of Bakas and stick them into a room together there is going to be trouble. And there is just that a lot of downright hilarious situations of trouble. From romance troubles, to fight backfires, just about anything you can think of these, bunch have or will get into. You have a genius that has health issues and confidence issues whose cooking kills (not in a good way), you have a complete idiot that has to do work for the teachers, a guy with a perverted fetish, a guy who everyone thinks is a girl because he acts and looks like it, a girl who is obsessed about breast sizes (mainly ones bigger than her) and really likes the complete idiot, then you have the gang of idiots who where the weird outfits (yeah I know what they look like but I really don't want to say it), and then the leader of them all who is sort of a mystery, it is like he gets things wrong on purpose, but at the same time he gets himself in lots of idiotic situations, he is afraid of his girlfriend (sort of she basically owns him, and come to think of it If I was him I would be afraid of her too). Roll them all together and you have a recipe for disaster every time, but it never stops to entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Seriously if you have not already gotten it, you should go back and read the whole thing again. Of course it is enjoyable. If you are looking for a good comedy, or just need a laugh, this anime is definitely for you. You will LYAO throughout the whole entire show, guaranteed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I give it a 10, you may not agree but eh that is the way things go sometimes, not everyone can agree you know. This is a great anime, it is short but sweet. The only I don't like is that it is now licensed by funimation and is hard to find, plus funimation changed the name of it. Don't get me wrong FUNI is not a bad company, it is just a stingy one. It ends soon so get to watchin, lol\\n\\n\r\nSo after reading this and you want to check it out, there are still a few sites that are streaming it, including FUNI's. If you don't agree and don't want to watch it that is ok too.",

            "content": "This is a really stupid show, and with that, I freaken love it! It\u2019s pretty much a slapstick comedy with meaning behind it. I consider it like Hetalia, so stupid that it\u2019s funny and with a bit of heart put into it. Some of the jokes seem not to translate well unfortunately but when watching the English dub, they do add different things into it to make it a bit more helpful. As I watched the show, I had prier knowledge from the Five Point Podcast and they had rated it a bit low but I actually think that it\u2019s better then they made itsound. They talked about how the characters were rather stupid and made it sound more like Puni Puni Poemy but the characters actually do sound smart at times; weather they are or not, I will leave that up to you. \\n\\n\r\nBy the second episode, they hooked me and I already have my favorite quote from that episode! It\u2019s the one that Himeji and Yoshii are talking and she says \u2018They also are pretty sure that you\u2019re the doughnut to his banana.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help but start laughing and right then, I figured I would watch the whole thing. There are a lot of sexual tones with this and it dives both into yuri and yaoi as well as a lot of odd ideas. There is a hint of incest but nothing makes this show seem like it should be a Hentai or even creepy. It\u2019s just how characters are shown. All the characters are pretty much the extremes of school stereotypes and yet there are actually only a few that people care for and the rest become no name characters like a tower strategy game. \\n\\n\r\nNow as we talk about the characters, we should start with the main characters\u2026 and who better then the main idiot, Akihisa Yoshii. Yoshii is well, they call him beyond retarted but I actually think he is at least a little smart. He lives alone and would probably die if he didn\u2019t know how to do basics of life. Now some of the time though, I wonder just what goes through his head. For instance, he figured that if he cut a thing of raman in half over and over again, he would be able to feast forever. What he lacks in brains though, he seems to have it in heart. Almost everyone seems to fall in love with him and when I say everyone, I mean men and women alike. I consider him the Italy of the show if we want to compare this to Hetalia. A fun thing about his character is that he is a probationary student but what I would like to know is how the heck they were able to have his avatar pick something up. It just doesn\u2019t seem right. \\n\\n\r\nNext, I think I should talk about the transgender character character, Hideyoshi. When I call him transgender, it\u2019s not because he is one specifically. It\u2019s more because he is somewhat girly. He has to remind almost everyone time and time again that he is a guy and it doesn\u2019t help that his sister looks exactly like him. He is a actor, and always seems to get dressed up in woman\u2019s clothing all the time leaving a lot of room for fan fiction about him and Yoshii it seems. \\n\\n\r\nMizuki is the next character and she is the stereotypical girl next door. Pure, sweet, innocent\u2026 and sometimes gets on my nerves because of this. On top of that, she is pretty much a Mary Sue character. She\u2019s good with academics and almost anything she can get her hands on. What she isn\u2019t good at, she is very Moe about. All these thing would make me cringe but somehow, probably because she is surrounded by so many other interesting characters, she isn\u2019t that bad.\\n\\n\r\nMinami is supposed to be from Germany, although she never seems to speak German or have any signs that she is from a different country except for the fact she can\u2019t read kanji. It makes me wonder just how she got into the school in the first place but that is kind of beyond me. She\u2019s pretty much a bitch with a bad temper and almost the opposite of Mizuki. (You can tell that the character descriptions get smaller the less they have an impact on me.) She has a female suitor from another class which brings the yuri thing out that I was talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI think the last one I really should talk about is Yuji although it\u2019s hard to actually talk about him. Little is known about him and he seems to be only a close friend to Yoshii and some think a little two close. He has some sort of intention but it\u2019s not clear at all what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Avatars are really cute and look a lot like ones from the game Maple Story. They are little chibi versions of the characters themselves and sadly, the only ones you really see are the avatars for the actual main characters and some supporting characters but the others are all generic with letters painted on their faces. I wish they had more designs and I actually want to see a Avatar creator sometime with these characters. Sadly, it seems like you don\u2019t get much of the avatar characters, mostly its gags and strange slapstick. Sometimes they even add a battle sequence that really isn\u2019t even part of the battle. This show is pretty much just random for a lot of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning, bright and beautiful. The colors are almost brightened as a pastel most of the time. There is a lot of fan service with hetero, yaoi, and yuri stuff. I noticed that a lot of girl\u2019s breasts bounce a lot. It\u2019s really really annoying. I\u2019m normally fine with fan service but it was all the time and pretty noticeable. Now this goes for the most part at least. There are small parts that change really strangely. The artwork is not fully consistent but it isn\u2019t bad. It just adds to the strangeness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really interesting and reminds me of Hetalia\u2019s ending, how crazy it is. It\u2019s bright, colorful, with rainbows and it actually made me feel that it was more about yaoi romance then a hetero romance but it\u2019s pretty cute. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I didn\u2019t want to kill any of the characters because of their voices. Most seemed to fit rather well and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but only person I didn\u2019t really like was the first teacher who turned into a narrator. His voice just seemed really dull then everyone else\u2019s. I really loved Akihisa\u2019s voice where he did sound stupid but not in a way that was bothersome.",

But, by the fourth episode I was tired of it all. The story wasn't going anywhere and the same old jokes were coming up leaving me more irritated than amused. \r\nBaka & Test is primarity a comedy, and most of the time their jokes contain dark humor and or hyperbole. For example, one girls cooking is so bad it kills people, and when a particularly pervy boy catches a glimpse of a girls underwearthe resulting noseblead is so massive he is left lying in a pool of his own blood.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to Baka & Test besides it's humor. It's kind of like a sitcom. A school segregates their students by inteligence and has this virtural system where students battle each other using avatars who gain power from their test scores. Everything following the set up is more or less a string of jokes. I would have enjoyed Baka & Test a lot more if the characters were more likeable and if the show contained better jokes or at least ones that were less repetitive. But, because the show is what it is I was irritated by a majority of the show and find it to be below average in quality.",

            "content": "At first glance, you may think Baka Test is just another harem comedy anime and may wonder why you should watch this as oppose to harem anime number 233. You have only so much time to spare. The main point that makes this series stand out a head above others of its genre is its quirky, strong and consistent characters. \r\nThe story is nothing ground-breaking.  \r\nThe artwork is good but not particularly distinctive either, thought animation is very good.\r\nMost soundtracks suit the situation, though they're not really great. The ED is awesome though!\r\nHowever, when it comes to the character department, Baka Test truly shines.Baka Test boasts a large, colourful cast, each with their own distinctive personalities and most of its humour stems from the interaction of these individuals. Their personalities are by no means original, but you can always rely on them to never act out of their character, thus providing consistent, situational fun. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the characters are what make this show great and worthy of your time. Be warned that actual character development is minimal though!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Baka Test was a very enjoyable start to the year and it kept me coming back for seconds. I\u2019d gladly recommend this series to people who enjoy harem, slap-stick humour and light viewing and oh of course, Hideyoshi. Do not bother with this if you cannot withstand weak plots, lack of major changes in characters, nonsense or fun in general ;)\\n",

            "content": "I've never been a great anime connoisseur but i remember that a few years ago when i was a little kid i would laugh a lot from watching nonsense, outright stupid humoristic attempts such as, i don't know, Shin Chan? Guess i haven't grown at all from that because i still don't get enough of this type of humour nowadays. I think there's not much into it, if you, like me, are into this kind of humour, you will definitely love both Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu's seasons. It is goofy, it has its own memes, it is entertaining.\r\nStory: 7\r\nHonestly, i never cared too muchabout the story itself, specially in the first season where it isn't that much of a concern. I wouldn't say there's no character development though, but it is quite likely that you will only get a good grasp of those things in season 2, where entire episodes are dedicated to background story and such.\\n\r\nOn this parameter, one thing that really made this anime shine for me is its setting. High school settings never get old, and when you add class stratification  disputed through summoning battles on top of that, you've given yourself an excellent context for the upcoming humour.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is an extremely important component of the overall package as well. I could easily imagine a different artistic style screwing up the series for me. You will welcome the colorful screen that this anime brings you to, along with its constant use of special effects and well designed characters, who are quite pleasant to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack displayed throughout the series was quite memorable for me. I particularly like the themes that play during the summoning battles, some of them remind me of pokemon battles and are quite dynamic. You may shake your head while listening to some of them. I did.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nOne might say that Yoshii is the main character just by a small margin. Truth be told, a good point of these series is that the main 7 or so characters combined feel like a main character. I guess that's natural for an high school setting but it seems particularly well executed here.\\n\r\nThere's no denying that you will still find tropes here (i don't see that as much of a problem though). \\n\r\nAkihisa Yoshii is your typical oblivious high school student, bad at school, bad at understanding that two girls obviously like him, living alone with few money and resorting to eat food on the floor from time to time. He is the complete baka;\\n\r\nYuuji Sakamoto is the cool guy who comes up with most of the plans and manages the class, using his friendship with Yoshii as a pretext to put him under all kind of chaotic situations.\\n\r\nMizuki Himeji, Minami Shimada and Shouko Kirishima are your typical love interests, respectively a dandere (kind of) whose woman features are largely defined (and whose voice gets annoying really quick i must say), a tsundere with a stereotypical flat chest, made fun of by Yoshii, and a yandere;\\n\r\nHideyoshi Kinoshita is your average Totsuka from Oregairu, a.k.a. an indefined genre. Actually, he is a guy but is always perceived as a girl (or as having its own genre);\\n\r\nKouta Tsuchiya is the character whose real name you'll hear the least. He is known as \"Ninja Pervert\" on the subbed versions (haven't watched the dubbed ones) or something like \"Muttsurini\" in japanese. Yeah, with that nickname you know what to expect pretty much.\\n\r\nAll in all, the clash of these characters proves to be really enjoyable. The thing about different tropes is that they somehow work because they are, well, different and even though they on their own are funny as hell, their interactions are even more win than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nLike i said in the beginning, it is up to you whether you will like the type of silly humour the series has to offer or not. \\n\r\nThere are memes everywhere: Ninja Pervert and Yoshii's nosebleeds, Yuuji's epic chats with Yoshii, Hideyoshi's genre, Himeji's poisoned food, i could go on and on. Don't expect anything serious or even resolutions because the anime won't give you any of that (i've heard the LN/manga do that). Although most episodes form some kind of continuation from the ones before, it is the randomness of this anime that i enjoyed the most. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy romcoms you will probably enjoy this show and if the comedy weighs more on that equation, you're in for a treat.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, watching Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is all about turning off your brain, sitting back and enjoying it. It's a no-brainer. In another of my boring summers, i had a hella good time with it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Short Version: Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a well executed, funny show with just enough shortcomings to keep from becoming a comedy anime classic.\r\nLong Version: Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is what happens when a group of idiots are pushed too far and, in a style reminiscent of Gurren Lagann, rise from below to topple their smarter, more able\u2026 just overall better at school than them classmates. It\u2019s been compared with Revenge of the Nerds, if the nerds were bashed over the head enough times to elicit amnesia and the burgeoning of likeable personalities.\r\nYoshii Akihisa is an idiot of the highest caliber; one sostupid that even his parents have little faith in his academic abilities. One day, the school that he attends came up with the idea to separate students into classes based on their academic abilities. Predictably, though still to amusing effect, Yoshii is relegated to the lowest class for his year: Class F.\\n\\n\r\nIn the dilapidated class (He has to fix his own desk with glue and the floor is littered with what could generously be called a pungent fungus), he meets up with the ensemble that will make up his group of friends in subsequent episodes: The boisterous yet book dumb Yuuji, the pink haired beauty Mizuki Himeji, Tsuchiya Kouta; the voyeur known affectionately as Voyeur, the tsundere pettanko Minami Shimada, and the unbelievably androgynous Hideyoshi.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, this group of misfits, nobodies, and just general oddities plans to rise from their unfortunate conditions to take the opulence of Class A for themselves. \u201cHow might they have the means to do this?\u201d you might be asking, hypothetical person who always questions when it\u2019s most appropriate. Well, the school has a rule that\u2019s most different from others. Rather than remain in the caste you\u2019re designated to be in, you can move your way up through the ranks through the means of improved test scores, mixed with chibi avatar battles.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Class F does all they can to improve their test scores to move up to the extravagant conditions of Class A, often with hilarious results. Along the way, they dodge crazed stalkers, inquisitors who crucify anybody who has a girlfriend, and the answer to what Hideyoshi\u2019s gender really is. Hint: He\u2019s a guy, but nobody else knows that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is flexible, transparent, yet omnipresent in the grand scheme of things. The characters drive it, bringing it upon themselves to advance the plot whenever the current gag has run its course. It rarely, if ever, feels like it\u2019s drawing a joke out past the point where It stops being funny. The characters drive it, each bringing their own unique spin to whatever situation rears its head.\\n\\n\r\nOddly for a comedy series, the male lead has the most personality out of the entire cast. While I wouldn\u2019t call Yoshii a dynamic character, he\u2019s by far the most interesting to watch, if only for the situations that he brings upon himself. It helps that he\u2019s likeable, but enough of a dimwitted pervert for the audience to relish whatever pain\u2019s brought down upon him with little malice.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also get enough time in the spotlight to elicit a few laughs. The most memorable is Yuuji\u2019s crazed stalker Shouko, who is by far the most over the top yandere character in recent memory, yet is oddly endearing considering the amount of abuse she puts the Kamina-in-training through. Electrocution and eye gouging are the norm for their hilariously lopsided relationship, and Yuuji\u2019s futile attempts to break free make for one of the funniest episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the mysterious FFF, an inquisitorial squad dressed in black robes vaguely reminiscent of the Klan who constantly persecutes Yoshii for the amount of female attention lavished on him. Despite their short time in the limelight, they\u2019re collectively one of the best parts of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style are bright and cheerful yet generic, occasionally descending into black and white hand drawn mode during stirring speeches. The backgrounds are sparse, punctuated by dots in a style reminiscent of manga. It can feel gratuitous at times, but it\u2019s nothing distracting. There are even a few visual treats, such as Mizuki\u2019s rabbit hairpin changing expression to match her own, that make the sparseness of the art style pop at times. In short, you\u2019ll either find it kind of neat, or a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the music matches the art style (Bright, poppy, yet nothing special), the voicework is exceptionally well done, never feeling overwrought or bland. Nothing to rave on and on about, but still quite good overall.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with all that said, here are the criticisms. There are very few, except for one glaring example: The variety of comedy used.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how uproarious or timely jokes and gags are, they inevitably grow stale the more they are repeated. I\u2019m not talking about jokes with enough variation between iterations. After all, Krauser raping a tambourine and him raping Tokyo Tower are both hilarious without feeling recycled, and they both involve excessive crotch thrusting.\\n\\n\r\nIf comedy is a pallet with different colors, the best kind is mixed with others and applied to the canvas to form a brilliant new component of the portrait. If you just paint in the same seven or eight colors, it\u2019ll still look good, but not nearly as eye catching. Where Detroit Metal City, Azumanga Daioh, and Cromartie High School (My top three most hailed comedies) mix and match to form interesting and ultimately fresh styles, Baka to Test keeps everything from blending together. Each joke is repeated with little variation each time, and it really starts wearing itself thin in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, there is only so many times that the gag with Yoshii still lusting after Hideyoshi, blissfully unaware of his lack of uterus and vagina.\\n\\n\r\nWith that one fairly significant complaint aside, Baka to Test is a cleverly written series that nevertheless falls short of being an utterly memorable comedy classic. Most of the jokes struck home, hitting a broad enough range of subjects that hit more times than missed. If you have room in your anime roster for one more series to watch, I suggest picking this up. The laughs are cheap and easy, and they come in stride.",

One of the anime's you would recommend your friend to start their journey of anime with. The dynamic duo of Akihisa and Yuuji can be regarded as one of the best in business with Yuuji the once held child prodigy and Akihisa what we call a battle hardened tube light. \r\nThis anime revolves around Akihisa who has been outcast-ed to the worst academic class in the school for bad grades and his struggle to get his childhood friend Himeji tothe best facilitated class. While trying his best Akihisa always gets dragged to situations where he most likely be misunderstood or dragged through pain in mischievous use of inspirational words from his long time friend Yuuji. Once held as a child prodigy Yuuji always finds ways to dump the hard and painful tasks to the less brighter Akhissa who does not have a knack for reading the situation. Together they challenge the elite classes for exchange of their facility.\\n\r\nEven having Several other characters in this anime does not seem out of place , with each bringing out their own personalities and a unique flavor with each episode better than the other.

            "content": "Baka and Test\r\nThis anime is about a group of not so bright students studying in a school which divides students into classes according to their grades. Students there have the ability to summon avatars (as said in the English dub version) and they fight each other in ST wars. Seems weird to me. At first I did not know what to expect from this anime because I found it's story kind of weird. I thought this would be some stupid anime. But when I started watching it, I discovered that this anime was just extremely hilarious. The anime is considered ecchi but it's not overflowingwith fanservice. It's mainly a comedy with a touch of ecchi and a little action to keep it going.\\n\r\nThe story in Baka and Test is well made. I'm the kind of guy who prefers animes with a well made story and this anime had just that. You might realize this towards the end where they continue from where they left before. Things in one episode were mostly linked to the next. It wasn't random like Rosario + Vampire in which things in one episode are mostly forgotten in the next. Almost nothing was left off here. This anime has a great story in one comical package. The way they made one joke somewhere in the anime and used it later, was a good way to make the series great.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great. I watched the English dubbed version and it was just awesome. Their voices really fit their characters. The art work was good. The characters were well made. Nothing too awesome done here. However, the avatars sort of reminded me of Heaven's Lost Property, the way they made the avatars miniature sized was a good thing.\\n\r\nEach character in this anime played a part in making the story progress and also more funny. For example, our main guy, Akihisa, his idiocy is one of the major sources of comedy throughout the series. His lack of understanding the situation is what mostly leads to many comical situations.\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment is concerned, this is by far the best anime I have seen till now. The great amount of comedy this anime has along with the little fanservice and action this anime shows is what makes this anime so enjoyable.\\n\r\nBaka and Test is a brilliant anime series and is fun to watch. I would suggest that you watch it. If you do, make sure you watch the next season. It has the same brilliance this has.\\n\r\nI hope I did well for my first review :-).",

            "content": "This anime is about Akihisa Yoshii,the baka that is mentioned in the title. He attends Fumizuki Academy, a school that assigns the students in classes based on their test scores. Akihisa, being an idiot, is sent to class F, the lowest of them all. The school has many features, the most interesting of them is the \"summoned beings\", chibi versions of the students that are called to do battle. Their stats are also determined by their summoner's scores. Classes can do battle with their beings in order to upgrade themselves or defend their facilities. \r\nThe story has not a basic axis to progress itself, it'smostly school life (even if it is a bit out of the ordinary), so don't expect anything amazing or uncommon. Every episode has a different plot and different events that happen. Only minor details will be referred throughout episodes, but that doesn't make the plot \"solid\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and contains a good amount of fanservice for those interested. At some points everything will be black and white, but that is for the moments Akihisa and Yuji are having a \"silent conversation\" by staring one another. I hear that the company that created the animations have little experience and I was surprised (in a good way) with the results. The style is unique and you won't find something similar in any other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the anime is mostly average. The background music can be hardly noticeable and is nothing impressive indeed. Also, you will find yourselves skipping the opening and the ending from the first episode since there is nothing there to make you watch it. Shame though, they could have done a better work.\\n\\n\r\nThe characteres are your average party. The brave, kind idiot (Akihisa), the cool, secretly genius partner (Yuji), the pretty girls that have a crush on the protagonist (Minami and Mizuki). However, two characters are hilarious and they will catch your attention. Kota is the first, the class pervert that prefers to stalk and take pictures of the girls in his school. As the story progresses, he will start wearing a ninja uniform, earning him the name \"ninja pervert\". The second, is Hideyoshi, the trap character. This guy is identical to his twin sister and has very feminine characteristics, thus he is being teased by everyone in hilarious ways. \\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this anime. The comedy factor is strong in this one and you will find out at the very first episode. Even if you won't like anything about the plot or the characters, you might find yourself watching it simply because of the laugh it provides. Personally, I had to pause at some points and start banging my head on the wall to stop laughing like an idiot. I can also guarantee that if you had a good laugh, you will rewatch it after a couple of months. Be certain, if you like comedy Baka to Test will not leave you unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though this anime has not much to offer when it comes to plot and characters, it is one of the funniest I have ever watched since Gintama. If you want a good laugh, BTT will help you have it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "Enter Baka and Test. A rather simple show at first glance, but after completing the entire series I have to say... It was still rather simple. Simple is by no means a BAD thing though, in this case it's quite the contrary. But I digress. Why don't we go over this one step at a time?\r\nThe story is about Akihisa. Like most male anime heroes, he's rather dimwitted. So it's no shock that he is placed in the lowest ranked class of his school, where the students are hardly given ANYTHING, and are treated as trash. In the class with him, is big-boobed and big-heartedHimeji, tomboyish but sweet Minami, cold and brilliant Yuuji, perverted Kouta, and Hideyoshi, who is the most sought after girl in school despite that he isn't a girl at all.\\n\r\nOver the course of the show we are also introduced to the adorable but DANGEROUS Shouko, the half-crazed Miharu, the playful and teasing Aiko, the rock hard \"Iron Man\", and the FFF, who are basically guys who will kill you if you date someone because they are incapable of getting dates themselves.\\n\r\nWhile none of these characters sound particularly original, the show still manages to make them one of the most likable gangs of friends you will EVER see in an anime, mostly thanks to the brilliant interactions between them. Even Akihisa managed to become a really likable guy, despite that I usually hate the main characters of such comedy-shows. In fact, there isn't a single character I can say I disliked, as they all have something going for them.\\n\\n\r\nReferencing countless shows and games, Baka and Test is truly on of the funniest anime's you'll find, with hardly any cheap fan service jokes (There are some, but 90% of these come from Hideyoshi, which makes it different, considering he isn't even a girl). You will find references to Metal Gear Solid, Mad Max, Code Geass, Apocalypse Now!, The Grudge, Gurren Lagann, and hundreds of other shows and games. Many of these are quite obscure and well hidden, but they're still rather funny even if you don't know the reference. In fact, I must say I was shocked to see that the humor of the show was in fact quite clever, and manages to parody anime with great effect. Both newcomers and hardcore anime enthusiasts will find plenty to laugh at here.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being classified as a \"harem\" anime, I'll have to disagree on this. Yes, the two female leads of the show are in love with the same guy, and yes, it does seem a bit weird at times that two gorgeous women would fall for the same guy (Actually, I take that back, as it's only in Himeji's case it seems forced and unrealistic, as season two of the show makes it perfectly understandable why Minami would care so deeply for Akihisa), but by only having two girls fight for Akihisa's affections instead of twelve, it manages to give each of the girls their time in the spotlight without having it seem forced or just plain dull (Although I think the show gives a bit too much attention to Himeji, despite Minami being the more interesting of the two). Aside from Akihisa, the other characters are given love interests as well, which Yuuji being stalked by his childhood friend Shouko, and Kouta having a charming back-and-forth with Aiko.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I felt the real meat of the show as far as romance goes never came from Akihisa and his two fair maidens, but rather from Yuuji and Shouko, as their chemistry is... Interesting, to say the least, but still quite deep in fact, with some of the cutest and saddest moments in the anime coming from these two. In fact, the only really serious scenes in the entire show is found in the episodes focusing on the relationship between these two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really caught me by surprise. Anime focusing on humor in general isn't really my cup of tea. Having watched Heaven's Lost Property, Genshiken and Ouran High School Host Club, three of the so-called \"funniest\" anime shows of all time, and not really enjoying any of them, my expectations for Baka and Test weren't exactly sky high. But that's also why I was not only shocked to find myself rooting for the characters, but actually laughing out loud at several of the shows jokes. Yes, Baka and Test is funny. And not only is it funny, it's CLEVER. Boy, could the creators of Heaven's Lost Property learn a thing or two from this, as Baka and Test makes it perfectly clear that titty-jokes for 20 minutes is neither clever nor good comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has great animation, an awesome soundtrack, superb voice acting both in japanese and english, one of the catchiest openings to any show I've ever seen, and some truly heartwarming moments at times. The adorable characters will charm your socks off, despite the fact that most of them are just stereotypes. The plot is simple, but you'll still find yourself watching episode after episode until you suddenly realize you've watched the show all the way trough. It also has loads of mini-skits which are all hilarious and well worth a watch. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with some actually clever humor that isn't 94% titty-jokes, with charming characters, great art, and a soundtrack that is will have you humming the main theme for weeks after, then this is most definitely a show for you. By far the greatest comedy-anime I have ever seen.",

The story is pretty random, jumping from one plot-line to another. It's pretty hard to grasp some decisions the main characters made (such as giving up the opportunities to exchange classroom utilities), and you will be confused by what the anime is trying to achieve. Therefore, if you are looking for some thought/feeling- provoking anime with great story-line, this anime is obviously not for you. Also, this anime is the mixture of allthe weirdness in anime world, from cross-dressing to homosexuality to incest. If you greatly oppose to any of those, you will hate this anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with those out of the way, it's time to praise this hilarious and well-built anime. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this anime will make you laugh every single episode. The comedy in this anime is so great that even I, who don't really enjoy comedy, laugh pretty hard throughout the series. Also, one of the major theme portrayed throughout the anime is friendship, and also the idea that being smart academically doesn't mean the best. It also takes strategies, bravery, hard-works, and team works to be the best. This anime also have slight romance, and a love triangle. The characters also contain all sorts of weirdness, from a tsundere to a violet and clinchy yandere, from a stalker to homosexuals, from a guy who looks like a girl, to a sister who does inappropriate stuff to her brother. These characters all contribute to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr- You will love this anime if you like school comedy with slight romance and a variety of weird characters.",

            "content": "Baka to test is my favourite comedy anime that I\u2019ve watched up to date, and trust me, I\u2019ve watched a lot. The word and genre \u2018comedy\u2019 is very subjective because there are many types but everyone can agree that the point of comedy anime-or any other comedy entertainment- is that it is supposed to make the audience burst out in laughter. Baka to test (idiots and tests and the summoned creatures) is one hell of an idiotic comedy show, but that doesn\u2019t mean it serves its purpose as a VERY funny anime.\r\n To most people, the story is simply outright stupid. Students are split intoclasses from A-F based on their academic skills; A being full of \u2018nerds\u2019 and smartasses and F being crammed with \u201cthe mentally unable\u201d, and because of that, the class that you are put in correlates to the academic equipment you may use. For example, class A in the anime has been shown to have luxurious sofas, high-tech tables and a snack bar that you can use during lesson. On the other hand, class F \u2013where our protagonists are in- have no chairs (they sit on the dirty cold floor), broken coffee tables-later changed to orange boxes- and no leisure activities. Ok so now I\u2019ve covered the idiots and test part of the title, all that is left are the summoned beings. To clarify, there is 2 ways to get into different classes. The first and most usual and normal way is by scoring good in the many exams-for example the midterms- or by the Exam Summoning battle or Summoner Test War. These wars consist of the students summoning creature-which is basically a chibi (small) version of them- fighting each other. They fight using the student\u2019s test score, For example, the higher you got on the midterms, the more hp and damage your summoning creature does. The creatures fight normally-through physical contact- and there is no exams needed to do the fighting. However, the people can do a quick \u2018mini\u2019 exam to try and power up their summoned creature further. So like I said earlier, there are 2 ways to advance- or degrade- the class system, through test scores or the ESB. Akihisa (the main character) and the rest of F-class duel in these ESB\u2019s to get the prestigious facilities and prove to everyone that grades aren\u2019t everything. Along with that there are love triangles, mo\u00e9, traps, incest, lolicons, cross-dressing, yaoi, yuri and every anime clich\u00e9 you can find. Normally, when you have so much common clich\u00e9s like these in 1 anime, it starts to be boring, repetitive and confusing, HOWEVER, the reason why Baka to Test is on this list and why it shines so bright is because it handles all this carefully and responsibly to create my favourite comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nFilled to the brim with slapstick humour and classic anime overacting such as the infamous anime nosebleed and a lot of shouting to the point it is classed as screeching; dirty jokes and overall randomness. Baka to Test helps the viewer just sit back, relax and take it all in. Also, the anime has a lot of references to other anime, most notably Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann and Code Geass. To add to the anime stereotype it also has the usual anime stereotypical characters. Akihisa-the dense and idiotic male lead that is completely unaware of the girls that love him;Yuuji- the strong willed class-rep who is often the main comedic character along with Akihisa; Himeji- the intelligent, insanely big breasted (couldn\u2019t find her exact cup size online \uf04c) and timid beauty who is put in the wrong class and is the main love interest of Akihisa;Minami-the tomboyish girl on the outside but quite girly in the inside, secret love for Akihisa, also a tsundere; Mitsurini-kun- the class pervert and my personal favourite of the characters, he collects erotic pictures using his trusty camera and sells them off for money; and last but not least, Hideyoshi- also known as the trap(mistaken for a girl due to his appearance to the point that he is made to be a separate gender thought the show)These stereotypical characters were handled so well that even though they\u2019re found in so many other anime, we don\u2019t lose interest in them and doesn\u2019t ruin the comedy of the show. However, because they ARE the generic characters you see in anime, they love romance and other character development happens very slowly BUT this doesn\u2019t stop or affect the flow of the anime and might only affect people who are hoping for there to be romance etc. Each of the characters has a specific habit, trait or punchline that we all love (or hate). For example, Kouta (mitsurini-kuns first name) has the specific habit of always taking pictures of girls\u2019 underwear or/bust and selling them off. These specific personality traits are handled very well and are delivered in a way that still stays fresh and funny. \\n\\n\r\nSilver link\u2019s (the animation company behind Baka to test) animation was very impressive and surprisingly good for an anime company that\u2019s pretty much unheard of. Although the animation and art style are mediocre, one of its most unique traits is that each scene has a distinctive art style; they use bright and beautiful colour when needed and eerie dark colours when needed. Even though, the ending for the first season was a bit of a let-down, the show kind of redeemed itself with the 2nd season that came out a year after. This time with EVEN more idiocy and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nComedy: 10\\n\r\nArt style: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.3\\n\r\nOverall: 9.1\\n",

            "content": "Summary: Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a great anime. I feel that it makes the best out of something creative and does that to the best it can be done. The characters aren't good at much, but sure give it a go.\r\nStory: One downside of this anime is its story. It isn't in depth and back stories aren't really explained, but in my opinion the positives outweigh this negative. With funny jokes and the only anime where a character uses the word ghetto Baka to Test is a great anime despite the story.\r\n7/10\r\nArt: For those who like the new style of art this won'tbe as appealing at it really is a 2010 style in this anime. I personally like the art and find it appealing to look at. The chibi summoned beings are especially kawaii.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of this song is nice and has some good parts to it. I fell especially in love with the 1st ED. The voice acting is also good and fits the characters well.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This shows best quality is the character development. As the characters progress their personalities and grades you fall more in love with them. As they grow closer together you fall more in love with the characters.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime and it was great to watch. The combination of character development and art style makes for a good anime overall.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n",

            "content": "I'm not sure what exactly about Baka to Test is so appealing. There's just something inexplicably charming about it. Nothing about it is particularly special or compelling, but it's fun and entertaining all the same. Despite the fact that I'm currently busy as hell, I couldn't stop myself from binging it. \r\nThe story is unique, I suppose. It creates a video-game-like battle scenario without sacrificing the school anime aspect and the cliches. It's an odd mix of genres and was fun to see. \r\nThe art was fun and simple, not to mention a part of the jokes. I found it easy to differentiate and theymade it hard to even mix up the twins. I found the polka-dot shadows to be interesting and reminiscent of pop art. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine; nothing special. The dub voices were hilarious, in my opinion. The music was a good fit, but nothing remarkable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, to the characters. They hold the entire show up. There's barely any character development other than for Aki, but the stereotypes that started as problematic grow on you. It's honestly pretty refreshing once you get into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe show relies on its humor, in all honesty. Everything about it is dependent on the running gags and the jokes they make about stupidity and the shoujo cliches. They make some non-PC jokes (like making light of the KKK, using tranny as an insult, making pedophiles and perverts into funny characters, etc.) but if you see past it, it's pretty fun and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: liked Assassination Classroom and want to see a stupider version of it without as much angst and tears, would like to see Ciel Phantomhive's english VA making weirdly sexual comments about being agender, like Teekyuu and Senyuu level stupidity, like lowkey harem anime\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: wanted something close to Assassination Classroom in terms of tone and mood, wanted something angsty or inspirational, don't like harems or overdone tsundere chicks, like realistic anime, like explained plot and technology \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "To be honest, I don't know how I gave this anime such a low score. Maybe it has something to do with me watching the dub first, cause the sub clearly turned this anime into something way more memorable to me.\r\nI watched this one a very long time ago. Actually, Baka to Test is among the very first anime I ever watched. Back then, I did get quite a kick out of it, but I do believe the only thing I disliked at the time was the acting, which explains why my previous score for it was so low. Watching the subbed version, however, breathsa whole new life into it and the characters' acting is way better because of it. From my understanding, the dub's voices fit the characters just fine, but they just needed better acting.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the actual anime. It's a very good comedy that favors originality a lot and ditches a lot of overused tropes. The main character, Akihisa, deals with quite a big of flak from the girls. But, unlike most anime where you'd think he's innocent...well, nearly all of his punishments are deserved. He can actually be too direct about what he says and this throws off one of the girls in particular, going by the name of Minami. Funnily enough, it's clearly obvious that she likes Akihisa since she's very submissive whenever he wants to do anything with her, but it usually occurs during misunderstandings and she always gets angry at him by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and concept is also very fresh and original in its own cool way. It's a school setting, but the students can either study in bliss, rich-style living if they're very intelligent; or, you know, horrific, poverty-esque environments and very broken school equipment if they're really incompetent. And for the whole first season, that's basically all they're trying to do is reach the highest class and can do so by challenging the class of their choice to what is referred to as a \"Summoning War.\" And this brings forth the next most major part of the series; that being their summoned beings.\\n\\n\r\nAt any point in the school building, if accompanied by a teacher, students can challenge each other to \"Summoned Being Battles\" and the student with the highest score on a certain subject, the choice of which is dependent on which teacher they choose, will have the advantage and win almost instantly every time. Or, if both students are evenly challenged in the field of academics, their stamina and battling prowess will be what decides the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not something to scoff at if you've never seen it before and it'd be very wise to do so if comedies are your favorite genre in the anime industry. Very lovable characters, really good soundtrack and the setting is very fun as well.",

The way that Aki thinks especially I find amusing\r\n(Story)\r\nThe story makes a steady progression and a easy to follow storyline.  The one liners that each character dishes out in comical situations is a great trademark that this show delivers.\r\n(Art)\r\nColours and imagery to compose a character's thoughts is done and avery intriguing way (Especially in Aki's case where this is used alot lol).\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\r\nSome of the sound is over-exaggerated but what isn't in this series, its perfect.  Grand upbeat music, believeable sound effects and best of all...the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\r\nEach character has something special that makes them likeable, no character gets left behind or forgotten.  Its fairly hard to say what character best is in line with the audience but that maybe is because you have all these characters who have very different ideologies....long story short: everyone is perfect as they are and it only gets better as it goes on :) \\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment)\\n\r\nAh-ha...well I don't think there was a single episode where I did not piss myself laughing.  The series does not miss a single beat when it comes down to throwing down humour to the audience in a fast paced way.  For me I love how the comedy is thrown quickly combined with the artstyle just makes it hard to not laugh...more so in S2.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall)\\n\r\nWell...its hard to add from what there is above.  All I will say is if you like fast comedy, humourous characters, warm sweet scenes, over-exaggerated slapstick comedy then this is the perfect one for you.  Japanese actors in this pull everything off so well I don't think it will be beaten :)",

This is my review of the day.\r\nGuys, if you want a good laugh or learn something new, this anime is meant for you!\r\nThis anime lived up beyond my expectations. It just blew me away. To be honest, I was thinking that this anime would've been bad when I first saw it, but after watching it, I had to re-watch it over and over again.\r\nThe characters are amazing and respectable in some way. Character development is also quite decent, especially with Minami, a character in the anime, and might I add is my favorite character inthe anime. The only character I find a bit annoying, and only because she changes too often and fast, is Himeji. It's not that I don't like her, but she changes too often and too fast. The music is catchy and goes well with the anime and the activity that is going on at hand, whether it is just something fun and out of the school, or if it is some battle. The animation is also quite good, and at some moments it was pretty cool. Everything about this anime is great.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, I would give this anime five stars out of six dead unicorns, which is a 10/10. You guys might be asking 'why a ten Aniwatcher154? You said that you didn't like how Himeji changed too often too fast.' I did say that, but that doesn't mean I cannot respect her as a character still, and even if I couldn't respect her, there is no such thing as a perfect anime. Thus, every anime has some kind of flaw. I feel like I am getting off topic, so I will go back to Baka and Test.\\n\\n\r\nThe two flaws in this anime I could think of, well one is in season two, and that is how the anime ended (a cliffhanger, which gave me even more hope for a season three) and the one mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, to sum it up, the anime is great. I highly recommend it to people who wants a good laugh and wants to learn some things, which even I did not know until watching the anime. Like I said, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my review for Baka and Test.",

            "content": "I haven't written a review or watched anime in months so go easy on me when rating this piece of work. I will try to do my best and make this review as interesting and colourful as possible despite there being a thousand pages worth of reviews on this anime already which from what I've seen repeat the same thing over and over again. However it's been a while for me, I've just finished this anime so I thought - why not.\r\nNow with all that said, let's get this shit rolling. \r\nSo in summary, what do we have here? \"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu\" isa school based rom-com with haremish vibes and a touch of some unconventional comedy. Anyone familiar with the \"school rom com comedy\" genre will know what to expect and sure enough, this anime seems to be no exception. \\n\\n\r\nYou have a clueless male lead, a cast full of females with perfect waist to hip ratios and every hair colour imaginable, intent on capturing the male lead's crotch and then a couple of dorks who drool over them and have some insightful shit to say from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing revolves around the students being assigned to classess from A to F based on their exam results and the possibility of progression from lower ranks through the \"Summoned being\" battles where they basically whip out a smaller electronic avatar of themselves and proceed to pummel the hell out of each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is a pretty standard set up and can get boring if watching these romcoms is all you do as far as anime goes. But hold on right there because there is one quality that makes this anime stand out despite the generic characters and setting.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the comedy. I don't know if it was the fact that I haven't watched anime in a while or the writer being genuinely creative (Probably both) but the comedy here has caught me off guard every single episode. And we're not talking some cliched slapstick girl whacks boy with a mallet type of thing. We're talking girl pulls dude's pants down and anally inspects him type of comedy. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not spoiling much by giving you this example because it had no impact on the story but I feel like I need to back up my claims as to the satirical brilliance of this animated piece of work. So let's do this :\\n\\n\r\nWe have a secondary male character who gets into trouble with a purple headed female because he refused to comply with her demands. Now because this fellow is playing a tough guy the girl has to try some unorthodox tactics to get what she wants. She goes all ninja on his ass, gets him down to his knees, pulls down his pants and eerily grins over his exposed ass cheeks. The boy then begs for mercy and promptly complies with her terms. \\n\\n\r\nNow I don't know about you but this is why I watch anime. I absolutely love these type of moments. I welcome any writer bold enough to include such artistic avant-garde in their work. I'm fucking serious.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the story and character themselves there's not much to say really. The story, in the first season at least (haven't watched the sequels) doesn't really go anywhere. Sure, there's the theme of the male lead's class wanting to beat all the others to prove a point but the nature of the show was still fairly episodic and the characters remain shallow all throughout so fairly low points awarded there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself was very good and style varied drastically between various moments aiding the comedy aspect of this show the most. I don't really have any complaints in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects and voice acting were both decent however the musical aspect of \"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu\" could make your ears bleed. I'm not partial to J-pop, in fact that shit makes me cringe and want to douse myself in sulfuric acid but that's what the opening and ending themes are and also a good portion of the background music here. And hey, I have nothing against people who listen to it but that's how I feel about it. I'm just being honest, don't hate me for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment in this anime, for me at least, was solely based on the comedic wit of the creators. But overall, all things considered it's a decent anime. The story isn't really bad and neither are the characters but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Unless of course this is the first anime you're planning to watch as you randomly came across this review but I'm 99.99% sure that's not the case so let's keep it real. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7 points seems fair to me if a little stretched out. I'd actually give this anime a 6.5 but MAL won't really allow that. So let's be a bunch of generous people and nicely round that up to 7. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and have a nice day.",

            "content": "A show about idiots?!\r\nWait, that sounds stupid enough to work. And it does.\r\nBaka and Test: Summon the Beasts is a show that lives and dies by its stupidity. Sometimes its dies, but mostly it lives.\r\nAt Fumizuki Academy, students with the highest test scores are placed in the air-conditioned, recliner seated room of Class A. Too bad for Akihisa, his grades have scored him a worn out straw mat seat in Class F. But, thanks to the Summoner Test Wars, students can summon their avatars\u2014chibi versions of themselves\u2014and challenge other classes avatar VS avatar. A lower class (F) can exchange their equipment with a higher class(E) if the former wins. Or a lower class (C) can have their equipment downgraded if they lose to a higher class (A).\\n\\n\r\nFed up with their decrepit wooden tables, Class F\u2014Akihisa, Yuji, Mizuki, Minami, Hideyoshi, and Kouta\u2014decide to partake in the Summoner Test Wars in hopes of improving their time at Fumizuki Academy. Except for the fact the strength of their avatars is based on their test scores, meaning a lower class shouldn\u2019t be able to beat a higher class. And since avatar strength is based on test scores, the Summoner Test Wars are impractical compared to taking a normal test. And they live on their own, so they knew what they were signing up for when they decided to enroll at the school.\\n\\n\r\nAlready the Summoner Test Wars are roundabout and frivolous. It gets even dumber when the strength system played straight during one fight is subverted by tactics in another fight. The fights themselves can only happen at Fumizuki, as only a teacher can create the fighting field for the avatars. Capping the fights is a teacher nicknamed \u2018Iron Man,\u2019 who drags the owners of knocked out avatars to remedial classes. It doesn\u2019t matter if their avatars are knocked out in the bathhouse or from a life-threatening emergency at Fumizuki, he WILL appear anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nWith pointless battles and the most adamant referees ever, the story cares nothing for following its own rules. Urgency? Continuity? Coherent battles? Fairness? None of that is a top priority when this show just doesn\u2019t care. But there\u2019s more to the show than the Summoner Test Wars, as they\u2019re only one part of the story. It\u2019s the wrapping for the cream of the crepe, the water that boils the noodles, or the clothes that sell Hideyoshi as a girl.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t describe Hideyoshi beyond being the guy who looks like a girl, nor do the other characters warrant much discourse. Akihisa is the title idiot, Yuji the cool best friend, Mizuki the cute genius, Minami the spunky hothead, and Kouta the perverted photographer. Some of them get a spotlight episode, but it\u2019s usually just a more serious take on their already existing antics. Unfortunately, a few serious moments don\u2019t mesh with an otherwise silly show. While this doesn\u2019t ruin the characters, they stay wholly unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nBut where the characters fall short by themselves, they stand out as a class, their antics showing in unflattering fashion. Hideyoshi is often the victim of his own appearance, by jokes from boys and girls alike, while Minami is the butt of gags noting her lack of femininity. The latter often vents her anger with wrestling moves on Akihisa. And every time Minami grapples Akihisa, her skirt rides up but she\u2019s too angry to notice Kouta trying to peek at her panties. And Kouta apparently runs a service where he sells photos of cute girls. And Hideyoshi.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the antics is Mizuki, who\u2019s actually a genius but in Class F by mistake. Her intellect is an ace for her class, but countless friends have also fallen victim to her poor cooking. Then there\u2019s Yuji, the representative for Class F, whose high confidence mismatches his low test results. Yuji barely leads his class as is, and is instead handcuffed against his will by the disturbingly devoted Shouko from Class A. While not a standout either, a few scenes and dialog are hints for why Shouko\u2019s so eccentric; she and Yuji are the only ones with any hint of background.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just when the show couldn\u2019t get dumber, it does. When one group of characters is trying to bring two other characters together, absolutely everything makes it worse for only one of the two. There are times when they conspire right in front of each other. There are times where ruses are plainly exposed only for the supposed geniuses not to notice. And there are times when the show becomes dramatic\u2014dramatic, not serious\u2014for the dumbest reasons. This show is impossible to take seriously, but stumbles when it\u2019s SUPPOSED to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with the show trying to be serious, is the mismatch in sincerity between a few scenes and episodes compared with the rest of the show. A serious moment where one character stops what she\u2019s about to do, or another character expressing a surprising amount of insight, doesn\u2019t mesh with how they behave otherwise. Maybe some viewers will find the emotional contrast to anchor the show for them, but for others, a show that appeals with stupidity loses its luster trying to haphazardly have a heart. A comedy especially needs to bring in \u2018heart\u2019 slowly, and this show doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the show brings in strong aesthetics. In addition to colors brighter than geniuses and expressions livelier than the antics, the character designs are easy on the eyes. Mostly the girls. Mizuki\u2019s long, pink, and fluffy hair is only matched by her three sizes. But size isn\u2019t everything, as the slender and short haired Minami will prove during a few scenes. Playing opposite to them is Shouko, whose elegant form belies her sadism. And rounding off the cast of girls is Hideyoshi, whose appearance alone will fool people into thinking he\u2019s a girl.\\n\\n\r\nHideyoshi\u2019s feminine appearance is further pushed by his designs. Quite oddly, most of the skinservice is from him crossdressing, from nurse outfits to swimsuits. And speaking of swimsuits, the show\u2019s skinservice episode about its girls doubles for a pool episode and bathhouse episode. So outside of the gender benderific antics, the show is devoid of fanservice in an overt sense. The girls often opt for stronger blushing than normal, suggestive words, or the scene itself to play up their appearance. It goes for something subtle instead of panty shots or what have you.\\n\\n\r\nBut what\u2019s often not so subtle is the soundtrack. As expected for a show about idiots, the music is bombastic. Everyday scenes are with silly tracks, the fights scenes have playfully dramatic pieces, and the sappy scenes are filled with over the top, melodramatic ambience. I\u2019d say the music is better if the opening and closing songs, \u2018Perfect-Area Complete!\u2019 and \u2018Baka Go Home,\u2019 were part of each episode during an opening or closing scene, but they\u2019re not.\\n\\n\r\nI say the music is \u2018often not so subtle\u2019 since there are scenes where it displays a strong grasp on the art of silence. Some scenes in the spotlight episodes especially do a fine job at wrenching a sense of rejection, uplifting the spirits through cheesy but heartwarming moments, and establishing a meaning behind a relationship. With the way these scenes sound, it\u2019s like the show has deeper character progress.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. The characters are standard fare throughout the show, and the story is brought down more than it should be. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad though, because Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts mostly succeeds at being entertaining through sheer stupidity. It\u2019s not the smartest show in the class, but I wasn\u2019t expecting clever humor about idiots.",

The answer is simple.  The show is dumb.  I don't mean it in a comedic sense where the comedy involves around over the top \"dumb\" humour.  \r\nNo.  I mean the story is just pure stupidity.  The premise of this world is so puzzling and hard to comprehend, I just could notaccept it.  The whole academy thing has been done to death in anime and so has been fantasy aspects such as the one showcased in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (BTS); however, these cliches are done in a way that makes no sense.  Maybe it is just me that can't get over how stupid this plot is.  An academy where your grades mean you get classified into groups and battle by summoning monsters?  \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I can overlook a stupid story or premise if characters are enjoyable to watch.  This is NOT the case for BTS.  The characters are boring archetypes and cliches.  The one exception to this was \"Hideyoshi\" who was only one that was kind of unique.  A lot of other characters are not only BORING but also DISTASTEFUL in nature and just annoying to watch 100% of the time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so-so and the OST was unremarkable.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show is just a solid 2-3 IMO.",

            "content": "Hey guys! For those of you unfamiliar with how I do things, briefly:\r\n- Categories are weighted differently\r\n- Story-driven anime (like angel beats) and episodic anime (like Baka and test) are critiqued differently\r\n- For reviews, I give my critical rating, not my personal rating; it'd be too bias.\r\n- If you don't care for long reviews, I put the overall rating at the bottom.\r\nAlright, let's get started!\r\nCritique Rating Type: Episodic; No overarching storyline\r\nThis review includes both seasons and all OVAs of the anime and contains NO SPOILERS\r\nCharacter Development - 8 (60%): This is the category where the anime shines the most. Characters are given thorough backgrounds thatgive the audience a clear explanation of the motivations and behaviors that the characters developed. Each main character has been thoroughly explored, with the exception of Tsuchiya who\u2019s background is still somewhat unclear.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, important characters like Himeji, Minami, and Akihisa were defined by the backgrounds that they had, including any siblings that they have as well. Because these characters were explored, it gave way to the development they had in the present.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the character development aspect of this anime receives a resounding \u201c8\u201d; some of the main characters could have been explored further but for the most part, the anime did a great job at developing its characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRepresentation/presentation of the genres and tropes provided and explored - 7 (25%): This anime does a great job at exploring a lot of the tropes in anime that you\u2019ll find in comedy and romance anime. CHaracter tropes like tsunderes and yanderes are explored in a way that makes sense with the development of the characters through their backgrounds. The use of tropes for comedic purposes was well executed and provided some great comedic moments that are unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe depiction of a supernatural twist to a Japanese high school setting adds an extra element to the mix that heightens the potential for both comedy and action. However, the anime does suffer from certain tropes that have been done quite often in the past before it aired (2010), such as the \u201cdense protagonist\u201d surrounded by girls interested in him, but the comedic moments that came out of this cliched trope helped draw attention away from said cliche moments and provides, once again, great comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the representation of tropes and romantic comedy aspects of the anime receives a deserving \u201c7\u201d; although there were some cliche moments, the exploration of the genres and tropes were well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPacing - 9 (10%): This anime does not have an overarching story, but it does have little mini-arcs within it on occasion. The episodes themselves are well paced, giving reasonable conclusions to each story per episode/per mini-arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes do not seem to rush the anime very much, as the conflicts and the solutions that were given were done in a reasonable amount of time without being too slow or too fast. This moderate pacing also gave way to exploring the genres and tropes that the anime provides, thus giving ample entertainment throughout the storytelling in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the pacing aspect of this anime receives an amazing score of \u201c9\u201d; very stable and consistent pacing throughout most episodes. There is some room for improvement, but that goes for most anime anyways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPopularity and relevance towards the time period it was made in/made for - 8 (5%): This anime was moderately popular when it aired. Most of its popularity came around later, especially after the second season and after some of its OVAs\\n\\n\r\nThis anime came out at a good time where supernatural comedy was rising in popularity. Now that these types of anime are commonplace, the comedy that this anime provided certainly did not leave the minds of those who had the privilege of enjoying this anime, but of course, comedy is subjective; it is different for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the popularity aspect of this anime receives a respectable \u201c8\u201d; a bit underrated, but still quite memorable for those who enjoyed it, and a reasonable rating for even those who might not have enjoyed the type of comedy it provided.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\n(8 * 0.6) + (7 * 0.25) + (9 * 0.1) + (8 * 0.05) = CR\\n\r\n4.8 + 1.75 + 0.9 + 0.4 = 7.85\\n\r\n7.85 \u2192 8\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! I hope you have a nice day!",

The better the grades, the better the equipment and education received. Ofcourse our main cast is found in the lowest class, and they strive to become the top class simply for the features and exceptionally well kempt classroom. In the F room it's merely sandbags and orange boxes, and the A class theirs nothing but fountain beverages and lounge chairs, like a hotel.\\n\\n\r\nThe classes can ascend the ranks through battle, in which they summon avatars to battle one another in a strategic war type setting. The power of the avatar is based on quiz scores, so of course the lowest classes must become better students to move up, this however creates an obscene amount of comedy!\\n\\n\r\nThis show has an incredible amount of production value for such a slim idea, and even the English dubbed version is very well done. Overall, it's easy to fall in love with the comedy the characters all bring to the table, it is easily one of the funniest anime's of all time.",

It's called (by me) \"I can't stand to sleep on an ending.\" Basically, It means that if I read or see the ending of some story that I really like, I end up thinking about it a lot and can't manage to sleep. This has led to many sleepless nights, and also has led me into starting a lot of new shows. See, if I start something new immediately after ending something, even if the new show is not very good, I'll be able to sleep because I'm thinking about the new show and not the one I just finished.And that is how I stumbled onto Baka to Test. I had just finished something I really liked (Can't seem to remember what now) when I happened to see this on Netflix and decided \"what the hell\" and started it up. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the introduction is out of the way, let's start this review.\\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test is stupid, gross, heavy-handed, obvious, inane, and utterly entertaining. Somehow, this show manages to bring in all kinds of elements I don't really like about anime and storytelling in general and still make it work brilliantly. It helps that it's very sarcastic about all those elements, presenting them humorously and gently poking fun at them. But it still employs those elements seriously, to great effect. Never losing sight of it's role as a comedy, it manages to keep a sense of drama without becoming either melodramatic, or overly silly. The comedy makes the drama funny, and the drama gives the comedy a certain weight that it wouldn't have without the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, the little drama that there is in this show is always punctuated with the appropriate lightheartedness. There will be no tears, but plenty of chuckles. And it actually is all fun and games, but that doesn't keep it from sometimes bringing out a bit of serious issues and themes. Those themes are presented in a comedic manner, but themselves are, in other stories and shows, more often seen in a less comedic setting. It is a very simple show, with very simple, broad themes and story-lines; but I hesitate to call it shallow. In a way it is extremely shallow, as it aims for plenty of cheap laughs, but it manages to obtain those laughs despite my best resistance. That shows a fairly deft touch, as it is not easy for slapstick to entertain for very long. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a plethora of bad comedies that aim for the lowest common denominator, rare indeed is that show that so openly and unashamedly aims for it, and hits the bulls-eye with perfect accuracy. Baka to Test, for me, hit the mark, and for that I will give a nod of appreciation and respect to the writers and directors. I won't call it genius, because the show itself ridicules such an association within the first episode, but I will call it competent. Extremely competent. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the specifics:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nPretty standard fare: an interesting setting, intriguing locale, and the classic, ever-so-popular \"Losers rise up!\" storyline. Overall, it's pretty generic, but people tend to forget that \"generic\" is not synonymous for bad. In fact, often times, generic stuff is better than the name brand. Generic, in this context, is simply that which is commonly produced. Rare indeed is the story that is generic, but still manages to obtain that unique spark of individuality. Besides, classic story-lines are \"classic\" for a reason: they work. And when they work, they work well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was both intrigued and impressed by the art. The devil is in the details, and this show really managed to hit the details well. Nothing too flashy (except in a few, intentionally over-the-top parts) but definitely has it's own style. Even shadows are personalized here, and the backgrounds are subtle jokes in their own right. Very bright and colorful, the art complements the story very well and definitely helps define the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding is the word I will use. Now, admittedly, I'm a fan of dubs and a big fan of Funimation, so I really enjoyed all the characters voices. I imagine that if you are not so big a fan of dubs, that the original cast will work too, but can't really comment because I haven't seen it. Where I really saw the sound shine through was in the sound effects and the music. Certain effects added a lot of humor, and some of the music had me chuckling every time they came on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing too fancy, mostly archetypes, but again, subtlety is where it hit the mark. While being archetypal, this anime goes intentionally over-the-top and REALLY hits the stereotype pretty hard. Anime tropes abound in this anime, but all of them poke plenty of fun at themselves so it manages to work in a really clever, satisfying way. The characters aren't exactly deep, but I have a feeling that wasn't unintentional, and to be honest, they didn't need much depth to be entertaining as hell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply: either you will like it or you won't. I don't see how someone could be lukewarm about it (though there are people who can be lukewarm about anything at all). For me, looking for something simple, palatable, and not (forgive my French) up it's own ass,  it was exactly what I needed. Nothing too heavy here, and to be honest, that is extremely refreshing. You can just sit back and watch this show without having to worry about it being some artistic achievement that you feel obligated to examine and plumb through. Whether it's a lazy day off of work (or school), or thirty minutes before bed-time, this show fits right in to those moments in your schedule where nothing else is consuming your time and attention. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI hate giving this a 7, because that seems way too harsh for something I so thoroughly enjoyed, but people seem to forget that 7 is \"good\". And that is what this show was to me: \"good\". I hesitate to give it less than an 8, and right now am really considering changing it, but I have a feeling that the show would make fun of me for those feelings with a black and white scene so I'll stick with my gut and say that this was a good show. Not a masterpiece unless you REALLY love the humor, but not bad or mediocre unless you're a stick in the mud. Competency at it's best and funny down to the last moment. Would recommend to anyone over 13 (some parts and jokes are... more mature in theme, while being less than mature in execution) who wants to relax and have a laugh or two (or seventy).",

            "content": "Ah, BakaTest, pearl of the Orient! Just look at all these jolly good reviews filled with hype and squealing!\r\nBut, as an old Russian idiom says, always there is \"a spoon of tar in a barrel of honey\". So, let's take a more critical look at this show. Although I've watched this anime long time ago, I re-watched some episodes in order to refresh my memories, and now I'm ready to share my opinion with you.\r\nOK, let's look at the title first. \r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu. \r\nLet me start from the end, i. e. \"Shoukanjuu\" or Summoned Beasts. Well, I think that this should matchproper to some kind of \"-mon\" anime, and so I thought when I just started to watch the series. Surprisingly, in the very beginning it looks kinda like an anime about kids and their \"mons\" fighting for glory, money and whatsoever. But if you look closer, you will see that these \"shoukanjuu\" are added only for a tick. All battles are short as a... I don't know what, let it be a bunny tail, the whole premise is that if your grades are high, then you're as cool as Chuck Norris and you can beat anyone without even lifting a finger. Also, we don't see the \"shoukanjuu\" much often, because the plot concentrates more on the everyday life of main characters. So, the titular Summoned Beasts become absolutely useless for the plot. Even without them the series won't lose anything. Just any random super-duper thing could replace the \"shoukanjuu\", for example, laser swords which sing traditional Japanese songs in battle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, for the \"Tests\", or plot. \\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing special here, to be honest. All we see is just everyday high schoolers' activities, flavored with some situational jokes and so on. Meet the characters, the characters get into first serious action, pool episode, amusement park episode, bla bla bla... *yawn* The whole show looks like it's filled with random events, typical for the anime of this kind. Only in the end the plot gets more action, but it's too insufficient to cover its lack in previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, let's go to the \"Baka\" part. The characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do we have here? Oh, it's just a bunch of clich\u00e9d school guys and girls - a tsundere, a main character's stupid friend, a moe girl with big boobs (oh, boy, this stuff is just gonna keep happening and happening), a pervert and yet another pervert. Groovy! And do we have any character development during the series? Absolutely not! The tsundere is needed to do her standard \"tsunder-ish\" activities, the moe girl is needed to make us all like \"Ohhhh, what a cutie!\" and the perverts are needed for some perverted jokes if there is a necessity (ha-ha, repetitive jokes about nosebleeding, so funny I could die). You may argue with me that this is a comedy anime, not some kind of drama, but I'll tell you just one thing - the flatness of the characters makes them so annoying, that I wish to hit each in a forehead with an axe dipped in curare venom. And I didn't even say a single word about our main hero...\\n\\n\r\nOK, there he is, Akihisa Yoshii. He is nothing but the biggest loser I've ever seen and this fact annoys me greater than the stupidity of other characters. His behaviour seems so unrealistic and lame, and I'll tell you what - in Russia, we call such people \"lokh\" (\"\u043b\u043e\u0445\", don't be confused with \"loch\" which means \"lake\" in Scottish, everyone knows about the famous lake Loch Ness). This word is used to describe a simple-minded foolish person, which is easy to manipulate. And so our main hero is. I think, that if such character should exist in real world, even a Russian kindergarten kid could easily fool him and make him its... uh... well, you should guess, what word goes here. And for this reason, as other characters, Akihisa also deserves to be hit with a poisoned axe in his forehead. And then with another axe. As a coup de gr\u00e2ce.\\n\\n\r\nOh, come on, man, if this anime is a parody, then the characters at least should act not so stereotypically. For example, let's take our moe girl, Himeji Mizuki. Instead of being cute and clumsy and other yadda-yadda-moe-stuff she should do something different, something out of the ordinary. For example, riding on an elephant, shouting \"THIS! IS! JAAAAPAAAAAAN!\" and shooting down UFOs with a shotgun which fires fried chicken legs. The parody is meant to be satiric or ironic to the source material (in this particular case, it's about \"school\" and \"super-duper power\" anime), not to bring all clich\u00e9 and stereotypes over the top and up to eleven.\\n\\n\r\nWell, there is one parody element that makes this show more interesting for otakus and kinda postmodern - loads of background events, references and shout-outs to different anime, videogames and whatsoever (yeah, the whole Evangelion-style episode is memorable only because of this). But, most of these references are quite openly revealed, it looks like they are waving hands at us and shouting \"Look at me! I am an easter egg! I am an easter egg!\" (this phrase is an easter egg itself too, ha-ha-ha). This makes BakaTest look more like Scary Movie.\\n\\n\r\nWell, and what should I say about art and animation? Ah, let it be \"OK\", the picture is bright with colours, the characters are drawn pretty good, especially girls. Nothing else I could say about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so about the sound. You see, guys and girls, because I watch all anime in subtitles, I concentrate my attention on the writings and I'm really not into that \"seiyuu\" thing, for me all Japanese voice actors, both female and male, sound the same. So, let's leave it as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is just an ordinary anime mostly for otakus who will undoubtedly have great pleasure while watching it. For anime beginners this series could be hard to understand because of all references (just like Haiyore! Nyaruko-san) It's not a great masterpiece, although you can kill some time with it. But keep in mind all the aforementioned things.\\n\\n\r\nDixi.",

            "content": "Baka and Test is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and always find something else to laugh at.  Going into it knowing even that much, you can go ahead and assure yourself that you are not in for an incredible story.  The show has a fairly original concept but also a very stereotypical comedic plot structure.  If you are looking for a show that you can sit back and laugh at for hours on end without really ever having to think, then this is definitely for you!\r\nStory: The story has a fairly original concept honestly, thoughwith that in mind it is still first and foremost a comedy, and therefore it retains a stereotypical, slice of life-styled plot structure.  This being said, the story does progress some and we are given several plot points that effect the show, but most of it is back story and/or moments that add to the romance aspect of the show.  Honestly the concept of the show is what pushes it above most other slice of life, romance, comedies.  For me the romance aspect of the show was my favorite part of the actual story.  What really made it stand out to me was that aside the over-the-top comedy that pretty much runs the show, they had several moments of back-story and romance were surprisingly touching.  But in the end the show still relies on it's comedy so... 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this show, I will admit, is a bit different than most, and therefore how much a person likes it will always depend on preference.  That being said, I absolutely loved the art!  Right from the start of the show we see a plethora of color.  The background of the anime is made up of a series of colored dots to give a very fun upbeat feel to the show, and it works like a charm.  I found that the art really set up for the craziness of the show and helped define the show as it progressed.  It gives a high tempo vibe, which I felt really helped support the comedy of the show and the overall energy of it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Ill start with music.  The music for the show is consisted of mostly J-pop, which actually suits the show very well.  Again it supports the high energy feel to the show while also being quite catchy.  If you are looking for something crazy, hilarious, and J-pop then this show is definitely a great option for you!  Then we have the dub.  It really isn't bad.  I typically like the subs, but with this show I really didn't mind the dub.  With the exception of a few actors we see several who are a bit underrated, and they really do a great job.  Many times the reactions to jokes aren't as funny in the dubs as they are in the subs, but surprisingly the English actors kept me laughing as much as the originals.  That being said I still prefer the Original actors, its just that this dub is much better than most.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The thing with this show is that the characters all have the classic stereotypes to them.  This being said though, they all bring a new vibe to these stereotypes.  The amount of comedic set-up done in the show allows for the characters to interact perfectly together to create hilarious moments between them.  Also the fact that our protagonist is a true idiot also adds to the recreation of these \"classical\" stereotypes.  All in all the characters make this a hilarious show.  I only wish there could have been a little more development in a couple characters, but I couldn't stop laughing long enough to really let it bother me too much. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  This is where I repeat myself and say that this is simply my opinion.  It is only what I thought of the show, therefore you can choose to disregard this if you disagree with me.  I found this show to be one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever seen.  It has such a fun storyline, and the characters are all equally hilarious.  Each character has certain traits that make them all hilarious to see interact together.  The jokes just never get old, and if they do I haven't gotten to that point yet.  This is my go to anime whenever I am looking for something to make me laugh, or just mindlessly watch after a long day. So if that isn't a good enough guideline then lets just say, If you are looking for some major comedy, slice of life, romance, and an energetic blast of J-pop then I think this anime is absolutely for you! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "[Updated review]\r\nEpisodes seen: 13/13 \r\nErm, I have to say first, I read chapters till 9 of the manga before watching up to episode 13 of the anime.\r\n And I have to say, the ESB battle started in class F is very very detailed in the manga and still ongoing in chapter 9. But the anime one was ep 1-2 then ep11-12. Ep 13 isn't exactly an ESB.\r\nEpisodes 3 until first half of episode 10 seems like fillers to me. Some very ecchi episodes, some more touching and in one word: random.\r\nStory:5/10\r\nMost were fillers, most still have a decent storyline, considering how most of them startsand end their plot in 1 episode.\\n\\n\r\nESBs and Himeji's love letter event was greatly summarised but it was still smooth and enjoyable, though not so strategic as manga at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nIt's good, although some of the background is not very detailed... more like still pictures with coloured polka dots on them.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nWell... not bad. OP and ED was fitting , but I liked ED better. \\n\r\nThe OP was a lively song with main characters popping out here and there.\\n\r\nThe ED was more focused on \"attitude\" with similar animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nVery well done for our main characters, and their personalities dun change very much throughtout the series, although a lot of characters do appear out of the blue and then go missing for several episodes, or are \"important\" people but with little development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nOverall it's quite a good scoring one in ecchi and comedy, although there were some cliches that I got sick of. This series specialty is more on comedy and ecchi while the manga was more on teenage feelings and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\r\nMore exactly, 5.23. The main dissatisfaction with this series imo is that the anime doesn't really follow the manga (I suppose it doesn't follow the original light novel as well since mangas adapted from light novels usually have very similar content- i think). In fact, someone watching the anime may have a bad impression of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu THAT IS UNDESERVED FOR THE AUTHOR.\\n\r\n But well, the anime has an allure of its own as well :D .\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a anime were you just couldn't stop laughing? No?\r\nthan this anime is the right anime for you. \r\nStory:\r\nIn this high school they have 6 classes A-F. While class F is the main class in this story it is also the dumbest. Class F is for the idiots of this school and so they are also threatened the worst. While class A studies at marble tables and live in luxury class F lives in a class room without tables or chairs. They only have a box were they can write things on. \r\nWell this all seems very harsh but class F isa funny class, and the people there don't really care for their low grades. In this school each class can battle one another in order to get to a higher class. Class F decides to battle the classes in order to become class A. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is incredibly dumb and keeps failing every time in the most hilarious ways. His best friend and also biggest rival is smart, and seems confident in everything what he does, until he meets a girl who claims him as his husband witch results into hilarious situations.\\n\r\nMeanwhile two girlfriends of our main character fight over our main character. One pink haired with huge boobs who seem to get bigger every episode, and the other one red haired with no chest (witch she has to hear the entire season). We have the photographer who is a perverted little boy who gets his nose bleed every time he sees girl parts. And there is a boy who looks like a girl and every boy loves him, he keeps telling everyone he is a boy but no one wants to believe him witch leads into hilarious situations and jealous females.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime looks kinda perverted but this is not the case you hardly see any fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is incredibly funny, with epic battles to get in a higher class and brilliant tactic plans. But also with awesome failures and a narrator who actually gives criticism on the characters is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. \\n\r\nBut I think that one character in this anime steals the show. And that is the punishment inspector, a brutal man feared by the entire school. Once defeated in battle the punishment inspector will appear out of no where and take you for punishment. Something our incredibly dumb main character has to suffer for a lot.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of humor is totally my humor, I simply cannot explain it,for example: The photographer slowly dies of blood loss cause he saw to many naked girls. Well you get the point this anime is simply amazing. Trust me you will be crying tears after the first season, and when you almost choke cause of the laughing you will notice there is a brilliant and equally funny season 2 with a beautiful ending, and maybe even a season 3.\\n\\n\\n\r\n During the anime we see two girls obsessed with the main character, one a pink haired cute girl with a annoying voice, who has large boobs who for some reason seem to get bigger every episode. And the other girl who has a flat chest and",

            "content": "Baka to Test! was one of the very first anime that pulled me into the otaku world. The story basically revolves around a group of friends in a typical high school with your not too typical mini avatars that they can use to pit their wits against others. (Cool right? :D i wish our schools had that system).\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nThere is no main storyline involved, the whole 13 episodes consisted of mini arcs revolved around the misadventures of the main protagonist and pretty much everyone in the school. The arcs told an interesting and humorous story and each episode would at least throw you intoa few fits of laughter. Some people may think that the stories are cliche or the jokes are lame and overused i won't completely disagree because I believe that the story was not the main selling point of Baka To Test! and it wasn't the story that made me like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can i say? The art is clear nice to look at, pleasant to the eye, well made and suited the story pretty well good light art for a good light comedy. However the only thing i didn't think was right was the art used in the ED, it felt like it was potraying a different type of show and not the Baka to Test i know and love.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10 \\n\r\nWhy? Well i couldn't really get myself to like the OP or ED of the anime, though it did suit the show pretty and the seiyuus fit their roles almost perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nTo me this was the true essence of Baka to Test , the main driving point that sets Baka To Test apart from other comedies. I admit character development wasn't exactly present and the main protagonist has a cliched personality which is the typical idiot that is determined and values friendship above all else, BUT even with all these stereotypical traits , the show somehow makes him a realistic and relatable and likeable character. This might only be me but i feel as if all the characters in baka to test actually exists and are doing idiotic things right beside me. When you watch the show you feel as if you were in their world, in their school, joining in their adventures and laughing and crying with them, which made it really enjoyable. On another point, it wasn't the comedic lines that made me laugh but those particular characters using those cheesy jokes that really drove the show into the elite ranks. The show is full of colorful characters with stereotypical traits, the main idiot, the lazy but ingenius leader, the flat chested tsundere, the dream girl, the pervet with a camera, the scary obsessive yandere, the gay, the lesbian, the parody of the KKK, the trap .... AH I GIVE UP.However i sure you get the point the show compiles together every stereotypical personality you can think of and makes them actually believable. In this case the characters would be Bruce Lee while the jokes and story being his fists and nun-chucks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10 \\n\r\nI wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece but it is definitely a show which should not be overlooked or underestimated. I really enjoyed watching this piece and i recommend it to everyone especially those under stress or just looking for something to enjoy right now :D",

            "content": "Wow I just finished the final episode and all I'm astounded, what started off with a simple comedic premise developed into a wondrous conundrum of lovable characters and jokes that never get old.\r\nSYNOPSIS: At fumizuki high, students are segregated according to their performance on a placement test and put into classes from A to F. A being the best possible class with stellar facilities and providing a luxurious environment while people in class F write on cardboard boxes instead of desks and sit on the floor. A girl called Himeji is ill on the day of the first placement test and is thrown into classF along with the other idiots:\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n Voyeur - (as his name suggests the most perverted one of the bunch) \\n\r\nAkihisa  (the biggest idiot of the bunch and the main char)\\n\r\n Yuuji (one of the smartest people in class F though he tends not to show it outwardly)\\n\r\n Minami (flat chested tsundere with killer wrestling moves)\\n\r\nHideyoshi - the identical twin of his sister in class A (and yes \"his\" wasn't a typo) \\n\r\nThere are many other characters introduced outside class F the most prominent being Shouko: the schools valedictorian who has the hots for yuuji.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time the classes are fighting each other to exchange facilities with each other. They fight using summoned beings (a system the school has implemented which makes for some rather entertaining chibi action). Though most of the time this serious aspect of the show is overshadowed by the utter zany nature of whats going on, there's literally never a dull moment in this anime. For me this was one of the best shows that aired this season, always put a smile on my face every thursday.\\n\r\n      If you want a quirky ludicrously funny anime with lovable characters look no further, just don't expect a thickly layered plot though in all fairness shows like this wouldn't be half as good if they took themselves seriously. DONT MISS OUT ON THIS SHOW !!!! this is comedy at its best\\n",

            "content": "Anim\u00e9 these days are turning into photocopies of past selves: ordinary kids who stumble inside cockpits of legendary mechas, orphan boys and girls who turn into saviors of the world, clueless boys seemingly surrounded by numerous beautiful girls whose affections are all aimed at the poor guy, a nobody who hides a completely unexpected secret skill, two governments or kingdoms in conflict, and groups of individuals with a common interest. Most people comment that recent anim\u00e9 are just reboots of the same formula that's been in use for years. Few titles make it out of the common zone and turn into masterpieces and hits.\r\nHowever, itshould be noted that all anim\u00e9 are practically just mixes of the same basic ingredients--romance, suspense, superpowers, harem, and the like. In comparison, both grilled chicken and fried chicken make use of the same meat, and both are heated before eaten, but both turn out differently from each other once the final product is compared.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, however, instances where the right ingredients are selected, the exact amounts o each ingredient is taken, and the ingredients are then mixed together to form an entirely different taste. It's just like pizza; all pizzas are made of the same basic dough, but philly cheese steak is certainly different from pepperoni and cheese.\\n\\n\r\nAnim\u00e9 makes use of the same technique, which enables it to sprout some masterpieces in the midst of the same repeated ingredients. Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is one of these masterpieces; we've all seen school life anim\u00e9, and we've all seen romance and harem elements in these anim\u00e9. However, there's something in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu that stands out. It makes use of standard ingredients--school life, romance, harem, friendship, comedy among others. But somehow, it uses just the right amounts of these ingredients, and turns into a breath of fresh air for the school life-comedy shows of this time.\\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu simply follows the daily (or monthly, depends on the time lapses) misfits of the class idiot, for whom the series is so rightly named. What sets the show apart from its fellow school life cousins is the addition of the battle system based on test scores. Simply put, it gives life to a student's test scores in the form of summoned avatars. Do not be fooled into thinking that this show is a battle anim\u00e9, however; it makes use of this unique plot device to keep the story linear despite the episodic misfits of the characters. Each episode has its own funny story, but the battle system keeps all the events related to one another.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key point which keeps the show's story together is romance. Romance is an ingredient as old as anim\u00e9 itself; Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, however, uses it at just the right level. The main character may be a dense idiot, and has no idea how he got girls interested in him (he has no idea that the girls have actually any interest in him, actually). The story, however, uses the battle system to strengthen the romantic flow of the plot. Being incredibly dense and clueless, the main character is also incredibly kind, starting battles simply for the sake of a girl in class. The girl (or girls, for this instance) then falls even more for the guy. It's a classic formula, but it never seems to get old in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe last important ingredient is comedy. What seems to be such a simple ingredient that needs no mention is actually a driving force of the series. (It was enough force to start--and finish--a second season of the series.) Similar to most comedies, each episode gives a different laugh, and episodes don't seem to have any connection to each other whatsoever. But it's the different laughs that keeps the audience asking for more. And with the unique plot devices this series makes use of, it turned itself into a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that deserves the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe show might be an episodic comedy, but it skillfully makes use of its unique plot devices to keep the flow of events coherent. The whole season eventually makes an entire story that's composed of episodes, each with it's own set of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation and drawing is well-done and quite fitting for a show of its kind. It's not at the level of mecha anim\u00e9 and all its 3D animation, but it's certainly above its fellow comedy peers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAny good comedy can't be good without accompanying sound that matches its swiftly-changing moods and scenes. The show skillfully makes use of constantly shifting sound effects that augment and amplify the series' funniest moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis comes as a surprise for me, since I expected comedies to focus less on character development, and more on the comedy itself. Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, however, adds a defining trait to each character that makes that character stand out from the rest. An example of this is the main character's impeccable stupidity and outright kindness. Here's something we have to thank the romance ingredient for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a comedy, and one that's well-done. You won't fall short of laughs from this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nI simply averaged my ratings and got the nearest score from the list. Had I stuck to my bias, I would have given this a perfect 10, because I simply adored and enjoyed this series. All bias aside, the show doesn't fail its viewers when it comes to comedy, romance, and school life all brought into one. It may make use of the standard ingredients, but it mixes it all together in such a way that it stands out from the rest, and defines itself as a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu isn't your average comedy; it's a comedy with enough back story to keep you wanting for more, and certainly enough comedy to keep you laughing for hours. It caters to every anim\u00e9 lover, and also provides room for newcomers. Overall, it has its own taste that lets it stand out from other comedies.",

            "content": "Are grades all that matter?  At this school, that is certainly the case, or so it seems.  \r\nThis is a genuinly fun series.  With few deep, hidden meanings, it's a series that wears it's heart on its sleeve.  The character's feelings, intentions, and goals are all shown very clearly and honestly.  So while the characters are rich and varried, they aren't very complicated.  But then, we ARE dealing with a cast made up of idiots after all.  For one reason or another, all of these characters get poor grades, whether they can't read kanji, had the misfortune ofbeing sick on the day of placement tests, refuse to focus on school, or they're just plain stupid.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd because of their stupidity, they get placed in the lowest ranked class, with the worst teacher and the worst equipment.  In the meantime, the smartest students get the best facilities.  Now here's the twist, it does not have to stay this way.  If the students in the worst class can beat the best class, then they can swap rooms and equipment.  And how do they beat them, with futuristic chibi avatars whose strength is measured by their GPA.  Simple right?  Okay, not really, but trust me, you catch on and get used to it quick.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where we get into what is the strongest point in this series, it's plot.  It's something unique, that has never been done before, and adds a whole new dimension (literally) to the school-genre.  While it's completely farfetched and ridiculous, it's still a fun and interesting premise for a comedy.  And then there are multiple layers of subplots that keep things interesting when classes aren't battling it out for supremacy.  Love triangles, squares, and one sided relationships are a staple of the series, all of which end in hilarity.  The characters themselves are also a joy to watch, and I can't really praise this aspect of the show highly enough.  While a few of them are simply archetypes cranked out in anime over and over, they play off each other in a way that makes it feel like you're seeing them for the first time.  And of course, some of the characters are very unique.  Hideyoshi...just, Hideyoshi, the bishonen boy who is repeatedly mistaken for a girl, to the point that the rest of the student body believes he is a woman, and Hideyoshi himself is in denial.  \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect I really enjoyed about this series is the question: Are grades all that matters?  Is there a way to get ahead in life, and maybe even ahead of the average joe, when you don't do well in school?  It's a question that a lot of kids and young adults ask themselves, especially when they see their classmates showered with awards and scholarships, when they have to struggle (for whatever reason) to maintain a decent average grade.  Is this all there really is to life?  This is a question the main cast repeatedly puts to the test, and shows that even idiots can surprise you.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very cute, typical moe, a bit reminicent of Higurashi (minus the blood).  These characters are adorable, and so are their chibi avatars.  The backgrounds are rich, and add to the overall humour, especially when contrasting classrooms.  The animation is a bit choppy, but then, precise and graceful movements are not really required for idiots, and it's all for comedic effect.  It also has a good range, and often parodies other styles, such as BL, shonen, and even a little horror.  This are usually only done for a split second as a sight gag, but it's still pretty good art.  The only downside is that these are often recycled from other episodes, rather than drawing more or different frames.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound I find is where the series suffers.  For a show that is so original and unique, the sound is simply generic.  Nothing new or exciting, just generic.  It does not take away from the overall enjoyment, but it doesn't really add to it either.  The music is generic for a comedy, and the sound effects are generic for one as well.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  The voices are wonderfully melodramatic (keep in mind that the characters are idiots) and are able to blow the silliest things out of proportion or say the silliest things in completely serious ways.  The English dub is also a joy to listen to.  (The line \"I don't want to be your dounut!\" was stuck in my head for weeks.)  Overall though, it's just...there.  And after being spoiled by characters and plot, the sound drags it down.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Watch this series!  It is so much fun, a perfect pick me up.  And a little fun for the blithering moron in all of us.  \\n\\n\r\nWarnings:  Jokes about homosexuality, sex, and breast size, skimpy outfits (nothing is shown), cursing, cartoon violence, and explosive nosebleeds.  You also may laugh so much you burst a lung or two.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThroughout my time with anime most School anime's play out the same, however when I discovered this anime I was pleasantly surprised by the path it took.\r\nThe story concentrates on Akihisa Yoshii a very dumb boy who ended up in F-class at his high school, but when he notices his crush Mizuki Himeji the 2nd smartest person in the School is also in the same class as him so Yoshii goes on a quest to gain the equipment from A-Class to make Himeji's school life more comfortable.\r\nNow from a story viewpoint it isn't really that strong, but what the anime makes up forin story is fun characters, brilliant comedy and entertaining battles.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the academic battles the students had with each other during the series and how they worked was pretty interesting as the students had a power called Summoning Beings which are small, furry avatars of the characters which are used for the academic battles whenever a class declares war on each other, Their stats are also ranked by their scores in any academic subject so if they have a low score then their attack will be weak and these battles can only take place as long as there is a teacher around to witness the battle, not only that the battles themselves had some strategy to them because before a battle took place F-class would mainly come up with a plan of attack or defence which gave the battles an extra point of interest.\\n\r\nThe battles themselves weren't the only good part of the as the characters numerous day to day activities were just really funny as the situations they get into were just hilarious and felt like they had really bad luck since most of the things they try to do always bad fires on them making their school life even more uncomfortable, also the chemistry between the characters was also done brilliantly because even though they are a class they don't always get along and there are plenty of times where the classmates of F-class always pull jokes or pranks on each other that always end's up with them getting in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters of the show were really well done I don't even think there was a character that I hated and the things these characters do were absolutely hilarious.\\n\r\nYoshii the male MC is probably the stupidest character I've seen as he always does things incorrectly and even overthinks a lot of things too like what is he going from the lack of money he has or what is he going to say that will end up with him getting a punch to the face, his avatar is also special too since he can actually summon it wherever he is on the school grounds, but at a cost whatever his avatar feels he feels it too, despite all this he can actually be a righteous person as he always put's himself on the line for his friends even if he doesn't gain anything from it.\\n\r\nHimeji is the female MC is the second smartest person in the school however due to having a fever on the class division examination  she was sent to F-class, Himeji is actually a very gentle and innocent person, but because of this she believes in other peoples words too easily and she is also a terrible cook that has been known to be deadly to others, she can also get jealous whenever other girls except Minami get close to Yoshii which brings out her Yandere side.\\n\r\nMinami is the other female MC and is a good friend of Yoshii's, originally from Germany she lacks in her studies because she is still adapting to Kanji however she is really smart at maths, she is also a Tsundere mainly because her breast size is mostly a joke to everyone and she also punches Yoshii whenever he's doing something useless however she like Himeji has feelings for Yoshii and has at times shown a more girly side.\\n\r\nYuuji is Yoshii's best friend although they certainly don't act like it as most of the time they are always pulling pranks on each other, however Yuuji is actually a collected and pretty intelligent person as he is usually the one who plans out the battles whenever F-class declares war on any of the other classes, although despite looking like a tough person there is one thing that truly terrify's him.\\n\r\nShouko is a childhood friend of Yuuji and has a crush on him however that crush is more a Yandere obsession as she can be a very ruthless girl, she is very soft-spoken and highly assertive even going so far to poke Yuuji's eyes to stop him seeing girls in their underwear despite this though she'll believe anything Yuuji says and will pretty much follow any order he gives her.\\n\r\nHideyoshi is another friend of Yoshii however he is often mistaken for a girl because of his appearance and even when he tries to correct them it never works and it has even gone so far as to be classed as a third gender called Hideyoshi however he has a major interest in drama and is very good at mimicking a boy or a girls voice.\\n\r\nKouta is another friend of Yoshii and is an incredibly big pervert as he always tries to take a photograph of the girls panties at every opportunity and whats even more funny is that the girls are actually fine with this mainly because he always succumbs to nose bleeds before he gets a good shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was done pretty well as the characters especially the female characters look smaller compared to other anime's and I really liked the difference between the classes as each rank has different attributes like A-class looks like a mansion while F-class looks an abandoned school, the avatars themselves look really cool too as they nicely represent the personality of their users.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was brilliant as there was probably never a moment that I couldn't stop laughing as the jokes were always on point, the chemistry between the characters always lead to funny stuff happening like the many times Yuuji pulls a joke on Yoshii or Hideyoshi always being seen as a girl even though he desperately tries to say he isn't and even the many times Minami punches Yoshii because he said something wrong, there are so many moments that are just irresistibly funny that made it such an enjoyment to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some Romance in this show, but it's more messed up than proper Romance since Himeji, Minami and Shouko are all pretty much Yandere's when it comes to their crushes Yoshii and Yuuji because even if they step out of a line by just a bit they get a considerable punishment by the girls and it doesn't look pretty, but there are moments where the girls show their softer side, not only that there also two other elements in the picture and they are Kubo and Miharu, Miharu is a lesbian that has the hots for Minami and Kubo gets a sudden attachment to Yoshii so the show introduces quite a lot of elements for a Romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a really funny anime and pretty much shows you don't need a complex story to make an anime good instead it relies on the characters to keep it going, so if you're looking for something to laugh your ass off to then this is the right choice.",

That is putting classes based on their intelligent from A to F class. And a thing that's called a Exam Summoning Battle, an \"all-out-war\" between two classes in order for the winner to switch facilities with the losers. The way students fight each other is based on their scores in different subjects and through\"Champions or Digimons or Pokemons lil dollies?\"\\n\\n\r\nSound, I've never seen an anime with bad sound as of now, so that's that. The OP and ED were alright, I mean, I didn't feel a shock in my spine or something. But nice PVs and BGMs. (Don't go to my profile and suggest some horrible sounding animes...)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice, everything looks nice and bak-I mean cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. This one is pretty easy, we got the idiot, the rich, the cool, the energetic, the perv, the smart, so on.\\n\\n\r\nLet me remind all of you I laughed a lot watching this so it was definitely an enjoyment to me. I couldn't believe I withstood the stupidest, most idiotic baka in the whole world after watching every single episode of Baka to Test. Until my next harem review. Later bak- I mean guys!",

It's not that it wasn't funny, but the style of humor just didn't grab me at the time.  Now that I went back and gave this anime another try I found myself liking it more and more.\r\nThis is not a complex story.  Kids and teachers running amok in school.  Yes there is a pseudo video game portion with classes battling classes, but that's just a backdrop to the real story of kids having fun.  Thought provoking dialogue is not part of thisanime, but that's not bad.  It's a fun quick moving story with lots of jokes and violent behavior.  Heck that's what my high school was like.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and funny.  I really enjoy the main character.  He is just idiotic enough to make him funny but not annoying.  For a comedy such as it is the characters are interesting and watchable.  You can see real personalities inside them.  Not just your typical aloof, self absorbed, unemotional characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \"Baka\" is a funny show that you will probably have a great time watching.  So if you are looking for a fast paced comedy with lots of jokes and some great characters, you should give this anime a chance.",

            "content": "I've wanted to write a review on baka for quite some time now since it was one of the anime i enjoyed the most, but due to time constraint i couldn't do it up till now.. So here it is :)\r\nI felt that Baka's story was very creative and humorous. To me the idea of splitting classes from A to F with each having facilities according to their academic abilities was a rather original and creative idea, and this actually reflects on most of modern society where most of the time, results are still everything(kinda sad to admit but its still true..). I also reallyloved the idea of summoning beings in the story.. First, they are extremely cute and have tails :) Second, they actually accurately portray what education is often really like: very competitive in nature. This anime does remind us that sometimes, results do not necessarily determine everything. However, i personally feel that the merit in Baka's story does not come from its plot development (you have to admit that not much has really happened from the start to the end of the story), but instead from the fact that Baka's humorous storyline keeps you falling off your seat from laughter. Some examples would be the nosebleeds that yoshii often gets, and of course, himeji's food. Although in reality there doesn't exist food so bad that it could make you collapse almost instantly, these scenes never failed to make me break out in complete laughter. (unless it has poison in it of course) Some of its jokes are witty while most are plain nonsensical, but you gotta admit those moments were pretty enjoyable!!\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art in the anime, i felt that it was pretty well done. I especially loved how they animated the summoning beings and the fighting scenes between them. Those scenes were sooo cute!! The art and animation quality wasn't extraordinary, but i felt that it still quite nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding characters in the anime.. I felt that the character development was outstanding. Yoshii, the main male protagonist, who was supposed to be the \"idiot\" was made a complete idiot in almost every aspect. His results were mediocre, he never failed to come up with completely stupid ideas, and even when it came to romance he was REALLY REALLY dense, and it seemed that he was almost completely oblivious of minami and himeji's all too obvious feelings towards him. Yuuji's character was also nicely portrayed, with him occasionally coming up with brilliant ideas and such despite being in class F, and always being the one to trick yoshii into doing certain things for him, making him truly deserve the title of \"child prodigy\" despite his idiot-like behavior and constant arguments with yoshii. I liked how they did Hideyoshi's character, with how he wasn't exactly a guy and also not exactly a girl..\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i felt that this anime is an extremely enjoyable one to watch with its many funny moments in the story. For those of you who love comedy or those who are trying to find some fun filled anime to lighten up your lives, Baka is definitely an anime for you :) Thanks for reading!! :D",

            "content": "Despite the high overall rating I gave to Baka and Test, surprisingly enough it was very difficult to rate it accordingly. I will thoroughly explain what my thoughts were on each category:\r\nStory-9\r\nBaka and Test's main focus is romantic/comedy (high emphasis on the comedy). The main protagonist Akihisa Yoshii, is a boy who's main focus in this anime is to do justice for the big busted and innocent Himeji, Mizuki who through unfortunate circumstances was forced into his class F despite her flawless academic record which under normal circumstances would put her easily into class A.\r\nThe side, but just as important, plot is what really makesthis anime stand out i guess you could say. Each student had an avatar which they can do battle with. The attack and defense of the individual avatars are unique to each student's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the subject they are battling in (Math, PE, History, English, etc.). It is the goal of class F to battle the higher rank classes in order to rise up from their oppression and make people realize that the rank that you're in as a class says nothing about who you are as a person (also, if they win a battle against a high class then they can trade school equipment which as you get higher, gets more and more flashy).\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art was a mix between impressive, yet at the same time typical. I couldn't help but appreciate it due to the fact that they incorporate different elements of art when in different situations. (This is just my opinion.)\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are still stuck in my head and I find myself humming and even busting out into song when I'm alone, don't judge me... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nAs per the usual, each character had an inner and occasionally opposing motive when it came to their overall goals. The overly busty sweet girl has a tendency to be quite frightening, the overly tough woman is actually very sweet, and the crazy psychotic, obsessive, representative of class A is actually a sensitive and well thought character who has potential for future development. What's weird is that despite some of these characters appearing to have more than one agenda, I couldn't help but find them extremely predictable, but hey, what isn't nowadays right? I have to say not one of the characters really jumped out at me as unique or memorable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nI'm actually surprised I went through this anime as quickly as I did given that I had other options to watch and for whatever reason chose to watch this. What lowered the enjoyment rating for me was the constant fan service and I know I've said it in other reviews but please bare with me this time. What does an episode solely existing to see the big busted heroin in a too tight for comfort swimsuit have to do with them completing with other classes for rank? I just found it inconsistent. Many of the episodes were just fillers with the only point to force minimal character development while exciting boys with fan service. Just not my thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nThis anime had the potential in my mind to be great and for whatever reason I finished quickly and could not stop watching despite the contrary writings above. Perhaps I just had too high of expectations, because I was hoping for another anime for my Top 10.\\n\r\nThis anime did not make my Top 10, but I can see the appeal and why people enjoyed it. I hope that my review was helpful and I hope you decide that based on the information I expressed. Thank you and enjoy!    \\n",

It is not the best anime out there, as my score of a 7 will reflect, but it does have its own unique qualitys. I believe that the concept of the setting was pretty good. Yes, we have all seen an anime where there are different classes sectioned off in a school whether it be for a different learning speed or for just different grade levels. But they also include that wherever your class is ranked dictates what items, and quality of said items, will be in your classroom. To me andthe \"former members of class F\" this was a big deal. And not only were they going to gripe about it in their class room, they would act on it! They were able to do something about it because  they weren't all stupid or mentally challenged. And how?? FIGHTING PEOPLE IN BATTLES!!\\n\\n\r\nYou have to realize that this was a creative anime that, in the end, was able to express certain morale values. If you watched this and only saw nosebleeds and people getting hurt for comedy, ten you honestly missed the point of the anime and should re-watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing really quick is that the title should not be the deciding factor for if you watch an anime or not, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a title that I cannot read, I did later look up what it meant and it did not change my opinion on how I valued this anime. Pretty sure it shouldn't change yours.",

Students getting their little avatars to fight . Don't get the wrong idea like I did though. It's nothing dangerous , or full of action or anything . It's purely kawaii and funny. But the story doesn't concentrate on the fights that much. It concentrates on fun . \r\nThe art is super cute. Nothing else to add. \r\nThe music is a perfect match for this anime . Nothing I would change. \r\nI loved every single character. Ido have my favourites , but that doesn't matter. We've got a cute Tsundere , a cute Yandere (well , I wouldn't say she's really Yandere , just a bit ) , a cute pervert , a cute idiot , another cute idiot (but this one's smart) , a totally friggin' awesome character who even gets he's own gender and some others. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing you can't enjoy . It's as simple as that. I can't complain about anything . It's my type of anime .  \\n\\n\r\nThis is what I call comedy . Something you can laugh about , without any disgusting things , and you can love it to the maximum . A must watch for any person who doesn't hate fun .  \\n\r\nThat's all for me (not really , but I'm not gonna keep you reading for hours ) . Hope you found my crazy fangirl review helpful .",

            "content": "Like a lot of things I really enjoy, I find it hard to construe exactly why I like Baka to Test so much. Perhaps its the way that the anime just goes completely overboard with the comedy, or how completely outrageous and obviously parodic some plots and scenarios are. Perhaps its the way that the show actually makes be believe and sympathise with such insane characters. I'm writing this review to see if I can actually find out what it is.\r\nAs a basis, calling Baka to Test a school romcom would be a good start. However, I'm not really sure if Fuzuki academy can bedescribed as a school. And I'm not sure if its correct to call it a romcom when the romance/comedy ratio in season 1 is so crushingly in favor of the comedy. Maybe its time to get started on the review.\\n\\n\r\n-Story (6)\\n\r\nWhen I actually try to summarize it, it just sounds so absurdly stupid to call it a story rather than a completely random clash of unrelated events. However, upon watching it, it is easy to follow and the way that the story completely devotes itself to comedy (and a parody) is actually somewhat refreshing. This isn't a comedy set in a school context, it's a comedy set in a comedic context. Although its hard to say that the story is actually good, I think the nature of the story partially explains why I found this anime so much funnier than similar school romcoms.\\n\r\nAs for plots/ developements/ arcs - there isn't really much. Some episodes come in pairs, but apart from that you can pretty much watch them in whatever order you like and see little to no difference.\\n\r\nOne thing to point out is that although its just a comedy, you do need to pay attention to what's going on as the anime can feel very fast paced at times. It may even be worth watching the dub for this reason (I will return to this).\\n\\n\r\n-Art (10)\\n\r\nMaybe it's just a basal connotation, but I really enjoyed the art style. I think the ridiculous over-the-top images, along with the contrasting \"summoned beasts\" and occasional snap scene changes to Aki's back breaking (for example) is just brilliantly done to cater to the comedic nature of the show. I wouldn't want to change anything at all about it. Perhaps the animation could be smoother at times, but it looks so great that I basically don't have any issues here.\\n\r\nTo appreciate the art, (and because the show moves so fast) if you don't speak Japanese I think the dub is a serious alternative to consider here (explained next section).\\n\\n\r\n-Sound (10)\\n\r\nFirstly, the opening and ending sequences are perfect for the show, and fit in really well. The sound effects and general background is also delivered well to improve the show. \\n\\n\r\nFor once, I would seriously recommend the dubbed version of this show. Not only is the English dub surprisingly good (IMO) but not speaking Japanese I found that not having to read the subtitles during the action meant that I didn't miss as much of the show. I normally don't have this problem, but at times the sequences are quite fast and the sub version can be harder to follow.\\n\\n\r\n-Character (9)\\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how they managed character development (mostly limited to everyone except the MC (Yoshi)) but they did it somehow. The characters are really fun, interact well and are (surprisingly) relatively relateable.\\n\r\nThe reason characters doesn't get a '10' is because priority is given to parody/comedy and obviously the writers couldn't resist throwing in some genuinely stupid stuff such as Yoshi being so stupid you wonder how he gets his clothes on, and Yuuko (kinoshita) being shoe-horned into a weird trap. Not that I actually mind overall, but it does take away from what is a fairly well developed and crafted set of characters (for a comedy). \\n\r\nWhat is mainly golden here is the interaction. Particularly between Yoshi and every other male.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (10)\\n\r\nI couldn't stop myself laughing at least once or twice an episode. I also found that I wanted to follow the plot and what happened to the characters. The emphasis here is certainly on the comedy however, some scenes remain funny no matter how many times you watch them.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall (9)\\n\r\nThe only reason I've avoided the 10 here is because I feel like giving it a 10 would be saying \"this is essentially perfect\". Because Baka to test is not perfect, it's just damn funny and a great show to watch if you like comedy. I think some of the parodic elements of the show might go over some heads of less experienced anime viewers, but I don't think that would detract from the comedy (although it may cause confusion). But in terms of comedy, this anime has some special. Something that I think other great shows, such as School Rumble, and Hayate lack. Certainly a must-watch for anyone who enjoys crude humor.",

            "content": "Baka and Test was my very first anime, the anime that got me into the medium, so I have a lot of gratitude towards it.  I watched it again recently just to see if it really was as great as I remembered. To be blunt, it isn't. After watching a lot more anime, re watching Baka and Test revealed that it wasn't really anything special. So, a seven is what I believe it deserves. I would say that it was certainly good, but nothing beyond that. The story is original as far as I can tell, but it plays very little role in theanime, even for a comedy. I believe that the jokes and humor should have revolved more around the entertaining situation with the plot, and a little less around teenage drama. The show could have had more potential if the humor was a little bit more original in this way, and the plot felt more significant than the skeleton to hold all of the characters together. On the note of characters, they may be one of the downfalls of the anime. I only found Yuuji to be interesting or unique, seeming to have a less predictable character compared to other anime. Other than him, the whole cast is just bland, Th lead is the classic idiot with good heart, the love interest with pink hair who is very sweet, the tsundere tom-boyish foreign girl, the pervert, and so on. Overall the anime was, without a doubt, very funny and VERY entertaining. What I am getting at here is that you shouldn't expect anything particularly revolutionary from this anime. Good and funny, but not exactly something that stands out..",

It didn't go one episode without me laughing, honestly.\r\nThe story is about a guy called Akihisa Yoshii and his classmates. The academy he goes to divides classes into groups depending on their test results. Class A has a very luxurious classroom, while class F has the worst. Aikihisa is in class F.\r\nThe classes can summon fantasy creatures and fight to get upgraded to better classrooms, and Akihisa is determined to not stay in the lowest standard classroom anymore.\r\nEnough of explaining the storynow, I think you get it. What I want to say is that this anime was really enjoyable and I loved the jokes and the humor in it. I think the humor is a bit silly though, but if you don't mind silly humor, I'm sure you'll like Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu. Please give it a try! It's the funniest anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Baka and Test is not exactly unique, but it doe  what it does well. Basically, its a high school anime covered in so many anime cliches to the point that the cliche boat as long since sailed then returned to port for the purpose of crashing into it and sinking every boat in the nearby area. It absolutely revels in the ridiculous and overdoing cliches. And it does that VERY well.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story is not so good. While the show is very much about overloading you with insanity, it doesn't really have the time during that to actually make a interesting plot suchas The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat did. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nWe got an extremely shoujo feeling art style with tons of bright colours, especially pink, as well as the dotted shadows effect which has gone mad and often used solely on light sources instead. This is really great to look at and seemingly enhances the insanity. Animation quality is nothing impressive, but rarely feels bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nFirstly, since I don't speak Japanese, I have no idea on the quality of Japanese voice acting (and neither should you if you don't speak Japanese). The music is wonderful tho, even if a comedy anime doesn't really have room for the truly epic tracks of some anime. The opening and closing fit perfectly for the ridiculousness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 \\n\r\nEvery character is an over the top cliche. From the tsundere to the quiet achiever girl (which obviously are the love interests...obviously) to the idiot protagonist to the pervert (which while I doubt the accuracy of, my sub group refuses to refer to him as anything but Ninja Pervert), the characters end up coming off as charming and hilarious, but hardly well developed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is to simply put it, batshit fucking hilarious, and an absolute pleasure to watch. At first it seems like the kind of anime that will get old fast, but such thoughts will disappear immediately once some of the real brilliance comes up, especially Ninja Pervert, who somehow managed to feel freshly genius in his comedy when even bloody Infinite Stratos was making similar jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is a must watch if you just want a laugh, or you need to be cheered up. If it can turn me from a blubbering mess over a break up into my normal self for a significantly long time afterwards, then its a damn good comedy anime.",

Well, I might as well as share my personal preferences about why I like this anime. \r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story isn't really very reliable. It gets switched out one and another and does not have any consistent plot. However, you will soon realize that the story of this anime isn't the big deal of this anime. I am not sure mykind is one of the minority, because I don't really check most of other people's preferences. Every episode has its own inconsistent story and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is fine as it is, I guess we do watch lots of anime and know basically how arts of anime are kindled of. There are moments when you will enjoy the exaggeration of funny and humorous parts of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is fine. It doesn't require much epic music to portray the moments as this is just a comedy anime. I would really say Hiroyuki Sawano-like's music doesn't fit here, it would be total exacerbation and turn off the viewers. As far as I have watched this anime, you'll just swing along with the background sound as it affects this anime and realize it has a good atmospheric sound effect that impacts well on most of the ludicrous moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nAll of the characters are idiotically funny to laugh at. Most of the characters have interesting ways to blend into the comedic story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nIf enjoyment is an issue to be worried about, then you are rest assured. I am sure the enjoyment of an anime is mostly rated by an individual, like me, obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nI am not usually the kind to criticize something with the less humble language. It's too humorous and entertaining to be put into words. Why not bother to try it out yourself?",

In a sense, it's really refreshing and relievingto watch. Looking closer you might actually find the side characters to have a surprising amount of depth.",

            "content": "Well, this anime was good (ish). It depends on your type of humor when watching Baka to Test, whether you'll like it or not. For me, it fit my type of comedy well with class F having the most retarded and random scenes with nosebleeds left and right. If random without a true plot is your cup of tea, then you have come to the right place. If not, then I suggest trying \r\nBaka to Test anyway because overall there are no discrepancies, it's just that there's really no great objective for the anime.\r\nI give the story a 7/10, not bad but not great either.This is because the problems that come up in the anime are usually not very logical, nor are they really essential to the story. Other than the way the problems are brought up, overall I think that the story could be a 9 or an 8.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, 6/10. This is an okay art style that I don't dislike, I'm not picky with art styles so it gets a fair for the style.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I think it deserves a 7/10. The sound isn't spectacular, but I like the op for the anime which is really smooth and catchy. The voicing for the characters are also very good with the VAs being really emotional when doing their lines, which is the main reason why the sound gets a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNext are the characters. I give it the lowest score in this review at a 5/10. My reasoning for this is because the characters seem very cliched compared to what I have seen, with the pervert, oblivious main character and girls swarming over the main character for no real reason.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is my enjoyment. Did I like it? Sure I did. It was entertaining from start to finish and can't wait till I have the time to watch the second and third season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my overall verdict is to only watch it if you want to. If random, idiotic comedy is something you want to try, go ahead and watch it because I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed.",

That show is by no means only about high school students fighting each other. Nor does it have any deep meanings or dramatic moments; it\u2019s just plain comedy. But that is exactlywhat it\u2019s good at. This anime lives from its hilarious characters and at this point it\u2019s so good that I even dare to compare it to classics like School Rumble.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was charming and it was fun to watch, so anyone who hasn't had the chance to watch it yet, I'd definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Baka and Test is an anime I really wanted to like. It seemed like an interesting idea, although unoriginal, when I first heard of the series. Unfortunately, what I got was a very boring and bland anime that wasn't very interesting at all. \r\nPROS\r\nThe intro to this anime was absolutely amazing. It is very catchy and fast-paced, thus, making the viewer very interested in watching each episode (whether they are bad or good). It never gets old or boring, unlike a lot of the other stuff in this anime. I don't think I've been entranced by an intro this much since Lucky Star. I lovedit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime is another thing to applaud. Each episode is very beautiful to look at. Anyone of the images in Baka and Test could be used in an art gallery to show the power of anime, visually. \\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nI have a ton of problems with this series, but I guess I'll start with the characters. Every single person in this anime is uninteresting. I didn't care about the goals of any of them. The so-called \"villains\" were your usual generic bad guys. Nothing new or interesting to see. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the storyline itself. Baka and Test is pretty much Yu-Gi-Oh, but taking place in a school The attack system, which was in Yu-Gi-Oh, is replaced by history, math, and English problems. So, it's basically trying to make school look cool by combining elements of Yu-Gi-Oh with school life. I don't want to accuse the show of ripping Yu-Gi-Oh off because it could be a coincidence, but I was very upset to see this. The parts of the anime that took place away from the battlefield were very boring. I actually started to daydream many times while watching this anime, which is NEVER a good sign for anything. \\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test is completely empty of laughs. This probably contributed to myself daydreaming during many episodes. Many characters tried to do certain things that were supposed to be funny, but never were. It's hard to find humor in a show that is so empty of any emotion from the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the fan service got on my nerves by the midpoint of the series. Look, there's nothing wrong with having fan service as long as you have an engaging show. That's the reason why Highschool of the Dead was able to get away with it - it was very entertaining. Baka and Test is a boring show that has fan service. Imagine that - watching a show that is devoid of any emotional response from the viewer and shows tons of female's \"upper parts.\" When shown, these female parts are not done in the nude, but they still are quite distracting. I am surprised that HOTD is the anime most people name when talking about fan service. For me, Baka and Test takes the cake. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test is great, technically. In all other categories, it fails. I can't really recommend this anime to anyone, unless you are a straight A student who loves school and ponder about Yu-Gi-Oh coming into reality. It's a pretty poor anime with almost no redeeming factors. A huge waste of time.",

If you'd like some more info wiki's got what you want ;).\r\nImagine going to school and your grades determined how well you were treated? Makes sense right the people that dont care about school and doing well dont get alot of attention and equipment. On the other hand studentswith good grades get whatever they need to further their education. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot. Baka i mean yoshi is an f student and is the most special person in the whole school . . . by special i mean speeeeeecial. He gets it in his head that the whole equality of the school was unbalanced and unfair so with the rest of class f decide to go for class A equipment. How? ST war! its a system where students fight with little chibi avatars that are based off there last test score. The victors can take equipment and privileges from the losing side. \\n\\n\r\nThe good. The art was beautiful and worked so well with the comedy style. Animation was crisp no problems there. \\n\r\nThe characters are what you look forward to the most in this anime the banter between friends and enemies and teachers and.  . .  idiots is one of my favorite times. \\n\r\nThe comedy . . . i'll tell you right now its not the kind of comedy you find in yacht clubs or a golf club where everyone's saying things like jolly good joke or hmmmnn n'yes turkeys gobble gobble n'yes. Its light comedy that you have probably seen before but it's well planned to try and keep you smiling. It succeeded in my opinion and thats why its a positive and an important one, this being a comedy and all. . . \\n\\n\r\nTheres faults like the music wasn't that memorable (didnt bother me but i forget. . .)\\n\r\nOnly 2 seasons. . . so far.\\n\r\nI could think about some more faults but faults really vary between preference, so if doi comedy isn't your thing than the title should have scared you away by now, but if you got some space in your heart for some warm comedy with a side of pervert then Baka and Test dude.\\n\\n\r\nDo i recommend this? I recommend this to comedy lovers who like to laugh but if your holding a tea cup and your looking for something more \"sophisticated\" then read the title one more time and think on it for a minute. .. Baka . . .  and test . . . hmmmn\\n\\n\r\nI rate this Badass. . . honestly id say its quality viewing or an 8 but my enjoyment of this series was defs a 9. . . So i dub this a Badass anime worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "MCSnapTurtle's Anime Reviews #1 : Baka To Test To Shoukanjuu\r\nSPOILER FREE\r\nBaka To Test To Shoukanjuu simply put, is a Comedy Anime, it has likable characters, and a decent story, however there is not much character development. The anime is very lighthearted and was very enjoyable for myself.\r\nSTORY- Baka To Test's story may seem simple at first as they are only trying to get the best classroom. They declare war on other classes and if they win, they switch classes with them. However there are a lot of other things that happened (ie. Side Stories). I feel the story is unique and original as i havenever seen something with the same story line.\\n\r\nOverall, the story was quite enjoyable and well made. 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSTORY ELEMENTS- This anime is classified as a comedy-romance, however the amount of romance isn't enough in my opinion as the MC is oblivious to the fact that both of the female leads like him.\\n\r\nHowever the comedy portion of the anime is amazing. There's lot's of comedy in the anime. \\n\r\nROMANCE SCORE 3/10\\n\r\nCOMEDY SCORE  9/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- The characters are very cliche but they do have a personality. There's the baka, our MC. There's A Tsundere, a typical nice girl, a pervert and many more, but they are still unique even though they are cliche. However, the character development is lacking, many, if not all, characters are static. \\n\r\nOverall, the characters are very good. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nART- I love this type of art style. The effects are good and the characters look great.  \\n\r\nOverall, the arty is very, very good. 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- The voice actors and background music were great. I loved the Opening theme.\\n\r\nOverall, the sound is very good. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- Overall i LOVED the anime, it may not be that great, but the comedy and characters made it very enjoyable for myself.\\n\\n\r\nI RECOMMEND THIS ANIME \\n\\n\r\nAnime Rating 7.75/10 \\n\\n\r\nHow much i enjoyed it 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw this anime, I was very intrigued by the concept of having a school where your grades equal your actual power, but after watching the first few episodes, it became apparent that the comedy aspect of the anime was the main point to me, since the main character is basically a huge retard running around having to do whatever someone tells him to do.\r\nThere is alot of character development despite the theme of the series, which makes it easier to relate to the people if you are in highschool, and helps you understand the characters better. There are sometimes in the animewhere you are left thinking \"What the hell is wrong with this?\" that feeling is basically one of the better points in this anime, since the comedy aspect is much more high than the action or the main story, which is just a bunch of retards trying to get to the top. \\n\\n\r\nI actually loved the soundtrack to the anime, since the music always kept me captivated and engaged in what was happening, which was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself in the anime isnt exceptional, but was clearly animated very well in my opinion, though it wasnt the best i have seen, it was fine enough to see the surroundings.\\n\\n\r\n The Story to this isnt much of an actual storyline if you think about it. It's basically the main character running around, getting the shit beat out of him by a bunch of girls while trying to be increasingly a pervert. It's not like the whole story was absolutely terrible, but the main plot isnt carried throughout the whole series, like for the first 2 episodes it was pure story and action, while the next like 3 was basically the main character and his friends running around during school, doing nothing. The following episodes after around episode 8 is where the main plot is back, although i didnt like those episodes more than the first 2, it was at the very least entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I personally loved this anime, since it never ceased to make me laugh even when the mood is serious in the anime, its basically like you are the principal in a sense, watching these retards running around while nearly killing each other, but you really dont care out of the pure enjoyment and entertainment you get out of it, which helps lighten the mood. The entire plot is revolving around a retard, for God's sake, hes at the education level of a 3rd grader, its easier to think about what he is first while watching the anime, before you go all ballistic on what is really happening. Overall, it was pure entertainment for me, which made it so appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the whole concept and the characters, as they were all very well created, the entertainment was great and the plot was alright, but it had some flaws, such as the fact that the main character is still an utter RETARD, but it is very appealing at most times. 8/10",

I would have gave it a 9 but some of the epsiodes were like characters are just doing thier thing but then another character pops up and the whole moment is gone that feeling killed me basically. The main story was great. It is a very well done comedy I laughed hard.\r\nThe art was a 9. When the  art part comes up I think of it as the design of the characters. The animation of of the characters was amazing but just some things here andthere I though could be better. I dont want to point fingers. But I thought the extra art could have more of an effort. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (This part is my favouritr part to review) is a 9. Some of the characters like 'The Pervert' made me laugh. And then how all of the characters personalty comes together and makes the show come to life. Like the main 2 girls love the same boy. They both know about each other but they still act like best friends. And then there is an epsiode showing the past and it's about how this girl liked this boy that was a nice episode. I would have gave it a 10 but there was some characters that really got in the way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall This anime was a 8. I didnt like the endings but loved the openings. Some characters where annoying. Background art could have a bit more effort done. So anyway Its an 8 sadly. I recommend this to people who love comedy and arent picky people like me! \\n\\n\r\nRead more of my reviews please. I write reviews every now and then and if you want to recommend me an anime either PM me or request on my profile comments!\\n",

            "content": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a show about, idiots.  It's a show for idiots, and a show with a cast that is comprised of idiots, as pretty much every comedy show has.  However, the use of idiot in this show is taken to a whole new meaning which makes it more enjoyable then it should be, not that I'm complaining.  \r\nStory(8/10): The story of Baka Test as it is commonly called, is about a school that uses an avatar-based fighting system that determines power level based on test scores.  Depending on which field the people battle on, the scores willdiffer in that specific subject.  Once a power level reaches zero, a crazy guy known as \"Iron Man\" comes in and kidnaps you to take a remedial course.  With a school that is solely based on test scores, the classes ranging from A-F is ranked from high scoring students to low scoring students.  Those in the higher ranking classes get fabulous school equipment, while the lower classes get pretty much jack.  The story basically can be summed up in the F class's struggle to rise to the top, with hilarious bits and pieces of scenes in between.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10): Now, I'll only go over the F class characters since I would rather not have people read a whole page describing the sheer amount of supporting characters.  With F class being pretty much made up of idiots, every single character has a running gag that spans throughout the whole show.  First is Akihisa Yoshii.  As the \"Baka\" that the title mentions, he is...stupid.  As the lowest scoring person out of the whole group, Akihisa is a true idiot in every sense of the word and does a hilarious job at doing it.  Things like failing at simple fractions or falling for the same prank over and over again.  Kindhearted and outgoing with a mind of a child, Akihisa proves himself to probably be one of the most prominent characters in the whole series.  His gag is being completely stupid.  I surprised this guy still has a spine.  Next is Yuuji Sakamoto.  As Akihisa's best friend, Yuuji is the most cunning of the group and displays his genius with successful plans that he's not THAT big of an idiot, though he still is one.  His gag is getting poked in the eyes a lot by his childhood friend.  Next is Kouta Tsuchiya, or known by his nickname, Muttsulini.  As the natural pervert of the group, Muttsulini is always seen with his camera and trying to take pictures of girls' undersides.  As the quiet and reserved one of the group, Muttsulini doesn't show much in terms of character but always, somehow makes any scene great.  Especially when he's running his picture business.  His gag is getting horrible nosebleeds to the point that he could swim in the pool.  Next, is the...I don't know what to call it, really.  Next is Hideyoshi Kinoshita.  As the person with most common sense, Hideyoshi really just sees how stupid all these people are around it but still supports them to the best of its abilities.  I say it because, for this character's gag, Hideyoshi can almost be considered the perfect trap.  With an extremely feminine look, Hideyoshi confuses people to think that he's a girl, when it's really a guy.  It's to the point that society has created a bathroom solely for Hideyoshi's purpose.  Next is Mizuki Himeji.  As the dandere of the group, Mizuki is a quiet and softspoken girl who is Akihisa's childhood friend.  Hint Hint.  As the smartest one of the group, Mizuki is always considered as an \"ace\" and helps her class the best she can.  She looks up to Akihisa a lot and always cherishes having him around.  Her gags are comprised of her bunny clip changing its expression, her cooking that can literally kill, and her overly large chest.  Yeah.  And last is Minami Shimada.  As a Japanese transfer student who came from germany, Minami bears a tsundere quality and shows her soft side to Akihisa, sometimes.  Hint Hint.  She always draws concern for her friends and is best friends with Mizuki.  Her gags consist of her flat chest, (always a staple in anime), the bow in her ponytail having a mind of its own, and her constant physical abuse.  The tsundere way of saying, I love you.  Other characters consist of a cult that condemns any contact with a girl, death, Minami's little sister, various teachers, class A, B, C, D, and E reps, Yuuji's childhood friend, Hideyoshi's twin sister, Kubo, and Minami's stalker/lesbian \"friend\" in class D.  Now you see why I limited the character explanation.  Needless to say, there is a very vibrant class of characters here.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound(8/10): For the majority of the tracks, Baka Test has a quite limited range of music, but sounds good in its own way.  The OP and ending songs each comprise of lighthearted and just overly cute sounding music.  The art in this anime is very special as it's very bright and never dark.  In this anime, a normal and chibi form of a character can coincide together in the same scene without it being for just straight comedy.  The characters themselves are always in bright colors and the comedic scenes are just pleasing to the eye.  They also implement some manga scenes where the characters become literal sketches.  As for general animation, it's fluid and well done, possibly due to the budget saved by putting no faces on background character, and making background background characters essentially polka dotted cardboard cutouts.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment(9/10): As a personal fan of lighthearted comedy, I found this show to be extremely enjoyable because of how blunt the characters are in many of the scenes.  As fun as this was, the gags did get old sometimes because they put the same gag in, multiple times.  I felt as though the yaoi and yuri of the show was completely unnecessary, (to a certain degree), and well, I have nothing else bad to say.  With such a vibrant cast, you can't help but like at least one of them.  They're each funny in their own way and it's just enjoyable to watch.  If I was to make a ship, since there are just a HUGE amount of possible ones to choose from, I would choose either the MinamixAkihisa ship or the YuujixShouko ship because, really, these would be the most hilarious things to see come out of this show.",

            "content": "Baka and Test is a show that centers it's comedy around the characters and the situations they find themselves in, rather than the story.  In this series, the story takes a backseat to the characters, which allows the full potential of the characters to shine, resulting in arguably one of the funniest anime ever.\r\nThe premise of the show is centered around an academy that uses \"avatars\" of it's students (essentially data derived from their academic scores and given form) to fight against the other classes in the school in order to receive their classroom equipment.  When a lower-ranked class defeats a higher-ranked class,they exchange equipment.  That is basically as deep as the story gets, but the character progression/backstories explores much further in spite of this, especially in season 2, allowing the viewer to become very attached to each character.\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is non-stop, and often I found myself rewinding just to watch the parts that I missed because I was laughing too hard to follow it.  The re-watch value of the show is also outstanding, when I watched it a 2nd, and even a 3rd time, I found the situations even funnier because I had a better understanding of the characters.\\n\r\nThe art is unique and I think that's the main reason I gave it a 9. It isn't phenomenal artwork that will make you think \"that's beautiful\" at any point, but it fits the story/characters perfectly, and I don't think it could have been done any better.\\n\r\nThe sound is also very good, but I gave it a 10 because this show has some of the best english dubbing I've ever encountered.  Nothing is more frustrating than finding a good show that has horrible dubbing, and Baka and test doesn't disappoint in that regard. \\n\r\nOverall, I give this show a moderately biased score of 10/10, simply because of the amount of enjoyment I got and continue to get from it.  Highly recommended for any anime/comedy fan.\\n",

            "content": "A tale of oblivious idiots, competitive schools, and monster fights, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Baka and Test) was a show recommended to me through a friend that found it hilarious. It's an anime that bases itself around raw comedy, with romance aspects that you either need to look carefully for or are thrown straight in your face. However, if you're looking for something driven by its characters in story, turn back now, because Baka and Test is anything but that.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nBaka and Test tells the story of Yoshii Akihisa, a dense and relatively unintelligent boy who is very lacking in the academics department. Whiletaking his placement test, a girl near him faints, and he gets out of his seat to see if she's okay. However, that violated the rule of \"no leaving your seat\", and his exam was thus scored zero. This resulted in him being placed in Class F, the lowest rung of the academy's ladder, along with the other misfit toys and failures that couldn't make the cut. However, the girl who fainted, Mizuki Himeji, was also pigeonholed into Class F because she technically left her seat and was unable to finish the exam. What makes this significant is that Mizuki Himeji is easily the second-smartest student at the academy, and would have been the pride of Class A had she not lost consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nAt this academy, things work differently than a normal high school. Classes can challenge each other to \"avatar battles\" by summoning a small chibi version of themselves, with their strengths and weaknesses based around their most recent scores on tests in a particular subject. With this in mind, Class F's representative, Yuuji Sakamoto, saw an opening. Class F had a powerful weapon in Mizuki Himeji, and he rallied Class F to challenge the other classes and make it all the way to the top, claiming the luxurious Class A for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test's story, while simple, doesn't quite stick to the plot as closely as would be ideal. A lot of what happens is purely for comedic benefit, and some of the anime's events hardly tie into the main storyline at all. For a show of a different genre, this would be a practical death sentence, but Baka and Test focuses on idiotic comedy. And an idiotic comedy's story does not need to be especially good to accomplish its goals, although it would surely help. That said, the premise is interesting but silly, and it sticks to the basic idea enough for a comedy anime, so it's not bad - in fact, it's above-average for comedy shows.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth, but not especially notable, and the colorful art style is an eye-catcher, but it also doesn't stand out. It's okay, I guess, but not great by any means.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNone of the soundtrack seems out of place for a whimsical anime like Baka and Test. Everything fits into its ideal place, but the soundtrack isn't great. It's passable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had little to no development, but in an anime that is not plot-driven, that's not important. What is important is the depth of the characters, and that they are. The main characters are pretty well fleshed-out, and even a number of side characters do well in that regard as well. Even though you have your traditional roles (boke and tsukkomi in Akihisa and Minami, busty ditz in Mizuki, quiet plotter in Yuuji), they go further beyond that and add additional quirks and qualities that make the characters much easier to become attached to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't come into this expecting the dramatic story of a boy struggling to achieve in high school, I came into it to laugh at immature and silly humor, and that's what I got. Unless you're the kind of person who isn't amused easily (in which case I pity you), Baka and Test does that exceptionally well. It's hard not to crack a smile or two when watching an episode here, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of comedy-style anime tend to fall short with humor in the wrong places and poor character depth. Some even resort to just throwing out immature sex jokes (Seitokai Yakuindomo, I'm looking at you). However, Baka and Test is a great example of a comedy done well. Even though it doesn't have a captivating storyline that hooks a viewer, a beautiful art style, or an exceptional soundtrack, it's still quite enjoyable to watch.\\n",

            "content": "Ahhh yes, a comedy anime a cast of characters who are basically all idiots in a good way of course. This has to be my favorite comedy anime, it's pure comedy I swear.\r\nThe story is about a school, but is no ordinary school. In fact, students placed in classes, A being the highest and F being the obvious worst. That's not all, students can legally fight using avatars, depending on your scores, your avatar can get strong if you study a lot. Unfortunatly the main character Akihisa Yoshii gets put in class F due to his stupidity, in fact, our fellow characters are in classF with some being in other classes.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get started with the characters. My favorite character is obviously Kouta Tsuchiya, aKa ninja pervert, yes no joke, he's best boy. He's just hilarious and adorable, plus he takes actual panty shots and sells them, like hell, he needs to win a fucking Oscar for his photographs. I love the main protagonist, Aki, he's really a huge idiot in a good way, he has a admirable personality which is difficult to hate. Then we have Hideyoshi, a dude who claims himself to be male even tho he has a femine appearance. Lastly Yuuji, a idiot but he is amazing when it comes to making plans and win, he's a fantastic character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one character that I dislike, which is Himeji. She's honestly trying her best being the next Yuno Gasai. She loves Aki, Aki likes her back tho, what a shame. Plus, her cooking is deadly, no joke. Her cooking even almost killed all her male friends, even Aki.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I admire about this anime are the fucking battle scenes between avatars, they are epic, no joke. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are depressed and trying to find a anime to make you laugh, then Baka to Test is the perfect choice. \\n\\n\r\n(I can litterally write a whole paragraph why Kouta is best boy :'))",

            "content": "Baka to Test (or Idiot Test in the ENG version) is an anime that is pretty notable for an early 2010's anime filled with jokes and stupidity. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story takes place in a High School where students are placed into a caste system based on their grades where the A students get luxurious classrooms while the F students get cardboard boxes or writing boards for desks. On top of that, students have these Avatars that have various HP levels based on their grades. The anime follows a boy named Akihisa Yoshii, who is the \"baka\" of the show and his group of friends tryingto survive both classes and the battles that take place in the school. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty nice and pleasing, although the intro video is a bit too crazy and fast for my taste (Up to the point where I just have to skip it since it bothers me). The characters are pretty well designed, although their heights are actually shorter than what I imagined. There's also some fanservice, but it wasn't enough fanservice that made me groan or cringe, but rather laugh at it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP is really catchy, having a cheerful and upbeat tune that pretty much sets up the tone of the show, and the ED serves to show how stupid the main character is. Overall, the sound in the episodes were alright to me, but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the characters in this anime, considering they were all pretty much idiots in their own way. Akihisa is is baka of the anime, having the worst grades of the entire school, as well as being oblivious to things around him (mainly in terms of romance), but he is a nice guy, giving support to his friends. Mizuki is one of the females of the group who is very beautiful, kind, caring and intelligent (Her presence in Class F is explained in the 1st Episode), but she is horrible with cooking to the point she kills anyone that eats her food. Minami is the Tsundere of the series, where she mainly beats up Akihisa, but she does see him as a friend, as well as she's nice to everyone in the group. Yuji is the best friend of Akihisa who's calm, cool, and collected. Kota is the pervert of the group, constantly trying to take lewd photos of every girl he encounters. Finally, Hideyoshi is the feminine-looking guy who's levelheaded to the group, but is constantly mistaken for being a girl. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nThis anime was filled with comedic scenes and slapstick comedy that made me laugh and smile along the way. I enjoyed the moments where Minami and Mizuki tried to make romantic advances towards Akihisa, only to be shut down by his oblivious stupidity, as well as the interactions each of the characters have with each other. The thing I enjoyed the most was the little avatar fights which made me wish that those type of battles exist in real life. Pretty much every episode had me hooked and smiling at every scene that occurred. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you want a silly anime that can make you smile, giggle or laugh, I recommend this anime. Although the humor is not for everyone, I think it's an anime that many people can enjoy and the story with it is pretty nice considering the setting that it takes place in. If you're a person who's looking into comedy anime, I recommend this one, as well as the 2nd season of it.",

            "content": "Well From this anime we will start from its content. Its a rom-com, which means this show is mainly a Comedy other than Romance. Just to clarify things . *Sniff Sniff* \"Disappointment intensifies\"\r\nThis Show contains countless of ideas and manages to utilize most of them in a pretty average degree. Such as : Cross Dressing,Comical Gayness for all genres,Comical and not Fan Service, Nudity,Lewdness,Romance,Tsundere,DereDere,Kuudere,MC abuse, etc etc. In general it is aim for a variety of viewers!! \r\nIts Comedy its pretty decent but imo it was mostly Hit or Miss. Either it would be an epic moment or a miserable retarded one! Casual School settingand not anything intriguing for its super powers factor. . .\\n\r\nIts Plot and story its pretty shallow but its well made and its pretty easy to follow.It really predictable but all its actions are clever made and orchestrated whatsoever .In other, words its a pretty relaxing and there is no need to think much of it.\\n\r\nIts Characters are superficial and plain. Not much in them. I wouldn't call them unique but on the contrary completely cliche ones.But some are fun!\\n\r\nSounds the OP wasn't to my liking due to the difference of its meaning and the shows meaning. The 1 ED was really beautiful while the 2 ED was mediocre but not worst than the OP.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Mistakes and Personal opinion~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs i said above,this show contain many ideas which lead to aim for many viewers. But that backfires since most of the ideas are disturbing and Fetish oriented,making the show easier to hate from ones points of view. IT contains more that 20+ Meaningless and aimless references to other shows and because of its poor use i can only perceive this as rip off and cheap tricks for attention.The Show uses its own catchphrase \"Baka\" way too stupidly. (that's a sin) Its Comedy was mostly retarded,stupid and aimed for edgy kids.The fact that the boys will always go crazy after the one boy who is crossdressing and not give a fuck about the girl who has 'Pink hair and boobs' Aka the Classic Female Lead (in ecchi shows especially) . That form of irony is never as smart and funny as writers and producers think it was...Overall,you will facepalm a lot in a bad way+really disappointing ending!!... And lastly, Characters have a perma blush disorder. \\n\\n\r\nFrom my point of view, its a show full of Fan Service, edgy comedy (mostly cringe) and a pretty relaxing one whatsoever. Got any type of character you might wanna see but don't expect anything beyond mediocre. I would recommend it if you like comedies and you are not here for the romance.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-So many miserable attempts to make references its funny only seeing and understanding them!\\n\r\n-Has a best Girl ! Any kind of best girl you might search for!\\n\r\n-Has its golden moments despite the fact its cringe. You will definitely laugh at some point!\\n\r\n-It has a guy called \"Pervert Ninja\",Racist genre bending jokes and also it has a scene of one girl poking someones eyes. They funny part is that you will feel the same pain only by watching the show. If it isn't that TOP TIER IRONY i don't know what it is!!",

            "content": "This anime is totally fine so long as you understand it's more cartoon than story. There's not a lot to it except its comedy so that's what i'll focus on critqueing.\r\nThere are multiple genres to comedy, neither kind necessarily being more superior than the next since it largely involves personal taste as to which type one prefers over another (if at all). This show incorporates many basic types such as slap stick, but it also utilises Spoof comedy, more colloquially recognised as satire or parody, something often used as a method of social commentary; questioning the standards of any given status quo. Parody is muchmore complex in its subtleties and can be argued to be the more intellectual or clever of the comedic genres. But that's ultimately neither here nor there, but does serve as a rule with which we can use to measure its depth and execution. It's far less self-explanatory than the purely visual style of gags we see.\\n\\n\r\nThe intellectual essence at the heart of satire and parody drives infamous shows like One Punch Man into being greater than the sum of its parts as many elements would be unacceptable anywhere else outside of it. This is ultimately the meta and point of parody, making fun of standards we accept that may not really be acceptable standards if we think more deeply on it. But why am i going so far as to lay the groundwork behind comedy and its execution?\\n\\n\r\nWell, because it's hard to tell what this show is trying to achieve as consuming certain types of humour requires a certain frame of mind or suspension of belief for us to drop our normal mental guards so that the comedy can work. Context matters. One thing that's confusing about the show is whether it's being ironic in its abuse of anime tropes or not. At times the parody is obnoxious enough that you can tell when it's a meta joke, but other times the show relies on the very tropes it's mocking to push itself forwards, becoming a victim of its own apparent social commentary criticisms. In contrast, Saitama, protagonist of One Punch Man is a victim of the tropes portrayed, suffering along side the audience when they deal with things like hefty monologues or clich\u00e9's like timely action power up scenes. When Akihisa, the protagonist of this show, is the victim of matriarchal slapstick power plays (physically attacking a man who'd otherwise be physically stronger; and winning), a common trope in contemporary anime (as an almost exclusive way of portraying female characters as \"strong\" whilst simultaneously unironically denigrating them to the punchline of a joke), that is the sum of the joke, except that it's just more exaggerated. So it doesn't become clear whether we're laughing with the joke, or at the joke.\\n\\n\r\nIt can be argued that this show is supposed to be more light hearted due to its lack of seriousness, but the show will at times take itself too seriously and this is where the dissonance occurs and whilst it's not the end of the world, it does make for an easy criticism for how it detracts from the quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's very little to be said for the characters as they all exist as they are as a foundation for the jokes. They're not that cleverly thought out, but as previously mentioned, the necessity of criticising a trope requires some element of utilising it. The animation is... OK. But the voice acting is pretty good and rounds off the execution of the gags nicely. The inclusion of some slice of life is... distracting. Since this is the part where the show appears to take itself seriously. Not being able to tell if this element of the show is supposed to be a grain of genuine story done badly, or a parody done so badly you can't tell whether it's a joke or not causes a problem. Neither out-come being particularly favourable for the show since they're both effectively demonstrative of literary failure.\\n\\n\r\nWould i recommend this show? If you don't want to think too hard about things and enjoy \"cartoons\" then yeah, you could do worse. If you like witty parody, you're not going to find much of it here, you might even find yourself frustrated that the show unironically becomes a victim of its own gags.",

It doesn't lie to itself trying to be something it's not, and that's a great thing.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIt doesn't have a main story and that's great, because you can follow it, enjoy every single episode and go and eat a hamburguer without thinking.\r\nThere's some back story but it's not the main part of the anime, and despise that, it helpsa lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty.

            "content": "Baka and Test made me laugh harder than any other anime to date, an impressive feat given my otherwise mediocre track record with pure \u201ccomedy\u201d animes.  The show, produced by Silver Link from 2010 to 2011, spans two seasons, 26 episodes, and 2 OVAs, which are required viewing due to their role in advancing the plot in between Seasons 1 and 2.  (Side note: this review covers the entire series, not just Season 1.)  (Also, as another aside, Silver Link has proven itself over the past few years to be very solid and reliable anime studio, with other notable titles including Chivalryof a Failed Knight and the loli-licious Prisma Illya series.)\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I find Baka and Test so funny?  While I\u2019m not a huge fan of physical humor, the slapstick is some of the best and most effective I\u2019ve seen this side of Tom and Jerry (or, for a more recent example, Ed, Edd n Eddy).  The show also has a phenomenal English dub, particularly for an anime set in high school (which I\u2019ve found almost never get good dubs).  Whoever at FUNimation was in charge of localizing this show should be given a raise, not only for the crispness of dialogue but also for having such a good sense of timing.  For example, here\u2019s an exchange between main character Akihisa and his tsundere classmate/love interest/best girl Minami from Season 1, Episode 6:\\n\\n\r\nMinami: Gee Aki, you\u2019re so sweet! You don\u2019t have to hide your love behind stupid comments.\\n\r\nAkihisa: Cool! Your micro-breasts are hot!\\n\r\nMinami: And now, I gouge out your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nExcuse me while die laughing.  Also, Season 1, Episode 8\u2019s parody of Neon Genesis Evangelion is absolutely brilliant and spot-on, made even better by the fact it takes up most of the episode (really, the show nails NGE\u2019s general aesthetic and fraught emotions, making it one of the best parodies I\u2019ve seen in any show, period).     \\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test also has a fair number of sweet, emotional moments as well, especially in Season 2.  Indeed, Season 2, Episode 11\u2019s exploration of the past relationship between Akihisa\u2019s best friend Yuji and the borderline-yandere Shoko actually moved me to tears (let\u2019s just say that isn\u2019t the kind of crying I expected to be doing while watching this show).  Unlike many other comedy shows I\u2019ve seen, Baka and Test takes time to give depth and substance to its cast.  As a result, they are not only funny but also surprisingly endearing and relatable (though admittedly, Shoko\u2019s possessiveness towards Yuji as his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d/future wife can go in rather disturbing directions).    \\n\\n\r\nShould I get into the plot?  Nah, it\u2019s not really that important.  While the show\u2019s \u201cbattle\u201d gimmick can at times provide an interesting commentary about the over-reliance on grades as indicators of intelligence and future success, this gimmick mostly serves as a foundation on which to maneuver the characters toward humorous interactions with each other.  However, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the character Hideyoshi somewhere in this review.  Boys are boys, girls are girls, and Hideyoshi is Hideyoshi, regardless of his/hers/its protestations to the contrary.    \\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test does have some problems.  Certain jokes are overplayed, especially moe-blob Mizuki\u2019s cooking incompetence (as well as her obliviousness to this fact), though her food being used by the other characters as a biological weapon did result in some pretty funny moments.  Also, there\u2019s a three-episode \u201ctraining camp\u201d arc during Season 2 that drags on for way too long (it didn\u2019t help that the main premise\u2014trying to sneak a peek into the girls changing room\u2014wasn\u2019t that funny to begin with).  Finally, while Season 2\u2019s ending is okay, it would have been nice to end the series on something more definitive or \u201cfinal,\u201d particularly since it\u2019s going on five years and there\u2019s still no word on whether there will be a Season 3.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Baka and Test earns an 8/10 from me.  It\u2019s a stupid yet fun show, and while certain elements don\u2019t work it has a lot of heart and is in general an enjoyable watch.",

The only parameter was attack power. There is something fishy.\r\nThe second episode was quite enjoyable, but the show started  to reveal the nature,  turned out that the subtitle \"summon the beast\" was  a bait to lure audience.  It's a slice of life anime,  the beasts started to  appearoccassionally.  The summoned beasts  didn't appear  in most of the episodes, sometimes their appearence only last less than 2 minutes.\\n\r\nAnd hey what the heck with the emotional outburst, it as if  anything can be solved by just crying your heart out\\n\r\nMy first impression of Reiji was he was  a wise guy.  but  late in  the series it  turned out that he was a good strategist.Don't underestimate this guy But i don't like the way he let himself being hit and humiliated by a girl.\\n\r\nJust like other lead in hundreds harem anime out there, akihisa lacks any reedeming quality.   \\n\r\nAt first  Matsuri and hideyoshi were funny,  but  then it was the same repetitive jokes",

            "content": "Man, I wish this anime was more popular!\r\nIn my opinion, this show is just an anime that makes fun of other anime. You have your classic character designations: the idiot, the cool type, the perv, the equally perverted female, the trap character (trust me on this one), the brainiac ditz, the tsundere, the stalker, the aggressive lesbian, the incestuous sister, the gay admirer, the yaoi fangirl, and the list goes on. The plot is very simple: a high school is segregated into classes based on academic ability and classes can do \"battle\" using an \"avatar\" system based off academic proficiency. The goal is to havethe best school equipment, which naturally belongs to the best students. However, don't expect this plot to just flow. It doesn't, not does it have. Just sit back and enjoy the shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime through Funimation's English dub. I find that the dub is very well done with a cast of voice actors that filled each character perfectly. The script translation is excellent. I have also watched episode 1 and 2 as well as the shorts in Japanese, and the damn near perfectness from Japanese to English is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not serious at all and it easily to diverts from the plot. That doesn't matter. It's a classic underdog story where the idiot students try to prove that academics don't matter by outdoing the smarty pants. Sure, there are overdone parts and I want to smack some characters at times. However, I love them all. They also REALLY want you to fall for the trap. The art style is very unique and the animation is very well done. If you are well versed in anime and video games, you can easily spot references to other media like Metal Gear Solid and Evangelion as well as character likenesses to D.Gray-man and Vocaloid.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the first 12 episodes, I want more. I have waited patiently and I believe that season 2 dubbed will be out later this year. I urge you all to want more too. This is unquestionably the funniest anime I have ever seen and I highly recommend it Japanese or English. Trust me on this one.",

When i watched this I started at 10pm and couldnt stop till I finally noticed that the sun was rising at 5:30am. \r\nThis is one of those animes that you wanna keep at it till its over. With the story line been based in schools and classes which are some of my favourite animes. \r\nWith the comedy most people find it quite difficult to add action into it without disturbing the flow of the anime,but they have perfected it, in fact its more or less keeping it at a steady pace. \\n\\n\r\nThe action just slides on in and it doesnt just change suddenly like you expect, since i dont want to spoil anything its hard to give out the explanation that would sell this anime as one of the best comedy animes ive seen. \\n\\n\r\nI couldnt stop laughing it was great how the class is like and the great mix of romance added into the action and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is a SPOILER so either stop reading or close your eyes!\\n\\n\r\nWhen the main protagonist whom im referring as probationary student gets lunches from the 2 girls in the class and the \"Inquisition\" come in and give him the 'death penalty' oh god cant stop laughing even thinking about it is making me laugh, as he gets punished for the actions of the girls who like him HAHA!! \\n\\n\\n\r\nWell if you stopped reading my bad luck well, i recommend this anime to anyone who loves a good laugh and likes a story that is unlike any others. Its got a good amount of action with a dash of romance. \\n\\n\r\nIts a great anime. If you dont watch this anime than there is something seriously wrong with you, its one for all ages.

Basically, Fumizuki Academy is a school utilizing some impressive technology that separates the students into classes based on their entrance exam scores. Class A are mostly the cream of the crop students that get a really nice room while Class F gets crummy supplies. You can getthe supplies of other classes if you beat them in a summoner test war, using virtual avatars, or shoukanjuu. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the visual effects were great, from the silly nosebleeds to the adorably sketched characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound wasn't spectacular nor terrible to me. I rated it a 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I liked the characters. Sure, they could perfectly fit certain stereotypes, but I easily fell in love with them. I don't know if it's because I'm an easily infatuated teenage girl or if they really are that amiable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Albeit the idiocy of this show, I absolutely fell in love with it right from the pilot. I have a short attention span and am a fan of slapstick humor and the sort, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu has that.\\n\r\nOkay, I can definitely see how some purists would find this to be a poor anime with over the top stupidity, but it's perfect to an audience of slightly perverted teenagers with short attention spans who would enjoy something like this. It's kind of a love or hate anime program. I'm one of the people who loves.",

BUT: I have never laughed so much to any anime or any other medium that I can remember. ever.  The MC falls for the same tricks repeatedly but his reactions are priceless, the love-triangle in the story is entertaining and hilarious and not the regular forced drama one might expect from ananime like this. but at it's heart, I love Bakatest for how goddam funny it was, how uncontrollably it made me laugh, the central theme of the lower, less advantaged rising up and proving their worth and finally, the ending song is one of my favorite of any anime I've seen.",

You want fighting? Plenty of action. Enjoy blurring out the gender barrier? This is for you. \r\nStory itself was interesting enough to keep me around for a few episodes. A few episodes, apparently, was enough for me to finish the entire season. Why the entire season? The episodes tend to start off from where they ended, which I absolutely respect. It's a difficult thing to keep transitions smooth throughout episodes, and evenmore difficult to make it sound credible and believable. It's tempting to start an entirely new story, and leave the previous ending either unresolved or up to the viewer's discretion. \\n\\n\r\nArt was the mix of typical moe/chibi/kawaii. But, it also included some terrifyingly realistic pictures that I could so relate to. In this case, it worked in managing to keep the entire premise of the anime intact and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nWere there some slow moments? Sure. But it didn't take away from the general focus of the plot. \\n\r\nAlso, this first season of Baka to Test alone could have emptied out all of the blood transfuse bags in a hundred hospitals, and still have room for more. Cliche? Yeah. Over-exaggerated? Sure. But it worked.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters may be unappealing and strange, but many of the characters will stick with you to the very end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It looks delicious but it's taste is deadly. Pretty different then the other anime which the food looks like a purple/green/blue blob with weird smoke coming off it.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to anime fans, since it's definitely worth to watch it.",

It goes well, but isn't remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7\\n\\n\r\nAll the clich\u00e9s are here. \\n\r\nBaka, Moe, Tsundere, Yandere, Loli, Yuri, Yaoi, Oversized and Flat chest, Nosebleed and Onee-sama.\\n\r\nAnd i surely forget some.\\n\r\nThis random mix of all these character gives an unique mood to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's very rare for me to laugh when watching an anime, but i just couldn't resist. There is always at least a totally awesome sentence, so stupid that i was forced to facepalm !\\n\r\nThis show is one of the most enjoying one that I've ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich gives an overall rating of 8 !\\n\\n\r\nI hope you'll this review.\\n\\n\r\nPS : Please post some comments, i need advice to improve my review.

            "content": "This is the most hilarious anime I've ever watched and its rewatchable score is 9/10\r\nNOTE: This review will include the second season and will add the points to this review.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n The story isn't that special. It's generic. So There's different types of classes. Classes with A students, B Students, C Students, D Students and so on, the students are judged by a test that will decide which class they'll start next school year. \r\nThe story is following a group of F students. There are no actual deep plot or storytelling but solving mysteries and....a bunch of hilarious moments, like I mean there's ALOTOF funny moments that are different from any other comedy movie/anime I've watched. \\n\\n\r\nBut keep in note that this is the first season and it's a build up to second season (which has some backstory to characters and romance)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nNothing special. It's good. I think it fits the comedy elements in this anime and they did a great job doing so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n The opening is catchy  and perfectly fits the theme of the anime. The OSTs are good because it fits the scenes and makes it more hilarious with the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n All the characters are except the girls (stereotypical, yes but this anime manage to pull it off) are idiots and you'll definitely love them, not hate them. There's romance between Yoshii and Shimada (Main Characters) so it isn't all \"full idiotic comedy moments\", there's cute moments, serious moments and 99% \"you will laugh so loud that the neighbour will knock your door\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, in the  gang, there's 2 girls 3 boys and 1 trap (boy with female appearence). \\n\\n\r\n1st girl:  Shimada, Minami     Flat-chest, foreign,shy and can't read japanese that well. Which is why she failed the test and got into F class. She was not a \"nobody\" in the beginning but when she arrived to japan for the first time and since she couldn't speak japanese and started school so fast, she didn't want to stay in japan.\\n\r\nNow that I mentioned \"nobody\", the classmates adored her and because she was not from japan, but during her introduction she misspelt something in japanese and the class laughed at her, thus made her decision that she couldn't trust anyone because they were mean to her and told the classmates to shut up (now she's a nobody)\\n\\n\r\nHowever,  the main character, Yoshii, didn't think anything bad of her. He hasn't met a foreigner before and he wanted to introduce himself to her.  But since he talked japanese in a fast pace, called her flat-chest and generally annoyed her, she couldn't keep up, was pissed and decides to break his arm but before that, Yoshii said something in french to her because he thought she was from france and that pissed her more off so she   got angry. But later she discovered those french words meant \"Want to be my friend\" and she has misinterpreted everything that Yoshii has said, she was in deep sorry and of course, fell in love with Yoshii.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2nd girl: Himeji, Mizuki         Nothing special tbh, from what I know, she is a clever girl that got sick during test thus she failed and got into F class. But she has developed some feelings for Yoshii and decides to fail the tests on purpose to stay in Class F, just to be with Yoshii and the gang.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1st boy: Yoshii, Akihisa the voice actor to this guy is what makes him the most funniest character in the anime. Our protagonist  guides us through his misadventure of slapstick comedy, in which he helps guide his class through the struggles it to get to the top, solve \"women problems\" and is unlucky that bad things occures to him everyday. He is a great guy, very friendly and brings alot of comedy but is also the king of idiot.\\n\\n\r\n2st boy:  Sakamoto, Yuuji , the 2nd king of idiot in my opinion.\\n\r\nWhen he was a boy, he was smart fifth grader but didn't care for anyone else than himself and treated everyone equally. But an event turned everything upside down and that turned him into troublesome \"bad boy\" guy and got into F class.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3st boy: Tsuchiya, Kouta , this guy is funny in his own perverty way. He also has the nickname \"the ninja pervy\" in which he uses stealth to take pictures of girls' underwear and does anything to get a sight of girl's underwear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrap boy, the last one, Kinoshita, Hideyoshi. Everyone mistakes him as a girl and the question whether he is a boy or a girl still is a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI laughed every minute in each episode and the uniqueness in the comedy, characters and comedy elements is what made me laugh more than other comedy movies I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance+comedy, mostly comedy then show this anime to everyone who wants a laugh once in a while.",

            "content": "If you were to take anime as art reflecting the real world you would figure Japanese high schools to be places full of huge breasted girls, oblivious guys who don\u2019t realize that six girls want to pork him, and you\u2019d probably get the idea that Japanese high school kids get nosebleeds upon seeing the cleavage of a woman. These are not actually true as Japanese high schools are not much better than any other high schools and the only reason anime treats high school as a place of fun, violence, tits, and more tits is because it makes high school a much more exciting placethan it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test reflects the real world almost as well as the Jersey Shore. It is in fact so opposite of the real world it is probably a mirror dimension. The high school is a place of tests, tests, and more tests. Upon entrance, you take a test that decides what class you will be in, A through F. F is of course the idiots and A is the nerds. F students have to deal with crappy wooden tables and pillows while A gets personal desks, lounge chairs, tables, a refreshment bar, and a giant ass wall of television screens. Our hero is Yoshi, a complete idiot who has a friend in Himeji, a very smart girl who wound up in the F class for getting sick and leaving during the placement test, thus giving her a zero. Together with their friends in the class they battle their way to the top through the use of avatars. Everyone in the school has one that has stats dependent on how well they do on tests in various subjects. Thus, the higher the grade, the harder their avatars hit. It\u2019s pretty much a school version of a JRPG where instead of health potions, students run to take recovery tests during battles to regain lost hit points. It\u2019s a rather smart idea I must say and actually works out kind of well. I don\u2019t think watching people compare test scores and take tests has been this exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThis plot of the underdogs taking on the big guys is of course a clich\u00e9 but works perfectly well here due to the peppering of strange and eclectic characters that ultimately lends this series the comedy aspect it should be known for. The plot is both downright ridiculous and hilarious and while there is not a lot of plot to go around, there is enough to add some semi-serious bits in throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems with the plot. There is a lot of romance being thrown around and it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. A love letter by a certain character is never given to another certain character despite this love letter being a main point of the plot. Another thing I found was I don\u2019t understand the science behind an avatar being hurt and Yoshi feeling it. Nobody else can feel their avatar\u2019s being hurt, only Yoshi can because of his terrible scores, but it still seems nonsensical. But that\u2019s just a tiny complaint that shouldn\u2019t even matter considering I\u2019m watching a show to laugh, not get a deep, engaging, realistic plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I did laugh, and so will you. This show is replete with sexual humor that may turn some people away but when an anime uses Apocalypse Now  in a joke, I think it deserves a cookie. On top of that was a random cameo by Miku Hatsune (whose back is turned in Class B) and it also references other anime. Yes, it does have lots of tits. And as I\u2019ve previously stated, tits do not a good joke make. This anime somehow made me laugh at tits. That\u2019s right. I laughed at boob jokes. I didn\u2019t laugh at the constant use of Himeji\u2019s breasts and Yoshi\u2019s sister\u2019s breasts as some form of fan service I guess, but I did laugh at Shimada\u2019s constantly comparing her breasts to Himeji\u2019s and being jealous. The overabundance of boobies also spills over into how characters act, which creates a particularly silly character but we\u2019ll talk about him in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing fantastic. It has this look as if it were a colored-in manga but it\u2019s not a style I found  appealing. The dots everywhere and the sometimes rather dull colors made it seem like an older anime, maybe 2005-ish. The animation also seemed rather lackluster in the fight scenes where a lot of the time we see an overhead view with little circles representing the characters instead of watching the characters actually fight. While this is not a huge issue, I feel as if the animators were lazy when producing these segments.\\n\\n\r\nSound quality is actually good. I committed high treason and watched the dub which turned out to be rather pleasant. None of the voices were grating and I felt that it actually kept the integrity of the original script without taking away any of the funny bits. Now the opening and closing on the other hand are another matter altogether. The opening is lame and basic and could have been tacked onto anything. The ending is meh, not bad but not particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show what it is. Yoshi is the oblivious idiot, a character archetypical of the genre but hilarious nonetheless. Himeji has big boobs and about as little personality as one would expect from the love interest. Shimada is the hot-headed and overly violent girl who does not like her tiny boobs being made fun of. She likes Yoshi, as does Himeji though they never fight over him. They seem to be a unified effort all the time. The problem with Shimada is the fact that another girl is in love with her and is stalking the crap out of her. The same can actually be said of Yoshi who is being teased by a gay guy from Class A a lot of times.\\n\\n\r\nClass representative of class F, Sakamoto is in a contract with the representative of A, Kirishima. Kirishima wants to marry him and does everything she can to be with him while Sakamoto wants nothing to do with it leading to some hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nHideyoshi is quite possibly one of the most interesting and hilarious characters of the show. A guy who looks like a girl but constantly dresses like a girl for whatever reason. The girls are jealous of how hot he is as a girl and the guys all seem to find him attractive as well. This leads to utter confusion half the time and while Hideyoshi\u2019s character is never explained (why does he dress like a girl if he wants to be treated as a guy?) he still provides enough hilarious moments to make that question void.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Kouta is a hentai who takes pictures of everyone\u2019s boobs and panties and is constantly dying of nosebleeds. He has started a book on the boobs of all the girls in the school. He is utterly hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we can\u2019t forget Iron Man, the remedial class teacher. When a student dies during a battle with their avatars Iron Man swoops in like a superhero and takes them to remedial classes. This guy is freaking great.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Yoshi\u2019s sister who seems to want to have sex with him. I won\u2019t explain any further because the anime doesn\u2019t either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is there to say about this show? It made me laugh every episode and while it may feel a little inconsistent at times (the semi-serious episodes and the flat out comedy episodes aren\u2019t mixed together proportionally) it still is one of the most entertaining comedy anime I\u2019ve seen. Sure it doesn\u2019t wrap up tightly, sure it doesn\u2019t have an amazing story, but who cares? It\u2019s freaking hilarious. The characters are not all original but all together make a memorable group of idiots. The action isn\u2019t real well done but is negated by the absolutely laugh out loud writing. There are lots of jiggly boobies for all the fan boys but also a lot of jokes concerning both American and Japanese culture.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fun ride that a fan of comedy anime may want to take if he or she hasn\u2019t already. I found it to be more entertaining then it should be, but loved it all the more for that.",

I found it funny because it was completely stupid like over the top at some points and in my opinion it did it in a really good way and it presented this well. I enjoyed watching this series because something was always happening and there was never really a dull moment. The characters were by far my favourite part and I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if the characters weren't the way they are. The story is very good I think mainly because it is quite well written and a lot of the storycomes from the light novels which are well written and the anime does do them justice however it's not a massively compelling story that keeps you on the edge of your seats all of the time or is it a sad sob story but I'm not saying that's a bad thing because I don't think those kinds of stories would fit in with this and even if they did this is a comedy I believe and it probably wouldn't be as funny. This anime is one that I thoroughly enjoyed but I can understand why others won't like it and this will be mainly down to what you find funny and I find this idiotic humour to be hysterical but if you don't then it probably isn't going to be your favourite anime but it doesn't mean that you won't like it.",

What puts this aside from the other school life/fan service/ dirty humour / plain comedy anime is that this series comprises of all the said theme. \r\nThis series certainly balances its sets of themes well but surprisingly, it has a decent story line as well with a nice touch of twists here and there. Another thing that makes this series special is that there is rarelyor if not no superfluous bits of information that leaves loose ends untied even until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to that, the second series ended rather abruptly but generally because the light novel/manga's pace of development at that time was considerably slow and thus they ceased animation. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is certainly an anime worth watching if you're just looking for a bundle of laughs. Also, watch this series first followed by the OVA and finally the second season.\\n",

            "content": "Before I watched Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, I was highly skeptical of the show. I was just starting to get back into watching a few more anime after being on a \"hiatus\" of sorts from anime/manga entirely due to juggling all kinds of things back then such as college, my social and family life, and even catching up on the latest Flash and Big Bang Theory episodes. I told my sister I was looking for a great comedy anime with some romance mixed into the fold. She suggested Baka to Test. When I searched for it, on first glance, it looked quite girly, tookiddy, and I kept telling myself, this isn't the kind of anime I'm looking for. My standards on anime with great comedic moments were School Rumble and even the classic Ranma 1/2. In my head, I was thinking, I wouldn't like something like this, so I shoved it to the back of my \"To Do/Watch List.\" \\n\\n\r\nFinally, after a few months, and going through a few other shows, I finally decided to give it a shot. Boy, was I glad I took the plunge into this show because by the end of the series, it had entered my list of all time favourite anime! It was exactly what I was looking for! The story wasn't exactly the greatest in the world. A school where people are divided by their academic prowess. It stars Aki, the typical \"dumb\" male protagonist, who all the girls fall for. It seems like a case for another typical anime. But, somehow, the amazing characters, the timing of the comedic moments, the great reactions of the cast, and also the artwork, and the scenarios blended together into a chaotic, and hilarious anime! Baka to Test is simply a great situational comedy! The characters end up in unusual scenarios for high school students. But each of these moments bring out comedy gold!  Every episode I couldn't help but laugh at something. I tried to savour every moment with this anime so I constricted myself to watching 1-2 episodes an evening. I couldn't help but be sad when the ride was over. It made my long days at work/school worth it when I came back home. It brought a sense of relief and joy to my aching body. \\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test isn't that deep of the show, it's not trying to be. Sure, there\u2019ll be a few episodes where you delve deeper into the backgrounds of the characters, but it doesn\u2019t give you a heavy feeling after doing so. It's for people who need a good laugh with a simple story, but it also gives you characters you end up loving as well.  It's for people who need a good refresher from all the stress in their lives, and also it\u2019s a great change of pace from all the serious anime you've been watching. I loved every bit of the show. However, I\u2019m sure there are people who aren\u2019t into this genre of anime, but, if you\u2019re looking for a great school/comedy/romance anime with some crazy situations, with memorable characters, then give it a shot! Check out an episode or two! It at least deserves your time to be seen at least once. If you don't like it, move on to the next great thing! But if you enjoyed the first episode, see the rest and I promise a great ride!",

It's just one big \"meh\", like many series latey. Is's just so average. Firstly we have average school boy protagonist, with average friends, being traditionally harassed by some girls, everything surrounded by bad jokes about flat breasts. As always. Practically only funny thing is protagonist's older sister, but she gets practically forgotten further in the series.Like in fourth episode. The further it goes, the more it turns into even more average cheap school romance. Not even trying. Honestly, 11th episode was so unnecessary and overdramatised I gave up tryingto watch this anime.\\n\r\nOh, did I forgot to say about title? Nobody even tried to think of something funny. \"Idiot, tests, and summonned beings\". Yeah. \"Angel Beats\" could be as well named \"Dude dies and then falls in love\". Really. Is it really that hard to think of original title?\\n\r\nThe only thing, that kept me watching this was art and this little bit of plot that you just want to see what happens.\\n\r\nNormally I write who would enjoy series I revew, but with this... Well, maybe if you want nobrainer. In other cases stay away from this series. It's just not really worth the time spent watching. It's not really bad. It's just meh.",

The storyline isn't all that serious and is mostly about everyone living a life in highschool fighting for better classrooms.\r\nArt 9\r\nThe art is good for a comedy anime plus the Chris look very cute (much kawaii) I also like how the art can show how a comedy anime is supposed to look like.\r\nSound 9\r\nThe music fits well into the comedy theme but I especiallylike the opening and ending themes very well\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nBaka to test shokanjuu has all the characters you need.

This is already a world wide famous anime that's been out for years, but to me only a recent discovery which has amazed me so far.\r\nIf you've already watched this anime then you'll know what I mean by confusing. People usually get to episode 8 out of 26 and give in because their un intrested.\r\nTheir wrong....\r\nUp to episode 4 we see our maincharacters learning all about a curse which has haunted Hinamizawa for 5 years. everyday, on the same day of every year 1 person will die and 1 will go missing along with that person. in certain cases 2 people will die instead of one, both in mysterious circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched some of these episodes than there will be absolute confusion, that's if you don't read in to it. Every 4 episodes the scenario restarts. I won't ruin it for you as the first 4 episodes don't make much of an impact or impression.....But one, well 3 if you count those insane characters too, die.....All within episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nStraight after episode 4....Boom!!!! Their all alive again and happy as can be. I feel as if they've done this to show all of the ways you can possibly die from Oyashiros curse, and all of the possible outcomes small decisions can make.\\n\\n\r\nOyashiro, he is the guardian of Hinamizawa who supposidly looks over the villagers... But in this Anime the guardian does the opposite of what it should do. Apparently when 1 sin is committed you will either die or go missing, if you die someone close to you will go missing. If someone goes missing, someone close to them will die.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say anything about the characters in this story apart from the fact that the main cast will either be seen at least once or those 4 episodes will be based on that character. The main bunch that we see are quite unusual and happy, each of them have their own individual side which is eerie, creepy and slightly disturbing. So I'm going to let you all have your own experience with this Anime.\\n\\n\r\nit is a great watch from start to finish, with parts that don't make sense till later, to parts of the puzzle which you have to fit together yourself to figure out the true meaning of the story. An amazing Anime which I'm going to finish watching no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nFriday 7th Febuary 2013. 8:55. ~AmyXxx",

Each character has there own avatar, and each avatar borrow from the characters traits. it's a unique way to show off the characters, and as in the first episode, when Shimada, Kinoshita and Tsuchiya all team up, it helps to show the characters off in one shot, giving more time for the music or art style to sink in. It's quite humorous too, and while I like dark animes, whenit's got an atmosphere like this, it's has to be an anime that can enjoy itself. But there's still SOMETHING I don't quite like, but I don't no what. So, I'm definetley going to be watching the rest of the series, but I don't no about it's replay value.",

            "content": "Baka to Test is a disappointment. This is because if you watch the first episode, you will find it to be absolutely hilarious. However, it does not take long before the enjoyment runs thin. All of the characters are flat anime stereotypes, with the possible exception of the protagonist and his bestfriend. The protagonist himself is the idiot stereotype taken to the extreme, which is different, but the show focuses on it so much that it is to the detriment to his character, so I don't remember his name. The main character has three gags that are constantly told about him: he is an idiot,he is poor and he doesn't know that the two leading ladies have a huge crush on him. Don't be upset at that last one, you know from the very first episode that both girls like him. The show reuses these three gags, and many others, to the point of nausea. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Baka to Test is basically the Taco Bell of anime. It reuses the same five ingredients over and over again. If you like your anime dumb with as little thought put into them as possible, then I highly suggest you watch Baka to Test. However, you can do better. Nichijou, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou and Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai are all better anime that will give you more laughs.",

            "content": "Critic's Log - Earthdate: April 5, 2013. Review #43: Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts\r\nTo those that love movies, we have lost a particular voice on April 4, 2013. We still have our thumbs to decide if a movie is good or bad but this man was known for being part of that. We have lost an influential film critic known as Roger Ebert. Yeah, the guy that was with Gene Siskel before Siskel died from complications of surgery. Roger Ebert was dealing with a health issue and I think everyone knows the story here. He had thyroid cancer, had to have part of ofhis jaw removed, the cancer came back and then he suddenly passed away. I can honestly say that Siskel and Ebert was kind of a big deal when it came to movies because they both shared their opinions on specific movies and that might seem a little boring to some but when these guys have differences in opinion, that does tend to be more fun to watch and it's fascinating that these guys are arguing through opinions...over A MOVIE! Yeah, I know movies are supposed to bring escape from reality but these guys take it very seriously. It is a bit silly to take a movie way too seriously but that's what Siskel and Ebert were good at. They both had a passion for the movies. Hell, even Roger Ebert had Gene Siskel over the phone while Siskel was in the hospital and they were reviewing a film, call that a bit strange. Even though he has seen and reviewed animated flicks, He even saw and reviewed some anime films as well such as anime films like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke. One of his headlines back in 1999 said \"Japanese animation unleashes the mind\"  and he did once say that he likes the fact that Japanese animation isn't all limited to kids. I actually did agree on that. He is positive towards anime but he only reserves this towards movies. This is perfectly obvious because he was a film critic. Roger Ebert is considered to be an advocate for anime even if that does sound a bit sketchy. Even in his final years when Roger Ebert couldn't speak anymore, he still wrote his film reviews and kept doing so without giving up. I think he was more than just a critic, he was a voice for the moviegoer, he was like a friend to us even if one of us never met him face to face or even if some of us have a difference in opinion with him. But most importantly, he is like everyone else that loves to watch movies. He was a moviegoer, just like us.  Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert may have not been a major influence or inspiration as to why I do anime reviews but I will say that their passion for movies really left an impression on me. I am also passionate about anime which is exactly why I review animes in the first place. I may be a self-proclaimed Anime critic but I do want to lend out my voice through my reviews and I want to be like a friend even if you don't agree with me. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I am like everyone else that has a passion for anime. Now that Roger Ebert has left this world, all we can remember him by is that his career, passion, life, and legacy deserves a \"Two Thumbs Up\". Roger Ebert is probably re-united with Gene Siskel up in the balcony. They'll see you at the movies in spirit and in memory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRoger Ebert\\n\\n\r\n1942-2013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said, I actually do have a review under way. As a self-proclaimed anime critic, can you please remain seated while I give you a lecture on how I do my anime reviews? If the answer is yes, then let me teach you how it's done. This will be a lengthy lesson that does involve questions. So, please remain seated while class is in session because here is Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #1: Should I mention the sypnosis of the show while reviewing it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou should just in case...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBeing into a school of higher grade proof-reading is decided by the results of the Promotion Test strictly for certain class types. Ranging from A class with the best facilities anyone can offer all the way down to F Class which is composed of low dining tables, rotten tatami mats and other worn out facilities. Students can change classes by competing using the Examination Summons Battle system or ESB for short. Students summon virtual avatars with their equivalent test mark scores and use them to compete with other classes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #2: What should I mention regarding the animation?\\n\\n\\n\r\nI simply mention that the show is done by the studio that made it and then explain the animation a little further.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, This is a Silver Link production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI said \"Silver Link\", not Dark Link! Anyway, Baka and Test does look pretty good for the most part, but there are some shortcuts that are a bit noticeable. Does this really hamper with enjoying the animation and artwork? No. The animation is quite possibly the strongest attribute to Baka and Test.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #3: Should I mention the composer of the soundtrack to the specific anime you're reviewing?\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlease do, it is part of the show after all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is by Nijine, and that's all I'm gonna point out because the soundtrack is a bit forgettable in this show. I will admit the opening is catchy and some of the closings are good too, but that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #4: Should I mention the voice acting? Should I mention the \"Dub\" too?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYes, mention the voice actors that are part of the show, unless there's not much to say about it, that all depends. As far as the Dub, I only discuss the Original Japanese Cast and the English Dub cast since I reside in the U.S. Discussing the English Dub is purely optional. Just don't write the entire cast down. List down who you thought stood out in their roles. I also mention the ADR director of the dub because the ADR director is essentially \"The Director\" of the English Dub.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The original Japanese cast is pretty good... for playing the generic character types. Hiro Shimono is alright as Yoshii and everyone else is alright too, this particular cast really isn't all too special and I don't know what else to say. I could say the same for the English dub. Josh Grelle is okay as Yoshii, and Brina Palencia does pull off a convincing voice for Hideyoshi. That's pretty much all I can explain about the dub. This show doesn't really rely on voices all too much, it's just generic character casting for the seiyus/Voice Actors and Voice actresses. Terri Doty did alright as ADR director I guess.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #5: Should I mention the characters?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely, the characters are an important factor to a fictional story, they are possible reflections to certain people and that's why some people feel that they could relate to the character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, the characters are poorly developed for the most part. But what does make this show work is the humor. Some of the events that take place are somewhat hilarious. It was a little interesting that a certian 1979 Vietnam War movie was actually referenced in an anime especially on Baka and Test. You'll have to see it yourself because I won't give it away. I did give out a few chuckles over that scene though since I have seen that \"1979 war movie\". I can imagine \"the horror\" that Yuuji had to go through while being in that situation. Great, I kinda hinted what the movie referenced was. Oh well, just watch the damn show and you probably will get it. If you already seen it, then good for you. There are some slightly overdone jokes that can be a little old but I guess it wouldn't hurt if it was overdone but not excessive. Kouta on the otherhand was funny at first but his perverted nature was joked around a little too much. It doesn't bother me too much but I can see that the jokes revolving this is a little excessive. Even if the characters are a bit poorly developed, some of the jokes are great but that's pretty much it. Also, If you are not into the Yaoi/Yuri stuff or if you're not into Gay and Lesbian topics, I have something to tell you about Hideyoshi...\\n\\n\\n\r\nHideyoshi doesn't bother me for a second, In fact. I actually like his character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #6: Should I mention more of the story even though a sypnosis would already explain that?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy yes, The sypnosis should (or can) be the starting point of a review. Going more in-depth of the story does help too. After all, like the characters... The story is important too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, Baka and Test does feel a bit episodic and the plot does feel a bit aimless because of this. I will give this show a pass because Baka and Test is a comedy and comedies are not story-driven. Comedies are laughter-driven. However... The humor is slightly overdone and I only found myself laughing at 35% of the show. The show was a bit boring at times and I am glad that this particular season was short, because I wasn't sure if I could take 12 or 13 more episodes of the show and then see a second season of it of the same length if that really did happen. Besides that, I was patient enough to see the first season all the way through and I will look into the continuations of this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #7: Should I mention the writer and director of the anime that is specifically being reviewed?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's up to you, I usually do this just for those that want to be technical.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's also interesting to point out that the writer for the show is Katsuhiko Takayama and the director for this show is Shin Oonuma. The reason I pointed this out is because they also worked on the anime Ef: A Tale of Memories and its sequel Ef: A Tale of Melodies. I have reviewed those shows in the past. I did comment on my Ef anime reviews that there was a visual gimmick that was present throughout the entire series and I have been seeing this on Baka and Test and I'm starting to notice that this might just be Oonuma-san's style. Except with Baka and Test, it's done with humor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #8: Should I mention the availability of this show as well as mentioning supplemental material?\\n\\n\r\nI do this just to inform if the show is currently available through the licensor or if it is out of print. I also mention the supplemental stuff to mention what else is made outside of the anime. You mentioning stuff like this is totally up to you.\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test is available from Funimation. An OVA of the series is also available by Funimation, The second season to Baka and Test is also available by Funimation. The only things that have not made it stateside are the light novels, a couple mangas, and a video game.\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #9: Should I make a closing statement?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt does help to make a closing statement before you're finished reviewing an anime. This is optional I guess.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Baka and Test is a 13-episode comedy that may give you some laughs but you're gonna have to stay patient in the long run because some jokes are a bit overdone. It may not have good character development, and it might not have a good sountrack. What it does have is some funny character moments.\\n\\n\r\nAfter grading everything that this anime has given me. I give Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts a 6.2 out of 10, it is DECENT!\\n\\n\r\nQuestion #10: THERE IS NO TENTH QUESTION! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!?\\n\\n\r\nYou do realize that this whole \"Question\" thing was just a little inside pun for this anime, am I right?\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below, and if you have read all this. You have passed the test.",

It looks like a grid of circles instead of squares, but the words themselves are not able to express, you have to just see for yourself. Very nice look also characters cited by the students, who are their chibi versions, dressed in intricate costumes and wielding weapons.\r\nThe music was pretty average, so it fell in my memory.\r\nThe story told in \"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu\" is simple and concise, but contains a lot of funny situationsand gags, through which we will often laugh. As if that were not enough, we get yet great-looking combat, the development of the past, some of the characters, themes of love, etc.\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the biggest advantage of this anime, its diversity and colorfulness surpasses many other titles. Despite the fact that there are so many, each is unique and fits well in the presented events. I will not list them here because it is certainly not enough left me time and space for written them all. Top view them and learn by watch this anime.\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this title to anyone who likes a good laugh at the great comedy with a beautiful look and very cute characters.",

Both were based around a school; however, Shokanju focused on the students an incorporated perverted and idiotic jokes there. Its a show where the main character is so stupid and obliviious its hilarious.\r\nThe story is based around a school system comparable to no other - it is equivalent to a social heirarchy and survival of the fittest. The smartest are place in \"Class A\" while the dumbest are place in \"Class F.\" Each classcan challeng another class in a match called ESB, where they summon beings. The beings are miniature replicas of the summoner and its powers are based on the students most recent test scores. \\n\\n\r\nThe underlying storyline is based upon the characters and their growth, relationships, and crushes on each other and how they interact. This is where it is hilariously funny as the characters incorporate perverted jokes, stupidity, and simple naivete. Each character playing a specific role with in this array of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a high strong point of Baka to test no Shokanju. There are hand drawn sketches and several unique pattern based graphics that give the animation an originality. The animation greatly supports each mood with an unyeilding intesity. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects inlcuding the music are all standard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this 13 episode series is for anyone who loves comedy and anime. If perveted jokes and stupidity don't bother you than its a must watch. I will warn you it does have action, but if thats all your looking for then this is not for you. I loved it!",

            "content": "Easy to like - hard to love.\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu has a lot of ingredients that could have made it a favourite of mine. A colourful cast in a borderline parodist concept, overloaded to the brim with gags and absurd situations.\r\nDespite that, there are some unfortunate detracting elements to this anime. First of all, the world and background art is one of those sketched reality type jobs you may have seen in for example Nisekoi. There are overlapping patterns, crazy shading and obscurement of detail, making the characters look like paper cutouts in contrast. The character art itself is also very simple, though definitelynot without personality. In my opinion, while I'm sure many see this kind of art direction as a breath of fresh air or even \"artistic license\", I see it as nothing more than a shortcut. You can argue that because of the lightheartedness of the show, it is perfectly valid to make the art itself more basic and effective. While that wouldn't be wrong, in this case I don't feel that the art direction did anything to lift the focus onto other aspects of the anime. What it does do for me is distract. And more distractions is not what this anime needed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the pacing of this anime can not be described as anything but exasperating. In 20 minutes worth of airtime, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu crams in more gags, jump shots, banal twists and ridiculousness than any other comedy anime I've seen. It seems the creators are desperate to rush through as many jokes and plot elements as is possible at all times. For a non-japanese speaker relying on subs, it's a very hard watch, and also a lot of jokes fall completely flat due to a lack of timing. Timing is one of the most important aspects of humor, and this is probably the main failure of Baka to Test.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, I still felt I had a blast with the anime. Despite leaning heavily on artistic shortcuts and unrelenting pacing, I did end up caring about the meager plot and loving the cast of characters, especially towards the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nBaka to Test is a hard anime to love, simply because there is so much to love but not enough time to fall in love with it. With proper pacing, all the jokes and gags would be funny instead of just half of them. With less artistic shortcuts, such as the tactical map trick used in every battle sequence, there would be more chances to see different sides of the characters. And despite the basic nature of the plot and setting, it could have done well for itself given more background and explanation.\\n\\n\r\nHow I rated:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n",

The idea of battles among students using very cute avatars is so brilliant. And they are actually using their grades so it is very school-like. Plus, the comedy is not far-fetched at all. It is not overly done and it is very effective. There are absolutely no dull moments in the series. It is absolutely funny that they would make small and simple issues into big deals. Well, when we\u2019re talking about \u201cBAKA\u201d people it could really resultinto one hilarious series.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things typical and great about school life stories are its wide range of characters. Each of them is very different from one another in a way that they are interesting and funny in their own way. Their hilarious antics are just unbearable, most especially when their making fun of Hideyoshi as being a girl.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this series is the amazing animation which is very rare for a typical school setting. Well, it is different from the typical because of its battles of summoned beasts. However, regardless of the summoned beasts or anything fictional, the animation of the characters and landscapes are already nice alone.\\n\\n\r\nNowadays, I know very well that with a story with a school setting, it is very hard to make an interesting enough storyline and plot that would make any viewer continue watching it. So it is definitely amazing that they are able to make it interesting, fun and unique despite the clich\u00e9 setting that they have.\\n",

I think if the art had only a little difference, it would totaly ruin the whole show. Even the emotions and reactions are really funny. 10/10\r\nThere aren't much flashbacks compared to some other shows, but the characters personalityes are awesome, in funny way. You'll see what I mean if you check this show yourself. 10/10\r\nHmm.. Enjoyment...Well... what can I say? If you read the whole Review carefully, you'll seethat I am totaly in love with this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The only thing that's bothering me the whole series is, that there's not much progress between their relationships. 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nWell the last thing I can tell you is, stop reading this and go watch it, so you'll see what I mean. Sorry for bad english. I hope you liked my review and make sure to have fun as much as you can. ;)",
