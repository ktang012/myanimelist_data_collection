            "content": "Once upon a time, I was browsing through My Anime List, looking for a new anime to watch. That's when I found Mashiroiro Symphony. From the look of it, I guessed that it was based off of a visual novel. I've been a big fan of visual novels being turned into animes, I guess that's why I liked A Bridge to the Starry Skies, The Rose Madder Colored Hills, etc. So, I decided to try it. I didn't expect to find such a masterpiece.\r\nSo, story wise, nothing fancy. It's your typical harem anime that starts out with a boy coincidentally meeting what appears to bethe main character of the story when looking for his sister. After that, he meets a bunch of other girls, and boom. He has his own personal harem. What I was thinking at the time was \"This is almost a clich\u00e9 harem anime\". I mean, this is basically how all harem animes start. HOWEVER, as I started getting further into the show, my opinion changed. The thing about harem animes is that 99% of the time, the first girl he meets in the show is the girl he falls for in the end. 99% of the time, and that's a fact. With Mashiroiro Symphony, it pulled the carpet out from under me, and halfway within the series the main girl changed. I wasn't expecting that. That's when the story started getting good.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork was excellent. Actually, the artwork was why I fell in love with this anime. When visual novels get turned into animes, there's just something in the artwork that tells you \"I used to be a Visual Novel\". That may just be me, but either way, stunning. Absolutely beautiful. I loved the character art and the scenery. Gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I feel like I've heard a lot of the voice actors play in other animes, and by other animes, I mean other animes that used to be visual novels, so I was fairly happy that I recognized some of the voices in the show. Despite my love for the voices, there was a single voice that irritated the crap out of me. Sure, I liked the character, but when all he says is \"Pyu\" over and over again, it will seriously bug the hell out of you. I know it's a cat/alien, but at least let it have other things to say then \"Pyu\".\\n\\n\r\nFinally. I've spent years trying to find a harem anime where the main character isn't either:\\n\r\nA) A Pervert\\n\r\nor\\n\r\nB) Someone who get's flustered easily.\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Uryuu is the one lead harem character that doesn't annoy the hell out of me. Not only is he cool, but his choices in friends is 5 Star material. That brings me to the second thing I've been searching for for years in harem animes: The male role's best friend isn't a pervert either! Along with Uryuu, we got a bunch of other characters that made me happy to see. Sure, we've got a couple tsunderes, but we've also got an animal lover, a cool younger sister, and a hyperactive maid. +1 for the character designing.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed the show. I really liked it a lot. It took me a few episodes to really get into it, but I feel like I've found a treasure in the harem anime/visual novels that get turned into animes vault. Definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "When I first took a look into Mashiro-iro Symphony I never thought it would drag me in as much as it did. It took hold of my attention when I was watching, and didn't let go of me until I got though the whole anime; and yes I did marathon the anime for me it was that good. \r\n       I've always been a fan of romance animes, they're what I go to when I need an uplifting story or a sad one; this anime does it that bill of being one ofthe higher end romance animes that I've seen (and I've seen a lot of them). It may have had those slow moments, and those slightly inappropriate moments but over all I thought the storyline and character progression really overshadowed those moments making it a very good anime. Especially one that can throw around your feelings like it was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nThe story and how it progressed through each character is what I think make it worth watching. Each storyline per character had it's own story to tell, each one had their own part in the story that just made the anime, and it's characters click. It wouldn't have been a romance if it didn't have it's ups and downs right? The way those problems and resolves came in truly made this story very, very enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nI thought the character was really good, the uniforms were well designed and well executed in color. Each character had their own unique part of their character that made them different from other character designs I've seen in the past. Also the character expressions were really on point. Though there were little design mishaps, I believe in my mind that it did not effect the anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nI thought the intro was amazing, I even downloaded it because I like it that much. The sounds in the anime were well place during certain parts which really added to the mood of the setting. The only problem for me was there were some parts where a song or two would have played well, but were just blank leaving for some awkward moments but other than that I thought it was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nEach Character have their own story, which adds to the mood of the story. They all have their own backdrop that pulls you in quite a lot. To be fair, each character were individually good at playing their part in the story that it is without a doubt one of the harder times you can pick out your favourite (couple/person) because each one has their own good qualities.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime will forever be one of my favourites! \\n\r\nMashiro-iro Symphony = MUST SEE",

            "content": "Mashiro Symphony: The Blandness of Half-Ass Ville\r\nI've watched 2 episodes of the anime. That was all I could muster before I just couldn't watch anymore. This is a preliminary review, based on what I've seen so far, and experienced based conjecture as to where it's gonna go.\r\nThe best way to describe this is with one word: bland. \r\nBland, bland, bland. \r\nCharacters are extremely one dimensional. Any attempts to make them interesting or have the audience invest are cursory at best. This is especially true for the main character. He has no quirks, no eccentricities, no emotional palette. He has 3 emotions: smiling contentment, thoughtfully unsettled,mildly upset due to embarrassing situation. Even when he's supposed to be upset, it's amazingly uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\n He's the embodiment of harem tropes, the quintessential \"smiling nice guy with no particular talents or distinguishing characteristics who inexplicably has several embarrassing, sexually themed misunderstandings/encounters with one female protagonist who now views him with great disdain.\"  \\n\\n\r\nThe female leads are slightly more interesting, but even they are just super stereotypes within the genre. The situations they get put in (guy walks in while girls changing, guy somehow falls forward into their breasts, guy somehow ends up at perfect angle to look at their crotch) and their reactions to them them (sudden shock, anger, and violence, accompanied with several \"kyaaaa!\"s) have been played out a thousand times before. \\n\\n\r\nMy big qualm is not that it's not original, though. Originality doesn't mean quality. But, if you're using something that's been done before, you better darn well do a good job at it, or there's no reason to watch it again. This series is all so soulless, like the writers, voice actors, and animators are just going through the motions and have nothing better to offer.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have a rule that as long as something is even remotely palatable, I have to watch at least four episodes of it, so I will. In fact, I'll probably watch the rest of the episodes two, one fast forward, just to say I've seen them. And it might turn it around; but I doubt it. There's no indication that this will recover at all and turn into something worth while.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a tiny potential for a decent story here. An insignificant seed, where they could have done something good. They could have gone the school life and friendship(not romance) in realistic comedy centered route that Seitokai Yakuindomo went, or done something like Kaichou wa Maid-sama and brilliantly fused the school life/politics comedy with a budding romance, or they could have done something very romance focused, like with Kanon, Clannad, even Myself; Yourself (which is greatly inferior to the former two mentioned, but still largely superior to this series). But they didn't. Instead there's just this lame, limp pile of gruel. \\n\\n\r\nI have a deep seated hatred for series that waste my time by not putting any effort into doing something engaging. It's not a matter of pacing, lack of a standard story arc, or even mundane subject matter, as there are series that are amazingly engaging, even with slow pacing (House of Five Leaves), pure slice of life story lines (Kino no Tabi; Mushishi), and mundane subject matter (Azumanga Daioh) that are simply amazing, and make you feel like your life is now better for having seen them. It's a matter of the amount of effort and care put into the crafting of the story on the part of the artists that contribute to its creation. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is just super duper half-assed, and viewers owe it to themselves not to waste their time with this crap and instead go find something worth watching(see above mentioned series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is quite possibly the best anime that I've ever seen that has harem listed as a genre.\r\nI'm sure that you will all agree that the most annoying thing about any harem anime is the perverted characters who tries to hit on everyone/ gets hit on by everyone. Thus, I have more or less given up on the harem genre and steer well clear. However, this anime is like hope at the bottom of Pandora's box.\r\nI really like how the protagonist is not just a decent person for once but he cares so much about everyone around him. All he is ever trying to dois help (leading to a number of misconceptions). The story line is not about him and every other girl falling in love symultaniously but rather, it focuses on the development of a single girl's feelings... before disregarding them for the next. He takes everyone's feelings and attitudes to heart, and is always trying to help.\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly did not expect the ending of this.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: (Warning Spoilers)\\n\r\nAs I'm sure you've gathered from the synopsis, the series starts with our protagonist looking for his lost sister and when they find one another there is a girl, our other main character, from the presteious girls highschool with the sister. This makes you think, oh no - here we go again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a merger plan between the girls highschool and the protagonist's co-ed school and our protagonist, his sister and his (not perverted) best friend are enrolled in the experiment.\\n\\n\r\nOur main girl instantly makes the boys feel unwelcome and from there on its tsundre. The character development is mainly centred around her rather than every girl. But then suddenly, about half way through the series the main girl switches. Completely unexpected. The new main girl is also tsundre but more heavily so (if you know what I mean). She loves the protagonist but he doesn't seem to love her back. Instead he is falling for her best friend (who is the only one whom he actually loves).",

            "content": "Judging by the cover of Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of lovers, I thought this was just another typical cliche harem, you know, high school environment, different females for the male lead to choose. As I was progressing through the anime, I realized the plot was very \"unique\" and was driven by \"unique\" characters. Mashiroro Symphony does not follow the typical harem outline. Does that mean this anime was outstanding? exceptional?\r\nNOPE\r\nPersonally, I don't mind if a harem is cliched or not, i was not expecting a unique plot, just your typical average harem. even if it was different I wouldn't mind it. So what went wrong?\r\nSTORY(5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI found the plot of this anime to be very \"special\", and when I mean special, i mean retarded special. It is not centered on one plot, rather it follows different routes (personally I don't like this). This anime starts off like a very typical harem. You are introduced to your protagonist Shingo Uryuu along with his sister and another girl Airi Sena whom you can easily deduce will possibly be the main female lead. The first half focuses primarily on the relationship between Shingo and Airi. I enjoyed this half very much, as watching the two leads interact, I established a very fond connection for the couple wishing to see more in the later episodes. However after the first half, Airi whom is our female lead is no longer the center of attention, instead the anime focuses on two characters who are already introduced in the first half: Sana Inui & Miu Amaha and this is where the anime truly becomes \"special\". I found this to be very weird, the first half was good but why change routes? Even so, it was not subtle, I was totally not prepared for it, the next episode, they just threw the spotlight on Sana and gradually onto Miu. Personally I didn't mind this change as long as the story somehow developed a strong relationship between the characters but unfortunately this never happens and it was a disappointment. The ending was one of the most disappointing endings I've seen, it was not the original purpose of the anime and felt more of a filler episode. As I watched the end, despite being a very touching moment, I lost my sense of touch with the characters and I could no longer appreciate what I was watching. If i had to relate a color, it will be black, confused to what I was watching and seeing no light.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\r\nI will outline the characters:\\n\\n\r\nShingo Uuryu - Male Lead, a hardworking, caring diligent student (Main)\\n\\n\r\nAiri Sena - Female Lead for the first half, a rude posh girl who seems to have a huge dislike towards the opposite gender, she does not want to show her weakness and is willing to do whatever to be seen strong among her peers. (Main)\\n\\n\r\nSana Inui - A tsundere girl who's always picking on Shingo. Even so, she will go out of her way to support Miu (Main)\\n\\n\r\nMiu Amaha - Loves animals, is extremely hardworking in what she does and will do everything possible to protect injured animals. (Main)\\n\\n\r\nSakuno Uryuu - The younger sister of Shingo, unlike typical harem animes she does not have a brocon. Quite mature for her age, has a very good relationship with her brother and the other females. (Support)\\n\\n\r\nAngie Sewell - The maid of the academy, she has a huge passion for being a maid and is happy to perform chores for her master. (Support)\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead: Shingo Uuryu is very different from your average Harem lead, instead of the lazy, negligent or pessimistic character, our lead is quite the opposite, hardworking, diligent and caring. The very same can be said to most of the female characters however this leads to one problem: lack of character development. Not to say that there were any development, I believed Airi was developed extremely well coming off being hot-headed and rude to someone who could open up and depend on others when needed. However this is the only strong development seen in the anime. For Shingo himself, the already hardworking diligent student, how can you develop him? The fact he was perfect already flustered me, there were no flaws about his character which really was annoying to me. Even more so, he is dense.\\n\\n\r\n The story focusing on Miu and Sana was not developed well and thus has affected the way I perceive both characters. The first half of the story had left an impression on Airi and the immediate change of routes had caused me to become confused of the characters. The fact that there 6 episodes left and they were trying to develop 2 characters, it was not enough to help establish a connection with the characters, had the anime went 2 cour, this might not have been the case. Also looking at the character outline, it seemed difficult to create any STRONG development. There may have been development for Sana, but the story did not choose her to be the winning female thus her character was wasted. While there was development in the anime for those 2 character (Sana and Miu) it was extremely weak. The plot-structure of the anime also contributed to the weak development of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise our 2 beloved supporting cast, Angie and Sakuno had no character development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nEXECUTION (5.5/10)\\n\r\nFor Mashiroiro, it was rushed, there was excellent character chemistry between Airi and Shingo mainly because together Shingo helped Airi overcome obstacles, it brought out both characters really well  and at the same time made the anime enjoyable to watch. This is the only highlight of the anime as when the route switches over to Sana and Miu, we never see a glimpse of proper action, the fueling desire to help someone overcome obstacles. Sana and Miu's character while developed weakly never satisfied me while I was watching the anime. Their weak development also led to me not being able to connect with the character thus feeling no sorts of empathy during the touching moments of the show. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND (7/10)\\n\r\nNothing wrong with the art, infact I liked the way how Shingo was designed, a very mature looking person, something that looks quite different from the tradiational \"half-ass\" look of typical anime characters. The female leads however do follow the cliche design, cute-looking, innocent and beautiful. \\n\r\nNot mucht to say about sound either, I love the ED personally, not so much the OP. The music during the anime was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (6.5/10)\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime that breaks away from the cliche stereotypical harems that the industry have been shoving in our face for the past err im guessing 10 years or so then you might enjoy this anime. However, be aware of the sudden plot-change and lack of character development, it may leave you disappointed.",

            "content": "1st thing to say, do not judge a book by its cover. This is not your standard visual novel adaptation. I am surprised myself. I watched for now, up until episode 3 and was surprised by everything it offers me. In fact some says about the ecchi scenes things but it does not disturbs the story and believe me, you won't find any more of that scene starting from episode 2, maybe it's an element to attract 1st time watcher but I think the element does not disturb the storyline after the 1st episode.\r\n2nd, about the storyline, well, maybe pretty generic at 1st, the protagonistand his friends are transferred to an all-girls school BUT, The developments of the storyline makes up for it. The protagonist is a good person who was once respected in his old school and he continues his deeds. He may looks like a weak character at 1st glance but he makes it up by improving himself, a lot, though. That is why I feels the story can be very good but, be wary that it may drops dramatically halfway though. But the basis storyline from episode 1 to 3 does not disappoint at all.\\n\\n\r\n3rd, the art, ah, this is why I decided to continue watching it as the first episode was too generic in storyline and I have to thanks this element. From the Opening song till the end of ED, the art is so beautiful, well, we may found the character drawings a bit plain but, that is not why i kept watching this, I kept on watching because of the beautifully made environments which suits the character very well, I am surprised myself with the design of the extras though. In fact, the OP can be compared with White Album's OP, which is very beautiful itself.\\n\\n\r\n4th, sound element, hm... well, i like how the music is played, which it suits the situations and the special effect sound is very well synchronized with the situations too. As to be expected from most 2010+ anime though.\\n\\n\r\n5th, Character designs, plain, personality... hm..plain too... but the personality and character developments makes up for it, in fact this plays a lot of role this anime. I like how the characters developed. It is enough to make me feels like i should watch this till the end.\\n\\n\r\n6th, the enjoyment of the series, in this matter, you will find some exciting parts of many characters in the series, especially when the male protagonist found out something exciting about the female protagonist in the third episode. I smiled when I saw that scene though. Be wary though, this is slice of life and romance genre anime, so you won't find something too much of a surprise though, but it is enough to make you enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the overall was excellent. I would give it 9/10 but it may drops though if the director messes up after this episode. But if it continues its pace, I would put it on the same level as Kanon, Clannad, AIR and Angel Beats from Key. If you loves heartwarming drama and love, you will surely enjoy this, believe me :)",

            "content": "[contains some generalized spoilers, point of view from someone who didn't play the visual novel]\r\nMashiro-iro Symphony (TV) is one of the two visual novels adapted this fall season.\r\nFrom what I know, the Visual Novel sold extremely well[#1 Oct 2009], but it was also extremely average[7.68@VNDB]. Unfortunately, it being \u201caverage\u201d appears to carry on over to the anime. The characters are extremely generic and linear; there's very little character development [There's two tsunderes, the nice girl, the maid, and the sister]. In most romance series, relationships form, characters mature, they grow, they get more intimate with each other, it's gradual, but it's there. However, in Mashiro,it's mostly rushed development, and the development is more so for storyline, rather than for the individual characters. The characters are basically static from the pilot to the finale. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Mashiro is a visual novel, and visual novels aren't exactly the easiest to adapt. They have multiple paths in visual novels; you choose one of the girls and you see her being developed constantly, along with your own thoughts as the main protagonist. While in anime, you view the entire story in third-person, and it's not just one character being developed, but multiple characters. Given this, anime adaptations more often then not take the harem route, which usually isn't bad,; as long as they stay true to the characters [I don't really have any experience with the visual novel itself, so I can't really say how well or how badly they portrayed the characters, but they appear to be fine]\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, to sum it up, Mashiro is extremely predictable, and it's riddled with bad dialogue, and silly plot developments. But that's to be expected, it's a generic harem. As a whole, Mashiro is a pretty decent way to kill some time, it's not irritating to watch, and it does have its plus sides. It manages to create a pretty calm and enjoyable mood, it's relaxing. It has a fitting OP and ED, and the characters are generic, but they're not the irritating type of generic [like those over-optimistic shounen leads].\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the last two episodes are actually pretty decent, they \u201credeem\u201d some aspects of the show. It develops the characters slightly, but it's still rather linear. But, it did give a different perspective on things. In most harem romances, the guy usually dates the girl he picks, and the other girls basically fade away. However, in Mashiro, their thoughts are shown, and it's done pretty well. It shows how they cope with not being chosen. To sum it up, Mashiro is one of the better generic harems out there, it doesn't end with an irritating harem ending.\\n\\n\r\nObjective Score: 4/10. It's \u201cbad\u201d when it comes to actually portraying human emotions, it's rushed and it's pretty damn linear. But it's the type of  \u201cbad\u201d that isn't irritating to watch; it's \u201cbad\u201d because it's not the most original.\\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score: 5/10 : Mashiro on its own really isn't the most unique anime. It's generic, it's predictable, it doesn't offer anything new or rare. It's still enjoyable, but there's just so much room for improvement. But the enjoyability is still there.",

            "content": "Ow, another harem any with pretty characters! Something I like to devour every now and then. It even started of with a decent plot and 3 very strong main characters. \r\nWhen Uryuu, Airi and Sakuno were introduced in the first episode I was happy to find out none of them are your average harem characters. A pity this impression didn't last long.\r\nSakuno,who seems to have had issues in the  past and who could be a very interesting character, is sadly pushed to the background after just one episode. Airi, a strong looking woman, gets 3 episodes of glory but afterwords turns into background decoration.At the beginning of the series she yells out that she hates boys (though, at the very first episode she is extremely kind to Uryuu...) but you never actually get to find out why she hates them so much... \\n\r\nUryuu's alright for most of the series. He's not annoying and seems to be the only character who maintains his sanity. Until of course he falls in love, out of the blue, with one of the other main characters. \\n\r\nThe only character with any development is Sana, but she's your everyday crybaby so that's not really interesting. We can't forget about Miu-sempai of course. She's the character who wasn't actually introduced at the beginning but turns out to be one of the main characters... \\n\r\nIs there anybody still following this?\\n\\n\r\nSo... really there isn't much good to say about Mashiro-iro's characters. Most of the time they're just really confusing. \\n\\n\r\nOnto a more positive note: art. This is why I initially started Marshiro-iro. Airi is real eyecandy and so are all of the other girls. Unfortunately this too breaks down after episode 5 or so. Suddenly we get lousy lineart and even colouring isn't done properly. It gets better again at the end so overall it's rather ok. \\n\\n\r\nOpening and Ending songs were fun to listen too and the soundtrack wasn't too bad either. Nothing you'll remember the day after finishing the series but it sets the mood alright. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no real story development. It starts of with a boy wanting to improve relationships between two merging schools, but after a while that theme is forgotten and the story starts focusing on the suddenly appearing friendships. When the scriptwriter is done talking about that, he develops a little bit of drama around the Nuko Club. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't really enjoy this anime because I was constantly reminded that neither the characters nor the story made any sense. It was quite a rollercoaster ride, the kind you regret getting into though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very average, almost bad harem anime, nothing really worth your time unless you're a huge fan of this sort of anime. If you're looking for anything similar but way better I'd suggest Clannad or H20 ~ Footprints in the Sand.",

            "content": "I decided, based on what I thought was sound reasoning to check out Manglobe's latest release Mashiroriro Symphony: The Color of Lovers.  I'm not the biggest fan of eroge interpretations but when I have liked them they were usually produced out by the higher tier studios.  I dug the output from studios like Kyoto Animation (Clannad, Kanon, etc.), Shaft (Ef series), and P.A. Work (True Tears) because those studios were able to mask the usual problems with harem/game based series with great animation, direction or story writing. \r\nI don't play eroge myself so I am not too certain about how often the sourcematerial affects the quality of the anime but considering that certain studios like Kyoani tend to constantly make good products and certain other ones tend to put out the same crap every season, I'd wager the studio plays a big role in whether these types of series turn out to be successful.  For example, I understand that both Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate were made by the same game creator and were both just as acclaimed as games.  One studio did a fantastic job producing Steins;Gate and another put out an hot mess with Chaos;Head. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Manglobe looked like it was hurting a bit monetarily (as you can tell by cut and cover animation job in the penultimate episode of Deadman Wonderland), I had faith that they would try to be competitive with the top studios with Mashiroriro Symphony.  They did a great job of animating The World God Only Knows and I even figured they would try to go all out with a moe show since programs in this genre have the potential to give a good return. \\n\\n\r\nI was very wrong.  So far, I've spent most of this \u201creview\u201d discussing why I decided to watch this show rather than discussing the actual show for a reason.  There isn't much to say about the program other than it's generic garbage.  The plot synopsis is a boy from a regular school now attends a formerly all girl's school due to a school merger... and a harem ensues.  I'm not even the type of person who is turned off by that type of plot off the bat (why else would I watch otherwise?).  However, my view is that you have to distinguish yourself in this genre, either through quality or innovation, in order stand out.  Mashiroriro Symphony is poorly made and unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nAll the anime does is throw a bunch of 'gap moe' characters into a typical situation and has the main character being nice to them.  I know that's the general formula but if you don't add something to the general archetypes you aren't really producing anything worthwhile. While I would prefer that shows deviated from the general moe archetypes, if they are going to be used, they ought to be a skeleton or a starting point rather than having the archetype become the point where the character ends. \\n\\n\r\nAs the characters go, there's a little sister in there who is your run of the mill quiet girl character, and then there are four other girls who are 'in play'.  The most offensive of them is the maid character with the green hair.  I don't mind maid characters.  In fact I think a lot of maid characters are moe like Maria in Hayate the Combat Butler or even that spinning girl in A Certain Magical Index.  But, for anything to be successfully moe, you have to buy into the context.  An otherwise regular school isn't going to have a maid character.  The whole thing is preposterous and this isn't a gag comedy like Baka Test or something where you expect preposterous things.  So, first, she shouldn't be there. Second, there is nothing about her character beyond the things that comprise of the prototypical maid character. Her only trait is that she is a clumsy maid, which we've already seen in a thousand other anime.  When she is on screen the only possible reaction is to marvel at how spectacularly uninspired she is. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the green haired maid, there are two tsundere characters, one with yellow hair and one with red hair.  Again, there's nothing more to say about these two characters other than the fact of them being tsundere types. The only thing that separates the two is that the red haired one is a lot more emotionally embellished than the yellow one.  You do learn some biographical facts about them but there isn't much interesting about their inner lives other than their interest in the main character and maybe the red haired girl's interest in the purple girl.  \\n\\n\r\nThe final girl is the incredibly boring purple upperclassman.  She has a whopping two traits: she is nice and she likes animals.  A good deal of the show focuses on her involvement with an animal nursery high school club.  I guess one different thing I can say about this show is this sort of character would get a lot less shine in other harems; unfortunately, that's probably because the creators of other harem works realize that it's a bad idea to give the most screen time to the shallowest character. \\n\\n\r\nI get it though. A lot of these shows have the same character types without anything special added but a lot of them are actually watchable because of the production values.  That makes sense because something you already know about can still catch your attention when it looks great.  You will often see very cardboard characters in the Kyoani shows but they are so brilliantly animated that even if you are seeing something old, it's something old presented in a pretty way.  When the production is bumped up or at least stylized, you're seeing characters you otherwise know in a new, more magnificent light.  It's like seeing Final Fantasy IV remade in 3d and then in HD.  \\n\\n\r\nManglobe did a lacklustre job possible with art direction.  All the backgrounds, even ones that should look pretty, like waterfalls, seem like super-plain stock footage.  The whole show plays out with one camera angle and there are almost no innovative shots.  Even Pokemon has cool shots sometimes.   I realize that Manglobe isn't a money studio at this point in time but there was clearly no attempt to be creative with the direction.  The only notable thing I can think of is one shot where they close up from outside of a window on a rainy day and you still see the rain falling outside as if the camera was actually there. Even that shot didn't look as cool as it was supposed to. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and I hate to hate on a show but I just can't think of anything redeeming to say.  I actually did expect a lot from Manglobe before watching Mashiroriro Symphony and at the end of the day I didn't get anything.  I didn't even get into the  the various other problems I found but I think I've made my point",

            "content": "Mashiro-Iro Symphony\r\n\u201cWhite\u201d -a pure and unstained color but could be dyed by any other color. \r\nThe title of this anime can be translated as \u201cPure White Symphony.\u201d I agree with the author to go with this title. It\u2019s a very suitable title for such a pure, innocent anime. The story is rather simple, our male protagonist usually encounters with our heroine and many other female companions. \r\nHowever, it seem like this anime was written by two different scriptwriter.. This anime seem to be split into two where in the first part of the anime, the producers focused on one heroine and then on the secondhalf they switch to a different heroine and complete shut out the first girl. \\n\r\nAt first it seems very interesting, guy had an unusual yet friendly encounter with a girl and then the next day she completely changed her attitude. The first half was about how to mend their relationship into a steadier one which could lead to a happy ending. Until the girl secret was revealed and the female and male lead reaches a friendlier point in their relationship that was the end of that small arc. For a couple of episode we were introduced to the side character and then the second arc came. The first heroine was overlooked and was replaced in the second half. She took neutral role, the one who observed and gave advice. The second part we got to watch a different girl take the heroine role as she learn the emotions of having a crush and then supporting one\u2019s love. However this isn\u2019t where it ends because there is a third heroine which wraps things up nicely. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the scriptwriter wanted the effect of the various heroine but didn\u2019t issue the right amount of screen time to the third heroine which could have produced a much better effect. Although this anime have the formula for a classic romantic comedy anime, it lacks the depth of the story. I get the sense that in the end, the writer is trying to say that change isn\u2019t easy, it could be scary but people need to move forward toward the future. Also that anything is possible in the future because \u201cthe future is pure white, it could be dyed into any other color.\u201d\\n\r\nDespite phrasing this in the beginning of the anime and at the end there wasn\u2019t anything more about it in between which made this anime shallow. To summarize the structure of how the anime was laid out, I would say the first part was about gradually accepting other people\u2019s support and the comfort of having people who you can trust and the second part is learning about the next deeper feeling of emotion and that is love.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is so pure. All the characters are drawn so adorable and in such a cute fashion. This is one of the classic harem anime that is very comfortable to watch. AS a classic harem anime, we have the at least one tsundere, tomboy, the caring upperclassman and the carefree, energetic girl and of course the reserved girl who speak slowly. Nevertheless all character was drawn pretty much with the same facial feature which lack variety. Yet despite this feature, no other changes were made to differentiate this anime to the other romantic anime. The only thing to tell the characters apart is the color of the different hairstyles and their eyes. They also have a outline around their eyes the same color as their pupil. \\n\r\nThe music was very pleasing. The opening soon is very soothing and relaxing, the ending was very hyped up and energetic which suit the anime quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that this anime could be improved in some aspect, overall this was a good anime. It doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of fan service expect a little from the beginning but as a harem anime it did a nice job. It\u2019s a very simple anime, no need to think very hard, debating whether to watch it or not. It\u2019s very pleasing and sweet romantic anime to watch. I don\u2019t see any reason why not give it a try so for all you harem anime fans out there\u2026.Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\n~Later\\n\\n",

Honestly, if the anime had more drama and more episodes to deepen the plot then it would be one of the best anime. The story is basically a high school teenager male that is attending a former all-girls school as a test to see if it can go fully co-ed. He is kind and that apparently wins the hearts of several girls. What was hilarious though was that the plot wenttowards one route, then completely jumped to another with no transaction.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler (some-what)*\\n\r\nHe chooses a girl, like most harem anime, and then the rest have a pity party on the last episodes.

            "content": "Lately with VN or eroge based animes I have been under the conviction that unless the anime takes two seasons to develop, most of the time the anime will end up extremely hurried and overly condensed. Mashiroiro was a nice outlier for this, proving to be quite enjoyable while staying modest in order to accomplish this. Very innocent story, without a whole lot of drama, but it makes for something very relaxing to watch and does not leave you unsatisfied. Each character has their time, and very thankfully, they do not pull that \"You know who the main character is going to choose just becauseof the opening theme biasing her to the centre of representations of the characters\" crap that you always get. I don't want to know the main character's choice from the start in a harem anime. That's the point of watching it, to see how the guy comes up with a choice in the end. That's what makes things interesting. Mashiroiro honours this, and comes through with a choice you wouldn't have expected at all based on the first 3-4 episodes. I liked that part.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10) is pretty reasonable, having nice varied appearances and very nice natural effects. The sound is not a holy grail, but its very fitting for the anime(8/10). If you don't like it initially, it will grow on you. Story(6/10) is sort of light, not too deep and characters go through only a bit of growth, although noticable. The best part is that the characters (for the most part) are quite well put together. They have interesting personalities, some extremely cute, some of a sort I have never encountered previously. (For example, Sakuno Uryuu, the main character's awesome sister, has this nonchalant, relaxed personality that is AWESOME. She is encouraging of her brother, but sounds reserved and cool at the same time. She was definitely my favourite character just because of her oddball personality.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother refreshing thing is that the main guy is not a complete wimp. I have seen too many harem animes where the main guy just doesn't want to make decisions and this is his flaw for the whole anime. That's a stupid flaw. There needs to be something else. Most of the time, I find that having the main character \"be too kind to want to leave the other girls\" makes for a very good storyline, and this is sort of the case for Mashiroiro. The main guy is a strong person, who makes good decisions, and ends up choosing at the end. This is what I like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very nice(8/10). Not a life changing anime, but in terms of harem anime, I have seen much worse. This one is in the set of \"better\" ones.",

I've never played the eroge, so it's kind of hard to really understand how the story was supposed to play out.\r\nThe story was kind of everywhere. It jumped from one girl to another and it was pretty obvious too. After Sena and he had gotten into a bath together, they never really talked to each other after that. It was really confusing because I thought they had become close or something after doing something like that. Anyway, I guess the story tried to get some story about all characters to fit into the 12 episode limit thatthey have been given which ended up messing the show up quite a bit because each girl pretty much gets pushed to the background after they have been in a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nNothing really needs to be said about art rather than average.

It is a truth that there are some scenes which male MC is forced to take a bath in same tub with some of fem characters coz the fem characters get in on their own even though they know that male MC already in the tub. But trust me,their body isn't being exposed or anything. So,don't worry,you wont see any ecchi nor hentai scenes in it :)\r\nwelllet's get on business now! (^^)/\\n\\n\r\nfirst, Story\\n\\n\r\n~as i said before,the story in this anime is cute and sort of realistic. The ending is also worth of applause. i'd like if this anime has a sequel,but well,even if there is no sequel for it,i think the ending is good enough coz there isn't much of thing left unanswered and i'm satisfied enough with it :)\\n\r\nand so i will give it 7/10\\n\\n\r\nsecond,art and sound\\n\\n\r\nthis anime have an outstanding art and the sound also suits the mood that this anime makes very well,may it be background songs,sounds effects,opening and even endings songs,it all left a deep impression on me, a well-done job on art and sounds indeed\\n\r\nand so i will give'em both each 8/10\\n\\n\r\nthird,characters and enjoyments\\n\\n\r\nhow to say this..at earlier episodes i though the amle MC will definitely end up with one of fem MC since the anime gives a lot of focus on this girl and so i'm kind of lost 1/3 of my interests in this anime. But,later,the mood in series changes and the neko club turns the story and characters development into something far different from earlier episodes. at first,the characters are all in for one ending then it turns out to be a harem fantasia, then later it turns out to be love triangle which makes me curious abot what is this anime creator really thinking ? but that is the interesting part which makes me run a marathon for this anime \\n\r\nand so i will give'em both each 7/10\\n\\n\r\noverall,i enjoy this anime and will recommend it to you if you lkes something that confused u in progress but ended in a wonderful endings. also,be patient to sit through out the first haf of series,it may seem like an obvious ending at first half but don't let it make u stop. Keep contiues on because that isn't the \"real ending\". The real ending is a lot more cuter than what you though what it was.\\n\\n\r\nthat is all.. Have a Good Time! :)\\n\\n",

I remember watching the first few episodes with a bit of a bored look on m face just listing of the archetypes of each girl. But eventually, I found myself drawn in. I am not sure exactly what drew me in but by the 6th episode, I could not stop.\r\nThe characters, while a touch one dimensional at the beginning grew heavily throughout the anime. Each characters grew personally and created connections with each other that I could not call at all. Each one was truly fleshed out and really made itfeel like the merger and their interactions with the protagonist had an effect on them. There were so many moments that had me lying back just surprised at the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was perfectly timed and really helped to create moments and move you as the watcher. The voice actors and actresses worked their parts perfectly and helped to create an honest story which almost felt like you were watching something that really happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and story were both phenomenal and yet I find myself with the least to say about it.  The art was a standard for the industry in recent years and show that this was not a project that was just thrown together. The story had me going from sitting back and relaxing as i watched the scene unfold to sitting straight up as a plot twist was thrown into the loop. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched in a long time. Many people will look at the Harem tag and dismiss this as a general trashy Harem show. All I can say to those people is that they are missing out and that this is without a doubt worth your time if you enjoy Romance Anime.",

If your looking for a fan service anime those anime does not have much of fan service close to none. If you are looking for a goodharem anime with lots of beautiful girls with different personalities then this anime is for you.\\n\r\nWhy its so Good:\\n\r\n-First & foremost the story starts out strong and is quite easy to follow\\n\r\n-The story is quite interesting in many ways it has large twists & turns which you probably never expected (Episode 4)\\n\r\n-The characters all have a different personalty. There not your typical boring old harem characters\\n\r\n-The story is made in quite a unique way with lots of girls & a caring brother and how he overcomes the feat of improving the atmosphere around him as a test student\\n\r\n-If you like anime with very little ecchi & some humor this anime is definitively for you and you should check out the first episode\\n",

I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).\r\nI am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it like the kechtup on the pasta and put things in the right context (i can't expect a complex plot for an harem)\r\nREVIEW\r\nPlot - 7\r\nYeah it's not bad at all; it's always an harem so for an harem the plot is totally nice. It is not simple andafter every episode the plot become more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nAbout the girls they are cute and funny and deserve a 7 for how they looks but they totally lack of \"soul\"; it's like see the usual harem girls, no one of them really was worth of note.\\n\r\nThe protagonist IS the harem clich\u00e8: cool, kind, good at everything but he got a weakness as  he stated \"i can't stand when the mood is down\"; oh my! That's really a huge weakness in an harem anime.\\n\r\nSo because the usual girls and the stereotype protagonist i give a 5: not too bad but totally not good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nHere is the boy. Here is the girls. If we are searching for a standard harem look no further, it's fair. If you are searching for something more \"elite\" and with characters well designed you should look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal tastes: I totally hate the protagonist, too perfect; he made me sick.",

            "content": "Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers.  Just your typical high school romance harem, right?  Well, in some ways it is, and in others it isn't.  The main idea behind this anime is the fact that it's a harem, but there is more to it than just that.  Since I don;t want to spoil any of the story for you, I will simply post a general review and you can decide for yourself whether you want to watch it or not.\r\nStory:\r\nMashiroiro Symphony is about a boy named Uryuu, Shingo who is, as many characters throughout the anime refer to him as, a\"nice guy\".  When a decision is made to merge his school, Kagamidai private, with an all girls private school, Yuihime, Uryuu's life drastically changes.  It is here where he meets our colorful female protagonists, and his harem slowly begins to form.  I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling anything, but I would like to point one thing out:  The synopsis above makes this anime seem much more perverted than it actually is.  Although it does have it's moments, Mashiroiro Symphony is generally a very clean anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the bright and colorful visuals used in these types of animes.  Every main character stands out from the others and the environment around them.  At some points it even feels like they may pop out of the screen at any moment.  Although some of the environments could be described as dull, the majority of this anime is presented in a colorful, and lively fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were both well done, and very fitting.  The background music that played during the anime was also chosen quite well.  It gave me the feeling that someone actually put some thought into what music they should have included in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this anime have their own personality and way they go about doing things.  Each character adds something to the anime as a whole, and it wouldn't be the same if even one of them wasn't in it.  Your not going to like every character (as is usually the case in the harem genre) but the ones you do like, you will most likely become attached to.  This brings me to an interesting point.  I actually could not decide which girl I liked best.  I have watched plenty of anime before, and the majority of them were harems, but I never encountered a problem like this before.  I was actually glad for once that the protagonist got to choose a girl, since I couldn't.  It was truly a moment to be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime may not rank #1 on my list, but it had its moments.  It was comedic at some points, dramatic and others, but mostly it was just entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMashiroiro Symphony isn't the best anime ever created, but is a good one to watch when your not sure what to watch next, and I definitely recommend it to all lovers of the harem genre.",

From the look of it, I guessed that it was based off of a visual novel. I've been a big fan of visual novels being turned into animes, I guess that's why I liked A Bridge to the Starry Skies, The Rose Madder Colored Hills, etc. So, I decided to try it. I didn't expect to find such a masterpiece.\r\nSo, story wise, nothing fancy. It's your typical harem anime that starts out with a boy coincidentally meeting what appears to bethe main character of the story when looking for his sister. After that, he meets a bunch of other girls, and boom. He has his own personal harem. What I was thinking at the time was \"This is almost a clich\u00e9 harem anime\". I mean, this is basically how all harem animes start. HOWEVER, as I started getting further into the show, my opinion changed. The thing about harem animes is that 99% of the time, the first girl he meets in the show is the girl he falls for in the end. 99% of the time, and that's a fact. With Mashiroiro Symphony, it pulled the carpet out from under me, and halfway within the series the main girl changed. I wasn't expecting that. That's when the story started getting good.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork was excellent. Actually, the artwork was why I fell in love with this anime. When visual novels get turned into animes, there's just something in the artwork that tells you \"I used to be a Visual Novel\". That may just be me, but either way, stunning. Absolutely beautiful. I loved the character art and the scenery. Gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I feel like I've heard a lot of the voice actors play in other animes, and by other animes, I mean other animes that used to be visual novels, so I was fairly happy that I recognized some of the voices in the show. Despite my love for the voices, there was a single voice that irritated the crap out of me. Sure, I liked the character, but when all he says is \"Pyu\" over and over again, it will seriously bug the hell out of you. I know it's a cat/alien, but at least let it have other things to say then \"Pyu\".\\n\\n\r\nFinally. I've spent years trying to find a harem anime where the main character isn't either:\\n\r\nA) A Pervert\\n\r\nor\\n\r\nB) Someone who get's flustered easily.\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Uryuu is the one lead harem character that doesn't annoy the hell out of me. Not only is he cool, but his choices in friends is 5 Star material. That brings me to the second thing I've been searching for for years in harem animes: The male role's best friend isn't a pervert either! Along with Uryuu, we got a bunch of other characters that made me happy to see. Sure, we've got a couple tsunderes, but we've also got an animal lover, a cool younger sister, and a hyperactive maid. +1 for the character designing.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed the show. I really liked it a lot. It took me a few episodes to really get into it, but I feel like I've found a treasure in the harem anime/visual novels that get turned into animes vault. Definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "When I first took a look into Mashiro-iro Symphony I never thought it would drag me in as much as it did. It took hold of my attention when I was watching, and didn't let go of me until I got though the whole anime; and yes I did marathon the anime for me it was that good. \r\n       I've always been a fan of romance animes, they're what I go to when I need an uplifting story or a sad one; this anime does it that bill of being one ofthe higher end romance animes that I've seen (and I've seen a lot of them). It may have had those slow moments, and those slightly inappropriate moments but over all I thought the storyline and character progression really overshadowed those moments making it a very good anime. Especially one that can throw around your feelings like it was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nThe story and how it progressed through each character is what I think make it worth watching. Each storyline per character had it's own story to tell, each one had their own part in the story that just made the anime, and it's characters click. It wouldn't have been a romance if it didn't have it's ups and downs right? The way those problems and resolves came in truly made this story very, very enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nI thought the character was really good, the uniforms were well designed and well executed in color. Each character had their own unique part of their character that made them different from other character designs I've seen in the past. Also the character expressions were really on point. Though there were little design mishaps, I believe in my mind that it did not effect the anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nI thought the intro was amazing, I even downloaded it because I like it that much. The sounds in the anime were well place during certain parts which really added to the mood of the setting. The only problem for me was there were some parts where a song or two would have played well, but were just blank leaving for some awkward moments but other than that I thought it was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nEach Character have their own story, which adds to the mood of the story. They all have their own backdrop that pulls you in quite a lot. To be fair, each character were individually good at playing their part in the story that it is without a doubt one of the harder times you can pick out your favourite (couple/person) because each one has their own good qualities.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime will forever be one of my favourites! \\n\r\nMashiro-iro Symphony = MUST SEE",

            "content": "Mashiro Symphony: The Blandness of Half-Ass Ville\r\nI've watched 2 episodes of the anime. That was all I could muster before I just couldn't watch anymore. This is a preliminary review, based on what I've seen so far, and experienced based conjecture as to where it's gonna go.\r\nThe best way to describe this is with one word: bland. \r\nBland, bland, bland. \r\nCharacters are extremely one dimensional. Any attempts to make them interesting or have the audience invest are cursory at best. This is especially true for the main character. He has no quirks, no eccentricities, no emotional palette. He has 3 emotions: smiling contentment, thoughtfully unsettled,mildly upset due to embarrassing situation. Even when he's supposed to be upset, it's amazingly uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\n He's the embodiment of harem tropes, the quintessential \"smiling nice guy with no particular talents or distinguishing characteristics who inexplicably has several embarrassing, sexually themed misunderstandings/encounters with one female protagonist who now views him with great disdain.\"  \\n\\n\r\nThe female leads are slightly more interesting, but even they are just super stereotypes within the genre. The situations they get put in (guy walks in while girls changing, guy somehow falls forward into their breasts, guy somehow ends up at perfect angle to look at their crotch) and their reactions to them them (sudden shock, anger, and violence, accompanied with several \"kyaaaa!\"s) have been played out a thousand times before. \\n\\n\r\nMy big qualm is not that it's not original, though. Originality doesn't mean quality. But, if you're using something that's been done before, you better darn well do a good job at it, or there's no reason to watch it again. This series is all so soulless, like the writers, voice actors, and animators are just going through the motions and have nothing better to offer.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have a rule that as long as something is even remotely palatable, I have to watch at least four episodes of it, so I will. In fact, I'll probably watch the rest of the episodes two, one fast forward, just to say I've seen them. And it might turn it around; but I doubt it. There's no indication that this will recover at all and turn into something worth while.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a tiny potential for a decent story here. An insignificant seed, where they could have done something good. They could have gone the school life and friendship(not romance) in realistic comedy centered route that Seitokai Yakuindomo went, or done something like Kaichou wa Maid-sama and brilliantly fused the school life/politics comedy with a budding romance, or they could have done something very romance focused, like with Kanon, Clannad, even Myself; Yourself (which is greatly inferior to the former two mentioned, but still largely superior to this series). But they didn't. Instead there's just this lame, limp pile of gruel. \\n\\n\r\nI have a deep seated hatred for series that waste my time by not putting any effort into doing something engaging. It's not a matter of pacing, lack of a standard story arc, or even mundane subject matter, as there are series that are amazingly engaging, even with slow pacing (House of Five Leaves), pure slice of life story lines (Kino no Tabi; Mushishi), and mundane subject matter (Azumanga Daioh) that are simply amazing, and make you feel like your life is now better for having seen them. It's a matter of the amount of effort and care put into the crafting of the story on the part of the artists that contribute to its creation. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is just super duper half-assed, and viewers owe it to themselves not to waste their time with this crap and instead go find something worth watching(see above mentioned series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is quite possibly the best anime that I've ever seen that has harem listed as a genre.\r\nI'm sure that you will all agree that the most annoying thing about any harem anime is the perverted characters who tries to hit on everyone/ gets hit on by everyone. Thus, I have more or less given up on the harem genre and steer well clear. However, this anime is like hope at the bottom of Pandora's box.\r\nI really like how the protagonist is not just a decent person for once but he cares so much about everyone around him. All he is ever trying to dois help (leading to a number of misconceptions). The story line is not about him and every other girl falling in love symultaniously but rather, it focuses on the development of a single girl's feelings... before disregarding them for the next. He takes everyone's feelings and attitudes to heart, and is always trying to help.\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly did not expect the ending of this.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: (Warning Spoilers)\\n\r\nAs I'm sure you've gathered from the synopsis, the series starts with our protagonist looking for his lost sister and when they find one another there is a girl, our other main character, from the presteious girls highschool with the sister. This makes you think, oh no - here we go again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a merger plan between the girls highschool and the protagonist's co-ed school and our protagonist, his sister and his (not perverted) best friend are enrolled in the experiment.\\n\\n\r\nOur main girl instantly makes the boys feel unwelcome and from there on its tsundre. The character development is mainly centred around her rather than every girl. But then suddenly, about half way through the series the main girl switches. Completely unexpected. The new main girl is also tsundre but more heavily so (if you know what I mean). She loves the protagonist but he doesn't seem to love her back. Instead he is falling for her best friend (who is the only one whom he actually loves).",

            "content": "Judging by the cover of Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of lovers, I thought this was just another typical cliche harem, you know, high school environment, different females for the male lead to choose. As I was progressing through the anime, I realized the plot was very \"unique\" and was driven by \"unique\" characters. Mashiroro Symphony does not follow the typical harem outline. Does that mean this anime was outstanding? exceptional?\r\nNOPE\r\nPersonally, I don't mind if a harem is cliched or not, i was not expecting a unique plot, just your typical average harem. even if it was different I wouldn't mind it. So what went wrong?\r\nSTORY(5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI found the plot of this anime to be very \"special\", and when I mean special, i mean retarded special. It is not centered on one plot, rather it follows different routes (personally I don't like this). This anime starts off like a very typical harem. You are introduced to your protagonist Shingo Uryuu along with his sister and another girl Airi Sena whom you can easily deduce will possibly be the main female lead. The first half focuses primarily on the relationship between Shingo and Airi. I enjoyed this half very much, as watching the two leads interact, I established a very fond connection for the couple wishing to see more in the later episodes. However after the first half, Airi whom is our female lead is no longer the center of attention, instead the anime focuses on two characters who are already introduced in the first half: Sana Inui & Miu Amaha and this is where the anime truly becomes \"special\". I found this to be very weird, the first half was good but why change routes? Even so, it was not subtle, I was totally not prepared for it, the next episode, they just threw the spotlight on Sana and gradually onto Miu. Personally I didn't mind this change as long as the story somehow developed a strong relationship between the characters but unfortunately this never happens and it was a disappointment. The ending was one of the most disappointing endings I've seen, it was not the original purpose of the anime and felt more of a filler episode. As I watched the end, despite being a very touching moment, I lost my sense of touch with the characters and I could no longer appreciate what I was watching. If i had to relate a color, it will be black, confused to what I was watching and seeing no light.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\r\nI will outline the characters:\\n\\n\r\nShingo Uuryu - Male Lead, a hardworking, caring diligent student (Main)\\n\\n\r\nAiri Sena - Female Lead for the first half, a rude posh girl who seems to have a huge dislike towards the opposite gender, she does not want to show her weakness and is willing to do whatever to be seen strong among her peers. (Main)\\n\\n\r\nSana Inui - A tsundere girl who's always picking on Shingo. Even so, she will go out of her way to support Miu (Main)\\n\\n\r\nMiu Amaha - Loves animals, is extremely hardworking in what she does and will do everything possible to protect injured animals. (Main)\\n\\n\r\nSakuno Uryuu - The younger sister of Shingo, unlike typical harem animes she does not have a brocon. Quite mature for her age, has a very good relationship with her brother and the other females. (Support)\\n\\n\r\nAngie Sewell - The maid of the academy, she has a huge passion for being a maid and is happy to perform chores for her master. (Support)\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead: Shingo Uuryu is very different from your average Harem lead, instead of the lazy, negligent or pessimistic character, our lead is quite the opposite, hardworking, diligent and caring. The very same can be said to most of the female characters however this leads to one problem: lack of character development. Not to say that there were any development, I believed Airi was developed extremely well coming off being hot-headed and rude to someone who could open up and depend on others when needed. However this is the only strong development seen in the anime. For Shingo himself, the already hardworking diligent student, how can you develop him? The fact he was perfect already flustered me, there were no flaws about his character which really was annoying to me. Even more so, he is dense.\\n\\n\r\n The story focusing on Miu and Sana was not developed well and thus has affected the way I perceive both characters. The first half of the story had left an impression on Airi and the immediate change of routes had caused me to become confused of the characters. The fact that there 6 episodes left and they were trying to develop 2 characters, it was not enough to help establish a connection with the characters, had the anime went 2 cour, this might not have been the case. Also looking at the character outline, it seemed difficult to create any STRONG development. There may have been development for Sana, but the story did not choose her to be the winning female thus her character was wasted. While there was development in the anime for those 2 character (Sana and Miu) it was extremely weak. The plot-structure of the anime also contributed to the weak development of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise our 2 beloved supporting cast, Angie and Sakuno had no character development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nEXECUTION (5.5/10)\\n\r\nFor Mashiroiro, it was rushed, there was excellent character chemistry between Airi and Shingo mainly because together Shingo helped Airi overcome obstacles, it brought out both characters really well  and at the same time made the anime enjoyable to watch. This is the only highlight of the anime as when the route switches over to Sana and Miu, we never see a glimpse of proper action, the fueling desire to help someone overcome obstacles. Sana and Miu's character while developed weakly never satisfied me while I was watching the anime. Their weak development also led to me not being able to connect with the character thus feeling no sorts of empathy during the touching moments of the show. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND (7/10)\\n\r\nNothing wrong with the art, infact I liked the way how Shingo was designed, a very mature looking person, something that looks quite different from the tradiational \"half-ass\" look of typical anime characters. The female leads however do follow the cliche design, cute-looking, innocent and beautiful. \\n\r\nNot mucht to say about sound either, I love the ED personally, not so much the OP. The music during the anime was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (6.5/10)\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime that breaks away from the cliche stereotypical harems that the industry have been shoving in our face for the past err im guessing 10 years or so then you might enjoy this anime. However, be aware of the sudden plot-change and lack of character development, it may leave you disappointed.",

            "content": "1st thing to say, do not judge a book by its cover. This is not your standard visual novel adaptation. I am surprised myself. I watched for now, up until episode 3 and was surprised by everything it offers me. In fact some says about the ecchi scenes things but it does not disturbs the story and believe me, you won't find any more of that scene starting from episode 2, maybe it's an element to attract 1st time watcher but I think the element does not disturb the storyline after the 1st episode.\r\n2nd, about the storyline, well, maybe pretty generic at 1st, the protagonistand his friends are transferred to an all-girls school BUT, The developments of the storyline makes up for it. The protagonist is a good person who was once respected in his old school and he continues his deeds. He may looks like a weak character at 1st glance but he makes it up by improving himself, a lot, though. That is why I feels the story can be very good but, be wary that it may drops dramatically halfway though. But the basis storyline from episode 1 to 3 does not disappoint at all.\\n\\n\r\n3rd, the art, ah, this is why I decided to continue watching it as the first episode was too generic in storyline and I have to thanks this element. From the Opening song till the end of ED, the art is so beautiful, well, we may found the character drawings a bit plain but, that is not why i kept watching this, I kept on watching because of the beautifully made environments which suits the character very well, I am surprised myself with the design of the extras though. In fact, the OP can be compared with White Album's OP, which is very beautiful itself.\\n\\n\r\n4th, sound element, hm... well, i like how the music is played, which it suits the situations and the special effect sound is very well synchronized with the situations too. As to be expected from most 2010+ anime though.\\n\\n\r\n5th, Character designs, plain, personality... hm..plain too... but the personality and character developments makes up for it, in fact this plays a lot of role this anime. I like how the characters developed. It is enough to make me feels like i should watch this till the end.\\n\\n\r\n6th, the enjoyment of the series, in this matter, you will find some exciting parts of many characters in the series, especially when the male protagonist found out something exciting about the female protagonist in the third episode. I smiled when I saw that scene though. Be wary though, this is slice of life and romance genre anime, so you won't find something too much of a surprise though, but it is enough to make you enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the overall was excellent. I would give it 9/10 but it may drops though if the director messes up after this episode. But if it continues its pace, I would put it on the same level as Kanon, Clannad, AIR and Angel Beats from Key. If you loves heartwarming drama and love, you will surely enjoy this, believe me :)",

            "content": "[contains some generalized spoilers, point of view from someone who didn't play the visual novel]\r\nMashiro-iro Symphony (TV) is one of the two visual novels adapted this fall season.\r\nFrom what I know, the Visual Novel sold extremely well[#1 Oct 2009], but it was also extremely average[7.68@VNDB]. Unfortunately, it being \u201caverage\u201d appears to carry on over to the anime. The characters are extremely generic and linear; there's very little character development [There's two tsunderes, the nice girl, the maid, and the sister]. In most romance series, relationships form, characters mature, they grow, they get more intimate with each other, it's gradual, but it's there. However, in Mashiro,it's mostly rushed development, and the development is more so for storyline, rather than for the individual characters. The characters are basically static from the pilot to the finale. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Mashiro is a visual novel, and visual novels aren't exactly the easiest to adapt. They have multiple paths in visual novels; you choose one of the girls and you see her being developed constantly, along with your own thoughts as the main protagonist. While in anime, you view the entire story in third-person, and it's not just one character being developed, but multiple characters. Given this, anime adaptations more often then not take the harem route, which usually isn't bad,; as long as they stay true to the characters [I don't really have any experience with the visual novel itself, so I can't really say how well or how badly they portrayed the characters, but they appear to be fine]\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, to sum it up, Mashiro is extremely predictable, and it's riddled with bad dialogue, and silly plot developments. But that's to be expected, it's a generic harem. As a whole, Mashiro is a pretty decent way to kill some time, it's not irritating to watch, and it does have its plus sides. It manages to create a pretty calm and enjoyable mood, it's relaxing. It has a fitting OP and ED, and the characters are generic, but they're not the irritating type of generic [like those over-optimistic shounen leads].\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the last two episodes are actually pretty decent, they \u201credeem\u201d some aspects of the show. It develops the characters slightly, but it's still rather linear. But, it did give a different perspective on things. In most harem romances, the guy usually dates the girl he picks, and the other girls basically fade away. However, in Mashiro, their thoughts are shown, and it's done pretty well. It shows how they cope with not being chosen. To sum it up, Mashiro is one of the better generic harems out there, it doesn't end with an irritating harem ending.\\n\\n\r\nObjective Score: 4/10. It's \u201cbad\u201d when it comes to actually portraying human emotions, it's rushed and it's pretty damn linear. But it's the type of  \u201cbad\u201d that isn't irritating to watch; it's \u201cbad\u201d because it's not the most original.\\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score: 5/10 : Mashiro on its own really isn't the most unique anime. It's generic, it's predictable, it doesn't offer anything new or rare. It's still enjoyable, but there's just so much room for improvement. But the enjoyability is still there.",

            "content": "Ow, another harem any with pretty characters! Something I like to devour every now and then. It even started of with a decent plot and 3 very strong main characters. \r\nWhen Uryuu, Airi and Sakuno were introduced in the first episode I was happy to find out none of them are your average harem characters. A pity this impression didn't last long.\r\nSakuno,who seems to have had issues in the  past and who could be a very interesting character, is sadly pushed to the background after just one episode. Airi, a strong looking woman, gets 3 episodes of glory but afterwords turns into background decoration.At the beginning of the series she yells out that she hates boys (though, at the very first episode she is extremely kind to Uryuu...) but you never actually get to find out why she hates them so much... \\n\r\nUryuu's alright for most of the series. He's not annoying and seems to be the only character who maintains his sanity. Until of course he falls in love, out of the blue, with one of the other main characters. \\n\r\nThe only character with any development is Sana, but she's your everyday crybaby so that's not really interesting. We can't forget about Miu-sempai of course. She's the character who wasn't actually introduced at the beginning but turns out to be one of the main characters... \\n\r\nIs there anybody still following this?\\n\\n\r\nSo... really there isn't much good to say about Mashiro-iro's characters. Most of the time they're just really confusing. \\n\\n\r\nOnto a more positive note: art. This is why I initially started Marshiro-iro. Airi is real eyecandy and so are all of the other girls. Unfortunately this too breaks down after episode 5 or so. Suddenly we get lousy lineart and even colouring isn't done properly. It gets better again at the end so overall it's rather ok. \\n\\n\r\nOpening and Ending songs were fun to listen too and the soundtrack wasn't too bad either. Nothing you'll remember the day after finishing the series but it sets the mood alright. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no real story development. It starts of with a boy wanting to improve relationships between two merging schools, but after a while that theme is forgotten and the story starts focusing on the suddenly appearing friendships. When the scriptwriter is done talking about that, he develops a little bit of drama around the Nuko Club. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't really enjoy this anime because I was constantly reminded that neither the characters nor the story made any sense. It was quite a rollercoaster ride, the kind you regret getting into though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very average, almost bad harem anime, nothing really worth your time unless you're a huge fan of this sort of anime. If you're looking for anything similar but way better I'd suggest Clannad or H20 ~ Footprints in the Sand.",

            "content": "I decided, based on what I thought was sound reasoning to check out Manglobe's latest release Mashiroriro Symphony: The Color of Lovers.  I'm not the biggest fan of eroge interpretations but when I have liked them they were usually produced out by the higher tier studios.  I dug the output from studios like Kyoto Animation (Clannad, Kanon, etc.), Shaft (Ef series), and P.A. Work (True Tears) because those studios were able to mask the usual problems with harem/game based series with great animation, direction or story writing. \r\nI don't play eroge myself so I am not too certain about how often the sourcematerial affects the quality of the anime but considering that certain studios like Kyoani tend to constantly make good products and certain other ones tend to put out the same crap every season, I'd wager the studio plays a big role in whether these types of series turn out to be successful.  For example, I understand that both Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate were made by the same game creator and were both just as acclaimed as games.  One studio did a fantastic job producing Steins;Gate and another put out an hot mess with Chaos;Head. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Manglobe looked like it was hurting a bit monetarily (as you can tell by cut and cover animation job in the penultimate episode of Deadman Wonderland), I had faith that they would try to be competitive with the top studios with Mashiroriro Symphony.  They did a great job of animating The World God Only Knows and I even figured they would try to go all out with a moe show since programs in this genre have the potential to give a good return. \\n\\n\r\nI was very wrong.  So far, I've spent most of this \u201creview\u201d discussing why I decided to watch this show rather than discussing the actual show for a reason.  There isn't much to say about the program other than it's generic garbage.  The plot synopsis is a boy from a regular school now attends a formerly all girl's school due to a school merger... and a harem ensues.  I'm not even the type of person who is turned off by that type of plot off the bat (why else would I watch otherwise?).  However, my view is that you have to distinguish yourself in this genre, either through quality or innovation, in order stand out.  Mashiroriro Symphony is poorly made and unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nAll the anime does is throw a bunch of 'gap moe' characters into a typical situation and has the main character being nice to them.  I know that's the general formula but if you don't add something to the general archetypes you aren't really producing anything worthwhile. While I would prefer that shows deviated from the general moe archetypes, if they are going to be used, they ought to be a skeleton or a starting point rather than having the archetype become the point where the character ends. \\n\\n\r\nAs the characters go, there's a little sister in there who is your run of the mill quiet girl character, and then there are four other girls who are 'in play'.  The most offensive of them is the maid character with the green hair.  I don't mind maid characters.  In fact I think a lot of maid characters are moe like Maria in Hayate the Combat Butler or even that spinning girl in A Certain Magical Index.  But, for anything to be successfully moe, you have to buy into the context.  An otherwise regular school isn't going to have a maid character.  The whole thing is preposterous and this isn't a gag comedy like Baka Test or something where you expect preposterous things.  So, first, she shouldn't be there. Second, there is nothing about her character beyond the things that comprise of the prototypical maid character. Her only trait is that she is a clumsy maid, which we've already seen in a thousand other anime.  When she is on screen the only possible reaction is to marvel at how spectacularly uninspired she is. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the green haired maid, there are two tsundere characters, one with yellow hair and one with red hair.  Again, there's nothing more to say about these two characters other than the fact of them being tsundere types. The only thing that separates the two is that the red haired one is a lot more emotionally embellished than the yellow one.  You do learn some biographical facts about them but there isn't much interesting about their inner lives other than their interest in the main character and maybe the red haired girl's interest in the purple girl.  \\n\\n\r\nThe final girl is the incredibly boring purple upperclassman.  She has a whopping two traits: she is nice and she likes animals.  A good deal of the show focuses on her involvement with an animal nursery high school club.  I guess one different thing I can say about this show is this sort of character would get a lot less shine in other harems; unfortunately, that's probably because the creators of other harem works realize that it's a bad idea to give the most screen time to the shallowest character. \\n\\n\r\nI get it though. A lot of these shows have the same character types without anything special added but a lot of them are actually watchable because of the production values.  That makes sense because something you already know about can still catch your attention when it looks great.  You will often see very cardboard characters in the Kyoani shows but they are so brilliantly animated that even if you are seeing something old, it's something old presented in a pretty way.  When the production is bumped up or at least stylized, you're seeing characters you otherwise know in a new, more magnificent light.  It's like seeing Final Fantasy IV remade in 3d and then in HD.  \\n\\n\r\nManglobe did a lacklustre job possible with art direction.  All the backgrounds, even ones that should look pretty, like waterfalls, seem like super-plain stock footage.  The whole show plays out with one camera angle and there are almost no innovative shots.  Even Pokemon has cool shots sometimes.   I realize that Manglobe isn't a money studio at this point in time but there was clearly no attempt to be creative with the direction.  The only notable thing I can think of is one shot where they close up from outside of a window on a rainy day and you still see the rain falling outside as if the camera was actually there. Even that shot didn't look as cool as it was supposed to. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and I hate to hate on a show but I just can't think of anything redeeming to say.  I actually did expect a lot from Manglobe before watching Mashiroriro Symphony and at the end of the day I didn't get anything.  I didn't even get into the  the various other problems I found but I think I've made my point",

            "content": "Mashiro-Iro Symphony\r\n\u201cWhite\u201d -a pure and unstained color but could be dyed by any other color. \r\nThe title of this anime can be translated as \u201cPure White Symphony.\u201d I agree with the author to go with this title. It\u2019s a very suitable title for such a pure, innocent anime. The story is rather simple, our male protagonist usually encounters with our heroine and many other female companions. \r\nHowever, it seem like this anime was written by two different scriptwriter.. This anime seem to be split into two where in the first part of the anime, the producers focused on one heroine and then on the secondhalf they switch to a different heroine and complete shut out the first girl. \\n\r\nAt first it seems very interesting, guy had an unusual yet friendly encounter with a girl and then the next day she completely changed her attitude. The first half was about how to mend their relationship into a steadier one which could lead to a happy ending. Until the girl secret was revealed and the female and male lead reaches a friendlier point in their relationship that was the end of that small arc. For a couple of episode we were introduced to the side character and then the second arc came. The first heroine was overlooked and was replaced in the second half. She took neutral role, the one who observed and gave advice. The second part we got to watch a different girl take the heroine role as she learn the emotions of having a crush and then supporting one\u2019s love. However this isn\u2019t where it ends because there is a third heroine which wraps things up nicely. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the scriptwriter wanted the effect of the various heroine but didn\u2019t issue the right amount of screen time to the third heroine which could have produced a much better effect. Although this anime have the formula for a classic romantic comedy anime, it lacks the depth of the story. I get the sense that in the end, the writer is trying to say that change isn\u2019t easy, it could be scary but people need to move forward toward the future. Also that anything is possible in the future because \u201cthe future is pure white, it could be dyed into any other color.\u201d\\n\r\nDespite phrasing this in the beginning of the anime and at the end there wasn\u2019t anything more about it in between which made this anime shallow. To summarize the structure of how the anime was laid out, I would say the first part was about gradually accepting other people\u2019s support and the comfort of having people who you can trust and the second part is learning about the next deeper feeling of emotion and that is love.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is so pure. All the characters are drawn so adorable and in such a cute fashion. This is one of the classic harem anime that is very comfortable to watch. AS a classic harem anime, we have the at least one tsundere, tomboy, the caring upperclassman and the carefree, energetic girl and of course the reserved girl who speak slowly. Nevertheless all character was drawn pretty much with the same facial feature which lack variety. Yet despite this feature, no other changes were made to differentiate this anime to the other romantic anime. The only thing to tell the characters apart is the color of the different hairstyles and their eyes. They also have a outline around their eyes the same color as their pupil. \\n\r\nThe music was very pleasing. The opening soon is very soothing and relaxing, the ending was very hyped up and energetic which suit the anime quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that this anime could be improved in some aspect, overall this was a good anime. It doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of fan service expect a little from the beginning but as a harem anime it did a nice job. It\u2019s a very simple anime, no need to think very hard, debating whether to watch it or not. It\u2019s very pleasing and sweet romantic anime to watch. I don\u2019t see any reason why not give it a try so for all you harem anime fans out there\u2026.Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\n~Later\\n\\n",

Honestly, if the anime had more drama and more episodes to deepen the plot then it would be one of the best anime. The story is basically a high school teenager male that is attending a former all-girls school as a test to see if it can go fully co-ed. He is kind and that apparently wins the hearts of several girls. What was hilarious though was that the plot wenttowards one route, then completely jumped to another with no transaction.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler (some-what)*\\n\r\nHe chooses a girl, like most harem anime, and then the rest have a pity party on the last episodes.

            "content": "Lately with VN or eroge based animes I have been under the conviction that unless the anime takes two seasons to develop, most of the time the anime will end up extremely hurried and overly condensed. Mashiroiro was a nice outlier for this, proving to be quite enjoyable while staying modest in order to accomplish this. Very innocent story, without a whole lot of drama, but it makes for something very relaxing to watch and does not leave you unsatisfied. Each character has their time, and very thankfully, they do not pull that \"You know who the main character is going to choose just becauseof the opening theme biasing her to the centre of representations of the characters\" crap that you always get. I don't want to know the main character's choice from the start in a harem anime. That's the point of watching it, to see how the guy comes up with a choice in the end. That's what makes things interesting. Mashiroiro honours this, and comes through with a choice you wouldn't have expected at all based on the first 3-4 episodes. I liked that part.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10) is pretty reasonable, having nice varied appearances and very nice natural effects. The sound is not a holy grail, but its very fitting for the anime(8/10). If you don't like it initially, it will grow on you. Story(6/10) is sort of light, not too deep and characters go through only a bit of growth, although noticable. The best part is that the characters (for the most part) are quite well put together. They have interesting personalities, some extremely cute, some of a sort I have never encountered previously. (For example, Sakuno Uryuu, the main character's awesome sister, has this nonchalant, relaxed personality that is AWESOME. She is encouraging of her brother, but sounds reserved and cool at the same time. She was definitely my favourite character just because of her oddball personality.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother refreshing thing is that the main guy is not a complete wimp. I have seen too many harem animes where the main guy just doesn't want to make decisions and this is his flaw for the whole anime. That's a stupid flaw. There needs to be something else. Most of the time, I find that having the main character \"be too kind to want to leave the other girls\" makes for a very good storyline, and this is sort of the case for Mashiroiro. The main guy is a strong person, who makes good decisions, and ends up choosing at the end. This is what I like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very nice(8/10). Not a life changing anime, but in terms of harem anime, I have seen much worse. This one is in the set of \"better\" ones.",

I've never played the eroge, so it's kind of hard to really understand how the story was supposed to play out.\r\nThe story was kind of everywhere. It jumped from one girl to another and it was pretty obvious too. After Sena and he had gotten into a bath together, they never really talked to each other after that. It was really confusing because I thought they had become close or something after doing something like that. Anyway, I guess the story tried to get some story about all characters to fit into the 12 episode limit thatthey have been given which ended up messing the show up quite a bit because each girl pretty much gets pushed to the background after they have been in a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nNothing really needs to be said about art rather than average.

It is a truth that there are some scenes which male MC is forced to take a bath in same tub with some of fem characters coz the fem characters get in on their own even though they know that male MC already in the tub. But trust me,their body isn't being exposed or anything. So,don't worry,you wont see any ecchi nor hentai scenes in it :)\r\nwelllet's get on business now! (^^)/\\n\\n\r\nfirst, Story\\n\\n\r\n~as i said before,the story in this anime is cute and sort of realistic. The ending is also worth of applause. i'd like if this anime has a sequel,but well,even if there is no sequel for it,i think the ending is good enough coz there isn't much of thing left unanswered and i'm satisfied enough with it :)\\n\r\nand so i will give it 7/10\\n\\n\r\nsecond,art and sound\\n\\n\r\nthis anime have an outstanding art and the sound also suits the mood that this anime makes very well,may it be background songs,sounds effects,opening and even endings songs,it all left a deep impression on me, a well-done job on art and sounds indeed\\n\r\nand so i will give'em both each 8/10\\n\\n\r\nthird,characters and enjoyments\\n\\n\r\nhow to say this..at earlier episodes i though the amle MC will definitely end up with one of fem MC since the anime gives a lot of focus on this girl and so i'm kind of lost 1/3 of my interests in this anime. But,later,the mood in series changes and the neko club turns the story and characters development into something far different from earlier episodes. at first,the characters are all in for one ending then it turns out to be a harem fantasia, then later it turns out to be love triangle which makes me curious abot what is this anime creator really thinking ? but that is the interesting part which makes me run a marathon for this anime \\n\r\nand so i will give'em both each 7/10\\n\\n\r\noverall,i enjoy this anime and will recommend it to you if you lkes something that confused u in progress but ended in a wonderful endings. also,be patient to sit through out the first haf of series,it may seem like an obvious ending at first half but don't let it make u stop. Keep contiues on because that isn't the \"real ending\". The real ending is a lot more cuter than what you though what it was.\\n\\n\r\nthat is all.. Have a Good Time! :)\\n\\n",

I remember watching the first few episodes with a bit of a bored look on m face just listing of the archetypes of each girl. But eventually, I found myself drawn in. I am not sure exactly what drew me in but by the 6th episode, I could not stop.\r\nThe characters, while a touch one dimensional at the beginning grew heavily throughout the anime. Each characters grew personally and created connections with each other that I could not call at all. Each one was truly fleshed out and really made itfeel like the merger and their interactions with the protagonist had an effect on them. There were so many moments that had me lying back just surprised at the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was perfectly timed and really helped to create moments and move you as the watcher. The voice actors and actresses worked their parts perfectly and helped to create an honest story which almost felt like you were watching something that really happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and story were both phenomenal and yet I find myself with the least to say about it.  The art was a standard for the industry in recent years and show that this was not a project that was just thrown together. The story had me going from sitting back and relaxing as i watched the scene unfold to sitting straight up as a plot twist was thrown into the loop. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched in a long time. Many people will look at the Harem tag and dismiss this as a general trashy Harem show. All I can say to those people is that they are missing out and that this is without a doubt worth your time if you enjoy Romance Anime.",

If you are looking for a goodharem anime with lots of beautiful girls with different personalities then this anime is for you.\\n\r\nWhy its so Good:\\n\r\n-First & foremost the story starts out strong and is quite easy to follow\\n\r\n-The story is quite interesting in many ways it has large twists & turns which you probably never expected (Episode 4)\\n\r\n-The characters all have a different personalty. There not your typical boring old harem characters\\n\r\n-The story is made in quite a unique way with lots of girls & a caring brother and how he overcomes the feat of improving the atmosphere around him as a test student\\n\r\n-If you like anime with very little ecchi & some humor this anime is definitively for you and you should check out the first episode\\n",

I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).\r\nI am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it like the kechtup on the pasta and put things in the right context (i can't expect a complex plot for an harem)\r\nREVIEW\r\nPlot - 7\r\nYeah it's not bad at all; it's always an harem so for an harem the plot is totally nice. It is not simple andafter every episode the plot become more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nAbout the girls they are cute and funny and deserve a 7 for how they looks but they totally lack of \"soul\"; it's like see the usual harem girls, no one of them really was worth of note.\\n\r\nThe protagonist IS the harem clich\u00e8: cool, kind, good at everything but he got a weakness as  he stated \"i can't stand when the mood is down\"; oh my! That's really a huge weakness in an harem anime.\\n\r\nSo because the usual girls and the stereotype protagonist i give a 5: not too bad but totally not good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nHere is the boy. Here is the girls. If we are searching for a standard harem look no further, it's fair. If you are searching for something more \"elite\" and with characters well designed you should look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal tastes: I totally hate the protagonist, too perfect; he made me sick.",

            "content": "Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers.  Just your typical high school romance harem, right?  Well, in some ways it is, and in others it isn't.  The main idea behind this anime is the fact that it's a harem, but there is more to it than just that.  Since I don;t want to spoil any of the story for you, I will simply post a general review and you can decide for yourself whether you want to watch it or not.\r\nStory:\r\nMashiroiro Symphony is about a boy named Uryuu, Shingo who is, as many characters throughout the anime refer to him as, a\"nice guy\".  When a decision is made to merge his school, Kagamidai private, with an all girls private school, Yuihime, Uryuu's life drastically changes.  It is here where he meets our colorful female protagonists, and his harem slowly begins to form.  I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling anything, but I would like to point one thing out:  The synopsis above makes this anime seem much more perverted than it actually is.  Although it does have it's moments, Mashiroiro Symphony is generally a very clean anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the bright and colorful visuals used in these types of animes.  Every main character stands out from the others and the environment around them.  At some points it even feels like they may pop out of the screen at any moment.  Although some of the environments could be described as dull, the majority of this anime is presented in a colorful, and lively fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were both well done, and very fitting.  The background music that played during the anime was also chosen quite well.  It gave me the feeling that someone actually put some thought into what music they should have included in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this anime have their own personality and way they go about doing things.  Each character adds something to the anime as a whole, and it wouldn't be the same if even one of them wasn't in it.  Your not going to like every character (as is usually the case in the harem genre) but the ones you do like, you will most likely become attached to.  This brings me to an interesting point.  I actually could not decide which girl I liked best.  I have watched plenty of anime before, and the majority of them were harems, but I never encountered a problem like this before.  I was actually glad for once that the protagonist got to choose a girl, since I couldn't.  It was truly a moment to be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime may not rank #1 on my list, but it had its moments.  It was comedic at some points, dramatic and others, but mostly it was just entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMashiroiro Symphony isn't the best anime ever created, but is a good one to watch when your not sure what to watch next, and I definitely recommend it to all lovers of the harem genre.",

All of the characters in MS were amazing, they all had their own personalities and you learn a lot about each of them throughout the series. One thing I really liked was how they portrayed the main character shingo, instead of being some idiot with a short temper or a pervert they made him a helpful and very kind person who was genuinely concerned about others. All the other characters had depth to them and were very unique in my opinion, even if their personalities were built off ofa commonly used quality such as a tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nart: the art in this show was simply amazing, the characters all had great designs, and were beautifly done. For those of you who really care a lot about the art in an anime you should definitely check this one out.\\n\\n\r\nstory: I thought the story started out great, an all girls school merging with a co-ed school so some students from the co-ed school go to the all girls school as a test. Then halfway through the plot seemed to dissolve and it became more about the nuko club and the group of characters feelings for each other which was actually enjoyable to watch and the change in the plot was actually done in a way so it transitioned nicely. I have to say the story actually really suprised me in the end and took some wierd twists, in my mind the best episodes are definetely 10 and 11.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed watching this anime even with all the sudden changes and twists, the romance was actually the best part since you really couldn't tell were it was going until it was actually happening. I must admit I was on the verge of crying towards the end of this.\\n\\n\r\nmusic:  while it wasn't the best part of the series they do a good job with the music, appropriate music for every mood.\\n\\n\r\nmy opinion (WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS)\\n\r\nI honestly felt bad for 1 person in this whole series and that was shingo, my reason is that yes while the others are hurt because he doesn't love them he's got to be the one who decides who gets hurt and who doesn't, he could either string them along trying not to hurt anyone and eventually hurt everyone, pick one and hurt the others, or pick no one and hurt everyone, either way he has to hurt someone. I feel a little peeved that they spent 5 episodes on airi just to toss her to the side and have him fall in love with miu, while I loved those two ending up together I just felt angry that they'd spend half the series completely on one character and then just have her give up and comfort sana, but then again thats also what makes the romance in this so hard to figure out. Episodes 10 and 11 are what really made this show great, while the rest were good those were the only two with any real romance, episode 10 suprised the cr@p out of me when shingo just snaps and confesses to miu. I had mixed feelings towards sana becuase while she did like shingo it was her own fault for constantly telling him she hates him. Shingo and Miu ending up together was great in my opinion, i could sort of see it comming but after the whole airi incident i was a little confused, i loved them describing each other as the same person when sana asked what they thought of each other. This was a great anime, I wish there could've been more but there's not much room left to add anything else, it's one of those animes that make you reluctant to watch any others so soon because it just won't be as good. \\n\\n\r\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading :D",

            "content": "Mashiro iro Symphony or Mashifony is a beautiful anime that tell a story of Shingo that meet various girls in girl's school which combine with his school. At first, the girls are opposed to this situation because due to the principal's daughter and also a student of this school, opposed it. The story flow beautifully and very enjoyable because shingo is a gentle, kind and caring person, he tries to solve this problem with a smile and thoughtful of other feeling. But that's why the girls are slowly but sure attracted because of the personality that shingo has.\r\nArt (9/10)\r\nThe art of this anime is beautifuland colorful ! look at the girls, background, and look at airi and other main girl ! so cute ! That's the main thing why my attention was at full mode when i watch this anime. Although in the half part till near the end of this anime, the art is somewhat decrease at quality. But when near the end of the series, the art is rise again.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYeah i love the sound of this anime too ! The OP and Ed are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? Well this a good thing too. This anime is filled with character development (Airi, Sana and Miu) although the MC is not influenced by Character Development. But i just think the maid (Angelina Nanatsu) and little sister of MC just like a decoration despite that they are main girls. In the series, not a single scene that can make you sympathize with those two. But overall, you will like a lot character from Mashifony.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell i give it 6 because there's something that have been bothering me when i watch this anime. Yeah, i was sure that this anime is good because of this beautiful story, but in the end, this anime fail to interest me. You know why? In the first episode, the MC shingo meet with one of the five main girl (not his little sister) and from that scene, the first appearance of this girl was very charming and you will think that 'this girl is the main girl'. Yeah right, that girl is the main girl. But just until episode 4. Starting on episode 5, this main girl is just like a doll that decorating the shows. This girl just appear to be a confusing girl because of her feeling. And then the other main girl appeared. And the worst is this 'new' main girl just overshadowing the first main girl till the end of this anime. Well that's annoying to me. Seriously. Not that i dislike the 'new' main girl, but the plot that transferring this 'main girl thing' is just doesn't quite right. The anime didn't have some good plot to counter that. For example Akane iro ni Somaru Saka, they have a scene (in episode 11) that counter the bad effect of this 'transferring main girl thing'. So that the viewers relaxed when they are watching the last episode and didn't feel cheated. \\n\\n\r\nIf that 'new main girl' is gonna be the main girl in the end, why the anime show us a charming introduction of the first main girl and make us hope that she will be the main girl till the end? Well, i guess we cant say that this anime is not good because of that alone. As i enjoyed every episode of this anime a lot. But ....  -_-\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nGood Music, Beautiful art, lovable character, fine story. If you like anime that shows a lot of cute girls and the pureness of love from the lovers of that anime, you should watch this. Of course if youre fine with that annoying 'transferring main girl thing'.",

            "content": "I review: Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers\r\nThis is not the typical harem, each girl has some annoying problem and the MC comes and tries to help, and then whatever he just fixes the show completely ignores its outcome. Not every girl in this show will be trying to chase around for his dick.\r\nBasically, this is a really watered down Clannad (first season), but it doesn't go as deep, nor does it have the humor (except laughing at how ridiculous the plot can be sometimes). \r\nThis is based on a hentai game by the way, the show pretty much had to pick 1 route fromone of the many other routes of the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are kinda retarded... Actually, really retarded.. It made me laugh at how stupid they are, but I guess after watching like, 10 episodes, you gotta pick which one you are rooting for, but damn are they stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThere is this annoying weird species cat in this show, but I just call him plot device #1 because when you see him, you better bet the MC is ganna run after it, finding a sparkly, shinny new BAE.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is a knight in shining armor, he is perfect in every way, which is probably why he has a harem around him. For being a harem master, he isn't stupid, which is a nice change. He is a little boring though.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC has a male friend, but he is also very boring. He doesn't have any level of bro-ship, not even close to Sunahara level. The show doesn't develop his character or anything, he becomes a useless character, you'll end up forgetting about him.\\n\\n\r\nI do like the fact that these girls start to realize that they  ARE in an actual harem, they are there for HIM. The group of friends circle revolves around HIM. \\n\\n\r\nThis show ends with him picking someone, it doesn't end with him getting with no one, like how some harems end, open-ended and all.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music, I don't really remember. It wasn't very memorable, maybe because I keep comparing it to Clannad by accident, but I can't help it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is super lazy. They barely move lol. That's okay for this type of anime though, they just need to open their mouths. \\n\\n\r\nDrama? A tiny bit, but not really. Wish there was more. I guess harems don't like to pry too hard into that stuff. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the show is kinda slow for being a 12 episode show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show shouldn't be watched unless you like to pick a girl and root for her, because the plot offers nothing for you but development towards which girl he ends up with. Also the problems they come up with are ZZZZ. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, please remember that these girls are really retarded. Damn If girls were this stupid I could make a godamn harem myself wtf. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show 6 out of 10 dumb anime girls   \\n",

The school atmosphere between he two distinct groups is heavy at first (due to the girls not accepting the boys) , but becomes a little lighter after the cooking class in the second episode.

            "content": "Why is it so hard to produce a decent harem? If harems were pointless excursions, it would\u2019ve been fine. If they were unpleasant, completely generic without a hint of originality than fine. Then it\u2019d be easy to review them and dismiss them. It\u2019s rarely the case. Often the anime hints it could be something fun, even as a light drama. All it would take is a little more character development, a few more quirks and a little more conflict.\r\nMashiroiro Symphony perhaps deserves credit that its path is less common in the harem genre. The harem aspect is the only thing in it that makes itmale-friendly. Anything else is so gentle, so fragile and cute that it fits the negative usage of the word \u2018gay\u2019. Nudity and sexuality are mostly absent. Hairstyles are all over the place, complex and detailed. Even Miu\u2019s hair, which goes straight down has a unique shape. Each piece of hair has its own curve.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s refreshing, since darkness is a persistent feature in fiction. Stories are rooted in conflict and changes, but the serenity of Mashiroiro Symphony is convincing. Many things point towards it \u2013 the characters\u2019 fairly pleasant nature, the gentle art style. Its limit shows quickly, but I doubt the limit is in the style itself. Rather, the creators stopped at creating a unique atmosphere and everything else is lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nOur tsunderes (yes, there are two of them) are out-of-place, especially Sana. Airi\u2019s insecurities become integral to development, but when Sana gets into tsundere mode she makes sure to kick the main character because she saw it on other harem shows. Somehow in a world where\u2019s little conflict and everyone\u2019s nice to each other, nobody points out how violent she is. Kicks to the face are quite serious.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters fare better, but their ideas don\u2019t work. As a male lead, Shingo is a little better. Then again, his competition isn\u2019t difficult. Not being a pervert or a dense idiot aren\u2019t praiseworthy qualities. You\u2019re praising him for not being something. What he is, is a tired character type that was done well one in big series but then everyone failed with it. Shingo is the good guy. He reads everyone, knows what they want and take every bad thing people throw at him with a smile.\\n\\n\r\nYou might remember this archetype from the Ender\u2019s Game series. Ender wasn\u2019t just a good guy, though. The psychology of it was apparent. Being such a person means containing others, understanding them and putting them above you means pushing yourself to the side. Humans are inherently selfish, so any effort to understand others won\u2019t be easy. Any sacrifice we make for others will affect us. Shingo\u2019s never really affected by all the good deeds he does. He faces the tsunderes like a Charizard facing a Rattata. Laughing it off once is fine, but every episode of self-sacrifice should take its toll. Shingo is just as dull as any harem lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters fare a little better, but only Miu is actually interesting. The creators had no idea what to do with the serene atmosphere, so characters end up either incredibly dull or pointlessly wild. Ange decides her sole purpose is to be maid, and what do you make of that? It comes off like a psychological problem, but the anime is too bright for this. As a funny personality it doesn\u2019t work since the world is too serene for it. Only Pannya (an adorable furball that should\u2019ve been Maromi famous) and Miu are interesting. In fact, Miu\u2019s personality is directly related to the show\u2019s nature and it gains steam when it starts exploring it. By the time it arrives we\u2019re at the last episodes, and there isn\u2019t time to explore it.\\n\\n\r\nThe basics of a decent harem is here. It\u2019s not annoying, and it focuses more on character interactions rather than embarrassing situations. The romantic conclusion is actually fitting. The two lovers have a clear basis for their relationship and if you seen it coming, that\u2019s only because it makes sense. It\u2019s all just a surface, a pleasant one but that\u2019s it. There isn\u2019t even surprise character deaths or a big explosion to notify you it reaches the climax. How bad is it to be stuck in the position of being pleasant, but not getting much of a reaction?\\n\\n\r\nPannya is awesome though.\\n\\n\r\n2 pannya\u2019s out of 5",

            "content": "Alright this is my first review so I'll try to keep it a little shorter. \r\nWhen I first started watching Mashiroiro Symphony I thought it was going to be another quick rom/com harem that was a light watch with no conclusion. Man was I wrong..... This show left me conflicted on who to feel happy or sad for. With only 12 episodes to work with Mashiroiro Symphony developed it's characters nicely, in particular **(Minor spoiler)** having the MC actually choose a heroine and openly be the one to confess to the girl as apposed to having each girl confess to the MC fist then achoice is made. Won't go into who is chosen or anything because spoilers are no fun. \\n\\n\r\nTons of laughs, tons of feels, overall a very enjoyable watch. Wish more romance/harem anime could learn from this example.\\n\\n\r\n-Story- 8/10\\n\r\nSo in my opinion the core story by itself is nothing exceptional. MC is introduced to an all girl school who is doing a temporary merger. Sound familiar? However there are a subtle aspects about the merger that you usually don't see. First off the MC isn't the only boy to be introduced into the school, and females from the previous school are brought along as well. So instead of a more typical boy introduced into an all girl world, you get a nice mix of both schools being brought together as a whole. After that the MC meets the cast of heroines and goes through a list of misunderstandings and other entertaining events before the show takes a more serious tone with the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\n-Art- 8/10\\n\r\nI didn't have any gripes with the art style, in fact I really enjoyed it. Color schemes felt complimentary and I felt the animation was very smooth. However while I liked the art style it was nothing groundbreaking or flashy either. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound- 8/10\\n\r\nAlright so I'm a little more conflicted on the sound here. The music during the show was constantly fitting and and in my opinion very well executed. However with the OP and ED I neither loved nor did I hate them. Although they did set up a fitting atmosphere for the show, thus the positive score. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters- 10/10\\n\r\nLoved the characters in this show, simply loved them. Each one felt like they actually had their own personality, and better yet each one was actually given a bit of development/depth. Of course you'll see the popular character archetypes but if this show was given the chance to be 24 episodes I think they could have done something special as far as character development in a harem. Also, MC isn't totally dense for once. Crazy I know. I mean there are still the misunderstandings and a touch of naive here and there but the guy showed more promise than most. Anyway as others have stated each girl is given some time in the spotlight as Mashiroiro Symphony keeps you on your toes as to who the main heroine really is. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment / Overall- 10 / 9 \\n\r\nI said I would keep this review short but I guess that was a lie. Overall I enjoyed this show very much and I'll admit that I did marathon it. It has a wonderful balance of laughs and feels with a story that wasn't needlessly complicated and was given a very sound conclusion. The sound conclusion part is something a lot of series lack so it was refreshing. All in all a must watch in my opinion for those who are a fan of the genre.",

But this one is really unique among all of harem anime.\r\nAlright,I know harem anime has a  lot of fan out there.Thats fine.\r\nFor me,I like to make a quickreview but includes all my perception about the anime.\r\nStoryline:\r\nThe anime start with very understanding storyline. I'm sure you will never get confused at all. For me,the understanding of anime storyline on first episode is the most important. Same as first impression of an anime.The storyline is quite unique this time. Usually,harem anime lead by pervert type character,but this is diffrent.\r\nArt and animation:\r\nThe anime art and animation is really something! Great to watch! Theenvironment and some of the effect are really good. No regret to watch anime with superb art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound:\\n\r\nBased on my experience,this anime has normal sound type like other anime. Yea,It still blend with the anime as well, but quite dissapointing of the theme song. I was expecting more romance like theme song,but I guess this one could deliver too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis anime has really rare harem anime character type. Not much harem anime has cool lead male character and not pervert. Thank God!. Bunch of cute and beautiful character with diffrent type of personallity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have to admit it. I really enjoyed the anime so far.The development is quite slow but as long as I can understand what is going on,thats OK!\\n\\n\r\nOVerall:\\n\r\nThis anime is a perfect anime for harem anime lovers(which is waiting for cool/not pervert type male protagonist). Great to view,great to watch and I recommend it to you.Just give it a try. So far so good!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now to be fair I have to give you the non-spoiler cold cut review, and then after that I have to give you my full uncensored opinion. But no worries there will be an indicator for the change of it. \r\n-Cold Cut Review-\r\nThis anime offers a very well animated style of art that is calming visually which matches ever so nicely to the nature of it's story. The thing that can be most appreciated is that it stays pretty consistent to one style of animation ,rather then switching from serious, to chibi for random scenes. Another thing to note is that the music was allvery well done, one problem being is that it was just \"well done\". It didn't really go above and beyond to really set the mood like some other, but at the same time that isn't really the point here, and though it may not be something that you yourself may not pay attention to, it is still worth mentioning for some of the music buffs out there. Again, that only really matters if you find yourself looking at the music as the mood setter, but this anime does a very good job of placing visual aids as a good amplifier for the mood that is desired. Specifically, weather seems to be a common choice for setting a good mood in this anime, and with all the visuals being very detailed and well drawn out, these moments are felt in full force. Unfortunately after you get passed the initial pleasantries of the visuals, and usage of scenes, the story seems oddly off. From a viewers perspective you sometimes find yourself getting yanked around as to what the real direction of the story is, and that made it very distracting for viewers sometimes. Not to say the overall story was bad but it just seemed a little too divided with only 12 episodes, and it jumped all over the place in intentions (for further explanation look for the uncensored). This all being said, it still did a good job of getting a laugh out of people, and it definitely brought out a bit of emotion. If your on the fence of watching or not watching, ask yourself three questions \\n\\n\r\n1. Do I feel like watching a romance \\n\r\n2. Do I mind a lack of sensible progression\\n\r\n3. Will I just take this anime at face value \\n\\n\r\nDepending on your answers to those questions I say go for it, it can be a very entertaining Sunday show to watch just for fun. \\n\\n\\n\r\nafter this line this is all personal beliefs on the anime, so if you don't wanna know, stop here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk this anime is one of the few harems that actually made me really mad. It seemed like the story writer tried WAAAAY to hard to make this not a cookie cutter harem, and instead of making a solid story, just kind of made a series of random events that kind of left me confused I'm almost completely certain the plot line changed 3-4 times (as a whole, not just episode to episode) through me watching this, and while each individual plot line wasn't a bad plot line, with just one season, I became frustrated with the lack of consistency. That also falls into the love life of our main guy, it just seems way to spastic for me to be able to fully sit down and appreciate. Especially since I feel like the final love interest felt like it was rushed into, but that could just be me. I personally hate the fact that in harems, sometimes they let the guy really buckle down on one girl automatically, and this cuts off the option to really get to know any of the other girls. In the case of this particular anime that really was the case, we got to know two girls really and then the rest was like a hit-and-run back story. The second thing that bothered me more with the dedicated pick, was that they put way to much emphasis on the girls that lost, and showed sooooo many scenes involving them down on their luck about the decision. It made me more agitated then emotional. This being said I just think that based on the introduction of the show, it should have stuck a little closer to home through out the series. There where also complete character changes that threw me off as well, like literally the personality of certain characters permanently changed in the film. I could have been missing something, but It all just felt really inconsistent and out of place. \\n\\n\r\nNow what was good was that if you took at literally just episode to episode, there were a lot of really well written moments, and there were also times where you would laugh really hard. Or there were times where emotions inside you would be sparked. It's because of these things that I still say go, watch this anime. It will entertain many of you harem seekers, and will excite the romance seekers even more. just don't look for any depth on plot lines, and don't expect to much character development. I wish I could explain it more, but it would require hard spoilers. But anyway guys thanks again for reading, I hope you enjoy this anime, I thought it was a cute little watch. \\n\\n\r\nHave a wonderful day :3",

            "content": "If one is to look on the surface of Mashiro-Iro Symphony, one would be hard pressed to see anything that was not seemingly riddled with cliche and the usual tropes typical of visual novel anime adaptions. What is remarkable about this show though is actually how it tends to subvert or twist these tropes into a surprisingly pleasant, soothing watch.\r\nWith the limitations imposed on studio Manglobe to do this adaption in one cour, they truly deserve a pat on the back for their efforts. The production values are pretty solid, and though the character designs may be simple, they are rather pleasant to watch. Butmost of all, the directing choices for the show were rather great. Knowing they could not cram in an arc for every girl, they decided for the better good to relegate certain characters to the background more. So instead of the typical rushed adaption that has been seen one too many times in the past, Manglobe succeeded in making a well paced, complete product. The pacing of this show is so important though that it is easy to see how this product could have gone easily wrong in the hands of some other, less competent studio.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and the atmosphere of the show is something that cannot be disregarded. Mashiro's strength is how it creates a soothing calmness for its audience. In a sense, it almost feels like a healing anime, one that you can expect to sit back and relax to as you let the show carry your daily worries away. It is not a show packed with tons of dialogue that one has to think hard to sort through its details, nor does it have chaotic events that require alertness, it just merely treads along at a nice slow pace that makes for quite the pleasant experience.\\n\\n\r\nStill though, this could not be made all true without its cast. Again, what's remarkable about Mashiro is how it turns its tropes and cliches on their face. In this show we have the tsundere that does not quite act like a tsundere, and the sister character who is not played up for some sort of incestuous relation. If they include a fanservice scene, the characters do not ever really overreact in ways typical of anime such as the guy getting clobbered by the girl or the like. The males are not shown to be such perverted pigs that are willing to do anything to get into their pants. While there is a sense of a harem in the show, the male lead is not so incompetent so that you question the girl's sanity for being interested in such a pathetic existence. He exemplifies good character, is extremely kind and thoughtful, and it's quite easy to see how some of the girls would come to be interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nReally, these qualities make Mashiro-Iro Symphony truly special to me. It is a show that does not see a need to bury itself in typically annoying tropes or cliches. Couple this with a lovely cast of really pleasant people, and you get an anime that you cannot help but find endearing. For anyone not opposed to the genre of visual novel anime adaptions, Mashiro-Iro should be a sure winner.\\n\\n",

            "content": "All my scores are subjective with the basis of a 7 being \u2018average\u2019. My scores are based off of my enjoyment rather than objective standards. Please read the entire review if you want reasons to why I like/dislike a series.\r\nMashiroiro Symphony is an adaptation of a visual novel by the same name. The visual novel has you following routes trying to get with one of the four main girls. Adapting a VN into an anime, usually anime studios would have to choose a route to animate, do a totally new anime story, or mix and match routes to try and put in a bit ofeveryone\u2019s. What this anime does is mostly the latter, it has aspects of everyone\u2019s routes in it, but eventually the main character DOES end up with someone, which can be surprising from a harem anime where the norm is open endings. Other than the fact that the MC does choose a girl, the anime itself is not half bad and only suffers from being an adaptation of a VN.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked:\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, what I love the most about this series is the that the MC does end up with a girl, and it feels satisfying to finally have a conclusive ending to a harem. The anime also seems to not suffer from the usual harem/ecchi tropes that plague the genre. All the characters in the show are likeable (all the girls are wife material) and the main character isn\u2019t annoying or dense, the girls don\u2019t throw themselves at him, and there are very few echo scenes(mostly at the beginning of the series). The character development is the strongest point in the series; each girl has their own arc with some longer than others, but you do see positive development from all the girls by the end of the series and each girl does have a logical and reasonable sense of progression. Oh, and best girl wins :)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\\n\r\nThe anime is adapting a VN, and by doing so, they decide to take bits of every girl\u2019s route, and some of the development is kind of lost by the end of the series and you wonder \u201cWhat's the point of them doing X if it doesn\u2019t really affect the ending\u201d. The anime would have been better off if it just stuck to one route. Other than that though, there isn\u2019t really much wrong with this series, but there isn\u2019t really much going for it either.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if you\u2019re interested in a harem where the MC does pick up a girl, then give it a shot. Other than that aspect, there isn\u2019t really much to the series, it doesn\u2019t light a spark within me and I can\u2019t really pinpoint the reason why. Maybe it was because some of the arcs were rushed? Maybe because they tried to fit in too many routes? Or maybe because the climax was a bit\u2026 anticlimactic? I don\u2019t know; and it doesn\u2019t mean the series is bad, it\u2019s just\u2026 nothing really stands out. It is still an above average romance/drama IMO and you won't be wasting your time giving it a try.\\n",

            "content": "Mashiro-Iro Symphony (or whatever the hypenation), is more or less pretty good anime for harem. Instead of having a lucky bastard out there (S.S.D.D.), the main character (Shingo) gets one girl after a plot twist in middle of airing. Most fans gone rage after that twist, though. In one forum, they made a big GRP bet and lost after the twist.\r\nThe story is well-developed with some twist after first third (or half, or maybe quarter, depends on the definition of \"plot twist\" term). As an eroge derivative, none much expected from the story. Skip this part to avoid spoiler.\r\nMashiro-Iro's art is quite standard for anime.This might be caused by the tendency to \"play it safe\" by making the character as normal as possible. The \"normal\" here is obviously moe for girls and average for boys. The environtment is also well-drawn, but there is a glitch. The cut-down tree in one very small spot, what's the point of having it?? Only the author knows.\\n\r\nThe sound is unbalanced, that causes a penalty. Opening Song \"Authentic Symphony\" in Romaji is excellent, and that song is put on the primary playlist for some anime enthusiasts. Ending Song \"Suisai Candy\" is fall short of expectation, making that song is the source of penalty. Others are relatively fair with some fluctuations. Effects are standard, skip it.\\n\r\nCharacter is fine with something strange that causes a penalty. One character that also defy the basic laws is Miu's mother,which one can call as MILF. The character's heights are inversely proportional to their age (WTF!?). \\n\r\nFor extreme case, Sakuno and Miu; Sakuno is still 15-16 yet 162 cms tall, she is still growing for another 2 years and she could simply as tall as 170 which is abnormal for Japan's standard (Japs normally have 158 for girls after growth age); Miu is 17-18 and 146 cms tall, that is also quite out of standard. No one knows what's in the designer's head.\\n\r\nEnjoyment achieve perfect score thanks to the fan-service after the second half. For instance, Miu just appeared naked in front of Shingo (WTF!?).",

            "content": "Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers is a 1 cour anime. If the anime can be describe in numbers it would be. \r\n\"180\"\r\nThe anime starts off with the main character Uryuu, Shingo who finds out that his sister Uryuu, Sakuno is lost. Even though she was told to stay still so that her brother can find her more easily over the phone. Her eyes caught an interesting little creature and she decides to follow the little bugger. While making her brother life more difficult her cellphone batteries dies and to top things off rains started pouring all over her! However all is not lost. Luckilyshe finds a tree and hides under it. While waiting for her brother she then encounters a friendly person named Sena, Airi. She aids Sakuno by letting her use her cellphone. Sakuno calls her brother and they have an awkward 3 way conversion over the phone. Shingo eventually figures out a plan and tells the ladies to meet at a park. They finally meet up and Shingo gets to meet Airi, Astonished by her beautiful charm and bust. \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point for someone who has watch a lot of \"harem animes\" It would easy to deduct that this guy is a main character! This girl is so kawaii! The final episode must be a kiss scene with each other! Easy Deduction, case solve.\\n\\n\r\nNope, what this anime deliver is quite a curve ball. A 180 degree turn. Yin Yang.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime develops 2 female character very well. Keeping the anime interesting. However the other characters not so much. For female viewers might learn something interesting about men. However as a male viewer it was hurtful to not see the harem ending the way we want. Most harems genre anime usually ends in cliff hangers but this one doesn't so if your interested in watching an anime with a decent build up and an actual ending to a harem genre anime. Then pick this up.",

It is so obviously based off an eroge game, it kills, it really does... \r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe story is the most unoriginal pile of poo and while didn't sound too awful written, when watching it became overly obvious that it was just so the male protagonist would be placed in the most convenient place possible to form a harem. You could clearly tell the writers had no intention of making the story remotely good, only to make a quick buck from some popular eroge game.\r\nArt 5/10\r\nThe art being the high point of the anime,the one and only. It wasn't bad looking and I did find the character designs to be \"cute\". That's about it... nothing more to really say, it wasn't great and it wasn't awful. Mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was almost unbearable, they were clearly reading off a script to the point it just seemed like they were yelling out, \"Hey, I'm reading my lines.\" OK,  maybe I over exaggerated, but it was bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had potential to be good, but every time they develop their personality, it immediately changes in the next episode, leading to one of the most bipolar and unoriginal, cookie cutter character cast I've seen in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime to be total garb and not worth the time of day for any one individual. This anime is better suited as a punishment or a challenge, god only knows how I was able to sit through all of it, because I haven't a clue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was clearly aimed for the fans of the visual novel/eroge game, and I don't see how the ratings are even somewhat decent. Please don't torture yourself, DON'T WATCH! Also, I would like to state that I did little to no back ground research, as in I really don't know if there's an eroge game for it, but watching it, it just seemed obvious.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\\n\\n\r\nIF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE SERIES, I APOLOGIZE IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS. IT WASN'T INTENDED, THESE ARE JUST MY HONEST OPINIONS OF THE ANIME!\\n",

            "content": "This is definitely not the best anime in the harem anime genre, but this series does have many elements that make it worth watching and appreciating.\r\nIn harem anime, it has become a staple to have a clumsy, awkward and... well... stupid male MC who is, for some reason, likable in some regard which attracts girls to him. When I think of a harem anime MC, I think of Keitaro from Love Hina. This anime however takes a step back from that and gives us... the most generic \"nice guy\" I have ever seen. This character doesn't have a personality. He is just... nice. He getsverbally taunted or abused... nice. He gets kicked or punched... nice. He gets labelled a pervert due to a typical \"misunderstanding\"... nice. He is too generic and nice for my liking. My \"perfect\" harem MC is Keima from The World God Only Knows. This is because Keima has a personality. A very distinct one and not usually common among the genre. A brilliant strategist with no desire to meet girls or have friends. He is cold, ruthless and dedicated to his craft... but he knows his stuff and it creates an interesting dynamic when he is introduced to different character types and elements because he can adapt. This guy in Mashiroiro, is the same no matter who he encounters or what he is doing... nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. The truth is that this anime is like pandora's box... you open it and all the good stuff flies out immediately and all you are left with is hoping that something interesting occurs. \"Oh I know, lets have the entire group release a squirrel that we never knew the story of or cared about... lets make it last like 6 minutes.\" Bah I say. The premise of them being transfer students and the attempt to fit in is dropped nearly entirely about 4 - 5 episodes in. Instead we focus on naming cats, a girl who runs away and cries a lot... while abusing the boy she \"loves\" verbally and physically... and then we have lots of pointless \"nice\" talking. Boring. It is enjoyable however. Just don't expect anything to blow you away. No school dance or festival... just worrying about cats.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the main character cares for everyone around him makes it uninteresting as he is nice to everyone. I could just as easily see him confess his love to the cat... thing... as I could a female character. While he does try and help everyone... a character that just helps people without any reason or backstory as to why he has to help others so much is... again... boring. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime suffers from ADD. For one part, you have the story centered around Sena and the MC. They make a big deal out of this... a lot of episodes... and then out of nowhere she vanished. Literally. She is just... gone. Only seen in a few passing by shots. All that build up for that?! At least have her fade out gracefully. Geez. I understand that because harem anime now have a reputation for being \"by the books\" that they have decided to try to throw the viewer for a loop... and while I don't mind who he ends up with. It is another case of wasted potential for the sake of a plot twist. Another anime I saw did that. It was called Shuffle!... it had an amazing premise that they flushed down the toilet in order to change pace halfway through to try to be \"unique.\" Garbage. Don't drop a premise that works in an attempt to be even more clever. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Very cool premise. Well executed at first... then it dissolves into a boring but enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nART: I liked it. Smooth. Looked good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Good opening intro and I like the piano throughout.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: MC is a super swell guy. Other characters are interesting and fun.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: High. It is boring... and the characters are a bit lacking but it is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nREWATCHABILITY: Zero. I will never watch this one again.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Its good. Virtus Signum gives this one a 7/10. Give it a watch.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this anime more than I expected to, I also find myself hating it for certain reasons I can't say due to spoilers, however I can say it has to do with romance situations.\r\nStory\r\nThis anime is about two schools who try a merge, some of the students from a mixed gender school go to a all girl academy.  Now you can imaging the reactions from some of the girls at this all girls academy. Anyway Shingo tends to be the mid-way point in a sense, all though not all students like him any better, but he seems to help. He essentially starts gettinginvolved and thus create the plot points of the story, making drama, excitement, and more. I really did enjoy the story overall however like many \"harem\" anime we all don't like the love choice or however you would like to put it. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI really liked the art, I liked how the characters looked, all the way to the trees, now I am not so picky on art so long as I can see what everything is and its not drawn like a 4 year old would draw. Anyway this art made everything easier to look at and made the story look a whole lot nicer, especially the cherry blossom scene at one point in the anime. I just found the art made certain scenes a whole lot nicer as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNow I was not very fond of the OP, and ED however usually I can at least listening to it a few times however I really don't know why but I couldn't. I found they were okay but not the best. I also didn't really notice the background music popping out to me or even really helping make scenes stand out more. I realize that maybe I was not paying attention enough but there was two times it did stand out so I am going to assume it was just the music not being good enough for me. If that makes any sense. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNow the main characters all got some screen time, we found out most situations, however there is one character that was my favorite she was a key corner stone to the story however she did not really get a \"situations\" it was more of a \"this is why I said this\" kind of thing, and I was also disappointed because of another issue with this same character, and this is me just expressing my opinion due to my favorite character being rejected.\\n\r\nAnyway overall the character development was okay, all them got screen time, and there was no real cliff hanging character development at the end, unless you count being curious about a certain characters feelings when it all ends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs I stated many times in this review, I am pretty upset about a certain character, however that does not change the fact I enjoyed the anime. I do wish the ending was a little different, well I wish things were different from around episode 8, but I still think it is worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI think if you like romance anime you should watch it, if you like animals go and watch it, if you like anime maybe go and watch it. I really think it is one of the better \"harem anime\" so please give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nP.s If I am getting it wrong and it is in fact not a harem genre then please excuse me. However I believe you all get my point.",

            "content": "Allow me to preface this by saying that the only thing barring this from a better review from me was its depressing brevity. I felt like this could have easily been at least a 25 episode show, and it ended all too soon. I ranked the story as a 7 for this reason (given more time and character development, it would have been worth a possible 10). \r\nI began watching this expecting another fun, rom-com harem. Oh, and the end of the first episode made me thing that perhaps some forbidden romance with his sister was brewing as well. Thankfully, my expectations were rather wrongon all accounts. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the main character was NOT a douche-bag. (Perhaps oblivious at times, but isn't that a requirement for a male high school character in an anime?) In fact, he was a rather admirable, kind hearted guy with a soft spot for animals and a penchant for wanting to help people. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the harem aspect, yes, it seems that all the main female characters were in love with the male protagonist. However, the way they dealt with it seemed surprisingly good to me. The story spent more time developing the ways the girls dealt with their unrequited feelings, and I felt like I watched each of them mature a little over the course of those twelve episodes. My two favorite girls dealt with their feelings differently--one with brave stoicism, the other by shedding many tears before realizing how to move on. But it seemed great, and was a real tear-jerker in parts. Although the girl I was rooting for \"lost,\" I still like the way the show ended and the girl the MC ended up with. I'll probably watch it again in a couple of months.",

I'm not even going to pretend like I remember any of the names from this show, because that's how much I wanted to forget this anime. This anime centers around a guy who transfers into what was formally an all girls school with along with some others in his class. What ensues is the repetitive, redundant marching out of potential partner candidates for the main character. Well, that's pretty much what I would expect out of this genre, so no harm. However, the pacing of the story proceeds to suckthe viewer in for a good 6 episodes thinking that the OTP (one true pair) is with a tsundere girl who initially resists the idea of having boys in her school. She eventually warms up to the idea and develops feelings for the main, only to be completely left out of the 2nd half of the script until for virtually the last episode. The proceeding next five episode focuses on a girl who has trouble dealing with her growing feelings for the boy and even goes towards great lengths to even have him notice her. In the end, the producers produce a big eff you plot twist as if to say that the first 10 episodes you just saw don't even matter. If they were serious about putting forth any sort of entertainment value into resolving the last plot twist, there weren't have been as many female characters, because given the length of the series and the number of charcters the show had, most of the characters were about as interesting as a piece of cheese. The roles that were actually focused on were written out for who knows what reason? (marketing eroge???) and the end result is that a very pissed off viewer who feels as if he's just wasted 5 hours watching this.",

Something that suprised me in terms of the plot is that the developers tried to be a little unpredictable when it come's to the main girl, it's a suprising move. And some may feel alittle unsatisfied (including me!) who the main protagonist ends up with.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent. They aren't anything special if you have watched many romance serie's before. It's the same kind of setup you usually get from a romance-anime like this. And you won't dislike none of the characters only less, your girl is losing.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much for me to say other than that the animation in this anime is beautiful, in terms of both character design and the environment.\\n\r\nand I see the developers have spent good time on boh sound and art.\\n\r\nI especially loved the sound to Pannya! I found myself always smilling everytime I heard something come out of Pannya's mouth!\\n\\n\r\nMy final impression of this anime is good. There wasn't anything I was really disappointed about.\\n\r\nBut I have a minor complain. Something I think the developers had served on, is if they would I have gone with the same setup like Amagami dide.\\n\r\nThat way all the people who were watching this would have been satisfied.\\n\r\nAnd each of the character could have gotten developed more then they did.",

I came to watching the series with no knowledge on how the anime would have been played out.\r\nStory: 5\r\nPretty basic Harem story, the Main Character Shingo at first is not liked by the girls in the story apart from his Sister and through his kind ways wins them over one by one.\r\nArt: 7\r\nThe lighting and the visual colouring of the characters and the environments is much better than quite alot of anime's especially when it comes to little details such as slight blushes andchanges in the characters expressions. The Colour's used are bright and smooth so they do manage to attract your attention.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe Sound fits in well with the anime, but pretty standard music overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe typical Harem characters are involved in this anime. The main character (Shingo) who wins over everyone through his actions, The Tsundere with Sana Airi, The Maid Angelina Nanatsu Sewell though why a Maid was needed I still have no clue.\\n\r\nYou have Shingo\u2019s younger sister Shingo Sakuno who in my view was the best character there who supports her brother yet doesn't get too involved and stops any conflict from occurring.\\n\r\n Then you have Sena Airi who in my mind isn't that much of a Tsundere but at the start she definitely shows it.\\n\r\nThen you have a Senpai Amaha Miu who is the wise person out of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI've found this show to be alright to watch, but it doesn't catch my attention for me to want to hope for a second season, because it just hasn't left an impression on me to want to watch it again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nA pretty standard Harem series has the typical characters and the sub-standard plot. It could have improved by not having the clich\u00e9\u2019s in a harem anime series, but it's worked for alot of them so why change the formula :/. This show can be watched without leaving you feeling like you have wasted your time but it will not leave a lasting impression. \\n\\n\r\nThis show stands out from most harem's as the MC is actually decisive and picks one of the select girls instead of having the typical harem end. That's why I think this show is worthy of a 6 just because it has a definite end to the harem\\n\\n\\n",

Characters who seem after the first few episodes to lack any real depth or development and a series that will rely on Fan-Service or Ecchi moments to pull them through this 12 Episode series...............How wrong i was.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe Story is a little different with the aspect of the main character, Uryuu Shingo & others having merged schools. His school Kagamidai Private Academy is now being being merged with the \"Elite\" Yuihime Girls' Private Academy. This creates obvioustension with school mates sticking to their own groups and the boys in the merger to be somewhat alienated by a certain section of the Yuihime School thinking they shouldn't be allowed to be there as it was an all \"Girls Only\" School.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this was the \"Initial\" which i felt was rather unique for a School/Romance series. After this the story developed a Club story which is the driving force for the later part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed the story, But did find it lacking a little, After the unique aspect to start with it just became \"Another\" Club orientated series, It just didn't really have another idea to go onto and solely relied on the Character development to get them through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs i hinted before this felt like more of a \"Game\" adaption, The characters have nice perhaps over the top styling,  But it works + Also the background art and everything else is superb, Aired 2011, But far better than some i'm seeing today in 2013.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nAll the female voices were really nice, my slight criticism would be some felt a bit too similar but you're bound to get this slight problem in many \"Harem\" type series. My personal favorite was Miu Amaha (Rikimaru Noriko) who's voice was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\\n\r\nFrom my opening paragraph i mentioned that i felt this series was more similar to a Visual Novel/Game, What i mean by that the first few episodes just made me feel like the characters would be rather simplistic and really have no depth or personality to them, How wrong i was. The more the series went on they gave enough information for the people in the Harem to understand them more and you really do become attached to certain characters even if the outset you didn't think you would. \\n\\n\r\nThe Romantic \"Harem\" part was really done nicely and is a staple for any Romantic show, The story did run dry at points and many episode near the end Mashiroiro Symphony simply relied on the characters to help them get through the episodes, I for one felt this part of the show was so strong and is refreshing to see development done this well in a series i perhaps thought wouldn't have this depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nMashiroiro Symphony to me is a nice surprise, Something i felt that would another really average Romance series that had no real development or plot turned out to be a big surprise and a series i thoroughly enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe series even wrapped up the romantic aspect and even gave additional \"Bonus\" Episodes to give the twist of how the other arcs could of finished which i felt was a nice touch\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, A very nice and well rounded Harem/Romantic series that i would highly recommend, The score is tough because 7 felt a tad too low yet 8 too high. So in the end i went for 8.",

An elaborated plot like this made me wonder who would be Shingo's girlfriend all the time! Still, its conclusion didn't seem right...\r\n{STORY - 5/10}\r\nBoth Kagamidai and Yuihime academies are being merged. Shingo had the opportunity to meet Airi just before it started happening. But the sweet personality of hers drastically turns into \"tsun\" during the welcome cerimony, as Airi doesn't agree with all this situation.\r\nA lot of prejudice against boys is shown. Still, Shingo strongly believes that both Kagamidai andYuihime's students can get along. Some particular girls start seeing him as a sweet and adorable guy, always able to help and never losing his temper.\\n\\n\r\n {ART - 6/10}\\n\\n\r\nIt really differs from usual VN based animes. Eyes are big, but pupils aren't \"square-like\", they're rounded. Actually, I saw some other works with an unsual design, like Chu x Chu Idol. Moreover, outlines used on pupils are pretty good and overall eye design is amazing! Scenarios are simple, nothing that draws too much attention.\\n\\n\r\n {SOUND - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nEffects used are reasonable and overall backgrounding is good. OP song is amazingly matching and a great one as well. Song chosen for the ED fits Pannya dedicated theme perfectly, as it is cheering and adorable, just like her.\\n\\n\r\n {CHARACTERS - 4/10}\\n\\n\r\nOur male protagonist, Shingo, is a true gentleman. He struggles to see all the girls smiling, doesn't let anything pull him down and keeps calm, despite the union-related problems. His little sister, Sakuno, innocent, quiet and cute, relates well to the other girls and cares for Shingo and his relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAiri was the first of the girls Shingo met. As the director's daughter, she tries to make let good impression wherever she passes by, eventhough she decided to live alone, denying financial help. She can be really temperamental at first, but time spent with Shingo affects the way she thinks and acts...\\n\\n\r\nMiu and Sana, friends and founders from the Nuko Club, are key characters on this anime. Miu, calm and sweet, takes care from the animals at the club and is the one who first met Pannya, being the one she loves most. Sana is the kind of girl who can't show her feelings, and tries to burry them at all costs. She hides a fragile personality and feelings developed for Shingo make her want to always stay by his side...\\n\\n\r\n {ENJOYMENT - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good anime, but its ending left an empty feeling on my chest. It was concluded and everything. However, Shingo's final choice disappointed me... It made me feel bad for the girl I was hoping for him to choose...\\n\\n\r\n {OVERALL - 6/10}\\n\\n\r\nBringing boys to a girls-only academy is obviously problematic. Shingo takes this chance to get closer to Airi, despite and critics and despise. His perseverance, combined with his gentleman's attitude, slowly change Airi's opinion about the union. Shingo ends up surrounded by beautiful girls, but who would be the chosen one? Until last episodes, it's really tough to know... Small twists change the course of this anime a few times, but would Shingo be able to make the girl he loves happy after all?",

I just finish watching this anime so its time for a review.\r\nToday I will be review Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers (\u307e\u3057\u308d\u3044\u308d\u30b7\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30fc\uff1a\u604b\u4eba\u306e\u8272)\r\nStory: At first its was a pretty basic storyline where one boy gets very lucky when five girls fell in love with him and so-called battle each other with events that occur but at one point of time it surprised me with a twist and I fell in love with the series but very late in the series.\r\nArt: The character designs are good but to me the eyes were not good because around theeyes there is a colored  line which really irritates me like crazy. Background was very static with little to no movements except the night scenes with Miu.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not really interesting and quite plain except in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Voice actors were actually good but just a bit more and it could be great.\\n\\n\r\nShingo Uryuu: A very very basic male character which you can get jealous off easily.\\n\\n\r\nSakuna Uryuu: She TOO plain and should not be counted as a main character!\\n\\n\r\nAngelina Nanatsu Sewell: A maid who is always happy and cheerful but a bit too into her job.\\n\\n\r\nAiri Sena: A very bossy girl with a strange background.\\n\\n\r\nSana Inui: Shana I..mean Sana is a tsundere redhead which reminds me of Shana from Shakugan No Shana.\\n\\n\r\nMiu Amaha: A sweet and kind girl. She is a year older than all the other main characters, She also has a pet named Pannya.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Didn't enjoy it a first but it was great and surprising in the end but I felt wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good towards the end but because of that it is not too good.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended age to watch: 13+",

            "content": "I truly never take the time to write a review, but this time I felt it was necessary. This anime had great potential but ended being a painful experience.\r\nThe anime starts with decent quality, MC is a typical harem guy who can't do anything but smile and be nice. That's the MC from the start to the end, with no flaws and no development to be done through the story.\r\nAll the girls start the same, being archetypes of a harem anime too, but at least they all end having some kind of development, specially two of them, only one girl remained being a common shyanime doll until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I said watching this becomes a painful experience because the anime builds up the story for the other girls, trying to make you feel something for them, and when you finally start caring, the show makes an anti-climatic pairing of the MC with the only girl with no backstory, and if that wasn't enough they show us with great detail the suffering of the other girls.\\n\\n\r\nTruly this is not the worst anime that I have ever seen, but I rate this so low because of the annoyance it made me feel, a similar thing that happened with baka to test ending.",

However on the romance side, I didn't really like how it turned out since it wasn't what I expected it would be. I expected it to be more romantic and a bit of humor I guess. The ending was the one that was a little too boring.\r\nBut the characters were the one that kept me going since they were well designed and makes the viewers fall in love with each one of them. \r\nOverall, if you are oneof those who love to watch anime's with cute and beautiful girls, this anime is just for you.",
