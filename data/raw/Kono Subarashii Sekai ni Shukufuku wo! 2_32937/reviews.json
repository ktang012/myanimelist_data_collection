            "content": "KonoSuba\u2019s second season is here and it\u2019s a fantastic follow up to last year\u2019s fantasy/comedy series which deservedly became a massive hit among the anime community. \r\nOne of the strongest points of this series is the characters and their interactions, Kazuma is one of the weird cases where I find the protagonist to be the best character of a comedy anime, he\u2019s just such a lovable troll that has to deal with the weirdos around him, the first of them being Aqua, a cute but useless crybaby that has a godlike talent for performing party tricks. However, outside of that she lacks any other abilitiesdespite being an actual goddess. Most of the time she\u2019s a hindrance to the group but damn she\u2019s great.  There is also Megumin, a chuunibyou that wants to see the world explode (and she will be the one doing it, one explosion at a time). Last but not least there\u2019s Darkness, a holy crusader that does her best in the front line, blocking the attacks of the enemies in order to defend her allies\u2026 well, that and to enjoy the pleasure of being hit, just masochist things. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast are great, the side characters are certainly capable of stealing the spotlight. For example, there's Wiz, who is supposedly on the bad side but is probably the nicest person around, and Yunyun, another crimson mage like Megumin that really needs some love and headpats, poor girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very enjoyable to watch and their wacky, random adventures are always hilarious. Their gags stay fresh and funny due to all the different situations the characters are thrown into. \\n\\n\r\nThe RPG-like world adds a lot of variety to the comedy via fantasy elements and characters/monsters. Most series that use this type of setting tell a more serious story but KonoSuba uses it for comedic purposes. It\u2019s a great, well-executed parody of the genre. Even the supposed \u2018enemies\u2019 are hilarious characters that add a lot of fun moments to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nExcluding the first episode, that for some motive had a derpier look, the art of this sequel was like in the first season, shining in showing the multiple reactions of the characters with comedic faces that add a lot to the humour of this anime. The music is\u00a0similar to\u00a0the first season, with a special mention\u00a0for\u00a0the new opening \"TOMORROW\". It does a great job of showing what the anime is about, a bunch of weird people having lots of random, fun adventures. It's so easy to get in the mood for an episode once that opening starts playing.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who really enjoyed KonoSuba, this sequel offers the same great comedy while putting the characters into new different hilarious scenarios. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season.",

            "content": "Konosuba is pure, unbridled stupidity. Kazuma and crew are so unbelievably lacking in their mental faculties that it is a wonder how they are even capable of putting their own clothes on every day. That they even know how to breathe is surprising in its own right. \r\nWhere most other anime in the fantasy genre-- Danmachi, Re:Zero and others of its ilk-- attempt to be absolutely and relentlessly serious at all times, Konosuba does away with the very notion of seriousness. It exists solely to be laughed at. And sometimes it does a pretty OK job at creating said laughs. It never aims to bea 'good' anime (least not in the traditional sense), and criticising it for not being such is kind of missing the point.\\n\\n\r\nIt just becomes a bit difficult to keep laughing when they repeat the same jokes for the fifth or fiftieth time. \\n\\n\r\nDarkness is a thundering masochist who mentally orgasms and gets foamy-mouthed whenever she is treated poorly. The first season already made this joke several dozen times, so I get it. Kazuma will threaten her by promising to do unspeakable (!) things to her body, and, the deviant that she is, squirms in delight! No, look, I get it already-- I really, truly do. Her mind is so perverted that she will twist a friendly conversation into a suggestion of her being sexually assaulted by monsters and--- PLEASE, KONOSUBA. I GET IT. I get it, OK?\\n\\n\r\nFor as much of a joke as Konosuba's characters are, there is only so much comedy they can create by repeating the same punch-line until the ends of time. There are other, more interesting things that can be done with Darkness' character, surely. If this were pornography then maybe, perhaps, her characterisation would get a pass, but comedy requires considerably more effort than \"oh gee golly I am like so horny right now.\"\\n\\n\r\nAqua, as tantalising as her mini-skirt is (and I have spent many a moment admiring her womanly curves), falls into much of the same issues, with her two defining traits being that she is a narcissist with an ego the size of Darkness' breasts, and a crybaby who falls on her knees and wails at the top of her lungs when she doesn't get her way. Her gags, almost invariably, follow a pattern of these two traits: she uses her status as a goddess to demand favours and respect, and then breaks her character and cries immediately after. A little bit more involved than Darkness' 'gag', sure, but it is still repeated to the point of nausea. \\n\\n\r\nKazuma is likely the more interesting of the lot, since he at least exists as more than a vehicle for a single joke. He is not developed by any means-- lord, no, he is a complete dunce from beginning to end-- but his frequent switching from idiot to straight-man does at least provide some variety to the gags. Kazuma is a jerky little twat, incapable of respect and prone to molesting the opposite sex, and his assertive nature does well to set him apart from all the other spineless protagonists of the genre. His over-reactions to all the ridiculous nonsense around him (often the direct result of Aqua's or Darkness' actions) are often still amusing, too, even if 'dude yells at stuff' may not exactly be the most artful style of humour. You almost feel bad for the little bugger - I would probably want to off myself in his situation, too. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot to say about Megumin, considering she is pretty well non-existent for 90% of what happens in the second season. She's unquestionably the most sane of the four (though that isn't saying a whole lot...), and the one least susceptible to repeated gags. While the first season pushed it a bit by making her defective explosion magic and chuunibyou nature a recurring theme, the second season has next to none of it. And that's a good thing. I just wonder if, cute as she is, she might be a bit too normal the second time around.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba just never capitalises on what made absurd comedy series like Osomatsu-san and Gintama so clever. There is wonderful opportunity here for it, as one of the only non-serious fantasy anime, to take the piss out of other titles in the genre and properly satirise them. Part of the joke is that the Gang of Stupid are woefully incapable of combat, unable to progress as one typically would in an MMO or fantasy world, and are able only to defeat monsters and enemies through luck and by surprising them with their colossal stupidity, provided they don't just scream and run away altogether. That's an amusing reversal of the genre's tropes. But that's all there is. There's no actual \"satire\", no parody to be found in Konosuba - it is standard manzai comedy, living, and dying, by its own strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Konosuba is without merit, or that watching it can't still be a fun time. If you enjoyed the first season or just want a short, easygoing anime that doesn't require much thought or focus, then, hey, it does its job just fine, even if it may at times feel more like a greatest hits compilation. Konosuba is a big, dumb show and it knows it. I just don't think that being dumb is an excuse for laziness.",

            "content": "In the end of Season 1, I thought the story was actually going to go somewhere. But as soon as I was halfway through season 2, I realized nothing really happened to further the story. I thought season 1 to have some potential so I came into season 2 with some expectations. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. \r\n3/10 story: \r\nThere was little to no story. This anime felt more like a slice of life than an adventure type anime. \r\n4/10 art:\r\nThe art was a big let down compared to the previous season. It seems they just rushed this out to get some profitquickly. People say it fits the anime, but an anime can have good art while having their characters making retarded faces. I feel like detailed retarded faces would be funnier. I honestly think even fan animations on youtube have better quality.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 sound:\\n\r\nNothing really caught my ears during the anime, but I never skipped the opening and ending songs at least. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 characters:\\n\r\nI don't think I like any characters and that's in a bad way. In It's always in Sunny in Philadelphia, they are all assholes to each other, but I like them as characters. But in this anime, they are all assholes and I don't like their characters. Darkness in any situation is a pervert and is never serious. This really gets annoying and it was never funny in the first place. Aqua reminds me of an annoying version of Shinpachi from Gintama. All she does is scream and complain. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Megumin is an alright character though. Besides from the refusal to learn another trick than explosion to help the group, she's probably the least annoying. Tbh I kinda like Kazuma as a character. He's interesting and steers away from the usual cliches. He doesn't take shit from other characters even if they're a girl and voices his opinions on things. Like equality and such. Most of the characters are presented as is and they don't seem to have another side to them that we can learn about. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 enjoyment:\\n\r\nAlthough this anime overall was disappointing story wise and comedy wise, It still got a few chuckles out of me, just barely. Nothing major really happened. I don't mind anime with no story or being episodic, but at least be really really funny like Saiki, Gintama, The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, Nichijou, etc. \\n\\n\r\n5/10 overall:\\n\r\nI'm not being a hater towards this anime, I just wanted it to go in a different direction. This had the potential to be one of my favorite comedies, but all the jokes were just sex jokes and they explored nothing more than that.",

The fun ride continues from the first season and we get to see Kazuma and his friends up the usual antics. The plots are funny and the story is mostly based on the manga(which is good thing). I would recommend that you read the manga along with the anime.\r\nThe story progresses as the same in KonoSuba 1. The crew is up to their usual pranks and you get all of them together. Also joining the journey is the cute Chomsuke, who has become a sensation on the internet(Idon't know why). \\n\\n\r\nThe sexy masochist Darkness, cute Megumin(and her cuter friend YunYun), the great Damegami Aqua Sama and our hero Kazuma. along with the their friends continue completing missions. The story continues just from where the first season ended and we see our heroes fighting terrible monsters and doing brave deeds(I am joking).\\n\\n\r\nThe plots are great and so are the sound effects.

            "content": "Consistency is hard to find in comedy. Many shows can be funny some of the time, but few can build off their initial success to keep an audience engaged for the long haul. Konosuba avoids the common pitfalls found in its genre by building off the success of season 1, getting even crazier in its lampooning of trapped in another world tropes and continuing to satirize its characters who find creative ways to fail at life.\r\nHaving already established the character cast and running gags, season 2 is able to hit the ground running immediately throwing viewers into the thick of a prosecution against Kazuma whoyet again can't catch a break from misfortune. It takes a mere 30 seconds to remember why we were so fond of Konosuba to begin with, and the comedy never loses it's momentum from there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought the characters were lazy idiots before, it's taken to another level where they're given the stage of an entire season to show just how ridiculous they can be together. Kazuma becomes the one true king of trash, Aqua an even bigger mess of tears and unwarranted self confidence, Megumin commits one adorable act of embarrassment after another and Darkness discovers creative new ways to flick her masochism switch. There's even a new character introduced in YunYun who's just as weird as the rest.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any popular anime sequel there's a lot of criticism being levied towards Konosuba that I'll address here.  The arguments aren't necessarily incorrect - the art style is worse and the party doesn't make substantial progress, but these complaints show a lack of understanding of the point of the anime. This is a parody. They are supposed to suck. The joke is seeing just how many ways they can manage to make their situation even worse than before. The fact that they even managed to exit the town this season is cause for celebration, and of COURSE within minutes of leaving they run into another issue. \\n\\n\r\nBeing beautifully animated wouldn't make Konosuba's humor any more effective. Some of the funniest moments are when the characters devolve into a frantic mess of panic like when Aqua cries herself into a moving blob. The opening theme, easiest place for animators to make beautiful, has a scene with all the characters dancing out of model and only a few seconds later is a gorgeously animated Megumin explosion. The final episode has some of the best animation of the Winter season interspersed with some of the worst. It's all intentional and works well for this show.\\n\\n\r\nAfter two strong additions to the comedy genre, Konosuba has inserted itself among the funniest anime in recent memory. A must watch series for those who can enjoy parodical slapstick humor, I pray that a third season is on the horizon for even more adventures from the worst group of travelers in virtual world gaming history.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED EVERY FEW EPISODES*\r\n*Updated as of Episode 9*\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 can be described simply as \"Disappointing\" or \"Mediocre\". There was lots of hype around the second season, however, thus far, it has been a mess. That's what I initially thought, however, it seems like KonoSuba Season 2 is just overrated. \r\nThere are many problems with the second season of KonoSuba. Firstly, the art has gotten worse compared to the first season. There are many scenes where it feels like the animators just got lazy and didn't do their best. The character faces sometimes look weird with the eyes in \"interesting\" positions.The art isn't bad compared to other anime, but it isn't what it used to be, something that the animators could feel proud to have produced. The characters are also less detailed but the backgrounds are fine. It feels like the studio and animators have gotten lazy or maybe just didn't have enough money. Keep in mind that this anime has lots of fanservice and sorta feels like it could be an ecchi. After a thorough examination, the art isn't that bad. It's definitely a downgrade but it isn't bad. There are some parts where the framerate feels like I am using the crappy internet, but the problem was the animation. (Mostly Ep6)\\n\\n\r\nThe story has been mostly filler for a majority of the episodes that have been aired so far. Nothing serious is happening yet, only time will tell if the story actually gets better. Many episodes have been detached from the main story and do not add anything new. After many episodes, there is finally some story development and things start happening. However, I'm not sure how long this will last. Any plot development is limited by the character's stupidity. This is getting pretty annoying for me.\\n\\n\r\nMany new characters have been introduced and some seem promising, however, there is a lack of character development and most characters are one sided two-dimensional characters. The main character Kazuma is as funny as he was in season one. I think he has gotten funnier but the rest of the cast isn't doing too well. Over time, some of the characters get a bit annoying due to the lack of change and they keep making the same jokes again and again. The characters are more like a bunch of weird traits stuck together with crappy glue. Some of the characters *cough Aqua cough* get pretty annoying at times because she resets all the progress the team makes during the episode. This makes the story more painful to watch. Many of the characters have very large breasts, which can get annoying because of the fact that almost all of the female characters, except Megumin, have abnormally large breasts. If you love large breasts than this anime would be great to watch for you. If not, it may make the whole experience worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are good like the first season and there are no problems with the VAs. The background music isn't memorable at all, like in most mediocre anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, most people don't watch KonoSuba for the story, but for the comedy. In my opinion, season two is very enjoyable to watch and even made me laugh out loud a few times, which isn't too common. My personal enjoyment is pretty good at a 7+. Personally, I don't want to review anime based on my enjoyment, but I prefer to show you the facts and let you decide if you like it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to laugh a bunch with some fanservice in between, then KonoSuba season two should be on your \"Plan to Watch\". I look forward to laughing for 25 minutes each week. It is one of the best anime this season, even though the winter 2017 season is quite weak in my opinion. It is rated too high in my opinion, but typically most comedy anime are rated highly. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want something with a more in-depth plot or characters, then you could consider skipping over KonoSuba unless it gets significantly better later in the season. Even though I do not think KonoSuba is the best thing in the world, it definitely isn't a bad anime, not even close, but it is also far from being something amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns. \\n",

            "content": "KonoSuba 2 had potential to be much better than what we've gotten so far , but it gets bogged down by bad art and animation, characters who are mere caricatures, and an inability to decide what it wants to be.\r\nThe story is a direct continuation of the previous season. The first episode follows Kazuma as he gets arrested and tries to clear his name. This whole season will essentially follow Kauma and his adventuring band as they face (many) hiccups along their ultimate goal: defeating the demon king. A pretty standard goal for a fantasy setting, but we all know that KonoSuba differs when itcomes to its execution. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what made the original season of KonoSuba so unexpectedly entertaining. KonoSuba is a parody of anime set in a fantasy world (see: Sword Art Online), and most of the entertainment comes from how the character tropes from that setting are either subverted or exaggerated. Part of the reason why the first season seemed so entertaining was because of the novelty; what KonoSuba was doing felt like a breath of fresh air in a stale room filled with innumerable \"set in a fantasy/game world\" anime . However, by now, the novelty has worn off. KonoSuba is doing the same thing with its characters as it did in the first season, but it is no longer as entertaining as it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a few quirks that provide for most of the comedy in season 2, but by now you should've noticed how the characters' personalities are defined almost only by their quirks and nothing else, which starts to become stale. In fact, most if not all of the characters can be summed up in one sentence. Buxom masochistic knight. Chuunibyou explosion loving loli wizard. And so on. So far, there is little character development to speak of. I know that that is par for the course for comedies. Character development isn't very funny, so it is sacrificed for comedic antics, but KonoSuba is not a plot-less show. As the plot develops without the characters significantly developing, the discord between the character and plot development becomes more and more apparent. And mixing comedy and character development is not impossible, it has been done before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, this might actually be the worst part of the anime. The art was a significant step down from season 1, even for my untrained eyes. The episodes aren't consistent either in terms of art quality. Talking specifically about the character designs, they aren't detailed enough. From certain angles, the characters have a shadow of a nose (which is just a speck) instead of having an actual nose. And the boob sizes were unnerving and unnecessary. I was left wondering how all those women weren't wearing back braces to deal with the back pain caused by the weight of those boobs. You may think i'm exaggerating, but some of the characters had boobs that were bigger than their heads and had the movements of sturdy water balloons. It was comical, and not in a good way. The anime isn't following the source material in this regard, so that isn't the reason. The art otherwise is more or less the same it was in season 1. Bright colors with each main character having a particular color scheme, and pretty backgrounds. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music was decent. The OP is upbeat, the ED is lullabylike, and both fit the show well. The other situational tracks aren't memorable, but they serve their purpose well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne more point of contention before I wrap up this preview is how KonoSuba is slowly (but surely) going from a parody of the fantasy anime genre to becoming one of the anime it parodies. Assuming you consider parodies to be separate, it is possible to be both the thing you parody and a parody of it (Seto no Hanayome did it, and it did it well), but my first impression from season 1 of KonoSuba was that it was a clear cut parody. Let me clarify: KonoSuba slowly starts incorporating those fantasy anime tropes that it previously lambasted, and rather than a parody it starts becoming a comedic anime set in the fantasy world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I know I may have criticized it quite a bit, but KonoSuba 2 is so far still a decent show which will definitely be a source of entertainment for people who enjoyed the first season. I know I will finish watching it (eventually) when it finishes. I just think it could've been much, much better than what we have so far.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I ended up dropping KonoSuba 2",

            "content": "I will tell you this now, I'm too lazy to type up a big review. This is basically the main parts you need to know. \r\nI don't really know why people are saying the 2nd season is \"overrated\" or \"messy\" but I think It hasn't changed as much as how some people think. I realized this for long time now, anime gets more criticism than it deserves. I suggest you ignore the reviews rated 6/10 and lower for this anime or you may be lead in their one sided thoughts. \r\nIf you think the change of art or animation makes it worse, your mostly wrong.In my opinion the change makes it funnier and more enjoyable. For instance, the animation in the opening is more entertaining. I watched the opening with great interest, this was due to the art and how the characters acted. Of course this also refers to the actual anime content, its rather unique if I must say so. Not all people will understand the true qualities of the art since they want the very best of everything. What you shouldn't expect is beautiful scenery and a blissful fantasy world with very detailed characters. When you go into this you should expect it to be less serious and more sketchy for the comedy. So far I've only found a few flaws in the art, that was during the ending and in episode 6,7 and 8 area. It was a low camera angle slowly showing Kazuma and co.. I didn't like any of the character art during that scene. It was difficult to take in seeing the characters I adore like that. Another flaw in the art was the art for Aqua in the ending song, though this might just be my own problem. This might be another problem only for me but I didn't like the CG for the wagon and the horses. I know that it's cheaper but it looks very bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is perfectly in sync with what's going on and works well with the comedy. The soundtracks are 10/10 on specific parts and makes some scenes better than how they would be if it had no sound (Manga as reference). This area is in the clear and only has 1small flaw that is again personal, the ending song. The ending song wasn't good enough to make me watch it, I usually just skipped. \\n\\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, a few parts didn't stay true to the Manga. That is only for the content I read in the Manga (since the chapters are rarely released...). I know from the previous season that content gets changed a lot but it's still funny in the end so I'm not going to continue.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I got bored of this at the end. The sudden seriousness with the sketchy characters was kinda... you know eh. The art of Aqua at the end was virtually cr@p and was uneeded. I'm not sure if they did it on purpose to make it funny or what. It took me a long time to finish this and it dropped my score. It may be different for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I love it: \\n\r\nThe laughs. Honestly though I laughed so much during a episode I swear people heard me. The best trait of the anime is the comedy and the #1 thing I love about it.\\n\\n\r\nBy all means, watch it and see for youself. 8/10 Very entertaining! Thanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Episodes watched - 10\\n\r\nModified by jeikobu11, 30/4/17\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "And now, I, the contrarian buzzkill present to you, Kono2ba: A middling, even less funny, and overall lower quality product that actually wants to be taken seriously at times. It fails by its predecessor's standards and it makes me feel like Kazuma. I'll grab the rotten tomatoes...\r\n*SPOILERS FOR KONOSUBA 2*\r\nI'm gonna come clean. I do not like Konosuba. The first half was really funny but the second half was so stale and infuriating that I would not be looking forward to any more. Hell, I only came back due to the fact that I follow all franchises I've seen, even the ones I dislike orhate. Even still, one can't deny that Konosuba had some novelty and genuine laughs, as well as a lot of heart. Kono2ba on the other hand, is a middling season that ends up being a downgrade in almost every way imaginable. It's more of the same things that made the second half of season 1 vastly inferior to the first half, only with some badly done plot, and a surprising amount of people seek to agree that this is at least inferior to the first season. Now, why the buzzkill viewpoint? Is this season as bad as I say? Well, before I get pelted like an Eris cultist, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, I wouldn't even try to rate the score of a comedy, as they tend to have stories that take no precedence and that are mostly episodic: a platform for the rest of the episode. However, this season actually tries to make us take this seriously at points and even reminds us that there is a central plot and not just a background for our characters to do whatever in. That means, I must take it into account. I'm a monster, I know. Even still, with this we can conclude that this ain't no \"How I Met Your Mother\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 has got to be the most simultaneously dull and aggravating first episodes to any anime I've seen to date. Presents everyone acting uncharacteristically douchey (which is a surprise given how awful some of these people are). Logic fore episode 1 is tossed aside as people make purposefully rash and assholish decisions for conflict that gets resolved at the episode, albeit with Kazuma getting the short end of the stick in the end, which is a common theme for this anime, but I'll get back to that. Some of the reasonings behind plot points, such as a member of the Demon Lord's generals surviving an explosion, or the Axis Cult being the worst people ever to their Goddess, or those same people finally worshiping her again and giving her a brand new power (God Requiem), are so damn plot convenient that they hurt. The Drifters level tone-shifts only make things worse, like in the most climactic moment of episode 10. They also like to make us have emotional moments in which we're supposed to feel for a character or see someone die, only for that to be revoked rather quickly, which sours everything. In the finale, Kazuma and a hot springs overseer are dissolved by a sludge monster that gets frozen, but we never see how they got set free and revived (since that would kill them both and we would need to see them getting revived, but Kazuma remains in the show but the other guy isn't seen again). There's that Darkness family subplot in episode 4 that amounts to nothing after all the buildup from the past 2 episodes.The last 4 episodes are spent on a bad Axis Cult arc that hardly does any progression aside from  taking down another bad guy and then returning to status quo, because that's what a story meant to progress needs. Progression isn't mandatory to any real stretch in this series, as that is not a major problem like many claim. Even then, the series progresses more than many give it credit for. However, given that the first half is largely just a rehash of jokes that got old in season 1 and season 2 is largely this aggravating detour, it makes me want to opt out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEven in a comedy, having your characters be static, one-dimensional characters that only get \"flandarised\" (or having their main personality quirk get taken up to new extremes while being their only personality trait) over time is a bad thing, and will get on people's nerves, and boy did it ruin everything for me here...again. Let's start with Kazuma. Poor, poor Kazuma is never allowed to win. That is the golden rule. It's annoying to see the only sense of reason and human decency be the ultimate punching bag. He's even more observant this time, bur rarely does that come in handy. Sure, he's a but of a spiteful prick, but when you consider the toxic shits around him, can you blame him? Megumin is still a one-trick pony with a thing for explosion magic. Now, she also gets sexualized occasionally and is now as much of a prick as the rest of the group, especially towards Kazuma, because the only likable character isn't allowed to win. Yunyun (introduced in the OVA) is her hopeless and childish rival who doesn't serve much lurpose aside from being made fun of and having a backstory that, while tragic, is forgotten just as quickly as it was brought up. Darkness is the same as always, but with a little more antagonism towards Kazuma, and her shit was as annoying as ever to the point where it gloriously aggravated one of the villains in episode 5. Sena, the prosecutor that arrests Kazuma in episode 1, is an annoying lady who constantly shouts at him for everything and does nothing because we need an obnoxious authority character. The lord in episode 1 is just your stereotypical sleezebag ruler. Wiz, luckily, is still alright, and has a genuinely badass scene in the finale. Hans is a mediocre final villain, but his reasoning for wanting to fuck up the Axis Cult are reasonable; they are the most horrid, pathetic, stupid, and obnoxious people on the planet, just like their goddess, Aqua. Plus, they hate Eris because we gotta torture an actually decent person more because it's totally funny! Vanir, the villain in episode 4 who survives due to the convenient reasoning of being able to have multiple copies of himself, is an actually entertaining villain and eventual side-character. Now, to what really killed everything for me, above all else.\\n\\n\r\nAqua is the worst character in this show by a long mile, and is one of the most unlikeable bitches I've ever seen in fiction. This vain, worthless, problem-causing, obnoxious, pompous, stupid, and pathetic brat gets even worse here with how much they ramp up her stereotypcally bitchy attitude. They even lampshade all of this, but since character development (and, to a lesser extent, plot development) isn't allowed here, the bitch only gets worse with each passing episode. The only reason she helps out the obviously awful and disgusting Axis Cult, they worship her. The only reason she does decent things is because she hopes for benefit. She is the main source of Kazuma's suffering and it was never, ever funny for me. A stereotype of a bitch taken to an extreme that gets ramped up even further this season than last season. Luckily Eris is still tolerable and a safe haven for both myself and Kazuma, but she gets constantly shat on as well. I also hate how in the beginning of episode 1, after trying to help Kazuma not get arrested, and they are threatened, both Kazuma's \"friends\" and \"guild colleagues\" rat him out with absoluyte lies and totally betray him. This show often tries to make it seem like the tetrad of party-mates are friends, but they're played for deception to fuck over Kazuma because making a flawed yet decent person suffer for literally everything has got to be funny. You see my problem? The likable and actually decent people are always shit on, and the one-dimensional pricks only get worse and are just a bunch of obnoxious stereotypes in a fantasy world with different classes that they suck at. It's even worse here since they repeat each character joke at nauseum when they were already dry by the end of the first season, so there was a complete dearth of new comedy.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the elephant in the room; the main point of division among the Konosuba 2 viewers. Studio DEEN handled this anime once again, and here's what I have to say about the visuals. The characters look far inferior, with how they handled going off-model. I get that they did this in order to make the characters even more expressive during jokes involving their reactions, but they should've did what season 1 did and reserved that for those moments exclusively instead of making it the default design. It doesn't even help out those moments well due to how they don't often fit with the actual emotions the characters have during reactions. The characters are rarely off-model and it becomes really jarring and bad to look at, with the benefits being outweighed by the negatives. Hell, it even effects enemy animals to a lesser extent. Action scenes aren't well-handled either when involving Darkness. I get what the team was trying to go for, but where Klasky Chupo (the studio that did Ren & Stimpy, Duckman, and Rugrsts) could pull it off, this studio can't. There are some fantastic animation moments and on the whole, the 2D animation is about on par, but when the rest of the visuals suffer, boy does the value of this fade.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, there are a decent amount of moments with bad CGI involved, such as the bad CGI horses in episode 7 and 8, that one moment of bad CGI water in episode 7, or the CGI sword jabs against Vanir in episode 5. Season 1 never had nearly as many moments, as sporadic as they are here. Sure, some of the nice magic and level up effects are still in display, but not done so enough to help counterbalance all of this. The explosions are still cool to look at, though, and the interior backgrounds can look nice. Still, not enough to save all of this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the OST isn't anything interesting or memorable. They take way too long to add some new tracks, but those new ones are actually pretty decent, an are some of the emotional tracks used for the moments of tension and sadness we're supposed to have. The OP, \"Tomorrow\" by Machico, is a decent OP, is somewhat catchy and nice, and is much better than the first season's OP. The ED, \"Ouchi ni Kaeritai\", is an ok enough ED, and is slightly better than the first season's ED. This is just about the only improvement this show has, and even then, it's not a big improvement, as the music is still overall, meh.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter loathing the first episode of this season, I wasn't sure how this season could make me feel anything other than bitterness.I was sorta right, but there were a few jokes here and there that I actually liked, such as Kazuma using his magic against people (for either new and satisfying digs at his douche allies, or for call backs to the better season 1 jokes) or Darkness landing on her neck after reveling in the lovely and rowdy pain she was in. That one actually made me bust. All of the other jokes made me feel aggravated, however. As stared constantly, I hated seeing actually decent people such as Kazuma get the shitter by everyone constantly. Along with all of the other recycled jokes from season 1 that were stretched way too thin this time, as well as the Axis BS, and every moment with Aqua, It wasn't a pleasant time. I was also groaning at how poorly they handled scenes that we're supposed to take seriously as plot and character moments, like when they are revoked just to give Kazuma another walloping. I didn't hate is as much as episode 1 made me think I would, but it was still a bitter experience that I don't want to go back to.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 38/100\\n\\n\r\nThis season was a middling mess of a sequel that embodied everything I hate about Konosuba while taking itself more seriously, and bring an overall inferior product in terms of quality and production. I can only look back at this with cynicism and say that I am actually tired of Konosuba in general, as well as all fantasy \"trapped in a fantasy game\" light novel adaptations this show parodies. I'll give it one thing, though: it made me respect Season 1 a bit more. Well, with all that aid, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "It\u2019s back. 10 episodes of comedic fantasy with Kazuma and the gang. If you\u2019re got a little kid lurking somewhere inside of you, then Konosuba Season 2 is here to please. If you\u2019re familiar with the first season, then expect all the humor to return in full fold. It\u2019s bright. It\u2019s colorful. The plot sounds like it could have been written by someone who was half drunk. But make no mistake about it\u2026Konosuba Season 2 is here again to entertain.\r\nThe second season wastes little time to get the viewers familiar with the main characters again. It has a small cast yet each of them standout in their own way. The first episode has Kazuma, our well-known 16 year old hikikomori being in trouble again. With accusations pointed against him in an intimidating trial, the series wastes little time to make him look like a fool. Fans of the show should probably expect this as Konosuba satirizes fantasy drama into a comedy. Kazuma is more or less a fool although the rest of the cast isn\u2019t off better than he is. The point is though, season 2 still knows how to have fun with its character cast. Aqua, Darkness, and Megumin all return in style with their roles. Each of them get their own spotlight in one way or another. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps noticeable is the presence of Yunyun, a character that anime viewers may not be too familiar with. She showed up from the OVA episode but in this second season, her role is more expanded as a rival of Megumin. What\u2019s important isn\u2019t just giving the audience a familiarity of her character but also Megumin as well. We learn of her past and in essence, fans of Megumin will be pleased to learn about her besides just being the girl with an obsession for explosions. In addition, the story focuses a bit on Darkness too when she gets involved with a bothersome prince. I can honestly say that without a doubt, the show knows how to make the audience laugh. It\u2019s not just with how the characters\u2019 roles are played out but how this series amplifies their personalities. The sequel combines elements of the first season as well and reintroduces jokes such as frogs swallowing up Aqua in comedic fashion. Oh and who can forget about Kazuma\u2019s panty stealing talent? It\u2019s all back in glory.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, Kazuma is character that I find likeable yet repulsive. The show purposely makes him a self-serving character that can make viewers tear their hair out. Obviously, the show is self-aware about this but to be honest, how many times can you really watch such an idiot being idiotic? The other characters are also more or less the same whether it\u2019s Darkness\u2019 machoism, Aqua\u2019s brutal honesty, or Megumin\u2019s lack of self-control. Some may say that it\u2019s because of their stupidity which makes this series entertaining. However, others can think of their lack of development as holding the show back. Regardless, the character cast supplements with the overall humor so be ready for a lot of that in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nWell, this isn\u2019t news but even before picking up the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that the sequel\u2019s production quality diminished. The first season didn\u2019t have good production quality either although it\u2019s subverted to look that way from the start. It\u2019s like a joke for fans to make fun of regarding the art in the first place. The character facial reactions is still over exaggerated at many humorous segments with visual gags. However in terms of quality, it seems that the sequel did drop the ball more so than the first season. Of course, fan service is still pretty noticeable especially if you\u2019re got a keen eye on Darkness. On the other hand, soundtrack and character voice acting is still generally the same. The OP and ED theme songs still has that atmospheric feel with a catchy tune to go along with its humor. Of course, character voice mannerism still retains their magic so be ready for a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is a joke of itself as it sells its comedy through the storytelling and characters. Selling comedy isn\u2019t easy because fans can take it in the wrong way. However, Konosuba is successful because it\u2019s aware of what it\u2019s doing. The second season will take no time to get fans into the show again from the first episode. It\u2019s like going to coming back to school after a Summer break where you\u2019ll expect the expected.\\n",

KonoSuba is your go to parody to complete all your guilty pleasures! \r\n\"Thou shalt love big breasts, Thou shalt love small breasts\"\r\n\"Whether you're a lolicon, a NEET or a questionably-human fan of animal-eared girls\u2026 just remember Konosuba is still the best\"\r\nKonoSuba S2 at its core is a comedy anime. Its purpose is to make parody of all the guild adventure style animes like S.A.O & Log Horizon and it goes ahead to do that and more. Though each episode is random and zeroes in onspecific anime tropes to ridicule, it still follows the underlying core plot of defeating the devil king. There isn't complexity in its story-telling but due to its bizarre plot-twists in their randomness, it makes the story unique. The pacing of the show is off-putting and some episodes may feel like filler with its repetitive jokes but because of its comedic & ecchi elements, it's enjoyable. The ending isn't as satisfying as the first season but avid fans can expect more of such hilarity in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show are the main characters. Each of them are very distinct & relatable from one another and this anime continues to set them apart by gregariously highlighting their flaws. It's hard to pick a fav one between Kazuma, Aqua, Darkness & Megumin thanks to their voice actors. They alone added a whole new dimension to the characters. The villains and the side characters were a bit interesting but nothing out of the ordinary. The major flaw with the entire cast is their ambiguous decision making and future goals or purpose. Some characters even felt like space fillers. Regardless, Darkness and Kazuma will be highly memorable in this series since they had the most growth overall.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art & sound the show went through a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sort of phase. Due to two different directors taking turns directing the show, you kept going for overtly caricatured faces to overtly epic musical scores. If they found a harmony between these two directors style of delivery the show would flourish more in terms of quality. Still, the hand-drawn animation gives a vibrant feel to the anime and the character designs were always unique. One drawback this show had was the OP & ED song. Unlike previous season, the OP & ED songs aren't memorable nor catchy. The background OST on the other hand, was decent. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, despite its glaring flaws in its unclear storyline, weak side characters and directing switcheroos, being a parody show at its core, this show is enjoyable to watch. It doesn't take itself seriously and viewers shouldn't either. They should go in with low expectation and be rewarded with a good comedy series to laugh and meme about. This show offered great quotes and I think it has potential as a show to be re-watched as a group. If you have a few hours to spend and want to watch a hilarious comedy with your friends or by yourself, give this show a watch. I know you will enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading my review. I'm always open to criticism and suggestions. I hope you found this short but supaishi review helpful.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S. \"Eris Pads Her Breasts\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of Konosuba was a surprise hit because it had great character interactions, well done comedy, good consistent visuals and a good soundtrack.\r\nWhen Konosuba 2 was announced, I was really excited because I wanted too, see this characters again but this time actually have character development. \r\nAfter binge-watching all 10 episodes of Konosuba 2 and I am going too, be real honest. Season 2 are far inferior too, season 1 in a lot of way.\r\nWhy do I think Konosuba 2 isn\u2019t as good as season 1? \u00a0You will find in this review\r\nHello everyone this are Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome too, my reviewof Konosuba 2 and with that out of the way let\u2019s begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\u00a0\\n\r\nHonestly theyre are hardly story in this season whatsoever.\\n\r\nIt's just Satou and his gang just traveling around places doing comedic/pervy\\n\r\nthings from start too, finish without any story/character buildup whatsoever.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right this season of Konosuba has no objective, no build-up, hardly any world building and overall its feels more like a slice of life anime than an adventure/fantasy show that\u2019s feels like filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any story really annoyed this season at the end of the first season it hinted that the show was going somewhere due too, the events of the last season. Instead Konosuba 2 are a generic fantasy anime that doesn\u2019t do much expect for comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about Konosuba\u2019s comedy. The comedy in the first was greatly handled because one it was actually funny; two the comedy hardly repeats itself and three the character interactions during those comedy moments were funny and refreshing\\n\\n\r\nNot even the comedy can save this season in-fact the comedy here lost its charm completely.\\n\r\nIts repetitive, abuse, predictable and not too, mention its honestly really boring seeing the same type comedy being used over and over and over! This are not good writing whatsoever. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s just lazy, cheap and generally annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI know Konosuba are comedy anime set in a fantasy world but come on take more risks.\\n\r\nBaka and Test are a show that great comedy that are mostly handled well and fresh. Also unlike Konosuba the characters in Baka and test actually do developed as well as having great and interesting backstory's especially in season 2.\\n\r\nAlso, Baka and Test has story that actually progresses theyre were some filler but least Baka and Test has great comedy and character chemistry too, back it up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of KonoSuba are a disappointment.\\n\r\n4/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\u00a0\\n\r\nSeriously what the hell happened too, this characters after the first season.\u00a0\\n\r\nHow do this characters become more repetitive and annoying? \\n\r\nNot too, mention theyre are no character development whatsoever?\\n\\n\r\nSatou are still the same character from season 1 expect here he has no character development and he always does the same comedic/pervy things from season 1.\\n\r\nI have nothing more too, say about this character.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Aqua...\\n\r\nWhat the hell happened too, you?\\n\r\nOkay I liked Aqua in the first season because she was charming and funny but here she' has been reduced too, an unlikeable and whiny character whom cries a lot. Not too, mention her jokes are no longer funny. Hell some of her jokes made me cringe. I really dislike Aqua here. \\n\\n\r\nMegium are the only character that I liked in this season.\\n\r\nShe are still funny as ever, very likable and she's still an entertaining character that I personally liked.\\n\\n\r\nLike with Satou Darkness are still the same character from season 1 whom hardly changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all generic stereotypes in a fantasy setting whom do generic fantasy things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Konosuba 2 are disappointing \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe first season of KonoSuba has some good visuals that was consistent for the most part.\u00a0\\n\r\nLike with the comedy the visuals in KonoSuba are a downgrade filled with inconstant art and lackluster animation that can get choppy at times.\u00a0\\n\r\nI still question Studio Deen for animating four shows at the same time because it\u2019s clearly shows how much effort that Deen put into season 2.\\n\r\nAlso, theyre are more fan-service this time around and like with the comedy are abused, repetitive and annoying.\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can say about the visuals are the backgrounds because like with the first season the backgrounds are well detailed and colorful\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of KonoSuba are the same as the first season.\u00a0\\n\r\nI have really nothing too, say about the soundtrack because it\u2019s still an enjoyable soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nI personally wasn\u2019t a fan of the opening of Konosuba 2 Tomorrow because the opening itself was kinda out of tone and didn\u2019t had the charm of the first opening called Fantastic Dreamer.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Ouchi ni Kaeritai\u00a0are a really good ending theme that fits the tone of the show really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting are good for what it are.\\n\r\nIt still needs a dub because like with season 1 it will add more charm too, the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRepetitive and annoying are the best words too, describe Konosuba 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes nowhere, most of the characters are a massive downgrade from the S1 counterparts with no charm too, them, terrible comedy, inconstant visuals with choppy animation and the soundtrack that the good thing I can say about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis are how you don't do a squeal!!!\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't recommend watching this squeal unless you are a die-hard fan of Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\nIn short Konosuba 2 are a average show that ruined the charm that the first season had.\\n\\n\r\nI give Konosuba 2 a 5/10\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations \\n\r\nBaka and Test\\n\r\nSlayers\\n\r\nLog Horizon\\n\r\nGintama\\n\r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash\\n\r\nExcel Saga\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this has been Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "(Updated as of Episode 10)\r\n[Note: This review, my first one on MAL if that makes any difference to anyone,may seem like it is attacking those who do not favor my opinion, however, everything I write in the following review is objective and contains only facts. Thanks for taking the time to read this]\r\nWhen I first stumbled upon Konosuba, red warning lights started flickering in my brain: 'Another one of these?\" What happened after the first episode is usually the same for most people, including me: They loved it. \r\nAnd the second season does it again: It brings everything you loved from the first season back,with more humor this time. Because that is what Konosuba is - a comedy. One might even say it's the Seinfeld of anime. \\n\r\nYou don't watch Konosuba for a deep meaningful story, you watch for the flashy colorful animation, cool references, and jokes, jokes and more jokes.\\n\\n\r\nI think this a point a lot of people miss, and is exactly why most critics versed in the field of objective reviews give it a 5/10 - they look for deeper meaning in a show that is not supposed to have any. \\n\r\nSure, if you look at it like any other anime, the story is a 5/10, which is the exact score I gave it. \\n\r\nThere is no real connection between episodes other than to reference earlier jokes and gags. Instead, every episode is a mini-story for itself, just like an episode from a sitcom. Or, as it is more commonly known in the anime world, filler. But don't be discouraged by this, these episodes are anything but boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the characters. Konosuba makes one thing clear - the main cast are as*holes, and that is exactly why we should love them. And love them we do. The side characters serve to show the true faces of the main cast, again, just like in a sitcom, and provide space to develop the main cast's running gags or make new jokes.\\n\r\nBy having most of the characters dressed in different colored outfits, the show can easily make you distinguish them while making fast-paced comedy, another well thought out detail.\\n\r\nAnimation?\\n\r\nOh boy, animation. Best way I would describe it - standard. And season 2 only made it worse, right? Wrong. Well, partially. For instance, do you consider the animation of Ping Pong bad, or substandard? No, because that is the whole point. It doesn't focus on animation, but on storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nKobosuba has something similar going for it. You see,  Kikuta-san, the character designer  doesn't give a damn about the animation being \"substandard\" as long as it serves to amplify the comedy, which is exactly what is does! (check his Twitter). Easiest way to see this is just to compare the opening of the 2 seasons - it is clear that the second one has far less attention focused on the animation and subtlety of jokes, and just goes full out on showing us that it is a comedy with the cheesy faces and character movements.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like to repeat myself for the n-th time: Konosuba is a comedy, and it is a well done comedy at that. As a comedy, it shines about most others. That is all you need to know.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Score : 5.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFinishing up Konosuba\u2019s second season, I\u2019m very happy to report that it doesn\u2019t suck. For context, Konosuba was going to be the first anime I\u2019ve ever actually watched as it airs. Week after week. However, this show\u2019s first few episodes were less than exceptional and didn\u2019t have many of the elements I enjoyed in the first season. Well, more specifically, nothing in the show changed and I felt as though they are rehashing the entire story for the sake of an unestablished return to norm of this anime sitcom. So, I guess it had too much of what I enjoyed in the firstseason, which made it too similar and therefore tedious.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was ecstatic to see was that Konosuba rebounded gloriously with its second half, as the character dynamics tightened up and the show felt like it was back to what made it fairly enjoyable in its first season, without being overly reliant on established jokes. I\u2019d be hard-pressed to call it anything but an above-average comedy, however, it does just enough to be appreciated in my eyes. With the gang of loveable misfits journeying just past their starting zone, we don\u2019t really get a chance to see anything new. Even as the season concludes in a completely different area, the zone itself never felt as a completely new region. Just a region with a gimmick. But this is a comedy show after all and any talk of character development, world-building, and secondary characters often falls on deaf ears. \\n\\n\r\nI think there are particular elements that should be included when discussing a show\u2019s return in a second season, though. The ability to craft a new story in a familiar world and setting. Every great sitcom never rests on its laurels and always strives to tell the best stories in the established setting. Whether it is Community, The Office, Arrested Development, or Always Sunny in Philadelphia, each great sitcom elevates something. It can be adding new dynamics, new worlds, or simply raising the stakes by adding unique story elements. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba isn\u2019t a great sitcom. Not yet anyway. However, as its thankfully short season wraps up, I finally start to see the kind of picture it is beginning to paint. In a generic yet whimsically ridiculous world full of wacky characters and unfortunately boring creature-design, we get a non-story that does just enough to stand out. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[What is a Second Season] \\n\\n\r\nAfter Konosuba\u2019s less-than-stellar beginning to this season, I felt the need to write a long diatribe about why this show completely misses the point of having a second season. Since it isn\u2019t telling a story of any substance, you are instead looking for different elements within a sitcom like this. An overtly cartoony sitcom, at that. These are the goals of a second season. \\n\\n\r\n1.)You should be raising the stakes. \\n\\n\r\n2.)You should be making sure those stakes stay raised and are actually something palpable, rather than tacked on for plot devices. \\n\\n\r\n3.)Don't rest on your laurels as a writer. As in, don't rely on past gags to fill up the comedy quota. \\n\\n\r\n4.)Understand and develop. Have a good knowledge on these characters and further push their interactions into different territories. \\n\\n\r\n5.)Bring in new, interesting characters to create different dynamics within the show that you haven't explored before. \\n\\n\r\n6.)Establish the world.\\n\\n\r\nThese points aren\u2019t all required. There are plenty of great sitcom\u2019s that do one or two for their second season. However, to accomplish a great sophomore year, you want to be applying at least one of these elements. For example, NBC\u2019s critically acclaimed sitcom Community, which just so happens to be the best comedy ever written, in my opinion, employed many of these tactics. For one, it added a background story that raised the stakes throughout the season, it introduced new, interesting tertiary characters that served to three, expand the world. The show also delved into concept-episodes, creating hilariously unique and original parody-esq episodic narratives that didn\u2019t rely on previously established gags of the first season. But that\u2019s Community, it is the best. \\n\r\nAnother example is Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where its semi-mediocre first season didn\u2019t speak well for the show. To try and revitalize a show that is distinctly not about character development, they introduced a completely new primary character in Frank, played wonderfully by Danny DeVito. Or what about The Office, which reformed its second season, straying far away from the confines of copying the original show and going into more thematic sitcom storytelling? All of these shows brought something new to a second season. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba didn\u2019t. The biggest aspect to a sitcom is the actual comedy. So of course, you must be funny. And if you read my original KonoSuba review where I dissected the meaning of a joke, and how it works, you'd know that the only way a joke works is if it isn't expected. Comedy works because it is unexpected, the only way an expected and obvious joke would make someone laugh is usually ironically. Comedy needs to stay unexpected to be fresh. The way it accomplishes this is by constantly switching up character dynamics and putting characters into different scenarios. A great example is Always Sunny, which has the entire cast usually embark on more and more audacious journeys as the show progresses, consistently ratcheting up the stakes and creating for new dynamics.I draw so many parallels to Always Sunny because it, similarly, doesn\u2019t focus on a complete narrative and just follows these characters as they do wacky shit. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Problem with the First Half]\\n\\n\r\nThis caused instant disappointment with Konosuba because it felt as though it was completely coasting on what made season one stand out. You know that funny gag where one of the characters gives a thumbs up? Or what about the entire concept of using a funny face as a punchline? Remember how it felt authentic in season one because the entire show had this rugged indescribable charm? Well, get ready for the creators becoming aware of that and running the entire concept into the ground. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, for some odd reason, decided to make the characters look almost ridiculously ugly. Which is fine, but it completely conflicted with everything else in the previous season. They made the \u201cfunny face\u201d gag a running punchline for numerous jokes. This made me instantly get sick of the entire concept. No face is that funny when it is surrounded by other, equally dumb looking faces. Konosuba was about dumb looking dumb people. Not about horrendously misshapen monsters that are also dumb people. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, this is quickly fixed. With the second episode, onwards, the art style miraculously improves and we are back to having high-momentum and movement-based animation which I really enjoyed from the first season. A cartoon is supposed to be fluid and dynamic with movement, by flooding the character with mesh-frames you get infinitely sillier looking scenarios and significantly more stretchy and lively designs. This makes the show feel like a cartoon, which it is. I love that. \\n\r\nThat being said, I wish I could say the same about anything else in these first four episodes. The show did this obnoxious narrative structure where it\u2019d just separate characters completely, which made their interactions more predictable and banal. They remove Darkness from the show for the first three episodes for some pointless plotline that goes nowhere. While I\u2019m not a massive fan of Darkness\u2019 character gimmick, at least it added a potential for a new dynamic. Now it is just Megumin relying on her overt character design cuteness and affinity for explosions rather than those being a backline to her actual relationship with the characters. It felt as though these characters were already being flanderized, which is weird because they have literally no distinguishable traits to flanderize apart from their one character gimmick. \\n\\n\r\nNow we are left with Aqua and our protagonist, Kazuma, who have virtually the same kind of character interaction every god damn time. It is always Aqua being a brat and then Kazuma being dismissive and that leads to more yelling. This got boring in season one and since they split these characters apart at the start of season two, this is all we get to hear for the first three episodes. \\n\r\nOne of Konosuba\u2019s strongest points is its knack for having all the characters involved in something. Doing this completely negates what is fundamentally enjoyable in the show. We are left with these hollow character interactions that lack any form of chemistry whatsoever. It felt stilted, awkward, and worst of all, unfunny. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba also doesn\u2019t bother adding any secondary or tertiary characters of any interest. There is a red-haired guy that just kind of walks around remarking about the gang\u2019s travels. There\u2019s a cute girl in a uniform whose gimmick is she gives orders, but also gets turned on by some sort of masochism I can\u2019t pin down, which is way too like Darkness for such a small cast of characters. There is also a cat, who\u2019s pretty much just used as a thing to have around so they can sell toys with that cat on them. \\n\\n\r\nWe are left with a wholly sub-average product which is less-funny than the already not-too-funny original, relying too heavily on reusing jokes that worked and pummeling them into the ground. Even the story is the same thing as it was in season one. Except in season one it was natural for them to want money since they need housing, while here it is some shoehorned reason that they need to pay something back. So they are back as the underdogs. But that never lasts long for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Rebound]\\n\\n\r\nThen the show gets better. Substantially better. As the second mini-arc is introduced, I begin seeing that the show is slowly becoming a bit more serialized in a very limp sense of the word. We are starting to see things get call backed to as a tool for a story, rather than a joke. This is where the show begins to shine once again. The animation is looking better, the story it is telling is at least semi-coherent and reasonable of a comedy, and finally, all the characters are back together. \\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions are just as predictable as they always have been. You\u2019ve seen one you\u2019ve seen em\u2019 all. What I do enjoy is Kazuma\u2019s growth as an actual spell-user. We slowly get to see him learning new skills that become useful in the grand scheme of things. This subtle increase in character power is intriguing. It is sad that every other character\u2019s gimmick is so reliant on their power that I doubt we\u2019ll be seeing them grow at all in any way. The scenarios are kept fresh though.\\n\\n\r\nThe gang begins to travel to a different city, which serves to cap the season and create a beautifully animated conclusion. The animation is now consistently impressive to me, especially on this shows insistence that it is definitely a cartoon. It reminds me more of Spongebob than anything. There is so much physical humor with very light-characterization and similar premises executed fairly well that I can just imagine these characters living in Bikini Bottom. Of course we get to see more bottoms in this show. By that I mean there is copious amounts of fanservice which, honestly, I still don\u2019t get. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters aren\u2019t that attractive. In fact, they are silly looking. The sexual fanservice is almost never actually funny, or even used as a joke at all. There are just characters in skimpy outfits posing in odd ways that just distracts you from what is happening. Even poor Megumin is there with all these other scantily clad big-tittied women. Every bend or bow these characters do is always shot in the back so we get a nice, long glimpse of their ass. It comes off as sleazy and distinctly not funny. \\n\r\nNow this is anime and sexualization is nothing new. After all, the biggest selling point of most anime is colorful girls running around blushing. But I can\u2019t help but feel that this show would be markedly more entertaining if it didn\u2019t feel the need to distract you with this element. Konosuba also has a knack of doing something I now like to call \u201cfake subversion\u201d, where a show has the cake and eats it too. If it is setting up for a ridiculously generic anime clich\u00e9, such as walking in on someone while they are changing, it\u2019ll point out that is happening\u2026 but still do it. For example, earlier on in the show during the awful first few episodes we get to see a totally not shoehorned scene of Kazuma offering to take a bath of Megumin. The clich\u00e9 is of course pointed out, and Megumin instantly dismisses it. Great. That is where the joke ends, right? The actual subversion. But no, then Kazuma says some dumb petty shit and she strips naked in front of him and you get this weird moment where you are wondering if it\u2019ll lead to a punchline, but it never does. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t do this. Ever. No one likes this. If you are someone who watches this show to watch a fourteen-year-old anime girl get naked, then you\u2019ll be disappointed since this show is very careful with its nudity as it is a PG-13 product. If you are someone looking for subversive comedy you\u2019ll be insulted because this fake-out subversion just ruins the joke. No one is left happy with this conclusion and that scene particularly frustrated me. That being said, the show actually does well to avoid being overly meta. A big complaint I had about Konosuba's first season was its over-reliance on pointing out cliches and going right ahead and doing other, equally stupid cliches. This made for a disjointed experience that felt like the writer/s were either unaware of the cliche, or simply lacked the creativity to properly subvert it.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the show gets better. While this can be chocked up to the gang getting back together, it is also worth noting that the change in location helps as well. This show is often praised for its world building, which I find baffling since this show\u2019s world is as generic as it gets. The idea that the monsters in this show are \u201cdumb-looking\u201d would be a good one if they were dumb looking. The only monsters that are silly and over-the-top are the giant funny-looking frogs and the exploding rocks in the show\u2019s opening. Everything else is unfortunately incredible generic. We get this scene of a stampede of animals running towards our hometown. They are virtually just colored big lizards. Their gimmick is they trample things. Then two episodes later we get yet another kind of animal that tramples things, but this time it is an ostrich. In what world is this creative? \\n\\n\r\nThe unfortunate side here is that they can easily do the same kind of over-exaggerated animal designs as they do with their characters. Take preconceived MMO designs and blow them totally out of proportion, much like you did with the main four characters. This could\u2019ve been ground for some funny parody elements, which this show\u2019s second season is very light on. This show was never quite a parody, however, it definitely had MMO themes to it. Everything from the quest text to Kazuma\u2019s reaction to things to the way abilities and learning them works. It hardly ever satirizes the concepts behinds these things, which is unfortunate since when it does it often leads to the funniest scenes in the show. As I\u2019ve said in my season one review, this show is at its funniest when it does these parodies. It is also its least funny when it relies too heavily on being sexual. Which just comes off as plodding and lame. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Konosuba is still likeable. I think after it came back from the disappointment of the first few episodes, we returned to what made even the more tedious parts of season one likeable. Which is the characters in this setting. They aren\u2019t developed or interesting, but they are comfortable. This show can be defined as comfortable. It is an extremely easy and light-hearted watch. Nothing about it is daring or shocking, it is just something to throw on because it makes you feel good and occasionally has you chuckle under your breath.\\n\\n\r\nI wish that this show didn\u2019t have such a weak start this season because I feel like if it started strong, much like season one, it could\u2019ve been equally as good, while still unfortunately relying on very predictable character interactions. The reason for this is because as you watch these characters\u2019 adventure together, no matter how uninspired these adventures may be, you begin to enjoy watching them. Much like comfort food. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is very much like a classic kid's cartoon. It can just as easily be some weekly webisode series that lasts three minutes and I don\u2019t think I would siphon anything different from it. It is that palatable. I remember arguing with someone about the show. They kept saying that it is like Seinfeld or Always Sunny in the sense that these characters are assholes and that\u2019s where the comedy is buried. But I couldn\u2019t help but disagree. These characters are dumb; they aren\u2019t assholes in any sense of the word. The comedy in this show is well-meaning to a fault. If they were written like douchebags stuck together, like Always Sunny, the comedy would have to be significantly darker to be affective. In one scene, Kazuma, probably our more morally ambiguous character rejects the offer of free money because he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s earned it. If that isn\u2019t light-hearted I don\u2019t know what is.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the heart of Konosuba and its second season. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Or, in Konosuba\u2019s case, the more things stay the same, the more things stay the same. Because while it doesn\u2019t do anything new, I can\u2019t hate it for that as much as I may want to. It attempts to recapture the essence of season one and I think, for many, it did. Everything from the opening, which is actually better than the season one opening, and the closing track, which isn't better, all try to convey the same message. The most different element it employs is a ampler use of serialized storytelling, which I actually enjoyed for the most part. I hope that this show becomes a journey to remember, by creating consistently funny foundations to a big journey these characters could go on. But until that moment, I\u2019m content with simply calling it a producer\u2019s blessing on this wonderful world. \\n",

Defeating the devil king was clearly just an excuse to have Kazuma enter the world. It's still a great and simple excuse to get everything started though.\r\nAlmost everyone is saying that the art quality dropped from the first season.  I personally didn't notice a huge difference.  The art was still really good and added to what the show was trying to convey.\r\nThe sound is very similiar to season 1, but I still love the music.  Konosuba'ssoundtrack isn't my favorite, but it's still really good and it really helps with making the show more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are still the same too.  The whole cast is in what I'd  call the \"love them or hate them\" category.  Season 2 does provide some more background information and development for the main crew (Kazuma, Darkness, Megumin, and Aqua) as well as Wiz.  You finally get to see Wiz use some of her magic.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this season.  I like it at least as much as season 1, if not more.  I recommend watching this season if you like the first one.",

If you look at their faces the entire episode the way it is drawn and put together with their words and sound it's simply beautiful.\r\nSound: The sound is amazing Unlike last seasons blandopening and Meh soundtrack, This one is memorable full of Perfectly Timed Sounds to go with what's going on. Their voice actors are amazing props to Kazuma, Darkness, and Megumin's voice actors for amazing work, it's almost like it's real the way they voice their characters like they are those characters is simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters of this season are given depth along with new characters that when added to the cast make it even funnier, so much can be said on this I can only sum it up in one sentence \"Wow, *Wink and duck away*\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime because it is simply too lovable to hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 Needs more explosions (Subject to change to ten once more explosion is seen)",

            "content": "First of all, I have never written a review of an anime in my life, but this is surely something I'v had on my mind for quite some time.\r\n*spoiler free*\r\nKonoSuba Season 2, a second round of the loveable and lively characters we saw come to life in the first season of the show, being this second season a direct continuation of where we left off in season 1.\r\nMany of you who want to watch this show after watching the first season might be wondering why the reviews for this show rank so badly, and that would be a fair question, but it all boils downto how some people simply came into the show expecting exactly what it was not meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 stands exactly the same as its prequel, its the story of an unlikely love-hate relationship between a group of friends brought together by sheer coincidence sharing adventures in the harsh reality of a Fantasy/Medieval world.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 8/10-\\n\\n\r\nThe first critique people give this show is the art, wich I can guarantee isn't fair, since the art presented in this show is some of the most fleshed-out to ever come out of a modern anime, imediately giving off a goofy vibe while still being aesthetically pleasing.\\n\r\nIt's very colorful and lively and it fits the characters extremely well, and when all of that is brought together it really makes the show come alive.\\n\r\nI think that given the budget cuts the animation team was given, they really did the best job they could and it doesn't disapoint at all.\\n\\n\r\n-Story 8/10-\\n\\n\r\nWhere do i even begin, story, this is where the anime fails for most people.\\n\r\nFirst of all, KonoSuba never set out an objective for itself, apart from all the \"Defeat the Demon King\" stuff, wich only exists to drive the characters forward.\\n\r\nSo what exactly is the story behind this fantastic and magically show? Its exactly what's described in the first season of the show, the mundane struggles of a NEET brought into the type of world he thinks he is the most accomodated with and his party of extremely weird people.\\n\r\nIts an extremely clever comedy jab at the so-ever satured genre of \"brought into another world\", coming to life in a comedy-driven show.\\n\r\nSo if you expected this beautiful show to have a dark turn and suddenly become serious and grim, don't even bother watching, but if you liked season 1 for what it was and want to see more, im sure you won't be disapointed.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say sound wise, its consistent and has a beautifuly composed opening and ending, that goes perfectly along with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines, its characters, they are unique and down-to-earth, each one of them stands out for themselves and its really hard to pick a favourite one in the bunch of loveable dorks this show presents us with, most of them carry out from season one, but this second second season still introduces some new ones that are equally good and enjoyable as the likes of YunYun (If you haven't watched the first OVA that will be the first time seeing her).\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10/10-\\n\\n\r\nThis is heavily opinion based, but there are some good reasons for enjoying this show so much, its exactly what i expected it to be and it feels like time well spent, it brightens the mood of anybody watching it and even though its kind of an episodical anime its hard to feel bored or annoyed on how the show isn't going anywhere especifically because there is just so much to look at in the world of this show that none of it feels like wasted time.\\n\r\nI can guarantee anyone reading this that the enjoyment they had in season 1  will surely make them company throughout the enterity of this second season.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nGiven all the reasons stated above I urge every single person that liked season 1 or any other comedy animes to watch this show and form their own opinion on it, in the end reviews here are mostly the opinion of individuals on a certain Anime, and when in doubt you should always give it a try, even if other people don't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Amazing world of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! Season 2 awaits you, and it's certainly worth your time.\\n\r\nThanks to anyone who bothered to read my review this far, and i hope it helped clearing some uncertainty over the reviews this show had been recieving.",

            "content": "Show is over and, for once in my liffe, I'm going to try and review it here. \r\nKonosuba's second season is really something out of this world in many aspects. It's a crazy, self aware comedy that works thanks to its characters, that could make a joke funny no matter how many times it had been done before; and it's spot on comedic timing. But those are just empty words if I don't go deeper into them, so let's jump straight to work.\r\nThe show's sense of humor is probably the most important thing and the first that one can notice, and it's never totally objective,so bear that in mind while you read.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the show starts with a serious -even heartfelt- scene that works both as a summary and as a nice moment. That doesn't last long, however, since the serious tone gets turned upside down in a split second thanks to the characters' \"peculiarities\". That, to be honest, is the general style of comedy the show employs: It builds up expectations based in our experience in anime and MMORPGs, and then throws them on the ground thanks to its world's \"unbalanced\" rules and it's characters' deplorable mental condition.  While it may sound like it should get repetitive, that's far from the truth, since in most cases, it's the situations in which the character traits come to play what keep changing and make everything fresh. The only joke that gets a bit old is Darkness' masochism, but it still works and brings some great moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that really stands out is the animation. I've read multiple times that it \"suffered from low budget\" or that it was \"worse than the first season and clearly rushed\", to which I can only respond with the most sincere lack of understanding, for not only do the crazy faces and weird poses and physics make everything more memorable, they are also intentional.  Koichi Kikuta, in charge of animation, did want the animators to mess with faces and proportion. He wanted everyone's style to be raw and expressive and he wanted the animation to support the show's tone as much as possible. Only real thing is that his philosophy directly clashes with the popular notion that screenshots can define animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, there are some incredible acting and action cuts, ranging from Megumin's explosions to Aqua's expression (In fact, I'd say a good bit of the last episode will soon be in sakugabooru), but the show isn't what I'd call \"great looking\" or \"breathtaking\" at all. It's more on the average side for the most of its run in matters of fluidity and overall technical quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe third key aspect for understanding why Konosuba works is the awesome sound design. \\n\r\nThe voices can't be defined with any word that isn't perfect, and the voice actors sound like they're having a blast in every single line. The preformances crank the comedy up to eleven and give the characters a new layer of charisma and personality. (That, I'll go back in a bit)\\n\r\nThe music is also really good. It's not a soundtrack for the ages and, except for a couple tracks, I wouldn't really listen to it on my own. It is, however, more than enough to help the tone and the mood, and the opening and ending are both catchy and representative of the show. The first follows the more upbeat, crazy style of the show, while the latter is calm and really works to convey the feeling of peace that probably reigns when the team's not screwing up in any aspect of life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd at last, but definetly not least, I HAVE to talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey're the cornerstone of the show, the strong main pillar that prevents it from ever falling or losing ballance. They're what diferentiate konosuba from any other \"Trapped in a fantasy world\" shows, and that's because they're just that, characters, instead of walking-talking gags. When one writes comedy, it's important to think about how the characters are going ot be treated and, In this case, as pathetic as they are as human beings, and being the base of most of the jokes, they're never the joke themselves. At least not in the \"narrative\" meaning. Their personalities are bound to create comical situations, but they're not all they have. Thay connect with each other and grow fond of their partners, eventually being friends and giving us some heartfelt moments that really make us love them a lot more. Whithout the show really teling us in an \"in your face\" manner, they progress and advance.  They're pathetic, lovable people and I'd definetly go on an adventure with them, and that, is the real difference between Konosuba and any other comedy anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, with a void I didn't really expect growing on my soul, I'll just go and read the rest of the light novels, and hope that, someday, God will bless this wonderful world with more of their animated adventures.",

            "content": "The main thing that I want to convey to you is that I really enjoyed this series! It made me laugh a lot in unpredictable ways and I loved the characters. For me is wasn't the type of anime that I thought about in the week between each episode but one that I really enjoyed coming back to each week and was really sad when I realised it only had 10 episodes and I had watched them all. So if you want something chill to watch that will make you laugh this is the show for you!\r\nThe first series of KonoSuba was probably one ofthe most enjoyable shows I have watched and having just finished the second season I have to say that season 2 was just as good if not better than the first.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a group of misfits and their adventures in a fantasy world. The story is quite slow pace but being a comedy that the story isn't always the best part of the show. I always found every episode was always very funny and this for me made up for the lack of progression in the story. I can see this story progressing a lot in future seasons (knock on wood).\\n\\n\r\nWhat is a big part of the humour is the characters. In this season you get to see different sides of characters and looking back at season 1 they have changed a lot in my opinion. Kazuma the main protagonist was a human who got dropped into the world after he died. He has lots of \"quirky\" skills that seem pointless but always seem to help out in life or death situations. He hasn't stopped being a scumbag but seems to care more about the party and has taken up more of a leading role which is good to see. Aqua is a Godess that was bought down to the world by Kazuma. She is a very funny character and always seems to get into the worst situations despite being arguably the most capable person in the group being a god and all. Darkness is a masochistic crusader who can't hit a thing with her sword but loves to take the hit for her companions in battle. She always seems to get excited in the wrong moments which is what makes her so great. Megumin (best girl) is an over powered wizard who can only use one spell that completely uses all her energy for that day, a bit of a glass cannon.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very fitting and the animation is pretty good, especially the explosions. I didn't really notice the sound much but for me that's a good thing because it means I didn't get bored of it which I have done with other series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still reading this then thank you for taking the time. This was my first review and I'm not that good at writing and tend to write all my thought onto the page so if you have any pointer that you would care to share then drop me a message!",

            "content": "It's kinda weird to see a second season of a show with such a drastically higher rating than its previous season while most of the top reviews are negative. So who's right? The people writing detailed reviews, or the people just throwing out high ratings? \r\nWell, they both are.\r\nI think the issue is that the reviewers' criticisms aren't incorrect (the art and animation have gotten worse, the stakes haven't really been raised, etc.), they miss the point. KonoSuba is a comedy, and simply enough, KonoSuba has gotten funnier.\r\nSeason 1 was good, no doubt, but in the first season it needed time to establish characters, runningjokes, it was a lot of establishing. This season, we're settled in and the comedy is flourishing. You can complain about how bad the art and animation look, but do you really think it's not intentional in this case? For what this show is, it's an IMPROVEMENT. Some of the biggest laughs I've had from the show as a whole were just when Kazutrash or Aqua flips out, starts hyperventilating, and devolves into an off-model, under-detailed mess of panic and fear. The show's \"shitty\" look gives it character that it was kinda missing last season when it was only kinda shitty.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the show's setting and humor has also made a very slight (but welcome) shift from a clever, but pretty simple parody to It's Always Sunny in Slayersville. The characters have been given the platform to show off just how pathetic, useless, and depraved they are and they've run with it. The \"fight\" between Kazutrash and Darkness in episode 4 is the hardest I've laughed at anything this season easily and it perfectly exemplifies how great the character dynamic is now.\\n\\n\r\nWhile their hasn't been a drastic rise in \"stakes\", the plot IS moving forward, and two more characters will soon become more important (Wiz and Eris). But to those who complain that the plot isn't advancing fast enough, I'd ask if you get what this show is even trying to say? The characters are lazy, idiotic miscreants. Why would they aggressively pursue greater dangers? One of the bigger jokes is that whenever they get a hold of some money, Kazutrash says \"Fuck finding the Devil King, I'm rich, I can eat good and stay inside all day\". The plot usually hunts THEM down, which is exactly how it should be given our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a plot driven show. The author intentionally set up the path to the end being so vague so that he can end it at any point, or never end it. It's a vehicle for comedy, just as One Piece is a vehicle for action and adventure. This isn't a show you watch for eye candy. Its visual based tactics aren't there to impress, they're there to evoke laughter, much like GTO's own terrible art. It achieves its goal in spades, moreso than season 1, and that's really all that matters.",

            "content": "KonoSuba\u2019s second season is here and it\u2019s a fantastic follow up to last year\u2019s fantasy/comedy series which deservedly became a massive hit among the anime community. \r\nOne of the strongest points of this series is the characters and their interactions, Kazuma is one of the weird cases where I find the protagonist to be the best character of a comedy anime, he\u2019s just such a lovable troll that has to deal with the weirdos around him, the first of them being Aqua, a cute but useless crybaby that has a godlike talent for performing party tricks. However, outside of that she lacks any other abilitiesdespite being an actual goddess. Most of the time she\u2019s a hindrance to the group but damn she\u2019s great.  There is also Megumin, a chuunibyou that wants to see the world explode (and she will be the one doing it, one explosion at a time). Last but not least there\u2019s Darkness, a holy crusader that does her best in the front line, blocking the attacks of the enemies in order to defend her allies\u2026 well, that and to enjoy the pleasure of being hit, just masochist things. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast are great, the side characters are certainly capable of stealing the spotlight. For example, there's Wiz, who is supposedly on the bad side but is probably the nicest person around, and Yunyun, another crimson mage like Megumin that really needs some love and headpats, poor girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very enjoyable to watch and their wacky, random adventures are always hilarious. Their gags stay fresh and funny due to all the different situations the characters are thrown into. \\n\\n\r\nThe RPG-like world adds a lot of variety to the comedy via fantasy elements and characters/monsters. Most series that use this type of setting tell a more serious story but KonoSuba uses it for comedic purposes. It\u2019s a great, well-executed parody of the genre. Even the supposed \u2018enemies\u2019 are hilarious characters that add a lot of fun moments to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nExcluding the first episode, that for some motive had a derpier look, the art of this sequel was like in the first season, shining in showing the multiple reactions of the characters with comedic faces that add a lot to the humour of this anime. The music is\u00a0similar to\u00a0the first season, with a special mention\u00a0for\u00a0the new opening \"TOMORROW\". It does a great job of showing what the anime is about, a bunch of weird people having lots of random, fun adventures. It's so easy to get in the mood for an episode once that opening starts playing.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who really enjoyed KonoSuba, this sequel offers the same great comedy while putting the characters into new different hilarious scenarios. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season.",

            "content": "Konosuba is pure, unbridled stupidity. Kazuma and crew are so unbelievably lacking in their mental faculties that it is a wonder how they are even capable of putting their own clothes on every day. That they even know how to breathe is surprising in its own right. \r\nWhere most other anime in the fantasy genre-- Danmachi, Re:Zero and others of its ilk-- attempt to be absolutely and relentlessly serious at all times, Konosuba does away with the very notion of seriousness. It exists solely to be laughed at. And sometimes it does a pretty OK job at creating said laughs. It never aims to bea 'good' anime (least not in the traditional sense), and criticising it for not being such is kind of missing the point.\\n\\n\r\nIt just becomes a bit difficult to keep laughing when they repeat the same jokes for the fifth or fiftieth time. \\n\\n\r\nDarkness is a thundering masochist who mentally orgasms and gets foamy-mouthed whenever she is treated poorly. The first season already made this joke several dozen times, so I get it. Kazuma will threaten her by promising to do unspeakable (!) things to her body, and, the deviant that she is, squirms in delight! No, look, I get it already-- I really, truly do. Her mind is so perverted that she will twist a friendly conversation into a suggestion of her being sexually assaulted by monsters and--- PLEASE, KONOSUBA. I GET IT. I get it, OK?\\n\\n\r\nFor as much of a joke as Konosuba's characters are, there is only so much comedy they can create by repeating the same punch-line until the ends of time. There are other, more interesting things that can be done with Darkness' character, surely. If this were pornography then maybe, perhaps, her characterisation would get a pass, but comedy requires considerably more effort than \"oh gee golly I am like so horny right now.\"\\n\\n\r\nAqua, as tantalising as her mini-skirt is (and I have spent many a moment admiring her womanly curves), falls into much of the same issues, with her two defining traits being that she is a narcissist with an ego the size of Darkness' breasts, and a crybaby who falls on her knees and wails at the top of her lungs when she doesn't get her way. Her gags, almost invariably, follow a pattern of these two traits: she uses her status as a goddess to demand favours and respect, and then breaks her character and cries immediately after. A little bit more involved than Darkness' 'gag', sure, but it is still repeated to the point of nausea. \\n\\n\r\nKazuma is likely the more interesting of the lot, since he at least exists as more than a vehicle for a single joke. He is not developed by any means-- lord, no, he is a complete dunce from beginning to end-- but his frequent switching from idiot to straight-man does at least provide some variety to the gags. Kazuma is a jerky little twat, incapable of respect and prone to molesting the opposite sex, and his assertive nature does well to set him apart from all the other spineless protagonists of the genre. His over-reactions to all the ridiculous nonsense around him (often the direct result of Aqua's or Darkness' actions) are often still amusing, too, even if 'dude yells at stuff' may not exactly be the most artful style of humour. You almost feel bad for the little bugger - I would probably want to off myself in his situation, too. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot to say about Megumin, considering she is pretty well non-existent for 90% of what happens in the second season. She's unquestionably the most sane of the four (though that isn't saying a whole lot...), and the one least susceptible to repeated gags. While the first season pushed it a bit by making her defective explosion magic and chuunibyou nature a recurring theme, the second season has next to none of it. And that's a good thing. I just wonder if, cute as she is, she might be a bit too normal the second time around.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba just never capitalises on what made absurd comedy series like Osomatsu-san and Gintama so clever. There is wonderful opportunity here for it, as one of the only non-serious fantasy anime, to take the piss out of other titles in the genre and properly satirise them. Part of the joke is that the Gang of Stupid are woefully incapable of combat, unable to progress as one typically would in an MMO or fantasy world, and are able only to defeat monsters and enemies through luck and by surprising them with their colossal stupidity, provided they don't just scream and run away altogether. That's an amusing reversal of the genre's tropes. But that's all there is. There's no actual \"satire\", no parody to be found in Konosuba - it is standard manzai comedy, living, and dying, by its own strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Konosuba is without merit, or that watching it can't still be a fun time. If you enjoyed the first season or just want a short, easygoing anime that doesn't require much thought or focus, then, hey, it does its job just fine, even if it may at times feel more like a greatest hits compilation. Konosuba is a big, dumb show and it knows it. I just don't think that being dumb is an excuse for laziness.",

But as soon as I was halfway through season 2, I realized nothing really happened to further the story. I thought season 1 to have some potential so I came into season 2 with some expectations. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. \r\n3/10 story: \r\nThere was little to no story. This anime felt more like a slice of life than an adventure type anime. \r\n4/10 art:\r\nThe art was a big let down compared to the previous season. It seems they just rushed this out to get some profitquickly. People say it fits the anime, but an anime can have good art while having their characters making retarded faces. I feel like detailed retarded faces would be funnier. I honestly think even fan animations on youtube have better quality.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 sound:\\n\r\nNothing really caught my ears during the anime, but I never skipped the opening and ending songs at least. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 characters:\\n\r\nI don't think I like any characters and that's in a bad way. In It's always in Sunny in Philadelphia, they are all assholes to each other, but I like them as characters. But in this anime, they are all assholes and I don't like their characters. Darkness in any situation is a pervert and is never serious. This really gets annoying and it was never funny in the first place. Aqua reminds me of an annoying version of Shinpachi from Gintama. All she does is scream and complain. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Megumin is an alright character though. Besides from the refusal to learn another trick than explosion to help the group, she's probably the least annoying. Tbh I kinda like Kazuma as a character. He's interesting and steers away from the usual cliches. He doesn't take shit from other characters even if they're a girl and voices his opinions on things. Like equality and such. Most of the characters are presented as is and they don't seem to have another side to them that we can learn about. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 enjoyment:\\n\r\nAlthough this anime overall was disappointing story wise and comedy wise, It still got a few chuckles out of me, just barely. Nothing major really happened. I don't mind anime with no story or being episodic, but at least be really really funny like Saiki, Gintama, The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, Nichijou, etc. \\n\\n\r\n5/10 overall:\\n\r\nI'm not being a hater towards this anime, I just wanted it to go in a different direction. This had the potential to be one of my favorite comedies, but all the jokes were just sex jokes and they explored nothing more than that.",

            "content": "Consistency is hard to find in comedy. Many shows can be funny some of the time, but few can build off their initial success to keep an audience engaged for the long haul. Konosuba avoids the common pitfalls found in its genre by building off the success of season 1, getting even crazier in its lampooning of trapped in another world tropes and continuing to satirize its characters who find creative ways to fail at life.\r\nHaving already established the character cast and running gags, season 2 is able to hit the ground running immediately throwing viewers into the thick of a prosecution against Kazuma whoyet again can't catch a break from misfortune. It takes a mere 30 seconds to remember why we were so fond of Konosuba to begin with, and the comedy never loses it's momentum from there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought the characters were lazy idiots before, it's taken to another level where they're given the stage of an entire season to show just how ridiculous they can be together. Kazuma becomes the one true king of trash, Aqua an even bigger mess of tears and unwarranted self confidence, Megumin commits one adorable act of embarrassment after another and Darkness discovers creative new ways to flick her masochism switch. There's even a new character introduced in YunYun who's just as weird as the rest.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any popular anime sequel there's a lot of criticism being levied towards Konosuba that I'll address here.  The arguments aren't necessarily incorrect - the art style is worse and the party doesn't make substantial progress, but these complaints show a lack of understanding of the point of the anime. This is a parody. They are supposed to suck. The joke is seeing just how many ways they can manage to make their situation even worse than before. The fact that they even managed to exit the town this season is cause for celebration, and of COURSE within minutes of leaving they run into another issue. \\n\\n\r\nBeing beautifully animated wouldn't make Konosuba's humor any more effective. Some of the funniest moments are when the characters devolve into a frantic mess of panic like when Aqua cries herself into a moving blob. The opening theme, easiest place for animators to make beautiful, has a scene with all the characters dancing out of model and only a few seconds later is a gorgeously animated Megumin explosion. The final episode has some of the best animation of the Winter season interspersed with some of the worst. It's all intentional and works well for this show.\\n\\n\r\nAfter two strong additions to the comedy genre, Konosuba has inserted itself among the funniest anime in recent memory. A must watch series for those who can enjoy parodical slapstick humor, I pray that a third season is on the horizon for even more adventures from the worst group of travelers in virtual world gaming history.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED EVERY FEW EPISODES*\r\n*Updated as of Episode 9*\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 can be described simply as \"Disappointing\" or \"Mediocre\". There was lots of hype around the second season, however, thus far, it has been a mess. That's what I initially thought, however, it seems like KonoSuba Season 2 is just overrated. \r\nThere are many problems with the second season of KonoSuba. Firstly, the art has gotten worse compared to the first season. There are many scenes where it feels like the animators just got lazy and didn't do their best. The character faces sometimes look weird with the eyes in \"interesting\" positions.The art isn't bad compared to other anime, but it isn't what it used to be, something that the animators could feel proud to have produced. The characters are also less detailed but the backgrounds are fine. It feels like the studio and animators have gotten lazy or maybe just didn't have enough money. Keep in mind that this anime has lots of fanservice and sorta feels like it could be an ecchi. After a thorough examination, the art isn't that bad. It's definitely a downgrade but it isn't bad. There are some parts where the framerate feels like I am using the crappy internet, but the problem was the animation. (Mostly Ep6)\\n\\n\r\nThe story has been mostly filler for a majority of the episodes that have been aired so far. Nothing serious is happening yet, only time will tell if the story actually gets better. Many episodes have been detached from the main story and do not add anything new. After many episodes, there is finally some story development and things start happening. However, I'm not sure how long this will last. Any plot development is limited by the character's stupidity. This is getting pretty annoying for me.\\n\\n\r\nMany new characters have been introduced and some seem promising, however, there is a lack of character development and most characters are one sided two-dimensional characters. The main character Kazuma is as funny as he was in season one. I think he has gotten funnier but the rest of the cast isn't doing too well. Over time, some of the characters get a bit annoying due to the lack of change and they keep making the same jokes again and again. The characters are more like a bunch of weird traits stuck together with crappy glue. Some of the characters *cough Aqua cough* get pretty annoying at times because she resets all the progress the team makes during the episode. This makes the story more painful to watch. Many of the characters have very large breasts, which can get annoying because of the fact that almost all of the female characters, except Megumin, have abnormally large breasts. If you love large breasts than this anime would be great to watch for you. If not, it may make the whole experience worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are good like the first season and there are no problems with the VAs. The background music isn't memorable at all, like in most mediocre anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, most people don't watch KonoSuba for the story, but for the comedy. In my opinion, season two is very enjoyable to watch and even made me laugh out loud a few times, which isn't too common. My personal enjoyment is pretty good at a 7+. Personally, I don't want to review anime based on my enjoyment, but I prefer to show you the facts and let you decide if you like it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to laugh a bunch with some fanservice in between, then KonoSuba season two should be on your \"Plan to Watch\". I look forward to laughing for 25 minutes each week. It is one of the best anime this season, even though the winter 2017 season is quite weak in my opinion. It is rated too high in my opinion, but typically most comedy anime are rated highly. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want something with a more in-depth plot or characters, then you could consider skipping over KonoSuba unless it gets significantly better later in the season. Even though I do not think KonoSuba is the best thing in the world, it definitely isn't a bad anime, not even close, but it is also far from being something amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns. \\n",

            "content": "KonoSuba 2 had potential to be much better than what we've gotten so far , but it gets bogged down by bad art and animation, characters who are mere caricatures, and an inability to decide what it wants to be.\r\nThe story is a direct continuation of the previous season. The first episode follows Kazuma as he gets arrested and tries to clear his name. This whole season will essentially follow Kauma and his adventuring band as they face (many) hiccups along their ultimate goal: defeating the demon king. A pretty standard goal for a fantasy setting, but we all know that KonoSuba differs when itcomes to its execution. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what made the original season of KonoSuba so unexpectedly entertaining. KonoSuba is a parody of anime set in a fantasy world (see: Sword Art Online), and most of the entertainment comes from how the character tropes from that setting are either subverted or exaggerated. Part of the reason why the first season seemed so entertaining was because of the novelty; what KonoSuba was doing felt like a breath of fresh air in a stale room filled with innumerable \"set in a fantasy/game world\" anime . However, by now, the novelty has worn off. KonoSuba is doing the same thing with its characters as it did in the first season, but it is no longer as entertaining as it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a few quirks that provide for most of the comedy in season 2, but by now you should've noticed how the characters' personalities are defined almost only by their quirks and nothing else, which starts to become stale. In fact, most if not all of the characters can be summed up in one sentence. Buxom masochistic knight. Chuunibyou explosion loving loli wizard. And so on. So far, there is little character development to speak of. I know that that is par for the course for comedies. Character development isn't very funny, so it is sacrificed for comedic antics, but KonoSuba is not a plot-less show. As the plot develops without the characters significantly developing, the discord between the character and plot development becomes more and more apparent. And mixing comedy and character development is not impossible, it has been done before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, this might actually be the worst part of the anime. The art was a significant step down from season 1, even for my untrained eyes. The episodes aren't consistent either in terms of art quality. Talking specifically about the character designs, they aren't detailed enough. From certain angles, the characters have a shadow of a nose (which is just a speck) instead of having an actual nose. And the boob sizes were unnerving and unnecessary. I was left wondering how all those women weren't wearing back braces to deal with the back pain caused by the weight of those boobs. You may think i'm exaggerating, but some of the characters had boobs that were bigger than their heads and had the movements of sturdy water balloons. It was comical, and not in a good way. The anime isn't following the source material in this regard, so that isn't the reason. The art otherwise is more or less the same it was in season 1. Bright colors with each main character having a particular color scheme, and pretty backgrounds. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music was decent. The OP is upbeat, the ED is lullabylike, and both fit the show well. The other situational tracks aren't memorable, but they serve their purpose well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne more point of contention before I wrap up this preview is how KonoSuba is slowly (but surely) going from a parody of the fantasy anime genre to becoming one of the anime it parodies. Assuming you consider parodies to be separate, it is possible to be both the thing you parody and a parody of it (Seto no Hanayome did it, and it did it well), but my first impression from season 1 of KonoSuba was that it was a clear cut parody. Let me clarify: KonoSuba slowly starts incorporating those fantasy anime tropes that it previously lambasted, and rather than a parody it starts becoming a comedic anime set in the fantasy world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I know I may have criticized it quite a bit, but KonoSuba 2 is so far still a decent show which will definitely be a source of entertainment for people who enjoyed the first season. I know I will finish watching it (eventually) when it finishes. I just think it could've been much, much better than what we have so far.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I ended up dropping KonoSuba 2",

            "content": "I will tell you this now, I'm too lazy to type up a big review. This is basically the main parts you need to know. \r\nI don't really know why people are saying the 2nd season is \"overrated\" or \"messy\" but I think It hasn't changed as much as how some people think. I realized this for long time now, anime gets more criticism than it deserves. I suggest you ignore the reviews rated 6/10 and lower for this anime or you may be lead in their one sided thoughts. \r\nIf you think the change of art or animation makes it worse, your mostly wrong.In my opinion the change makes it funnier and more enjoyable. For instance, the animation in the opening is more entertaining. I watched the opening with great interest, this was due to the art and how the characters acted. Of course this also refers to the actual anime content, its rather unique if I must say so. Not all people will understand the true qualities of the art since they want the very best of everything. What you shouldn't expect is beautiful scenery and a blissful fantasy world with very detailed characters. When you go into this you should expect it to be less serious and more sketchy for the comedy. So far I've only found a few flaws in the art, that was during the ending and in episode 6,7 and 8 area. It was a low camera angle slowly showing Kazuma and co.. I didn't like any of the character art during that scene. It was difficult to take in seeing the characters I adore like that. Another flaw in the art was the art for Aqua in the ending song, though this might just be my own problem. This might be another problem only for me but I didn't like the CG for the wagon and the horses. I know that it's cheaper but it looks very bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is perfectly in sync with what's going on and works well with the comedy. The soundtracks are 10/10 on specific parts and makes some scenes better than how they would be if it had no sound (Manga as reference). This area is in the clear and only has 1small flaw that is again personal, the ending song. The ending song wasn't good enough to make me watch it, I usually just skipped. \\n\\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, a few parts didn't stay true to the Manga. That is only for the content I read in the Manga (since the chapters are rarely released...). I know from the previous season that content gets changed a lot but it's still funny in the end so I'm not going to continue.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I got bored of this at the end. The sudden seriousness with the sketchy characters was kinda... you know eh. The art of Aqua at the end was virtually cr@p and was uneeded. I'm not sure if they did it on purpose to make it funny or what. It took me a long time to finish this and it dropped my score. It may be different for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I love it: \\n\r\nThe laughs. Honestly though I laughed so much during a episode I swear people heard me. The best trait of the anime is the comedy and the #1 thing I love about it.\\n\\n\r\nBy all means, watch it and see for youself. 8/10 Very entertaining! Thanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Episodes watched - 10\\n\r\nModified by jeikobu11, 30/4/17\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "And now, I, the contrarian buzzkill present to you, Kono2ba: A middling, even less funny, and overall lower quality product that actually wants to be taken seriously at times. It fails by its predecessor's standards and it makes me feel like Kazuma. I'll grab the rotten tomatoes...\r\n*SPOILERS FOR KONOSUBA 2*\r\nI'm gonna come clean. I do not like Konosuba. The first half was really funny but the second half was so stale and infuriating that I would not be looking forward to any more. Hell, I only came back due to the fact that I follow all franchises I've seen, even the ones I dislike orhate. Even still, one can't deny that Konosuba had some novelty and genuine laughs, as well as a lot of heart. Kono2ba on the other hand, is a middling season that ends up being a downgrade in almost every way imaginable. It's more of the same things that made the second half of season 1 vastly inferior to the first half, only with some badly done plot, and a surprising amount of people seek to agree that this is at least inferior to the first season. Now, why the buzzkill viewpoint? Is this season as bad as I say? Well, before I get pelted like an Eris cultist, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, I wouldn't even try to rate the score of a comedy, as they tend to have stories that take no precedence and that are mostly episodic: a platform for the rest of the episode. However, this season actually tries to make us take this seriously at points and even reminds us that there is a central plot and not just a background for our characters to do whatever in. That means, I must take it into account. I'm a monster, I know. Even still, with this we can conclude that this ain't no \"How I Met Your Mother\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 has got to be the most simultaneously dull and aggravating first episodes to any anime I've seen to date. Presents everyone acting uncharacteristically douchey (which is a surprise given how awful some of these people are). Logic fore episode 1 is tossed aside as people make purposefully rash and assholish decisions for conflict that gets resolved at the episode, albeit with Kazuma getting the short end of the stick in the end, which is a common theme for this anime, but I'll get back to that. Some of the reasonings behind plot points, such as a member of the Demon Lord's generals surviving an explosion, or the Axis Cult being the worst people ever to their Goddess, or those same people finally worshiping her again and giving her a brand new power (God Requiem), are so damn plot convenient that they hurt. The Drifters level tone-shifts only make things worse, like in the most climactic moment of episode 10. They also like to make us have emotional moments in which we're supposed to feel for a character or see someone die, only for that to be revoked rather quickly, which sours everything. In the finale, Kazuma and a hot springs overseer are dissolved by a sludge monster that gets frozen, but we never see how they got set free and revived (since that would kill them both and we would need to see them getting revived, but Kazuma remains in the show but the other guy isn't seen again). There's that Darkness family subplot in episode 4 that amounts to nothing after all the buildup from the past 2 episodes.The last 4 episodes are spent on a bad Axis Cult arc that hardly does any progression aside from  taking down another bad guy and then returning to status quo, because that's what a story meant to progress needs. Progression isn't mandatory to any real stretch in this series, as that is not a major problem like many claim. Even then, the series progresses more than many give it credit for. However, given that the first half is largely just a rehash of jokes that got old in season 1 and season 2 is largely this aggravating detour, it makes me want to opt out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEven in a comedy, having your characters be static, one-dimensional characters that only get \"flandarised\" (or having their main personality quirk get taken up to new extremes while being their only personality trait) over time is a bad thing, and will get on people's nerves, and boy did it ruin everything for me here...again. Let's start with Kazuma. Poor, poor Kazuma is never allowed to win. That is the golden rule. It's annoying to see the only sense of reason and human decency be the ultimate punching bag. He's even more observant this time, bur rarely does that come in handy. Sure, he's a but of a spiteful prick, but when you consider the toxic shits around him, can you blame him? Megumin is still a one-trick pony with a thing for explosion magic. Now, she also gets sexualized occasionally and is now as much of a prick as the rest of the group, especially towards Kazuma, because the only likable character isn't allowed to win. Yunyun (introduced in the OVA) is her hopeless and childish rival who doesn't serve much lurpose aside from being made fun of and having a backstory that, while tragic, is forgotten just as quickly as it was brought up. Darkness is the same as always, but with a little more antagonism towards Kazuma, and her shit was as annoying as ever to the point where it gloriously aggravated one of the villains in episode 5. Sena, the prosecutor that arrests Kazuma in episode 1, is an annoying lady who constantly shouts at him for everything and does nothing because we need an obnoxious authority character. The lord in episode 1 is just your stereotypical sleezebag ruler. Wiz, luckily, is still alright, and has a genuinely badass scene in the finale. Hans is a mediocre final villain, but his reasoning for wanting to fuck up the Axis Cult are reasonable; they are the most horrid, pathetic, stupid, and obnoxious people on the planet, just like their goddess, Aqua. Plus, they hate Eris because we gotta torture an actually decent person more because it's totally funny! Vanir, the villain in episode 4 who survives due to the convenient reasoning of being able to have multiple copies of himself, is an actually entertaining villain and eventual side-character. Now, to what really killed everything for me, above all else.\\n\\n\r\nAqua is the worst character in this show by a long mile, and is one of the most unlikeable bitches I've ever seen in fiction. This vain, worthless, problem-causing, obnoxious, pompous, stupid, and pathetic brat gets even worse here with how much they ramp up her stereotypcally bitchy attitude. They even lampshade all of this, but since character development (and, to a lesser extent, plot development) isn't allowed here, the bitch only gets worse with each passing episode. The only reason she helps out the obviously awful and disgusting Axis Cult, they worship her. The only reason she does decent things is because she hopes for benefit. She is the main source of Kazuma's suffering and it was never, ever funny for me. A stereotype of a bitch taken to an extreme that gets ramped up even further this season than last season. Luckily Eris is still tolerable and a safe haven for both myself and Kazuma, but she gets constantly shat on as well. I also hate how in the beginning of episode 1, after trying to help Kazuma not get arrested, and they are threatened, both Kazuma's \"friends\" and \"guild colleagues\" rat him out with absoluyte lies and totally betray him. This show often tries to make it seem like the tetrad of party-mates are friends, but they're played for deception to fuck over Kazuma because making a flawed yet decent person suffer for literally everything has got to be funny. You see my problem? The likable and actually decent people are always shit on, and the one-dimensional pricks only get worse and are just a bunch of obnoxious stereotypes in a fantasy world with different classes that they suck at. It's even worse here since they repeat each character joke at nauseum when they were already dry by the end of the first season, so there was a complete dearth of new comedy.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the elephant in the room; the main point of division among the Konosuba 2 viewers. Studio DEEN handled this anime once again, and here's what I have to say about the visuals. The characters look far inferior, with how they handled going off-model. I get that they did this in order to make the characters even more expressive during jokes involving their reactions, but they should've did what season 1 did and reserved that for those moments exclusively instead of making it the default design. It doesn't even help out those moments well due to how they don't often fit with the actual emotions the characters have during reactions. The characters are rarely off-model and it becomes really jarring and bad to look at, with the benefits being outweighed by the negatives. Hell, it even effects enemy animals to a lesser extent. Action scenes aren't well-handled either when involving Darkness. I get what the team was trying to go for, but where Klasky Chupo (the studio that did Ren & Stimpy, Duckman, and Rugrsts) could pull it off, this studio can't. There are some fantastic animation moments and on the whole, the 2D animation is about on par, but when the rest of the visuals suffer, boy does the value of this fade.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, there are a decent amount of moments with bad CGI involved, such as the bad CGI horses in episode 7 and 8, that one moment of bad CGI water in episode 7, or the CGI sword jabs against Vanir in episode 5. Season 1 never had nearly as many moments, as sporadic as they are here. Sure, some of the nice magic and level up effects are still in display, but not done so enough to help counterbalance all of this. The explosions are still cool to look at, though, and the interior backgrounds can look nice. Still, not enough to save all of this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the OST isn't anything interesting or memorable. They take way too long to add some new tracks, but those new ones are actually pretty decent, an are some of the emotional tracks used for the moments of tension and sadness we're supposed to have. The OP, \"Tomorrow\" by Machico, is a decent OP, is somewhat catchy and nice, and is much better than the first season's OP. The ED, \"Ouchi ni Kaeritai\", is an ok enough ED, and is slightly better than the first season's ED. This is just about the only improvement this show has, and even then, it's not a big improvement, as the music is still overall, meh.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter loathing the first episode of this season, I wasn't sure how this season could make me feel anything other than bitterness.I was sorta right, but there were a few jokes here and there that I actually liked, such as Kazuma using his magic against people (for either new and satisfying digs at his douche allies, or for call backs to the better season 1 jokes) or Darkness landing on her neck after reveling in the lovely and rowdy pain she was in. That one actually made me bust. All of the other jokes made me feel aggravated, however. As stared constantly, I hated seeing actually decent people such as Kazuma get the shitter by everyone constantly. Along with all of the other recycled jokes from season 1 that were stretched way too thin this time, as well as the Axis BS, and every moment with Aqua, It wasn't a pleasant time. I was also groaning at how poorly they handled scenes that we're supposed to take seriously as plot and character moments, like when they are revoked just to give Kazuma another walloping. I didn't hate is as much as episode 1 made me think I would, but it was still a bitter experience that I don't want to go back to.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 38/100\\n\\n\r\nThis season was a middling mess of a sequel that embodied everything I hate about Konosuba while taking itself more seriously, and bring an overall inferior product in terms of quality and production. I can only look back at this with cynicism and say that I am actually tired of Konosuba in general, as well as all fantasy \"trapped in a fantasy game\" light novel adaptations this show parodies. I'll give it one thing, though: it made me respect Season 1 a bit more. Well, with all that aid, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "It\u2019s back. 10 episodes of comedic fantasy with Kazuma and the gang. If you\u2019re got a little kid lurking somewhere inside of you, then Konosuba Season 2 is here to please. If you\u2019re familiar with the first season, then expect all the humor to return in full fold. It\u2019s bright. It\u2019s colorful. The plot sounds like it could have been written by someone who was half drunk. But make no mistake about it\u2026Konosuba Season 2 is here again to entertain.\r\nThe second season wastes little time to get the viewers familiar with the main characters again. It has a small cast yet each of them standout in their own way. The first episode has Kazuma, our well-known 16 year old hikikomori being in trouble again. With accusations pointed against him in an intimidating trial, the series wastes little time to make him look like a fool. Fans of the show should probably expect this as Konosuba satirizes fantasy drama into a comedy. Kazuma is more or less a fool although the rest of the cast isn\u2019t off better than he is. The point is though, season 2 still knows how to have fun with its character cast. Aqua, Darkness, and Megumin all return in style with their roles. Each of them get their own spotlight in one way or another. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps noticeable is the presence of Yunyun, a character that anime viewers may not be too familiar with. She showed up from the OVA episode but in this second season, her role is more expanded as a rival of Megumin. What\u2019s important isn\u2019t just giving the audience a familiarity of her character but also Megumin as well. We learn of her past and in essence, fans of Megumin will be pleased to learn about her besides just being the girl with an obsession for explosions. In addition, the story focuses a bit on Darkness too when she gets involved with a bothersome prince. I can honestly say that without a doubt, the show knows how to make the audience laugh. It\u2019s not just with how the characters\u2019 roles are played out but how this series amplifies their personalities. The sequel combines elements of the first season as well and reintroduces jokes such as frogs swallowing up Aqua in comedic fashion. Oh and who can forget about Kazuma\u2019s panty stealing talent? It\u2019s all back in glory.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, Kazuma is character that I find likeable yet repulsive. The show purposely makes him a self-serving character that can make viewers tear their hair out. Obviously, the show is self-aware about this but to be honest, how many times can you really watch such an idiot being idiotic? The other characters are also more or less the same whether it\u2019s Darkness\u2019 machoism, Aqua\u2019s brutal honesty, or Megumin\u2019s lack of self-control. Some may say that it\u2019s because of their stupidity which makes this series entertaining. However, others can think of their lack of development as holding the show back. Regardless, the character cast supplements with the overall humor so be ready for a lot of that in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nWell, this isn\u2019t news but even before picking up the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that the sequel\u2019s production quality diminished. The first season didn\u2019t have good production quality either although it\u2019s subverted to look that way from the start. It\u2019s like a joke for fans to make fun of regarding the art in the first place. The character facial reactions is still over exaggerated at many humorous segments with visual gags. However in terms of quality, it seems that the sequel did drop the ball more so than the first season. Of course, fan service is still pretty noticeable especially if you\u2019re got a keen eye on Darkness. On the other hand, soundtrack and character voice acting is still generally the same. The OP and ED theme songs still has that atmospheric feel with a catchy tune to go along with its humor. Of course, character voice mannerism still retains their magic so be ready for a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is a joke of itself as it sells its comedy through the storytelling and characters. Selling comedy isn\u2019t easy because fans can take it in the wrong way. However, Konosuba is successful because it\u2019s aware of what it\u2019s doing. The second season will take no time to get fans into the show again from the first episode. It\u2019s like going to coming back to school after a Summer break where you\u2019ll expect the expected.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Whether you love comedy or satire, maybe in the mood for some ecchi memes to quench your kinky desires. KonoSuba is your go to parody to complete all your guilty pleasures! \r\n\"Thou shalt love big breasts, Thou shalt love small breasts\"\r\n\"Whether you're a lolicon, a NEET or a questionably-human fan of animal-eared girls\u2026 just remember Konosuba is still the best\"\r\nKonoSuba S2 at its core is a comedy anime. Its purpose is to make parody of all the guild adventure style animes like S.A.O & Log Horizon and it goes ahead to do that and more. Though each episode is random and zeroes in onspecific anime tropes to ridicule, it still follows the underlying core plot of defeating the devil king. There isn't complexity in its story-telling but due to its bizarre plot-twists in their randomness, it makes the story unique. The pacing of the show is off-putting and some episodes may feel like filler with its repetitive jokes but because of its comedic & ecchi elements, it's enjoyable. The ending isn't as satisfying as the first season but avid fans can expect more of such hilarity in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show are the main characters. Each of them are very distinct & relatable from one another and this anime continues to set them apart by gregariously highlighting their flaws. It's hard to pick a fav one between Kazuma, Aqua, Darkness & Megumin thanks to their voice actors. They alone added a whole new dimension to the characters. The villains and the side characters were a bit interesting but nothing out of the ordinary. The major flaw with the entire cast is their ambiguous decision making and future goals or purpose. Some characters even felt like space fillers. Regardless, Darkness and Kazuma will be highly memorable in this series since they had the most growth overall.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art & sound the show went through a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sort of phase. Due to two different directors taking turns directing the show, you kept going for overtly caricatured faces to overtly epic musical scores. If they found a harmony between these two directors style of delivery the show would flourish more in terms of quality. Still, the hand-drawn animation gives a vibrant feel to the anime and the character designs were always unique. One drawback this show had was the OP & ED song. Unlike previous season, the OP & ED songs aren't memorable nor catchy. The background OST on the other hand, was decent. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, despite its glaring flaws in its unclear storyline, weak side characters and directing switcheroos, being a parody show at its core, this show is enjoyable to watch. It doesn't take itself seriously and viewers shouldn't either. They should go in with low expectation and be rewarded with a good comedy series to laugh and meme about. This show offered great quotes and I think it has potential as a show to be re-watched as a group. If you have a few hours to spend and want to watch a hilarious comedy with your friends or by yourself, give this show a watch. I know you will enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading my review. I'm always open to criticism and suggestions. I hope you found this short but supaishi review helpful.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S. \"Eris Pads Her Breasts\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of Konosuba was a surprise hit because it had great character interactions, well done comedy, good consistent visuals and a good soundtrack.\r\nWhen Konosuba 2 was announced, I was really excited because I wanted too, see this characters again but this time actually have character development. \r\nAfter binge-watching all 10 episodes of Konosuba 2 and I am going too, be real honest. Season 2 are far inferior too, season 1 in a lot of way.\r\nWhy do I think Konosuba 2 isn\u2019t as good as season 1? \u00a0You will find in this review\r\nHello everyone this are Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome too, my reviewof Konosuba 2 and with that out of the way let\u2019s begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\u00a0\\n\r\nHonestly theyre are hardly story in this season whatsoever.\\n\r\nIt's just Satou and his gang just traveling around places doing comedic/pervy\\n\r\nthings from start too, finish without any story/character buildup whatsoever.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right this season of Konosuba has no objective, no build-up, hardly any world building and overall its feels more like a slice of life anime than an adventure/fantasy show that\u2019s feels like filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any story really annoyed this season at the end of the first season it hinted that the show was going somewhere due too, the events of the last season. Instead Konosuba 2 are a generic fantasy anime that doesn\u2019t do much expect for comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about Konosuba\u2019s comedy. The comedy in the first was greatly handled because one it was actually funny; two the comedy hardly repeats itself and three the character interactions during those comedy moments were funny and refreshing\\n\\n\r\nNot even the comedy can save this season in-fact the comedy here lost its charm completely.\\n\r\nIts repetitive, abuse, predictable and not too, mention its honestly really boring seeing the same type comedy being used over and over and over! This are not good writing whatsoever. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s just lazy, cheap and generally annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI know Konosuba are comedy anime set in a fantasy world but come on take more risks.\\n\r\nBaka and Test are a show that great comedy that are mostly handled well and fresh. Also unlike Konosuba the characters in Baka and test actually do developed as well as having great and interesting backstory's especially in season 2.\\n\r\nAlso, Baka and Test has story that actually progresses theyre were some filler but least Baka and Test has great comedy and character chemistry too, back it up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of KonoSuba are a disappointment.\\n\r\n4/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\u00a0\\n\r\nSeriously what the hell happened too, this characters after the first season.\u00a0\\n\r\nHow do this characters become more repetitive and annoying? \\n\r\nNot too, mention theyre are no character development whatsoever?\\n\\n\r\nSatou are still the same character from season 1 expect here he has no character development and he always does the same comedic/pervy things from season 1.\\n\r\nI have nothing more too, say about this character.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Aqua...\\n\r\nWhat the hell happened too, you?\\n\r\nOkay I liked Aqua in the first season because she was charming and funny but here she' has been reduced too, an unlikeable and whiny character whom cries a lot. Not too, mention her jokes are no longer funny. Hell some of her jokes made me cringe. I really dislike Aqua here. \\n\\n\r\nMegium are the only character that I liked in this season.\\n\r\nShe are still funny as ever, very likable and she's still an entertaining character that I personally liked.\\n\\n\r\nLike with Satou Darkness are still the same character from season 1 whom hardly changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all generic stereotypes in a fantasy setting whom do generic fantasy things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Konosuba 2 are disappointing \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe first season of KonoSuba has some good visuals that was consistent for the most part.\u00a0\\n\r\nLike with the comedy the visuals in KonoSuba are a downgrade filled with inconstant art and lackluster animation that can get choppy at times.\u00a0\\n\r\nI still question Studio Deen for animating four shows at the same time because it\u2019s clearly shows how much effort that Deen put into season 2.\\n\r\nAlso, theyre are more fan-service this time around and like with the comedy are abused, repetitive and annoying.\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can say about the visuals are the backgrounds because like with the first season the backgrounds are well detailed and colorful\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of KonoSuba are the same as the first season.\u00a0\\n\r\nI have really nothing too, say about the soundtrack because it\u2019s still an enjoyable soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nI personally wasn\u2019t a fan of the opening of Konosuba 2 Tomorrow because the opening itself was kinda out of tone and didn\u2019t had the charm of the first opening called Fantastic Dreamer.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Ouchi ni Kaeritai\u00a0are a really good ending theme that fits the tone of the show really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting are good for what it are.\\n\r\nIt still needs a dub because like with season 1 it will add more charm too, the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRepetitive and annoying are the best words too, describe Konosuba 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes nowhere, most of the characters are a massive downgrade from the S1 counterparts with no charm too, them, terrible comedy, inconstant visuals with choppy animation and the soundtrack that the good thing I can say about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis are how you don't do a squeal!!!\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't recommend watching this squeal unless you are a die-hard fan of Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\nIn short Konosuba 2 are a average show that ruined the charm that the first season had.\\n\\n\r\nI give Konosuba 2 a 5/10\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations \\n\r\nBaka and Test\\n\r\nSlayers\\n\r\nLog Horizon\\n\r\nGintama\\n\r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash\\n\r\nExcel Saga\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this has been Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "(Updated as of Episode 10)\r\n[Note: This review, my first one on MAL if that makes any difference to anyone,may seem like it is attacking those who do not favor my opinion, however, everything I write in the following review is objective and contains only facts. Thanks for taking the time to read this]\r\nWhen I first stumbled upon Konosuba, red warning lights started flickering in my brain: 'Another one of these?\" What happened after the first episode is usually the same for most people, including me: They loved it. \r\nAnd the second season does it again: It brings everything you loved from the first season back,with more humor this time. Because that is what Konosuba is - a comedy. One might even say it's the Seinfeld of anime. \\n\r\nYou don't watch Konosuba for a deep meaningful story, you watch for the flashy colorful animation, cool references, and jokes, jokes and more jokes.\\n\\n\r\nI think this a point a lot of people miss, and is exactly why most critics versed in the field of objective reviews give it a 5/10 - they look for deeper meaning in a show that is not supposed to have any. \\n\r\nSure, if you look at it like any other anime, the story is a 5/10, which is the exact score I gave it. \\n\r\nThere is no real connection between episodes other than to reference earlier jokes and gags. Instead, every episode is a mini-story for itself, just like an episode from a sitcom. Or, as it is more commonly known in the anime world, filler. But don't be discouraged by this, these episodes are anything but boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the characters. Konosuba makes one thing clear - the main cast are as*holes, and that is exactly why we should love them. And love them we do. The side characters serve to show the true faces of the main cast, again, just like in a sitcom, and provide space to develop the main cast's running gags or make new jokes.\\n\r\nBy having most of the characters dressed in different colored outfits, the show can easily make you distinguish them while making fast-paced comedy, another well thought out detail.\\n\r\nAnimation?\\n\r\nOh boy, animation. Best way I would describe it - standard. And season 2 only made it worse, right? Wrong. Well, partially. For instance, do you consider the animation of Ping Pong bad, or substandard? No, because that is the whole point. It doesn't focus on animation, but on storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nKobosuba has something similar going for it. You see,  Kikuta-san, the character designer  doesn't give a damn about the animation being \"substandard\" as long as it serves to amplify the comedy, which is exactly what is does! (check his Twitter). Easiest way to see this is just to compare the opening of the 2 seasons - it is clear that the second one has far less attention focused on the animation and subtlety of jokes, and just goes full out on showing us that it is a comedy with the cheesy faces and character movements.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like to repeat myself for the n-th time: Konosuba is a comedy, and it is a well done comedy at that. As a comedy, it shines about most others. That is all you need to know.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Score : 5.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFinishing up Konosuba\u2019s second season, I\u2019m very happy to report that it doesn\u2019t suck. For context, Konosuba was going to be the first anime I\u2019ve ever actually watched as it airs. Week after week. However, this show\u2019s first few episodes were less than exceptional and didn\u2019t have many of the elements I enjoyed in the first season. Well, more specifically, nothing in the show changed and I felt as though they are rehashing the entire story for the sake of an unestablished return to norm of this anime sitcom. So, I guess it had too much of what I enjoyed in the firstseason, which made it too similar and therefore tedious.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was ecstatic to see was that Konosuba rebounded gloriously with its second half, as the character dynamics tightened up and the show felt like it was back to what made it fairly enjoyable in its first season, without being overly reliant on established jokes. I\u2019d be hard-pressed to call it anything but an above-average comedy, however, it does just enough to be appreciated in my eyes. With the gang of loveable misfits journeying just past their starting zone, we don\u2019t really get a chance to see anything new. Even as the season concludes in a completely different area, the zone itself never felt as a completely new region. Just a region with a gimmick. But this is a comedy show after all and any talk of character development, world-building, and secondary characters often falls on deaf ears. \\n\\n\r\nI think there are particular elements that should be included when discussing a show\u2019s return in a second season, though. The ability to craft a new story in a familiar world and setting. Every great sitcom never rests on its laurels and always strives to tell the best stories in the established setting. Whether it is Community, The Office, Arrested Development, or Always Sunny in Philadelphia, each great sitcom elevates something. It can be adding new dynamics, new worlds, or simply raising the stakes by adding unique story elements. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba isn\u2019t a great sitcom. Not yet anyway. However, as its thankfully short season wraps up, I finally start to see the kind of picture it is beginning to paint. In a generic yet whimsically ridiculous world full of wacky characters and unfortunately boring creature-design, we get a non-story that does just enough to stand out. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[What is a Second Season] \\n\\n\r\nAfter Konosuba\u2019s less-than-stellar beginning to this season, I felt the need to write a long diatribe about why this show completely misses the point of having a second season. Since it isn\u2019t telling a story of any substance, you are instead looking for different elements within a sitcom like this. An overtly cartoony sitcom, at that. These are the goals of a second season. \\n\\n\r\n1.)You should be raising the stakes. \\n\\n\r\n2.)You should be making sure those stakes stay raised and are actually something palpable, rather than tacked on for plot devices. \\n\\n\r\n3.)Don't rest on your laurels as a writer. As in, don't rely on past gags to fill up the comedy quota. \\n\\n\r\n4.)Understand and develop. Have a good knowledge on these characters and further push their interactions into different territories. \\n\\n\r\n5.)Bring in new, interesting characters to create different dynamics within the show that you haven't explored before. \\n\\n\r\n6.)Establish the world.\\n\\n\r\nThese points aren\u2019t all required. There are plenty of great sitcom\u2019s that do one or two for their second season. However, to accomplish a great sophomore year, you want to be applying at least one of these elements. For example, NBC\u2019s critically acclaimed sitcom Community, which just so happens to be the best comedy ever written, in my opinion, employed many of these tactics. For one, it added a background story that raised the stakes throughout the season, it introduced new, interesting tertiary characters that served to three, expand the world. The show also delved into concept-episodes, creating hilariously unique and original parody-esq episodic narratives that didn\u2019t rely on previously established gags of the first season. But that\u2019s Community, it is the best. \\n\r\nAnother example is Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where its semi-mediocre first season didn\u2019t speak well for the show. To try and revitalize a show that is distinctly not about character development, they introduced a completely new primary character in Frank, played wonderfully by Danny DeVito. Or what about The Office, which reformed its second season, straying far away from the confines of copying the original show and going into more thematic sitcom storytelling? All of these shows brought something new to a second season. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba didn\u2019t. The biggest aspect to a sitcom is the actual comedy. So of course, you must be funny. And if you read my original KonoSuba review where I dissected the meaning of a joke, and how it works, you'd know that the only way a joke works is if it isn't expected. Comedy works because it is unexpected, the only way an expected and obvious joke would make someone laugh is usually ironically. Comedy needs to stay unexpected to be fresh. The way it accomplishes this is by constantly switching up character dynamics and putting characters into different scenarios. A great example is Always Sunny, which has the entire cast usually embark on more and more audacious journeys as the show progresses, consistently ratcheting up the stakes and creating for new dynamics.I draw so many parallels to Always Sunny because it, similarly, doesn\u2019t focus on a complete narrative and just follows these characters as they do wacky shit. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Problem with the First Half]\\n\\n\r\nThis caused instant disappointment with Konosuba because it felt as though it was completely coasting on what made season one stand out. You know that funny gag where one of the characters gives a thumbs up? Or what about the entire concept of using a funny face as a punchline? Remember how it felt authentic in season one because the entire show had this rugged indescribable charm? Well, get ready for the creators becoming aware of that and running the entire concept into the ground. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, for some odd reason, decided to make the characters look almost ridiculously ugly. Which is fine, but it completely conflicted with everything else in the previous season. They made the \u201cfunny face\u201d gag a running punchline for numerous jokes. This made me instantly get sick of the entire concept. No face is that funny when it is surrounded by other, equally dumb looking faces. Konosuba was about dumb looking dumb people. Not about horrendously misshapen monsters that are also dumb people. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, this is quickly fixed. With the second episode, onwards, the art style miraculously improves and we are back to having high-momentum and movement-based animation which I really enjoyed from the first season. A cartoon is supposed to be fluid and dynamic with movement, by flooding the character with mesh-frames you get infinitely sillier looking scenarios and significantly more stretchy and lively designs. This makes the show feel like a cartoon, which it is. I love that. \\n\r\nThat being said, I wish I could say the same about anything else in these first four episodes. The show did this obnoxious narrative structure where it\u2019d just separate characters completely, which made their interactions more predictable and banal. They remove Darkness from the show for the first three episodes for some pointless plotline that goes nowhere. While I\u2019m not a massive fan of Darkness\u2019 character gimmick, at least it added a potential for a new dynamic. Now it is just Megumin relying on her overt character design cuteness and affinity for explosions rather than those being a backline to her actual relationship with the characters. It felt as though these characters were already being flanderized, which is weird because they have literally no distinguishable traits to flanderize apart from their one character gimmick. \\n\\n\r\nNow we are left with Aqua and our protagonist, Kazuma, who have virtually the same kind of character interaction every god damn time. It is always Aqua being a brat and then Kazuma being dismissive and that leads to more yelling. This got boring in season one and since they split these characters apart at the start of season two, this is all we get to hear for the first three episodes. \\n\r\nOne of Konosuba\u2019s strongest points is its knack for having all the characters involved in something. Doing this completely negates what is fundamentally enjoyable in the show. We are left with these hollow character interactions that lack any form of chemistry whatsoever. It felt stilted, awkward, and worst of all, unfunny. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba also doesn\u2019t bother adding any secondary or tertiary characters of any interest. There is a red-haired guy that just kind of walks around remarking about the gang\u2019s travels. There\u2019s a cute girl in a uniform whose gimmick is she gives orders, but also gets turned on by some sort of masochism I can\u2019t pin down, which is way too like Darkness for such a small cast of characters. There is also a cat, who\u2019s pretty much just used as a thing to have around so they can sell toys with that cat on them. \\n\\n\r\nWe are left with a wholly sub-average product which is less-funny than the already not-too-funny original, relying too heavily on reusing jokes that worked and pummeling them into the ground. Even the story is the same thing as it was in season one. Except in season one it was natural for them to want money since they need housing, while here it is some shoehorned reason that they need to pay something back. So they are back as the underdogs. But that never lasts long for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Rebound]\\n\\n\r\nThen the show gets better. Substantially better. As the second mini-arc is introduced, I begin seeing that the show is slowly becoming a bit more serialized in a very limp sense of the word. We are starting to see things get call backed to as a tool for a story, rather than a joke. This is where the show begins to shine once again. The animation is looking better, the story it is telling is at least semi-coherent and reasonable of a comedy, and finally, all the characters are back together. \\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions are just as predictable as they always have been. You\u2019ve seen one you\u2019ve seen em\u2019 all. What I do enjoy is Kazuma\u2019s growth as an actual spell-user. We slowly get to see him learning new skills that become useful in the grand scheme of things. This subtle increase in character power is intriguing. It is sad that every other character\u2019s gimmick is so reliant on their power that I doubt we\u2019ll be seeing them grow at all in any way. The scenarios are kept fresh though.\\n\\n\r\nThe gang begins to travel to a different city, which serves to cap the season and create a beautifully animated conclusion. The animation is now consistently impressive to me, especially on this shows insistence that it is definitely a cartoon. It reminds me more of Spongebob than anything. There is so much physical humor with very light-characterization and similar premises executed fairly well that I can just imagine these characters living in Bikini Bottom. Of course we get to see more bottoms in this show. By that I mean there is copious amounts of fanservice which, honestly, I still don\u2019t get. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters aren\u2019t that attractive. In fact, they are silly looking. The sexual fanservice is almost never actually funny, or even used as a joke at all. There are just characters in skimpy outfits posing in odd ways that just distracts you from what is happening. Even poor Megumin is there with all these other scantily clad big-tittied women. Every bend or bow these characters do is always shot in the back so we get a nice, long glimpse of their ass. It comes off as sleazy and distinctly not funny. \\n\r\nNow this is anime and sexualization is nothing new. After all, the biggest selling point of most anime is colorful girls running around blushing. But I can\u2019t help but feel that this show would be markedly more entertaining if it didn\u2019t feel the need to distract you with this element. Konosuba also has a knack of doing something I now like to call \u201cfake subversion\u201d, where a show has the cake and eats it too. If it is setting up for a ridiculously generic anime clich\u00e9, such as walking in on someone while they are changing, it\u2019ll point out that is happening\u2026 but still do it. For example, earlier on in the show during the awful first few episodes we get to see a totally not shoehorned scene of Kazuma offering to take a bath of Megumin. The clich\u00e9 is of course pointed out, and Megumin instantly dismisses it. Great. That is where the joke ends, right? The actual subversion. But no, then Kazuma says some dumb petty shit and she strips naked in front of him and you get this weird moment where you are wondering if it\u2019ll lead to a punchline, but it never does. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t do this. Ever. No one likes this. If you are someone who watches this show to watch a fourteen-year-old anime girl get naked, then you\u2019ll be disappointed since this show is very careful with its nudity as it is a PG-13 product. If you are someone looking for subversive comedy you\u2019ll be insulted because this fake-out subversion just ruins the joke. No one is left happy with this conclusion and that scene particularly frustrated me. That being said, the show actually does well to avoid being overly meta. A big complaint I had about Konosuba's first season was its over-reliance on pointing out cliches and going right ahead and doing other, equally stupid cliches. This made for a disjointed experience that felt like the writer/s were either unaware of the cliche, or simply lacked the creativity to properly subvert it.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the show gets better. While this can be chocked up to the gang getting back together, it is also worth noting that the change in location helps as well. This show is often praised for its world building, which I find baffling since this show\u2019s world is as generic as it gets. The idea that the monsters in this show are \u201cdumb-looking\u201d would be a good one if they were dumb looking. The only monsters that are silly and over-the-top are the giant funny-looking frogs and the exploding rocks in the show\u2019s opening. Everything else is unfortunately incredible generic. We get this scene of a stampede of animals running towards our hometown. They are virtually just colored big lizards. Their gimmick is they trample things. Then two episodes later we get yet another kind of animal that tramples things, but this time it is an ostrich. In what world is this creative? \\n\\n\r\nThe unfortunate side here is that they can easily do the same kind of over-exaggerated animal designs as they do with their characters. Take preconceived MMO designs and blow them totally out of proportion, much like you did with the main four characters. This could\u2019ve been ground for some funny parody elements, which this show\u2019s second season is very light on. This show was never quite a parody, however, it definitely had MMO themes to it. Everything from the quest text to Kazuma\u2019s reaction to things to the way abilities and learning them works. It hardly ever satirizes the concepts behinds these things, which is unfortunate since when it does it often leads to the funniest scenes in the show. As I\u2019ve said in my season one review, this show is at its funniest when it does these parodies. It is also its least funny when it relies too heavily on being sexual. Which just comes off as plodding and lame. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Konosuba is still likeable. I think after it came back from the disappointment of the first few episodes, we returned to what made even the more tedious parts of season one likeable. Which is the characters in this setting. They aren\u2019t developed or interesting, but they are comfortable. This show can be defined as comfortable. It is an extremely easy and light-hearted watch. Nothing about it is daring or shocking, it is just something to throw on because it makes you feel good and occasionally has you chuckle under your breath.\\n\\n\r\nI wish that this show didn\u2019t have such a weak start this season because I feel like if it started strong, much like season one, it could\u2019ve been equally as good, while still unfortunately relying on very predictable character interactions. The reason for this is because as you watch these characters\u2019 adventure together, no matter how uninspired these adventures may be, you begin to enjoy watching them. Much like comfort food. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is very much like a classic kid's cartoon. It can just as easily be some weekly webisode series that lasts three minutes and I don\u2019t think I would siphon anything different from it. It is that palatable. I remember arguing with someone about the show. They kept saying that it is like Seinfeld or Always Sunny in the sense that these characters are assholes and that\u2019s where the comedy is buried. But I couldn\u2019t help but disagree. These characters are dumb; they aren\u2019t assholes in any sense of the word. The comedy in this show is well-meaning to a fault. If they were written like douchebags stuck together, like Always Sunny, the comedy would have to be significantly darker to be affective. In one scene, Kazuma, probably our more morally ambiguous character rejects the offer of free money because he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s earned it. If that isn\u2019t light-hearted I don\u2019t know what is.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the heart of Konosuba and its second season. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Or, in Konosuba\u2019s case, the more things stay the same, the more things stay the same. Because while it doesn\u2019t do anything new, I can\u2019t hate it for that as much as I may want to. It attempts to recapture the essence of season one and I think, for many, it did. Everything from the opening, which is actually better than the season one opening, and the closing track, which isn't better, all try to convey the same message. The most different element it employs is a ampler use of serialized storytelling, which I actually enjoyed for the most part. I hope that this show becomes a journey to remember, by creating consistently funny foundations to a big journey these characters could go on. But until that moment, I\u2019m content with simply calling it a producer\u2019s blessing on this wonderful world. \\n",

Defeating the devil king was clearly just an excuse to have Kazuma enter the world. It's still a great and simple excuse to get everything started though.\r\nAlmost everyone is saying that the art quality dropped from the first season.  I personally didn't notice a huge difference.  The art was still really good and added to what the show was trying to convey.\r\nThe sound is very similiar to season 1, but I still love the music.  Konosuba'ssoundtrack isn't my favorite, but it's still really good and it really helps with making the show more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are still the same too.  The whole cast is in what I'd  call the \"love them or hate them\" category.  Season 2 does provide some more background information and development for the main crew (Kazuma, Darkness, Megumin, and Aqua) as well as Wiz.  You finally get to see Wiz use some of her magic.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this season.  I like it at least as much as season 1, if not more.  I recommend watching this season if you like the first one.",

If you look at their faces the entire episode the way it is drawn and put together with their words and sound it's simply beautiful.\r\nSound: The sound is amazing Unlike last seasons blandopening and Meh soundtrack, This one is memorable full of Perfectly Timed Sounds to go with what's going on. Their voice actors are amazing props to Kazuma, Darkness, and Megumin's voice actors for amazing work, it's almost like it's real the way they voice their characters like they are those characters is simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters of this season are given depth along with new characters that when added to the cast make it even funnier, so much can be said on this I can only sum it up in one sentence \"Wow, *Wink and duck away*\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime because it is simply too lovable to hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 Needs more explosions (Subject to change to ten once more explosion is seen)",

            "content": "First of all, I have never written a review of an anime in my life, but this is surely something I'v had on my mind for quite some time.\r\n*spoiler free*\r\nKonoSuba Season 2, a second round of the loveable and lively characters we saw come to life in the first season of the show, being this second season a direct continuation of where we left off in season 1.\r\nMany of you who want to watch this show after watching the first season might be wondering why the reviews for this show rank so badly, and that would be a fair question, but it all boils downto how some people simply came into the show expecting exactly what it was not meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 stands exactly the same as its prequel, its the story of an unlikely love-hate relationship between a group of friends brought together by sheer coincidence sharing adventures in the harsh reality of a Fantasy/Medieval world.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 8/10-\\n\\n\r\nThe first critique people give this show is the art, wich I can guarantee isn't fair, since the art presented in this show is some of the most fleshed-out to ever come out of a modern anime, imediately giving off a goofy vibe while still being aesthetically pleasing.\\n\r\nIt's very colorful and lively and it fits the characters extremely well, and when all of that is brought together it really makes the show come alive.\\n\r\nI think that given the budget cuts the animation team was given, they really did the best job they could and it doesn't disapoint at all.\\n\\n\r\n-Story 8/10-\\n\\n\r\nWhere do i even begin, story, this is where the anime fails for most people.\\n\r\nFirst of all, KonoSuba never set out an objective for itself, apart from all the \"Defeat the Demon King\" stuff, wich only exists to drive the characters forward.\\n\r\nSo what exactly is the story behind this fantastic and magically show? Its exactly what's described in the first season of the show, the mundane struggles of a NEET brought into the type of world he thinks he is the most accomodated with and his party of extremely weird people.\\n\r\nIts an extremely clever comedy jab at the so-ever satured genre of \"brought into another world\", coming to life in a comedy-driven show.\\n\r\nSo if you expected this beautiful show to have a dark turn and suddenly become serious and grim, don't even bother watching, but if you liked season 1 for what it was and want to see more, im sure you won't be disapointed.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say sound wise, its consistent and has a beautifuly composed opening and ending, that goes perfectly along with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines, its characters, they are unique and down-to-earth, each one of them stands out for themselves and its really hard to pick a favourite one in the bunch of loveable dorks this show presents us with, most of them carry out from season one, but this second second season still introduces some new ones that are equally good and enjoyable as the likes of YunYun (If you haven't watched the first OVA that will be the first time seeing her).\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10/10-\\n\\n\r\nThis is heavily opinion based, but there are some good reasons for enjoying this show so much, its exactly what i expected it to be and it feels like time well spent, it brightens the mood of anybody watching it and even though its kind of an episodical anime its hard to feel bored or annoyed on how the show isn't going anywhere especifically because there is just so much to look at in the world of this show that none of it feels like wasted time.\\n\r\nI can guarantee anyone reading this that the enjoyment they had in season 1  will surely make them company throughout the enterity of this second season.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nGiven all the reasons stated above I urge every single person that liked season 1 or any other comedy animes to watch this show and form their own opinion on it, in the end reviews here are mostly the opinion of individuals on a certain Anime, and when in doubt you should always give it a try, even if other people don't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Amazing world of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! Season 2 awaits you, and it's certainly worth your time.\\n\r\nThanks to anyone who bothered to read my review this far, and i hope it helped clearing some uncertainty over the reviews this show had been recieving.",

            "content": "Show is over and, for once in my liffe, I'm going to try and review it here. \r\nKonosuba's second season is really something out of this world in many aspects. It's a crazy, self aware comedy that works thanks to its characters, that could make a joke funny no matter how many times it had been done before; and it's spot on comedic timing. But those are just empty words if I don't go deeper into them, so let's jump straight to work.\r\nThe show's sense of humor is probably the most important thing and the first that one can notice, and it's never totally objective,so bear that in mind while you read.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the show starts with a serious -even heartfelt- scene that works both as a summary and as a nice moment. That doesn't last long, however, since the serious tone gets turned upside down in a split second thanks to the characters' \"peculiarities\". That, to be honest, is the general style of comedy the show employs: It builds up expectations based in our experience in anime and MMORPGs, and then throws them on the ground thanks to its world's \"unbalanced\" rules and it's characters' deplorable mental condition.  While it may sound like it should get repetitive, that's far from the truth, since in most cases, it's the situations in which the character traits come to play what keep changing and make everything fresh. The only joke that gets a bit old is Darkness' masochism, but it still works and brings some great moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that really stands out is the animation. I've read multiple times that it \"suffered from low budget\" or that it was \"worse than the first season and clearly rushed\", to which I can only respond with the most sincere lack of understanding, for not only do the crazy faces and weird poses and physics make everything more memorable, they are also intentional.  Koichi Kikuta, in charge of animation, did want the animators to mess with faces and proportion. He wanted everyone's style to be raw and expressive and he wanted the animation to support the show's tone as much as possible. Only real thing is that his philosophy directly clashes with the popular notion that screenshots can define animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, there are some incredible acting and action cuts, ranging from Megumin's explosions to Aqua's expression (In fact, I'd say a good bit of the last episode will soon be in sakugabooru), but the show isn't what I'd call \"great looking\" or \"breathtaking\" at all. It's more on the average side for the most of its run in matters of fluidity and overall technical quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe third key aspect for understanding why Konosuba works is the awesome sound design. \\n\r\nThe voices can't be defined with any word that isn't perfect, and the voice actors sound like they're having a blast in every single line. The preformances crank the comedy up to eleven and give the characters a new layer of charisma and personality. (That, I'll go back in a bit)\\n\r\nThe music is also really good. It's not a soundtrack for the ages and, except for a couple tracks, I wouldn't really listen to it on my own. It is, however, more than enough to help the tone and the mood, and the opening and ending are both catchy and representative of the show. The first follows the more upbeat, crazy style of the show, while the latter is calm and really works to convey the feeling of peace that probably reigns when the team's not screwing up in any aspect of life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd at last, but definetly not least, I HAVE to talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey're the cornerstone of the show, the strong main pillar that prevents it from ever falling or losing ballance. They're what diferentiate konosuba from any other \"Trapped in a fantasy world\" shows, and that's because they're just that, characters, instead of walking-talking gags. When one writes comedy, it's important to think about how the characters are going ot be treated and, In this case, as pathetic as they are as human beings, and being the base of most of the jokes, they're never the joke themselves. At least not in the \"narrative\" meaning. Their personalities are bound to create comical situations, but they're not all they have. Thay connect with each other and grow fond of their partners, eventually being friends and giving us some heartfelt moments that really make us love them a lot more. Whithout the show really teling us in an \"in your face\" manner, they progress and advance.  They're pathetic, lovable people and I'd definetly go on an adventure with them, and that, is the real difference between Konosuba and any other comedy anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, with a void I didn't really expect growing on my soul, I'll just go and read the rest of the light novels, and hope that, someday, God will bless this wonderful world with more of their animated adventures.",

            "content": "The main thing that I want to convey to you is that I really enjoyed this series! It made me laugh a lot in unpredictable ways and I loved the characters. For me is wasn't the type of anime that I thought about in the week between each episode but one that I really enjoyed coming back to each week and was really sad when I realised it only had 10 episodes and I had watched them all. So if you want something chill to watch that will make you laugh this is the show for you!\r\nThe first series of KonoSuba was probably one ofthe most enjoyable shows I have watched and having just finished the second season I have to say that season 2 was just as good if not better than the first.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a group of misfits and their adventures in a fantasy world. The story is quite slow pace but being a comedy that the story isn't always the best part of the show. I always found every episode was always very funny and this for me made up for the lack of progression in the story. I can see this story progressing a lot in future seasons (knock on wood).\\n\\n\r\nWhat is a big part of the humour is the characters. In this season you get to see different sides of characters and looking back at season 1 they have changed a lot in my opinion. Kazuma the main protagonist was a human who got dropped into the world after he died. He has lots of \"quirky\" skills that seem pointless but always seem to help out in life or death situations. He hasn't stopped being a scumbag but seems to care more about the party and has taken up more of a leading role which is good to see. Aqua is a Godess that was bought down to the world by Kazuma. She is a very funny character and always seems to get into the worst situations despite being arguably the most capable person in the group being a god and all. Darkness is a masochistic crusader who can't hit a thing with her sword but loves to take the hit for her companions in battle. She always seems to get excited in the wrong moments which is what makes her so great. Megumin (best girl) is an over powered wizard who can only use one spell that completely uses all her energy for that day, a bit of a glass cannon.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very fitting and the animation is pretty good, especially the explosions. I didn't really notice the sound much but for me that's a good thing because it means I didn't get bored of it which I have done with other series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still reading this then thank you for taking the time. This was my first review and I'm not that good at writing and tend to write all my thought onto the page so if you have any pointer that you would care to share then drop me a message!",

            "content": "It's kinda weird to see a second season of a show with such a drastically higher rating than its previous season while most of the top reviews are negative. So who's right? The people writing detailed reviews, or the people just throwing out high ratings? \r\nWell, they both are.\r\nI think the issue is that the reviewers' criticisms aren't incorrect (the art and animation have gotten worse, the stakes haven't really been raised, etc.), they miss the point. KonoSuba is a comedy, and simply enough, KonoSuba has gotten funnier.\r\nSeason 1 was good, no doubt, but in the first season it needed time to establish characters, runningjokes, it was a lot of establishing. This season, we're settled in and the comedy is flourishing. You can complain about how bad the art and animation look, but do you really think it's not intentional in this case? For what this show is, it's an IMPROVEMENT. Some of the biggest laughs I've had from the show as a whole were just when Kazutrash or Aqua flips out, starts hyperventilating, and devolves into an off-model, under-detailed mess of panic and fear. The show's \"shitty\" look gives it character that it was kinda missing last season when it was only kinda shitty.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the show's setting and humor has also made a very slight (but welcome) shift from a clever, but pretty simple parody to It's Always Sunny in Slayersville. The characters have been given the platform to show off just how pathetic, useless, and depraved they are and they've run with it. The \"fight\" between Kazutrash and Darkness in episode 4 is the hardest I've laughed at anything this season easily and it perfectly exemplifies how great the character dynamic is now.\\n\\n\r\nWhile their hasn't been a drastic rise in \"stakes\", the plot IS moving forward, and two more characters will soon become more important (Wiz and Eris). But to those who complain that the plot isn't advancing fast enough, I'd ask if you get what this show is even trying to say? The characters are lazy, idiotic miscreants. Why would they aggressively pursue greater dangers? One of the bigger jokes is that whenever they get a hold of some money, Kazutrash says \"Fuck finding the Devil King, I'm rich, I can eat good and stay inside all day\". The plot usually hunts THEM down, which is exactly how it should be given our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a plot driven show. The author intentionally set up the path to the end being so vague so that he can end it at any point, or never end it. It's a vehicle for comedy, just as One Piece is a vehicle for action and adventure. This isn't a show you watch for eye candy. Its visual based tactics aren't there to impress, they're there to evoke laughter, much like GTO's own terrible art. It achieves its goal in spades, moreso than season 1, and that's really all that matters.",

            "content": "Konosuba Season 2 is good. Very good. For sure I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. But reading the novel made me realize the problem I had with both, this and the previous season, and hadn't noticed until now.\r\nKonosuba tries a lot making you laught. It really tries very hard to be funny. And it delivers, heck, it was a long time since I laughted out loud watching anime. The problem is that it tries so hard that only makes the more serious, quasi-epic-ish moments feel slighly awkward, someway out of place. I find the anime funnier, but overall I think the novelis better just because of this. After this little apart, which I will recall at the end of the review, let's go with the review.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing I want to say is, KONOSUBA ANIMATION IS NOT BAD (I never thought I would ever defend Deen's animation, jeez...). For sure the style changed to one more carefree than before (I think quite obviously for extoling its comical side), but that has more to do with what I said at the beginning of the review than with it being poorly animated. They put work on lots of the scenes, but that doesn't matter when you can't take a photogram out of context and start a rant on the internet, right? Even though, the CGI they used is quite improvable.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about one of my biggest complains with this series, the characters. (calm down, it is the biggest to me but nothing to make a fuss about). They are very enjoyable, yes, but they can be summed up in one phrase, two at most. Anyway, I never thought developing complex characters was the focus of the show, so nothing really important. In contrast, the chemistry between the characters was better than ever, developing even more their weird relation of \"we can't live either with or without the others\". Also I loved how the characters started taking advantage the little strengths they have despite all the flaws they carry and how other characters had their moment to shine.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the music, it was pretty solid. Can't remember any specific song but the opening and the ending (they are amazing BTW), but I can say the anime sounded pretty good in general.\\n\r\nVoice acting was amazing. Specially Kazuma and Aqua.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to conclude, I would like to make a final thought and a recommendation. Yes, this season is miles away from being the perfect adaptation, but it is definitely worth watching. It is very, VERY enterteining, and I'm sure it will make you smile at least once.\\n\r\nOn a side note, the possibility of Konosuba not getting a 3rd season is there, so if you enjoyed both seasons, consider reading the original novels. As I said at the beginning, I consider them better that the anime. If you don't believe me, you can just try them and figure it out on your own :D",

So, I'll make you a question, do you want to watch something special, or something that is predictable/clich\u00e9? If you want the first option, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufu wo! isn't for you, but if you are the second type, this show is for you.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nThere's a poor story line in the anime, which is: defeat the demon king, but all you will have is fan service mixed with some (bad) jokes. You will not find a good story in Konosuba,but I can confirm that you will laugh sometimes, and that's a good point. Since the show doesn't have a big and good story, I give it a 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked konosuba's art, all the emotions and faces it haves are beautiful, the expression of Kazuma trying to be gentle is amazing, I laugh a lot with that. The world seems alive, the colors are touching and the scenery is detailed. Since the art is pretty good, I give it a 8. Why not a 10? I felt the details sometime had dropped in quality, so a 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing to say about, it wasn't so good, but wasn't so bad, I decided to give a it 7. It was above average, but wasn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThey are generic comedy characters. There's almost nothing of development in konosuba, but the characters seems alive, their expressions, how I've already said, are beautiful. Their personalities are controversal, but that's normal since the anime is a comedy, I think the first season was better in this point, there was more development. Since the characters are nice, but not perfect, I give it a 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI laughed, I felt good while watching, that's important, so I'll give it a 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's fair to watch, but I don't recommend if you don't like clich\u00e9 or animes with no development.\\n\\n\r\n(It's my first review, please don't kill me, if you want to make a point, be gentle)",

The first is that this show is the absolute Pinnacle of comedy on anime, the comedy is so well written that it fits perfectly into the story itself. The second is romance, romance is not really there but just as a possibility like in TMNT or Teen Titans. The third is ART I say this art is a 8/10 because it looks nice and smooth but its not9 or 10 because it can be better but the art it has is certainly Fitting. The fourth is Overall story, This show doesn't have a large story but more of a long one. it takes time to go through the story but yet again it doesn't progress as fast as you would think. Lastly is the fact that just finding out a new episode is coming out makes you smirk from the enjoyment that you know you will get from watching another Side Hurting and breathing trouble episode. I just say that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME FOR ENJOYMENT AND FUN JUST MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE FIRST SEASON FIRST.",

I write this under assumption that I'm just an ordinary anime-lover, without any knowledge about the art and quality of the production studio.\r\nThis time I'll start with the animation. Just like the first season, the animation is quite satisfying. I usually didn't judge the visuals, it's like I'm really biased toward story line more than how it looks. But yes, good animation makes way to level-up the anime.\r\nSoundtrack itself wasn't bad, I like the opening (Tomorrow by Machico), up-beat   cheerful song. Opposite, the ending sounds little bit ordinary for me. Instead it was pretty calming.\r\nHere what I like themost about konosuba... The characters are really funny and filled in their own respective roles. Most of them are pretty naive, has strong desire on something that probably absurd. First time I saw those characters I thought it'll be some harem anime. But Kazuma didn't really have time to make it his own harem. In fact, he is unlucky in a cute way. Aqua, Megumin and Darkness make a great combinations on finishing quests actually but always... of course giving troubles afterwards to the point they loss all the fortunes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusions, I really enjoy the comedy content, the cuteness and how every character almost make me forget that the story line itself was just about helping the adventurer defeats villains in fantasy world.

            "content": "It has been a long, long year since we saw the last of Kazuma, Aqua and co. But the days of crying into your sheets are over, it\u2019s time for KonoSuba 2: Resurrection!\r\nStory:\r\nWe start where we left of. After saving the town, the four adventurers are celebrated...until Sena appears and charges Kazuma with cooperating with one of the Devil King\u2019s henchmen (which he totally did). So, unlike in season one, this time we have the story part at the beginning and the episodic adventures later. Only that they are not all that episodic. In fact, we now have real \u201carcs\u201d (if you can count themthis, provided KonoSuba 2 is only 10 episodes long...again!) that span multiple episodes. The whole thing is still full of slapstick and the characters\u2019 self-deprecation, mean jokes and heroic failures, so if you enjoyed the first season for all these reasons (why else?), you will have just as much fun again.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let\u2019s get this straight. It\u2019s one thing to say that KonoSuba looks like shit in general (and I was somewhat critical of the art of season one myself), but if you actually believe, like for real, that season 2 looks horrible compared to season one, you do not understand animation. You see, I\u2019m by no means an expert on this, but even I can clearly see that this time, they were going for a whole different appeal. Season one had meh character design, probably because of a small budget. Season two has understood that this worked in favor of the show and ran with it. KonoSuba 2 is partially a cartoon at this point. There\u2019s this one scene people like to point out, where Aqua throws a tantrum as if she was a Looney Tunes character, that is supposedly badly animated. But it\u2019s not. This is cartoonish exaggeration to underline the comedy. If you don\u2019t like that, that\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t be stupid and say it\u2019s badly animated. I personally think they went the right way (especially the faces are real killers) and it makes the anime work so much better. They still up the ante for the finale though, which is just as fine with me.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNot much has changed here. The new opening is quite catchy, even though the old one grew on me in nostalgia of watching the show, so that\u2019s a job well done. The ending theme is almost identical to the first one, a relaxing piece sung by the leading ladies. Speaking of which, all three of them do a great job once again. Sora Amamiya is just a joy to listen to as she\u2019s crying and yelling, Rie Takahashi is just as good as ever and Ai Kayano gets more to work with this time, also doing a good job. Same goes for Jun Fukushima as Kazuma. The side characters are all solid in performance again, though I was a little surprised at Wiz suddenly changing to a no bullshit voice in episode 10, that was pretty cool. On the other hand, I should have expected Yui Horie to be able to do this much. BGM and sound effects were temperate and non-distracting, as they were before.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere shouldn\u2019t be much left for me to say about the characters, but I shall write a little anyway to fill up space and make me look like I have a validated opinion. The breakout character of season one was definitely Megumin, while Darkness got the short end of the stick. This time they switch roles, with Lalatina (pffft) getting her own storyline and Megumin not doing much. All we knew about her up to now was that she was an extreme masochist and apparently from a noble family. This time we get to see just how far that masochism goes and we also get to see her father. Oddly enough, when given the chance, Darkness is just as much of a prick as the rest of the group, which was pretty funny to me. We also had a new general of the Devil King\u2019s army, who was a weirdo, but kinda entertaining (I still like the dullahan guy better).\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWe only got 10 episodes once again, which leaves me begging for more. On the other hand, it\u2019s probably for the better, because every comedy dies eventually, some just do a lot later than others. Short seasons mean less exposure of weaknesses and less getting old. I already experienced a lesser hype for new episodes than I did last year, most likely because the novelty was gone by now. That doesn\u2019t mean I liked it less than season one though. KonoSuba 1 was probably the funniest anime I\u2019ve ever seen and KonoSuba 2 is not far behind. If you enjoyed season one, I don\u2019t need to tell you to check this one out. If you thought it was merely okay, I\u2019d still say give it a chance. If anything, it has more consistent storytelling. If you hated the artwork and cartoonyness, you will loath season two for being the same but more. It hurts me to do so, but as I think that the first season is superior, I\u2019ll have to refrain from giving KonoSuba 2 the whole 10 points.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.4/10",

            "content": "The adventuring foursome of misfit adventurers returns in the ever-exciting season two of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! With new adventures to be had and an overall shift in focus, does the second edition prove a fitting continuation? I would say yes, though it's not without its problems, all discussed in the following text.\r\nAs a disclaimer, this is mostly a comparative review, therefore much of this review relies on comparisons to the quality, experience, and enjoyment of the first season. No major spoilers are unveiled for either season, but a proper understanding and foundation of the initial series (or light novel) is recommended.\r\nHow dothe seasons compare?\\n\\n\r\nWhat's changed for the better?\\n\r\n-- additional character development for characters left lacking previously\\n\r\n-- supporting characters are given more screen time\\n\r\n-- more personalized dialogue, where inter-character relationship sees a boost\\n\\n\r\nWhat's changed for the worse?\\n\r\n-- moderately reduced animation quality, moreso inconsistent than anything\\n\r\n-- a deviation from the first season's identity as a RPG-style world\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba 2 picks up from where the first season left off, as Kazuma Satou, notorious NEET and main character, is under trial for causing the destruction of a noble's mansion. He nearly faces execution until Darkness invokes her authority as a noblewoman and manages to get him a reprieve, though he must still pay back the debts. Prosectur Sena, meanwhile, follows him and the crew around in order to see whether or not he works for the Devil King's army. The series continues following the party around as they seek new ways to generate income in order to pay off their debts, continuing on further kill quests and even involving a dungeon mission. When a great wealth inevitably befalls Kazuma, does this spell fortune for the young man's otherwise misfortune stay in this wonderful world?\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the plot of the second season is enjoyable, with progression being dominated by mini-arcs. There are two episodes where a specific dungeon is visited and revisited, an area that truly had some great dialogue and fun new characters. That zone, particularly, really seemed to get the spirit of the series, and it's there that the second season shines. Later on, a tourist city complete with its own hot springs and fervent cultists becomes another source of great moments. In regards to the ending, the crew was faced with an \"emergency quest\", as in another boss, and everyone got their own time to shine in the final battle, much to my appreciation. Each individual mini-arc had something unique to itself that let it shine as a part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, however, the season was relegated to a stunted length of ten episodes. As much as I complain about this low a count, it would be okay if the series progressed as a ten episode series should. With the first season feeling like it ended prematurely and without much conclusion, so too did the second. I can see this becoming a dangerous, even harmful trend for the series if a third season arrives and concludes with the same pattern.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the popularity of the series, I can't imagine that we wont be getting a third season, but personally I'm more inclined to combine everything into a standard 12- or 24-episode package and develop additional seasons from there. While the light novel / manga itself may be structured as a long-lasting epic, anime series constrained to ten episodes a season do not have that luxury (unless you're One Piece), and the creators may find themselves losing their audience if stability is not achieved.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, stylistically, KonoSuba 2 continues in its predecessor's footsteps. I do feel like the series undergoes a heavier \"adventure\" focus, with the group actually travelling around rather than just using the town as a questing hub. As for the other elements of the fantasy lore and lewdness, they remain strong, integral parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, much of the \"gaming\" and \"progression\" appeal as previously shown in the first season was largely absent by comparison for this one, only showing any major relevance in the dungeon scenarios. While there are heavy moments of combat and even gear acquisitions, action slows to all but a halt in the latter half of the season, causing the series to develop more as a fantasy comedy rather than an action/adventure anime. Don't get me wrong, I actually think this season was far more humorous than the previous, but seeing a deviation from what I thought was one of the series' strongest and most unique elements in its RPG-style progression proves a detriment in my opinion. The biggest issue of the story for me involves the lack of direction or focus, and now I'm starting to see that indecisiveness bleed out into the overall foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nMost unfortunately, the biggest detriment to KonoSuba's second season is the distinct drop in animation quality. While I found myself a fan of the first series' visuals, the style of KonoSuba 2 often seems to skate the realm of laziness. Characters are much less fluid and even odd looking at times, quite a difference compared to what was experienced before. Whether it be an issue of budgeting or change in staff, my enjoyment was noticeably affected as a result. With this in mind, the reduced quality applies mainly to character animation, as the various backdrops and visual effects of combat aesthetically pleasing and even outstanding as before.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the soundtrack retained much of the coziness you'd find in the previous season, and the setting is represented well this way. Both the opening and ending were great, particularly the latter as its voiced by the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu, both returning and new, also performed their roles spectacularly. One of the strongest suits of KonoSuba, both new and old, has been that the characters feel exciting and live. Voices often have a serious impact on how accurately a personality is emphasized, from Aqua's high-pitched, pompous tone to Yunyun's shaky but confident spirit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nFurther to the credit of the season, each of the main characters are as entertaining as always, and some of them received the development that was seemingly absent from before, notably Darkness through her mini-arc. The character cast remains largely the same, though we do have the introduction of new characters Yunyun, crimson demon and self-proclaimed rival of Megumin, Vanir, maniacal entrepreneur and Devil King general, and Chomusuke, Megumin's adorable black cat. Others, such as Wiz and Eris, receive a great deal more screen time, with the former potentially become a member of the party herself!\\n\\n\r\nThere's an abundance of fun scenes between the characters, greatly highlighting the new direction of the series. The spirit of discovery and togetherness is really highlighted in this season as we see the party members further bonding together, though not without their previous incompatibilities. Personally, I really enjoyed the various \"rival\" matches between Megumin and Yunyun, as the latter tries her damnedest to match up with Megumin yet to no available.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, again, Megumin is still best girl. This will still be true in season three.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to boil down KonoSuba 2 is that substantially it has improved, though aesthetically it has suffered, with an exception to the former regarding the ambiguous direction the series is heading. How good the second season is will largely differ person-to-person, and I've noticed it's certainly been a polarizing release. I personally found it more enjoyable thanks to the heavier character focus and improved adventures, though others may find themselves too distracted by the lack of focus or inconsistent visuals. At it's core, KonoSuba 2 remains a fun series, and regardless of whether you like it more than the first season or not, you'll enjoy it just for being KonoSuba. \\n\\n\r\n\"Damnit, what the hell is with this world's game balance??\" - Kazuma Satou",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE 1ST SEASON, PLEASE DO WATCH KONOSUBA'S 1ST SEASON BEFORE READING THIS, UNLESS YOU WANNA GET HEAVY SPOILERS!\r\nWell, Konosuba, the 2nd, did a lot of things right in terms of many things:\r\nWhile this definitely isn't one of the more serious shows out there, it never failed to entertain me... because of the great comedic value of this stuff! Although the circumstances of this anime might have been somewhat weird and improbable, this anime has nevertheless turned out to be very original and really powerful in handling certain topics which one wouldn't expect to see in this kind of anime...\r\n[SPOILERS BELOW]\r\nTothink how it started: The \"shut-in NEET\" Kazuma leaves the house for once to purchase a new game which got released that day... dies after trying to save a girl from a tractor... from a shock, and suffers from the pain of being humiliated... seeing scenes of being laughed at even by his family! \\n\r\nA great deal of funny adventures with him, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness ensues... and it ends right there where this party saves their town from being destroyed by a giant enemy... yet things turn out to get uncomfortable...\\n\r\nAnd this would be where the 2nd season carries on pretty much exactly...\\n\\n\r\nActually, this (re)entry seemed to be a bit abrupt, as there were actually about 9 months between the end of the 1st season and the continuation thereof. But after a while, the anime really gets you back into that ... ahem ... adventure mode again, while toying around with the characters' personality a bit.\\n\r\nWhile the art style of this anime seems to have changed quite a lot (and it changed to a simpler style in some way), this kind of style happens to fit the comedic nature of this anime really well! There are even scenes which have the potential to become memes 'cause they are so reminiscent of those.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nEven the characters themselves have the potential to be specific examples of the \"trait\" they represent:\\n\r\n-Satou Kazuma, the guy who just wants to have an enjoyable life\\n\r\n-Aqua, who wants to be acknowledged for being a goddess\\n\r\n-Megumin, who seeks for adventures while contributing her part of explosion magic\\n\r\n-Darkness, the young lady who often shows her masochist nature\\n\\n\r\nHow astoundingly well this plays out can be observed in Season 1. But what surprises even more is that this does also apply to the 2nd Season, even though one might fear that the story gets too repetitious. \\n\r\nAlso, there's even a lot of progress within the characters, despite the rather unusual composition of this group:\\n\r\nWhile circumstances change, different and unseen sides seem to unfold themselves, and we will also learn a bit of the adventurers' backgrounds! \\n\r\nWhat seems to be a bit over-the-top in some settings could also be considered a hyperbole, although that covers up the real meaning of those scenes... \\n\\n\r\nWait, might that already be the real deal? Who knows...\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the characters are definitely faithful to their characteristic traits, even though circumstances change... but whether that is truly them would be a question which the viewers should ask to themselves.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhat's also a bit questionable is to what extent the main objective of this story plays a role in this anime... Yeah, the quest to defeat the Demon King... was it?\\n\r\nAnyway, the saying which would apply perfectly to this anime would be:\\n\r\n\"It's not the goal that matters, but the path one goes through in order to achieve that goal.\"\\n\\n\r\nClearly, one wouldn't always think of the main objective of an adventure all the time, but this KonoSuba just puts it to a whole new level:\\n\r\n\"Do we want to reach our goal, or just idle around?\"\\n\r\nIndeed, it seems that the characters would be idling around at many times, which is meant as deviating from their main goal... Normally, that could be referred to as a filler, but whether those fillers are what characterize this anime could be a question very well worth asking.\\n\r\nAnd then there are those \"accidents\" which always tend to be so ridiculous and random at times that it suggests that they weren't just accidents at all?\\n\r\nSimply put, a main story is clearly evident, but the conceptual nature of this anime just creates the feeling that one would only go in circles... but there might actually be a lot of progress in the story, too!\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8.75/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow let's really get to the main point that this anime excels at: Entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the 1st installment of this anime already crushed the hope of seeing a usual \"NEET\" finding his way in a normal world. But the way the creators of this anime put this irony afterwards was just splendid: \\n\r\nInstead of mourning over his death, Kazuma's family just makes fun of how he died... and such teasers have always supplemented the anime.\\n\r\nAnd this is definitely true for the 2nd Season, too!\\n\\n\r\nThen there are those scenes where pretty much everyone, or even everything, plays some kind of pranks on one another, and pokes fun at their victim...\\n\r\nThe ones that cringe are the audience, after all!\\n\\n\r\nI mean, seeing someone cry is one thing, but the way KonoSuba's putting that is another... Then there are the scenes where certain people try to be useful... but their personalities/circumstances prevent them from succeeding:\\n\r\n-Just imagine a person trying to be helpful, but then falling for the temptation of being humiliated.\\n\r\n-The other person being seemingly helpful, until you realize: nah!\\n\r\n-Another person being really helpful, but only if she IS actually helpful (no need to know what I'm talking about, you'll see)\\n\r\n-Then there's Kazuma, who happens to show very \"different\" sides of him (whether this is meant literally is subject to personal interpretation)\\n\\n\r\nCombining all this, we'll get great scenes with awesome entertainment factor. And it's so logical in its own logic that one can really get the feel of KonoSuba's anime logic:\\n\r\nYou're watching a scene, relieved that something seems to work out the way you expect it to, or rather, hope for it to... but then, KonoSuba strikes again and crushes all of your previous expectations and redirects the whole progression of this anime into a whole new direction.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even more astonishing is that one might get the feeling that one has finally understood \"this wonderful world\" by the name of Konosuba, until one realizes... well, no.\\n\r\nThis anime never fails to entertain in terms of cringe, unexpected twists and turns, and the ubiquitous irony that lurks behind every corner and only waits for an apt moment to strike!\\n\\n\r\n[Entertainment: 13/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhat might not be as evident as the entertainment, but also contributes a lot to this anime is the music:\\n\r\nKonoSuba wouldn't be as noticeably funny without the music, as the music really supports the scenes in creating the mood:\\n\r\nBe it the dramatic scenes which would immediately lose their tension as soon as a key event takes place, while simultaneously, the music changes, or just a soundtrack which reflects the current mood of the character...\\n\\n\r\nThe music hasn't changed really much during the 2nd Season of this anime (the main theme is just the same), and even the openings and endings seem to be very similar to their counterparts... but they remain as fitting to the game-ish nature of this anime as before...\\n\\n\r\n[Music: 8.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is rather not that noticeable in the whole context, but also plays a big role, is the voice acting:\\n\r\nIt's only with the great exaggeration of the voice actors (VAs) and the great passion that the VAs put into their roles that this anime is so comical:\\n\r\nWhat would the anime be like if Kazuma wouldn't freak out, what if Aqua didn't cry, what if Megumin wouldn't rant her signature lines, what if Darkness didn't moan for more humiliation?\\n\\n\r\n[Voice Acting: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nWell, all the points being said, this anime really has an outstandingly entertaining value which captivates with its naked irony and teasingly cringey nature!\\n\\n\r\nI'd highly recommend to watch this anime if you have already watched KonoSuba's 1st season, as this is definitely not getting less entertaining and funny! It's a great diversion from daily life, as this anime really gets your full attention for being just... so ... Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the 1st Season yet, and have somehow read this review nonetheless, then I'd still recommend watching Konosuba, even though there were spoilers in this review. The 1st Season is still great, and the 2nd Season also!\\n\\n\r\nOnly if you are a kind of person who likes more serious stuff, or doesn't like the ironic, teasing kind of anime, then this anime would probably not be your cup of tea! But why not give it a try anyway? ;)\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 9.6/10]\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I guess that's it for this anime review. Please keep in mind that this review merely reflects my opinion on this anime; if you disagree with me, then that could be attributed to the many factors that play a role in forming an opinion! \\n\r\nThanks for reading :)\\n",

            "content": "KonoSuba is back stronger than ever.\r\nWell, not so much.\r\nTo some extent, this review can be considered for both seasons in general \u00bfwhy? Because from my perspective both seasons are absolutely the same, the serie didn't innovate in anything, but neither have any downfall except for the animation sometimes. It's exactly the same.\r\nThe story follows where it remained the first season, with Kazuma being arrested for an alleged act of terrorism. Up to this point it isn't necessary to speak much more of the story, after all, it's about mini arcs with stories in the purest style of RPG games and \"isekai\" animes, plus we allknow that is not the central axis or the main thing that makes KonoSuba so attractive. The story itself is not what matters, but how it influences the main topic: the comedy that goes around the picturesque characters, with some satire to the clich\u00e9s of RPG, although falling into them on several occasions.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfWhat do I mean by this? KonoSuba does the same thing as several comedy series like Nichibros, One Punch Man or Seitokai Yakuindomo: repeating a single joke, but in different ways depending on the context in which they are. In the case of KonoSuba, this context is the story, the joke is the characters: Kazuma tsukkomi (although it is usually the most unpredictable character and with some more variety to his jokes), Aqua useless, Megumin chuuni and Darkness masochistic, the serie focuses on their characteristics to make the jokes, \u00bfthen what makes it so funny even though it sometimes falls into the repetitive? That such jokes vary according to the context, as the story progresses and different situations in each arc are presented, the characters develop in them, which makes it appear that the joke is renewed and makes him retain his grace. So, although it doesn't seem so, the history is important in KonoSuba; if there is no progress, the comedy serie would remain very stagnant. Now, isn't as if this is the formula of success, it doesn't always work and in more than one occasion it feels forced or simply boring, but in this also favors the small number of chapters: it's not the same to see the same joke in 10 Chapters in one year to see it in 24, so there is no \"saturation\", and the serie feels \"light\", to call it somehow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main focus of the comedy in this anime are its characters who, although they may seem rather flat and simple, have enough charisma to lift the serie by themselves:\\n\\n\r\n-Kazuma can be described as the typical otaku hikikomori, and in fact he is, relying on their cliches, as his perverted fantasies and the constant allusion to his virginity, but also stands out for not being the typical loser dense protagonist. Among the main characters he seems to be the only sane and with feet on the ground, which doesn't prevent him from time to time make decisions or act in an unreasonable way, this coupled with the fact that he's usually the tsukkomi make him an unpredictable character at the time of being funny, so it has more \"variety\".\\n\\n\r\n-Aqua is a goddess who welcomes the deceased to give them a better life after death. She should be a loving and kind girl, is not she?... No, Aqua is just the opposite: narcissistic, haughty, manipulative and immature. By chance chance (the unpredictability of Kazuma) ends up in the fantasy world where she reveals her main feature and the main source of her jokes: she is a complete useless, something that the serie does not bother to hide from the beginning. Many of the problems that face the group protagonist are the result of her actions, directly or indirectly, is here where the context favors Aqua's uselessness: you know that sooner or later she will ruin it, but of all the possibilities you don't know how, and even if you know, the situation could take an unexpected turn, as in the last arc where her own followers accuse her of being a false prophet \u00a1and even want to burn her as a witch! I don't know about you, but while it was an expected outcome, the development of it was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\n-Megumin (her only name is a recurring joke) belongs to a tribe of wizards with chuuni characteristics, and she is not the exception: she is an obsessive of explosive magic, which leaves her completely immobile after using it. In itself it's a very simple joke and not very easy to exploit, but outside these characteristics Megumin is perhaps the most \"normal\" character after Kazuma, and like him, she's usually unpredictable and contribute to the comedy scenes in various ways.\\n\\n\r\n-Darkness (whose real name is Lalatina, which I personally like more) is a paladin willing to receive damage to protect her companions, but all because in reality she is a complete masochist, with only the idea of facing something dangerous excites her. The jokes around her are usually the most varied, due to the many forms of masochism that she herself thinks, however, it's the joke that loses grace more easily. What makes the character pleasing is her reactions, and curiously enough, she is usually amashed at several other situations instead of getting excited.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters who also contribute their grain of sand, but I will not go too long talking about them. The interaction of the protagonists between themselves and with the characters usually give more variation to the jokes. A clear example is the scene where Vanir takes over the Darkness body, one of the most fun of the serie in general, due to the charisma of Vanir and the way in which Darkness made him exasperate with his perversions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for audiovisual quality, I don't see reason to give it many turns. The sound is acceptable, it attaches well to the series and the moment situation. The animation has always been the subject of controversy: the series in general presents a fairly average animation (although it highlights in some specific moments), but it's not the type of serie that needs an ufotable animation to achieve its purpose. Sometimes it was a little awkward to see, of course, but it was more favorable than what it affected, after all the exaggerated reactions of the characters emphasized ridiculous comedy (in a good way), whether on purpose or not.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba is a serie that has elements that by themselves are not the big thing, but together they create a favorable result and a great synergy. It could be summarized as \"simple comedy\" or \"situational comedy\". Finally, I think that is not enough to clarify it: This is a comedy with some parody, doesn't seek to be anything serious, neither pretend to show deep characters or a development of them, and despite having satirize to the fantasy worlds, also counts as one of these, so, if you like these genres, there is no lose with watch this serie. It's not a serie for everyone, not everyone likes these comedies, but if you like them, you'll feel pretty satisfied with the result.",

There are basically two major differences. the character designs and animations have changed quite a lot which many say is a negative. this is not the case. the designs are improvements that give more fluidity and life to the characters(watch the canipa effect's Breaking Down Konosuba's Incredible Animation | Animator Spotlight on youtube to see why) the final episode proves this with it's great animation. i also have to give credit to the final episode for having a battle better than a lot of action anime. in short if youlike the first season and can actually appreciate the great animation and character designs instead of being a pretentious douchebag you will truly enjoy season 2 as well.",

            "content": "Welp. Another fantastic run of Konosuba. This follows up from the first season, so make sure to watch that first before watching this. It still has the beauty of the first show.\r\nThe story is pretty much the same from the first season, except they managed to progress in this season a bit more. If memory doesn't fail me (been following it after it aired) they've quite done a dent in the King Devil's Army.\r\nArt is beautiful. Comfortable, pretty, funny and sometimes sexy. Nothing much to say here, as the show looks really good.\r\nSound and Soundtrack are simply fantastic, following up two new OP/ED songs thatI just can't stop listening to, they feel oddly comfortable when you hear them. And I usually skip over EDs but Konosuba feels so homely that you can't stop listening to it.(Also Machico is a great singer.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, I'd say it doesn't have the greatest character development, but each character still feels the same from the first season, which means that they still feel different in their way of life but still magnetize as friends. Although I'd say that they don't progress much given the nature of Konosuba itself (if you've watched the first season you'll know this) so don't expect too much character development, but they do still pace their own emotions/feelings and ways of thought. In short, you just know how the characters are and sometimes you can even predict their behavior (I don't mean this a bad thing, it just adds to the comedic affect of the show).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I really enjoyed this show. It's a fantastic little world that feels homely everywhere you look. From the beautiful art to the enchanting OST, it hasn't changed from the first season and gave me laughs as the episodes went on. It just finished airing as of this writing, so all we can expect is #KonoSuba2018.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a great continuation. A worthy sequel and just more of the good stuff.",

            "content": "Before I start, I don't want you to look at my score and think that I'm that dude that gives shit ratings to all the popular shows just to feel special. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. The comedy was excellent, and I can't give it enough praise. While the second chapter for these four idiots mirrored the first, it was missing some things that should have been in the original. There was so much missing that I believe is needed in a good sequel. I really want to say \"screw it\" and give this show a 10/10, but I don't think that would be fairto the show's faults, or to the other shows that I have reviewed. I'm Zepphire, and this is Konosuba 2.\\n\\n\r\n(I rate anime a little differently, and am currently working on a explanation on my page. In short, I consider Plot and Story to be separate entities, and include the op/ed in the rating.)\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED: 7/10\\n\r\nWhat I liked about the OP was that it told a small story while telling the audience exactly what this show is about. While I have to give it credit for that, the story got repetitive quite quickly, the music also wasn't as good as I was expecting. As for the ED, it was very hard to top the original's ED, which was absolute perfection. It's calming tone was quite similar, but not as good. It is still excellent, showing off the wonderful art style.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 4/10\\n\r\nThe music (apart from the op/ed) wasn't that good, and quite average at best. A good example of this was whenever Aqua cried, it played the same track over and over again. While I thought that track was good, it just played it so many times that it lost it's magic. And it's like that for the rest of the show, as if the producers did not create enough tracks for the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nImma get straight to it, I don't really understand why they decided to act like this was in some sort of game. Was it a poke at SAO? Either way, the \"Kill Quest\" pop up was neither funny nor interesting. It's out of place. Konosuba also had a general lack of setting, and this \"inside a game\" thing was probably used to cover that up. We have absolutely no idea where our band of idiots is, are there any bigger towns than the ones we have seen, or how many races there are (they mentioned elves out of nowhere in one of the episodes). The only redeeming thing is the unique situations that the characters go through, which show how much thought was put into these scenarios. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 2/10\\n\r\nThis \"inside a game\" story thing had a very small effect on the plot, which leads me to believe that it was shoved in at the end. I understand that it gives reason for the existence of skills and whatnot, but it brings up more questions than it answers. The problem with Konosuba's plot was, well... there wasn't really one. Apart from some minimal episode to episode plot, there wasn't really anything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nWho can forget about our band of four idiots. I don't really have much to say here, but I could praise them forever. The only issue I see is a lack of dynamics in them, none of them really changing that much from the beginning of the show. I guess Kazuma changed a little since entering the world, but nothing too big. I understand that this is a comedy, and 10 episodes isn't much for a good character arc, let alone 4 of them.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics (VA+Art): 9/10\\n\r\nBoth the voice acting and art were top tier quality. The art style for the show is really well done, mostly because of two main reasons. First, the art style for the characters themselves, which I believe very accurately portrays their emotions, and fits the tone of the show. It's hard to explain, but it never gets old. Second, the effects. Whenever Megumin or Aqua cast some sort of magic, the effects look incredibly detailed, with vibrant colors that look absolutely beautiful. The art may not be Kimi no Na wa level, but it's pretty damn good. The voice actors were so well chosen, and really matched the tone of the comedy. If my aesthetics score was voice acting alone, it would've been an easy 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Personal Opinion: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's kinda obvious that I enjoyed this show. I even had to limit myself to one episode per day to savor it. I cannot give the show enough praise for it's comedy and the hilariously unique situations that it puts our four idiots through.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nWell, there's my review. Konosuba is a prime example of a show that does one thing so exceptionally well, it's able to have just that one thing, and still be an acceptable and popular show. The series has a very very high re-watch value, and I'll be sure to watch it again and again, hoping for a third season.",

            "content": "Ok ok ok ok ok, this is getting a bit tiring.\r\nLet's not waste a second on KonoSuba 2 and get to the real review. Because I've watched 5 episodes and holy hell am I thinking the EXACT SAME THOUGHTS every episode since the first episode of season 1.\r\nKonoSuba 2 is funny. There, the end, arrivederci, bye, thanks for coming.\r\nIt's funny and that's it. It's really funny, I laugh at a ton of parts, it's extreme in its humour and I love it for it. The girls are also cute or really hot and there is a LOT of fun ideas and great little parodies andturning MMORPG ideas on their heads and making them spin.\\n\\n\r\nAND\\n\\n\r\nTHAT'S\\n\\n\r\nIT.\\n\\n\r\nAND IT BOTHERS THE HELL OUT OF ME.\\n\\n\r\nYou see between the complete bitch of a goddess, the explosion nerd intelligent teenage girl, and the utter and complete masochist pervert who goes beyond the beyond even for anime standards, and Kazuma at the center of that being the local Kyon, the guy who keeps his head cool and isn't insane, you have A LOT, and I mean A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of material and potential to go to insane lengths and make a blast out of your characters, your story, and be funny at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nKONOSUBA CAN'T DO IT. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm capslocking because it really really gets grating over time.\\n\\n\r\nBack when I reviewed season 1, I thought that the biggest issue was that Konosuba was a one-string anime that only knew how to play the humour song. It had more plot than season 2 and it thus I glossed over it, and complained mainly about the characters being extremely underdevelopped and generally being walking masses of untapped potential. Developping their backstories and personalities beyond the trope of I'm a huge bitch/I'm a super-destructive girl in a child's body/I'm as hot and filthy rich as I am a masochist freak was a NECESSITY and the doorstep for Konosuba to go from \"fahnay animay\" to genuinely really, really, REALLY good. The potential was huge and I only begged for season 2 to realise it and take that step forward, give its girls more than just a one-note personality, make them more human and less trope-only.\\n\\n\r\nAnd guess what they didn't and now I'm really annoyed, because I really, really like Konosuba a ton.\\n\\n\r\nIt's everything a comedy anime should be.\\n\\n\r\nOne, its tropes are turned around their heads in several ways. Second, its world is both realistic and fantastic without one harming the other. Humans act human and all the superhuman/abnormal humans all act very strange(or rather I should say, are tropey). Three, there is an established storyline that's just waiting to be tapped in and of course never is.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take the example of the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the episode where Lalatina/Darkness has to be \"saved\" from marriage with a decent, kind and gentle nobleman, you get to meet her father, her household, her growth environment. Then the episode spends its entirety in trying very hard to make Darkness into even more of a pervert. It succeeds. It's funny and goes beyond crazy especially when she describes her ideal man. It's genuinely enjoyable and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, everything else is sacrificed on the altar of worsening the trope of Darkness = Pervert. We are in her home, where she grew up, with everything she grew up with being there to talk about her.\\n\\n\r\nSo I ask the questions I've been wondering about since season 1 episode 2 where we meet Darkness: why and how did she become such a massive, superhuman pervert? Did she get her first sexual experience at age 8 and wanted to try it again ever since, thinking about it every day? Was there something or someone that made her like that? Is her father like that too/was her mother like that? Can I please get something that justifies the trope?\\n\r\nOr better yet, can we just walk away from the trope for just one full minute and talk about how she likes flowers or cats and how she's not just a walking talking boobing trope?\\n\r\nNo, no they can't. Even if we talk about something else than BDSM and humiliation for Darkness, being a bitch or dumb as heck with money for Aqua, or explosions and loli talents for Megumin, it doesn't last more than roughly 20 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nAt the risk of doing humour 101 in a review, what makes things funny is that we get something serious and make it laughable, or take something laughable and take it very seriously, like making a Clown Ninja who kills people stealthily while he juggles 8 balls and plays the trumpet in front of everyone while yelling \"I'M A CLOWN NINJA, WATCH ME KILL THAT GUY!\".\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba has the principle down, it knows that making a realistic world with realistic characters is what's necessary, and past the main crew and Wiz and all of the Demon King's captains, everyone is fairly good and normal. They have the world right, so why can't they realise that having walking tropes isn't the way to go? If you want tropes that's great, but for the love of god put them on full characters, don't build tropes with tits.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to have taken care of the Darkness' household episode, I would've spent 3 mins introducing the main plot, getting to know Darkness' point of view on the marriage, and then spent a good 12-15 minutes both doing what Kazuma tries to do, and meanwhile talking to the father and EVERYONE in the mansion to get to learn about her. So many maids and the dad to tell us about her backstory in the finest details! And at the end of the whole episode I'd have had pretty much the exact same ending(although to be fair, the Konosuba guys are waaaay funnier than me and I wouldn't have even thought of that). But I'd have spent about 10 minutes, 12 tops, on Darkness' tropes and reason to reject the marriage. The entirety of the rest would've been on the backstory. Showing the serious, and then ridiculing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in the other episode, a dungeon has to be destroyed. And it's the other problem of Konosuba 2 here. It's funny again as usual and although characters aren't deepened, this kind of episode could've been more about developping the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\n(minor spoilers)\\n\r\nEssentially they meet a Demon King's captain in there and a fight ensues. He's perverse and wierd and only slightly more threatening than Verdia.\\n\\n\r\nThe dungeon is cleared and all goes well. But that means that what could have been/should be a clear growth into knowing and fighting the Demon King is just not there. You fight the guy and laugh and then poof, fight over. Nothing gained. No more is known of the world, of the status of the Demon King's army, nothing is built on this. You get a fight, you laugh during the fight, you win the fight, gone.\\n\\n\r\nIn season 1 I was more tolerant of the whole anime being nothing but characters and getting to random MMO world places like the \"mystic lake\" or \"the snowlands\" or whatever because it was season 1. Characters are what matters most along with basic world building at the start. Getting to do the real thing, advancing the plot and facing harder and harder foes, all of this can wait a bit.\\n\r\nWe're at season 2, the wait should be over since long now. I felt like Shinsekai Yori started slow, or that the 3 filler episodes before the main plot at every GitS season was kinda bad, but this is a whole other level. We are simply not advancing at all, and it seems to me that just like for the tropes with the characters, the makers of Konosuba aren't interested in building a real story even though they have the world for it, the characters are there, everything's just waiting to be started.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was in charge of that episode, I would've simply let them fail. Either Darkness would've stayed in that state for x amount of episodes(2 or 3), either they would have failed and needed to come back for a new fight, thus giving us stakes, an arc, a storyline, and making it more about serious fighting that could be satirized just as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever been a shit teenager who watched shit Shounens like Naruto(I've been one), do you remember the moment where Naruto wins a fight by farting in his opponent's face after the guy's been presented as really freaking strong? That's good satire. Build a thing then ruin it. Not with farts jesus, Konosuba's humour is thank god much more adult, but the principle is there. Have Darkness get waaaay too into her new situation, or have everyone seriously question how to get the guy dead. Move along the story by raising the stakes, meeting a stronger opponent than the ones before, or changing the situation and making the characters grow or change from it. A real storyline, in short.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is all I can say, this is where my frustration comes from: wasted potential. Konosuba is funny, well-built, has a cute world, cute and hot girls, it's pretty frank in its shamelessness both in humour, personalities and sexuality, everyone's kind of a pervert, an idiot, or an asshole, or all three, and I love it this way. It feels so much more real when the people are people and not absurdly typed, when you don't have the tsundere and the cute one and the this and the that.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba has real characters that feel real.\\n\r\nIt has a fantasy world that feels logical.\\n\r\nIt has an entire storyline whose bounds have been laid out and is just waiting to be walked on like a ripe fruit waiting to be picked.\\n\\n\r\nIT HAS IT ALL.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it does none. Nothing. I'm extremely frustrated at this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not giving me what I want, I feel teased all the time but never satisfied. I wanna know what's going on with Darkness or Aqua, and get to know the world. I want more scenes like the end of episode 2 where we see Megumin and Yunyun's backstories. I want to see a completely built storyline and a hyped fight with a big villain that gets utterly destroyed with laughs when the crew fights it. I want to have a long-winded, long-running development of all the characters, main or not, or move to a new town and know new people, or just go somewhere, do something else than wallow in tropes eternally.\\n\\n\r\nHow can I not say how annoyed I am when I know I'm looking at a solid 9 or perhaps even 10 as comedy shows go, one of the funniest things I've ever seen, a genuinely well-constructed world, show and cast, and it just will not go above 7 because it constantly holds its head down in the murk of TROPES LOL TROPES LOL TROPES LOL?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 : The episodes have fun ideas and storylines every time, they just never go anywhere, like a 4-page comic manga, when they have so much potential.\\n\r\nArt: 6: The art started bad in episode 1 and the opening is kinda poorly drawn, which I'm guessing is a technical choice, because the rest seems to look just as good as season 1, which looked quite nice to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8: I like the opening, I like the ending, I like all the sound and the VAs are just having soooooo much fun with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7: Tropey as they are, the characters are still a ton of fun and do represent a sort of hilariously broken MMO world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9: And yes, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed a ton of it and it's a 9 I'm not taking down, but I just hate how I want to make the enjoyment a 10 but can't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave 7 to season 1 and feel like the same applies here. Konosuba is just too funny, too good, too enjoyable, but the smell of potential being left to rot is just unnerving by this point. I highly doubt it will change by season's end, but if it does, I will amend this.",

Pretty much the same crew is back to produce the second season of KonoSuba. As a result, it picks up right where you'd expect, and feels virtually the same as the first season.\r\nThe only real downside is the lack of any substantial character development. everyone has their shtick or quirk that offers comedic value, and they don't really change because of it. If you wanted to think about it way too hard, you couldtry to defend it as a statement on how little people tend to actually change over time. That really isn\u2019t the case here, though, and this is fantasy; I\u2019d rather see some actual character development than face the crushing reality of human nature.",

I guess you could argue it's more about the journey but really the show starts becoming a reality of it;s own parody if that makes sense.\r\nArt -  The art waspretty solid through out, it didn't really improve too much but didn't get worse in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The OST and voice acting is a big part of what makes this entertaining to watch, the subtleties of the way certain lines are delivered are a big part of the comedic aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This another part of the show that kind of dips in quality.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nDuring a sequel trip to Disney, my family and I visited Disney Springs (which will forever be Downtown Disney to me). In my teal polo, white hat, and matching white shorts, I looked, dare I say, dashing.\r\nI wasn\u2019t there to strut my stuff, though. Instead, we sat down and dug into some delectable Ghirardelli sweets, making excuses about ignoring our calorie count. When the last morsel of mint-chocolate-chip ice cream settled in my belly, we began walking back to the bus station. It didn\u2019t take long, however, for a drunk man somewhere in the crowdof people to holler out in a North-American-Southern accent.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHa! You dun crapped your pants!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPeople started to stare, and a little girl pointed \u2013 everything directed at me. I had no idea what was going on until my younger brother chimed in. Apparently, the spot on the bricked enclosure where I sat to eat my ice cream also had a small chocolate surprise of its own to share.\\n\\n\r\nThe brown leftovers smeared onto my white shorts, giving the drunkard and the onlookers a mishap to behold. When we finally understood what all the hubbub was about, we all started laughing. My family huddled around me like a football formation to protect my backside from any more interested eyes, and no shortage of bathroom humor left our mouths that night.\\n\\n\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 (or KonoSuba Season 2 for short) prompted me to share a Disney-related anecdote since the first season made me do the same. Thankfully, it also brought along more of its comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 is the sequel to the first season of the massively popular KonoSuba series. (The number two in the title over there should make this statement obvious enough.) Such sequels often have a very tough job: balancing the old and the new.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike sequels to dramas that have the luxury of \u201crefreshing\u201d themselves (assuming the previous installment concluded its plot succinctly), comedy sequels, more often than not, have no such luxury. They risk falling into the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d trap since the characters\u2019 personalities and the premise at large not only do not change but also have \u201calready happened\u201d last time.\\n\\n\r\nBut a sequel also cannot just forget about its origins. Those same qualities are what defined the series to begin with, so to ignore its past would only serve to make the audience question its future. Thus, as a comedy sequel moves forward, it must venture out into new territory while still remembering how it got to where it is today.\\n\\n\r\nDid KonoSuba Season 2 balance the old and the new? The answer is \u201cmore yes than no.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMuch of what made the first season so fun was how the show shaped much of its content as a parody of the fantasy genre. True to form, KonoSuba Season 2 continues this approach well enough. Episode three features an \u201cevil\u201d arch wizard who only wishes to be purified. In episode four, the knight Darkness is forced to marry is a complete gentleman and the nicest guy imaginable as opposed to the sleaze ball she desires. The adventurers and fans of the group in episode eight attempt to give them money and praise, but Kazuma cannot possibly accept any of it since they caused all the troubles anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWith parody as a big chunk of the foundation once again, the anime also reintroduces other elements that keep the comedy going. For instance, it will make callbacks to previous episodes. At the end of episode five, Kazuma lets everyone know Darkness\u2019s true name (Lalatina) as a follow-through on the \u201ccrazy punishment\u201d promised to her at the end of episode four. Meta jokes find a home here as well. In episode one, Darkness\u2019s usual pleasured reaction to Sena (the prosecutor lady) calling her a \u201cmeatshield\u201d causes Kazuma to remark that he hasn\u2019t \u201cseen that in a while\u201d given the year between this season and the last.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, the anime strikes at that balance between old and new. On the old side, Kazuma\u2019s trial in the first episode brings back characters and events from the first season to paint him as a lecherous, guilty man. Or how, in episode nine, Wiz sees Verdia the now-deceased dullahan in her dreams whenever she gets precariously close to death herself. On the new side, scenes like Kazuma buying a set of unusable armor and a too-long katana or the visit to Arcanretia with its radical proselytizers give the anime fresh chances at comedy stardom.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime sometimes reuses older content without tweaking it enough. Those giant frogs return to eat the crew. Kazuma repeats his lewd hand gesture and steals Chris\u2019s panties once again. Kazuma and Megumin\u2019s cut-off-the-word-\u201cexplosion\u201d practice gets played out once more. As they deal with the Lizard Runners in episode six, Aqua bursts into a tantrum that leads to the show \u201cpausing\u201d the screen, a replicated action from Aqua\u2019s initial tantrum in the first season\u2019s first episode. Indeed, this same season-two episode also revisits Kazuma dying to a \u201chead-related injury.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe reuse of these different jokes does not make-or-break the anime by any means, but, with only ten episodes to work with for the second time in a row, it seems like a waste to include the same ones again. Plus, they impart an imbalance in that vital old-versus-new idea within this sequel.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime ends, it comes off as perhaps a tiny bit cruel that Aqua\u2019s efforts still go down the tubes after saving the whole city. It\u2019s all in good comedic and parody fun, but it seems like now would have been the perfect chance to finally allow some sincere gratitude thrown her way. And, unlike the first season that concluded right as the next conflict began, this season finishes in a spot that seems unsure of where it can go. It had the money deal struck between Kazuma and Vanir before their trip, but the anime forgot about this plot point upon their return.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the show keeps the comedy flowing throughout the whole season, remaining at least within a favorable state.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel, KonoSuba Season 2 does not deviate much from its previous artistic outing, a sentiment applied across the board. Quaint shots of the city return. The characters\u2019 color-centric designs still catch the audience\u2019s eye (with Darkness\u2019s new designs and outfits being particularly attractive). Breasts do not stop jiggling. Megumin\u2019s \u201cExplosion!\u201d scenes remain a spectacle each and every time she summons forth her immeasurable power.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major change in the anime\u2019s artistry is one that goes in a direction that the audience may not have anticipated: the roughness of it all. Coincidentally, this change, similar to the sequel nature of this project, brings up a small talking point.\\n\\n\r\nMost would agree that the first season of KonoSuba sometimes presents its characters\u2019 in a rather rough manner. E.g., weird mouth placements, strange proportions. Such roughness, however, doesn\u2019t take anything away from the anime but rather adds to its charm and comedic flavor.\\n\\n\r\nFor this season, the show decides to ramp up this roughness quite a bit. In essence, the anime occasionally takes it to an extreme, exaggerating the exaggerations to an almost obscene degree. As a result, the art possibly becomes not so much deliberately rough as it looks mistakenly unpolished. One needs to go no further than the opening track\u2019s visuals. The gang\u2019s rounder appearance during their loose, goofy dance and the at-times janky faces warn of the rougher art ahead.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, this looseness helps in the other direction, too. It has always been funny to see Darkness blush hard or Megumin lash out, but, with this looser approach to the art therein, the nose flares, the crazy eyes, and the huge mouths not only invite more diversity to their facial expressions but also up their expressiveness that much more.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, this small sacrifice on a cleaner presentation does not compromise on its command of the various animated segments found all throughout the season. Examples include the triple perspective of Kazuma shooting the queen of the Lizard Runners and Aqua\u2019s God Blow followed up directly with her God Requiem. Indeed, the higher level of roughness can also translate into extra personality behind the very movements they make. Aqua\u2019s reused tantrum joke in the middle of episode six stands as a nice candidate for this line of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nTo KonoSuba Season 2\u2019s credit, it can also be quite nuanced when it so chooses. For instance, in episode nine, the suspicious yet eye-catching woman at the bath, who Kazuma stares at (\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201d) and who speaks with Hans, gets up to walk away. With her back to the audience, they believe a bootyful treat awaits them \u2013 except a sneaky water droplet from the accumulated steam on the camera streaks past to censor any would-be perversion.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, the ending track\u2019s visuals once again involve that much-needed balance in the old-and-new content for the season. New shots of the girls in different parts of town or admiring the scenery exist, but the familiar claymation-esque sequences, the kids watching Aqua\u2019s tricks, and that old fisherman sharing a headshake with Kazuma remind the audience of the season that once was. The best part, though, is the end of the ED. It calls back to the first one but in opposite fashion. Kazuma greets Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness back home instead of the other way around \u2013 all while sharing a firm thumbs-up.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 enlists the same troupe of \u201cadventurers\u201d that the audience grew to love in the first season but also invites never-before-seen guests to liven up the place. That is, much like the story, the anime must balance the old versus the new. Save for one key factor, it does just that.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the old, Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness initially burst onto the anime scene with derisive words, cries for help, weird names, and unfettered masochism (respectively). Thankfully, they do not falter. No longer needing to focus on introducing the main cast or establishing the premise, the anime delivers their raucous personalities and actions with ever stronger comedic punches, crafting scenes that bring out the very best in its characters.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma \u201cconfesses\u201d his sins to a distraught Aqua. Aqua purifies ghouls and ghosts in rapid succession. Megumin doesn\u2019t back down from a bathing challenge. Darkness \u201csuccumbs\u201d to Drain Touch in orgasmic fashion. No matter the scene, the anime makes sure to have its cast deliver as many funnies as possible.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike last season, though, the series explores the characters somewhat beyond their base personalities. Darkness\u2019s family, her home, and her faith take up more importance than usual, and Aqua\u2019s returned devotion to her many followers showcases a sincerer side that the audience doesn\u2019t always get to see from the goddess.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, too. He still has a tendency of following up his appreciation of life with lamenting his situation, but he has his moments. He looks out for Aqua. He relates on some level with Megumin. He worries about Darkness. He learns new skills in archery and blacksmithing. He possibly falls in love with Eris (a figurative and literal godsend when compared to the other girls). Kazuma may be a pervert, he may hurl insults at everyone (both out loud and in his head), and he may yearn for \u201ctrue gender equality.\u201d But seeing him be even more of a nice dude this season gives him an edge that he hasn\u2019t always had.\\n\\n\r\nNew characters also take to the stage. Yunyun, Megumin\u2019s childhood friend, describes herself as the soon-to-be leader of the Crimson Demons. She also must duel Megumin whenever the chance arises, and she \u201cjust-so-happens\u201d to be in the same area as her fateful rival on more than one occasion. As the magical device in Wiz\u2019s shop reveals, however, she leads such a pitiable life that even the flowers near her would rather uproot and walk away.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Wiz, she helps the gang out in defeating one of the anime\u2019s first pure villains, the soap-hating blob monster named Hans. Vanir, the mask-wearing, death-wish-having commander in the Devil King\u2019s army, also forms a fun duo with Darkness during his introduction in episode five and later (similar to Wiz) becomes a semi-friend to the group. And while Sena isn\u2019t around past that same episode, she prosecutes, summons, and bends with ease, fitting right alongside the comedy around her.\\n\\n\r\nUp to now, and in similar vein to the anime, a distinct and important character has been (purposefully) left without much attention: Megumin.\\n\\n\r\nBased on polls and various words in the community, many people would argue that Megumin stands as the favorite character of the series. At the minimum, she\u2019s a staple part of it. Not only because she is literally one of the four major protagonists but also her one-and-done powers are an iconic element of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it comes as quite a shock when KonoSuba Season 2 gives Megumin the short end of the magic stick this go around. Episodes three, four, and five leave her outside of the dungeon or on the outskirts of town, and episodes seven, eight, nine, and ten keep Megumin from participating in the more hectic events encountered.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the story, this lack of Megumin represents an imbalance on the show\u2019s part. Granted, episode one has a few explosions, but they are not the focal point. Likewise, episode six has her drawing on Kazuma, but the outcome, not the action she took herself, earns the laughs instead. Furthermore, it is nice to see Darkness and Aqua receive a bit more background and angles to round out their characters. But, with the tradeoff being close to a disregard for one of the anime\u2019s vital cast members, it ultimately may not be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nEven the episode that could be classified as Megumin\u2019s for this season reserves half that time for Yunyun and her (official if counting the between-seasons OVA) introduction into the series. Chomusuke the kitty cat becomes her pet in this episode as well, but her inclusion doesn\u2019t lead to anything worthwhile besides the occasional scream and background boob fondling.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin\u2019s lacking presence aside, the anime still forms a better balance between the old and the new here with its cast when compared to its story elements, elevating the show\u2019s overall execution that much more.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the highlight of the entire anime is the voice-acting performances from everyone who takes part in the project. Hearing Jun Fukushima, Sora Amamiya, Rie Takahashi, and Ai Kayano again in their respective roles reaffirms how perfect the four are for the job. Kazuma\u2019s responses to his name as they talk. Aqua\u2019s crying and range of squeals. Megumin\u2019s chuunibyou chants. Darkness\u2019s moaning. From the in-between transitions to the layering of their sighs, breaths, and growls, they elevate this anime several times higher than where it would be at without their presence and skill.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the glorious VA performances, one finds an ending track that hearkens back to the first ED in its countryside, lackadaisical progression. It\u2019s not as smooth or as catchy when compared to the drawl and the instrumentation of the original, but that\u2019s not saying a whole lot when the first ED remains one of the best listens in the medium. Indeed, KonoSuba Season 2\u2019s ED picks up the pace and finishes once again on a higher vocal note, finding that sweet balance between old and new in this song as well.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the ED, the opening track surpasses the first season\u2019s OP. Groovy bass, tremolo picking, the fun little tune that cuts into the song a couple of times, the cut in sound that leads into the rousing finish, faint bells and chimes in the background, the \u201cSubarashii!\u201d lyric. It all comes together as downright fun piece that captures the silliness of the series itself without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd continuing the audio trend, KonoSuba Season 2 finds extra strength in the rest of its original soundtrack. It doesn\u2019t change up the songs or the effects to any noticeable degree, going with an \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d approach that works here if only because of the inherent supportive nature of OSTs. In particular, the rap-like, ukulele piece makes a welcome comeback, as do the individualized tracks for Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound design in general, the gushing, sloppy noises of frog slime as the characters move around and Megumin\u2019s ear-deafening explosions let the audience know that the anime has the audio portion of this adventure down pat.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nFor a second season straight, I found myself laughing way too loud during every episode. Kazuma\u2019s gratefulness to Aqua for turning the other way when he \u201crustled\u201d at night when they used to stay in the stables. Aqua\u2019s mega, stifled cry (that I cannot replicate even after trying a couple times) after she loses hardcore at rock-paper-scissors. Megumin\u2019s food escapades before befriending the others. Darkness\u2019s \u201csacrifice\u201d and \u201cprotection\u201d of everyone from the Running Hawk Kites.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what they said or did, their shenanigans once again had me entertained the whole way through. Not to mention how all the other little moments still add up. Those crazy Axis Cult members spit not once but twice at the mention of the rival-goddess Eris. And Dust, the one side adventurer who cannot seem to contain his hormones, attempts to use \u201cSteal\u201d on the bar maidens at the inn.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, shoutouts to Sena, the new prosecutor woman. She didn\u2019t so much make me laugh as she caught my eye. Long, dark hair. Attractive figure. Blue, professional work outfit. Glasses. She wasn\u2019t around for half the season, and, even when she was, she didn\u2019t have much more of a role besides spurring the characters onwards to a new conflict. But she had my attention nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, on this Thanksgiving Day, I am thankful to the author of the source, the creators behind this project, and the anime sphere as a whole for providing yet another hilarious installment in this wonderful series. Hopefully I will not have to wait long to see an announcement about the next season, for Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness most certainly deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Season 2 may be a very small step down from its predecessor thanks to small imbalances in the content and the cast therein. However, this imbalance does not dethrone the anime from its spot as one of the premiere comedy outings in this medium. Parody, diverse reactions, quirkiness, wonderful voice acting, a never-ending streak of funnies. Simply put, no crap in sight.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, the popular fantasy-parody tale returns, delivering content that occasionally leans a bit too much towards the old side of the all-important old-and-new balance\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, the color-centric designs and the normal backgrounds return, a looser approach to the artistry adds hilarious exaggeration, movement remains more than solid throughout, and nuance finds its place when it can\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Kazuma, Aqua, and Darkness earn more to their persons while maintaining what made them so fun to begin with, the new characters continue the comedic trend, but Megumin finds herself oddly sidelined for an inordinate amount of time\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, the once more superb VA performances, a reminiscent ED, a fun-filled OP, nice tracks off the OST, and numerous audio design decisions make everything simply a treat to hear\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, yet another hilarious experience in the series\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

And it succeeded at doing just that.\r\nHere we go again, Kazuma is back with the misfortunes of hanging out with his weird party of girls. For the most parts, the plot structure is similar with the first season. You won't get that much major worldbuilding. Instead, it's just some short bursts of comedic adventure through quests, leading up to funny interactions between the lovable characters.The story was aiming to make you laugh though the running gags can get quite repetitive at times. Even with that, thankfully, there were enough new creative comedies to keep the giggle train running on its track. All of the humors connected back to Kazuma's struggle of staying sane in the fantasy world, which is really just a hilarious montage of him dealing with the quirky girls as best as he could against all odds. He really does deserve a break from all that wasted energy.  Towards the end, a particular side character was revealed more, slowly opening up the diverse range of personalities and abilities. And even with what must be a mess, the party's abilities to actually function as one despite their dysfunctional circumstances shows that their bonds have actually improved even though it doesn't seem like it. As for the enemies, let's say that they were the laughable types both in terms of personality and sense of threat, which matched the friendly tone of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe wonderful world tainted by the stupidity of characters here and there was highlighted using vibrant colors. With comedy at its side, the colors brightened up the smiles, making a pleasant entertainment. Some may find the details in the art to decline in comparison to the previous season, however, I see it in a different way. It complemented the non-linear, quite unpredictable nature of the characters' dynamic. The way they do things with an over-the-top attitude, an organized looking visual is not needed and that's why it looked fitting in my eyes. Ridiculously amusing expressions in the character's faces also helped in getting reactions out of me that placed a toll on my lungs. Anyhow, the animation was still stellar, especially in the last couple of episodes. Action scenes were sprayed with sparkles of magical powers, turning the battlefield into a brilliant field of energy. These scenes was the peak of what KonoSuba's art and animation can portray. Regarding soundtracks, they're still the same fun and joyful kinds, fitting the lightheartedness of the atmosphere. As usual, the voice actors have a great sense of humor in saying, or more accurately shouting, the hilarious dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 was briefly said, another enjoyable source of laughter. With the entertaining cast of dumb characters and all the crazy conditions they got themselves into, it's really a wonder that their fantasy world is still intact to this day. Who knows, maybe the world is indeed being blessed by a god.",

I think that the fan-service is \"well made\". Moreover, I liked the fact that Konosuba is one these anime who can be serious, and just after, become crazy (more crazy than serious ha ha).\r\nPersonally, I had a good time watching Konosuba, even if I'm a little bit disappointed about the story, but finally, thatwas not an useless season : it was maybe a sort of transition between season 1 and 3 (pls Jesus, we (yes we) want a season 3).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are basically the same (besides 2 or 3 new), but more joyous you know x).\\n\\n\r\nSo here, we have an anime to watch if we do not want to reflect : nice humour, crazy characters, a few fights, a lot of references to RPGs games, a simple story... what else ? Why look complicated ?\\n\\n\r\nHowerver, In my opinion, the few defects that can be there are :\\n\r\n- Only 10 eps, like in S1. too bad...\\n\r\n- this season contain more humour than story, and the main mission : defeat the Demon King, progress fairly slowly...\\n\r\n- fan-service can anyway be annoying in the long run if you really hate fan-service...\\n\r\n-They did not really innovate much during this season...\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's all, I don't want to spoil anything, so I stop here. My English skills are limited too, so i think that the massacre can stop here.\\n\\n\r\nIn brief, this season aims to make you laugh, with pleasant characters and a relaxed atmosphere, despite a few defaults unfortunately.\\n\r\nThis anime is not perfect, but you will have a good time if you do not try to ponder !\\n\\n\r\nThat was not a very thorough analysis, but never mind, that was not the goal of the anime anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWell, see ya folks !\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The great animation is wasted by the trash art! (OK, that is a bit exaggerated, but really, I hope they did better. The animation on the other hand, is pretty good)\r\nConclusion: If you are very picky about art, reading the novel will be a better alternative. But in other perspectives the anime itself is still decent and has some great animations.\r\n* Thanks to people's reply I see the show with a new light and have adjusted my review accordingly (This is an updated review after finished watching the show) (Overall: 5->7)\r\nKonosuba is a pretty good show, but it was more due to the story andvoice actors distracting from actually looking deep into the art of the show. The art does good better as the show progressed and eventually reach fair quality near the end. It also help that there are great animators adding wonderful effects to the presentation of the show (all the magic effects are quite beautiful). \\n\\n\r\nBut to be fair, here are the Cons:\\n\\n\r\n1. The art is HORRIBLE at a few of the early episodes, the characters have colors that are so poorly put on it felt like it was animated years back with 16 colors available.\\n\\n\r\n2. The characters are also extremely different than how the Light Novel portrays, in terms of art, the color are different, characteristics barely drawn, and focuses on wrong aspect of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n3. It is a fun comedic story, but have been ruined by the animation company. In multiple events it gave me the feeling that the company had no intention of making this a success (though it did convince me to go read the novel). It felt really inconsistent between the great animation and the poor art (though it did get better in the later half), why would anyone waste the efforts of the animators with such low quality art.\\n\\n\r\nOthers: After watching the video posted by another user (this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC2HqRS1qjo) I have changed my opinion quite a bit. Agreeing with the video I do think Konosuba did well in animating the motions and effects, but I still hoped they did better with still scenes and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading",

There are some rare examples of this not happening at all (Fawlty Towers and Father Ted both end exactly as they began).\r\nHow I wish Konosuba could be one of the latter. I know it will have to evolve plot-wise, as the the story moves along in this season. \r\nEverything else is as it was in season 1. Our main cast are still blundering along, but there are worrying signs of actual skill growth. Of course, Aqua is still a useless Goddess who'll never stop crying, Darkness still can't hit anything with hersword, Megumin hasn't managed to control her magic and Kazuma is still...Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said previously, I enjoy Konosuba immensely but the problem is, I actually don't want it to end or at the very least, I want it to have an open ending. Of all the TV shows, films, books and video games I have come across, I have never felt the same about any of them. But then again, they aren't Konosuba.",

            "content": "Spoilers from the first season, none about the second. Pls send feedback if you have any.\r\nAfter the hilarious Season 1, many have had high hopes for this one. The return to our favourite four adventurers, KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2 delivers and it delivers hard.\r\nWe arrive right after where Season 1 left off, Kazuma Satou is accused of the crime of blowing up a former Nobel Aldarp Alex Barnes' mansion after saving Axel from the Mobile Fortress Destroyer. After that problem is hilariously dealt with, we return to our usual shenanigans with the Perverted NEET Adventurer, the Idiotic Pantyless Goddess Aqua, theMasochistic Noble Crusader Lalatina \"Darkness\" Dustiness Ford, and the Chuunibyou Loli Arch-Wizard Megumin.\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably know from watching Season 1, (at least, I assume you've watched it) KonoSuba is an episodic anime. There is not much plot progression except for a few arcs scattered around. So does that mean we won't ever see the Devil King? Not exactly. We can all tell that he will be the final boss, and Konosuba is nowhere close to ending, but we can still see mentions of him through his Demon Generals. Every so often one pops up for them to either defeat or befriend. But enough about the story, it's not the most important factor of this anime. Let's talk about what really makes this show amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of Konosuba is what drives the series. I have to warn you, this anime's main focus is its ability to make viewers laugh, so it can either be a hit or miss for most people. It revolves around Kazuma and his party, using their flaws and mistakes to bring out a chuckle. The formula is simple. The gang receive a goal, stumble around and manage to achieve it, but usually not without consequences. It's pretty easy to understand, but the way it executes it is where it shines. What could have become tired and repetitive, Konosuba hits us again and again with fresh outrageous situations that bring out the best and the worst (usually the worst) out of our lovable screw-ups.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make this anime shine. Extremely flawed as they might be, you can't help but fall in love with every single part of the gang. (except for Aqua, you can't help but hate her just a little bit) Every interaction between each party member is hilarious and oddly realistic, like a group of friends happily messing around with each other. Even the background characters feel like they have a genuine personality. Everyone in Konosuba may be the butt of one joke, (Kazuma being called scum, Chris getting her panties stolen) but the execution of all of them provides a fun roster of characters that never cease to make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the animation is where a lot of people get turned off. The background and the action are amazing, I think most can agree with that. Where Konosuba gets controversial is the character animation. It may seem lazy at first, but a lot of the characters are animated in a way to make the show funnier than it would be without it. The use of stretch and squash techniques to make the show more visually comedic allow jokes to translate better and give it a better chance of getting us to laugh. But that doesn't make it perfect. Corners are cut, and if you know where to pause, you can see frames that are just not up to standard. Is that a bad thing? I guess, but in my opinion, it's a flaw that can be easily looked over and seen as minuscule.\\n\\n\r\nThe second Season of KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! is a tremendous sequel that must be watched by anyone that enjoyed the first Season. As long as you don't mind the animation flaws, this is quite the enjoyable experiences for fans of the \"Transported to Another World\" anime trope.\\n\\n\r\nP.S Darkness best girl Megumin is second place",

But the story are real crap and losing its way... Maybe bcs of how popular the s1 they make this anime more focused on comedy,more harem,ecchi(i dont like haremor ecchi but the comedy are funny) and thus the story from s1 arent really continued... This season feels like some ova episodes with great comedy to enjoy with just little bit story development... So im still recommend to watch it...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10:\\n\r\nI cant describe it well but in short The characters around the main character are lacking of identity.... but if you just focused on comedy this wouldnt be a problem...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBELOW IS SPOILER SECTION WHY I RATE THE STORY 3/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending are really disappointing... The ppl in this anime world always feared the great,powerful,unbeatedable devil king and his servants even for the high ranked adeventurer,noble clan fear them too.. But from what we see in this second season the ppl,adventurer in that anime world are all happy and almost lived with no fear of devil king... And is this devil king is really \"powerful,unbeateble,ruthless,evil\"? Well i think they should change his title to not so great devil king or maybe the retired devil king...\\n\\n\r\n I know that this is a comedy anime but wiz getting angry and help those guys fighting her former comrades are just too weird... The devil king and his servants in this anime are like a total joke,weak and useless... Even if wiz turn to be a good ppl but she's still one of former devil king servant and she make an neutral agreement that only valid if they(devil king side) didnt kill anybody... Lol so wiz are so strong that she can make an agreement like that to the devil king sides? And now one of the servant that they defeat joins wiz and helping that boy get rich? So this devil king is actually weak and treated like a joke? That their servants that easily quit and change sides even make an agreement and help the opposite sides with no fear? I know that this is a comedy anime but at least dont just throw away the story that built up in s1 just bcs the anime got popular and ppls gonna like this as long there's some ecchi,harem and comedy... first season was an awesome,funny anime with great story with not too much ecchi and the second one just telling about a daily life of an neet adventurer surrounded with pretty girls living his everyday life that full of jokes and some ecchi scenes but with no real stories...",

            "content": "Ah, Konosuba, the show that turns everything you expect from an Isekai anime on its head. The show that has a main character with actual common sense. The show that makes you laugh every episode with its over the top absurdity. I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at that.\r\nContinuing from where season 1 ended, Konosuba 2 deliveres more of what made season 1 good. From Kazuma being the loveable douchebag we know him for, to Darkness being a true masochist to the heart. Add a little bit of Megumin's EXPLOOOOSION, and Aqua's not-so goddess-like personality and appearance, and you've got someof the most ridiculous cast of characters I have seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Konosuba 2 has its share of good moments, it's not devoid of flaws. The biggest flaw I can see is that there's not really an overarching plot, or rather, the plot that is there isn't brought to an end. The task of defeating the demon king is still unfinished, and looking at the progress Kazuma and his group have done so far, there's a long way to go.\\n\\n\r\n-Pros-\\n\\n\r\n- Hilarious cast of characters\\n\r\n- Good overall animation and art\\n\r\n- Jokes are mostly executed at the right time\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack\\n\\n\r\n-Cons-\\n\\n\r\n- No real plot\\n\r\n- Being a comedy anime, some people may not find it funny\\n\\n\r\nOverall, is Konosuba 2 worth the watch? In my opinion, yes, because it takes your typical Isekai anime and makes fun of it. The jokes may get a bit repetitive at times, but they're still funny most of the time. Also, if you haven't seen season 1 already, go do so first, since you get introduced to the characters and setting.",

Here is three times worse! During the first temp. of the anime we find that the demon king has judges (if I am not mistaken are called judges of hell) and to defeat him first is necessary to defeat first his judges. By the time they have defeated 3 judgesand form they find the judges of the demon king are always the same: by chance while he did something random. Was it hard to try to do something more elaborate here? What is more bone is that they NEVER show interest in going after the demon king (even this being one of Megumin's greatest desires and the only way for Aqua to return to his Goddess position.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the season they finely leave the initial city and go to another city and by coincidence is the city of worshipers of the Aqua Goddess. The anime explains that the power of a Goddess is linked to the faithful. Aqua has few faithful but they have a great faith and this leaves them strong. In that city they find another judge randomly fight with him and defeat him (Aqua actually). When you get to that part of the anime you'll probably think: NOW GOING. But soon after everything they return to the initial city and once again the anime walked, walked, walked, walked a little bit ... but ended up going back to the beginning (literally). If it had not been for the well-made comedy and the retarded, the more captivating characters this season would be completely forgettable. I hope that in Season 3 the anime takes another turn ...",

            "content": "I came into the second season of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo thinking that it would pick up from the first season in its story development and possibly an encounter with the devil king would happen, or even just a reveal of who this devil king is. To my disappointment, none of the above occurred. \r\nSTORY: 3/10\r\nThe story continued to be pointless, more pointless than the first season as we already have been introduced to the main characters. What began to bother me in the end was how much of a constant pain the complaining of Aqua began to become, resulting in the animebeing a serious displeasure to watch. This could have been avoided if the story line actually progressed, but the only thing that progressed was the debt that the main characters were in. The constant completion of meaningless challenges only to be able to repay the debt, which would then become greater because of Aquas stupidity quickly became a boring and incredibly repetitive story line. this ultimately led to my disliking of the anime in general. the story is basically a budget version of sword art online but they never get to the boss.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime was average with not an immense amount of detail used, which is expected. however there were no times when the style changed for dramatic effects like what happens to Saitama's face in one punch man (definitely a must watch). occasional changes in lighting and the simplicity of the artwork led to chibi like designs that had a moderately comical effect. Overall the artwork in this anime was fairly well created, no fancy designs for anything, everything was fairly simple.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime were average, I personally didn't focus on the sounds too much, but they were reasonable and fitting for the events that occurred throughout the anime. appropriate music was played during certain scenes, but it didn't add another level to the anime in any way, it just set the scene better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were highly underdeveloped, and could most definitely been expanded on. What disappointed me was the irritability of Aqua, which mostly contributed to my disappointment in the anime. All Aqua did was just complain about everything, sabotaged the ideas that Kazuma came up with whenever they were in a pinch, and would come through at the last minute with a power move that would solve the dilemma, leading to her demanding Kazuma to worship her. This was repeated almost every episode, and quickly irritated the actual crap out of me. The other characters were okay, but they all were too underdeveloped and made the anime not as engrossing as it could have been. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoying the anime quickly became a difficult task as there was nothing that resonated within me as the viewer. Nothing made me sit on the edge of my seat wanting more. The continually whinging and whining of Aqua was so incredibly irritating I began to intensely detest her presence in any scene, especially the hot spring city. overall the lack of development and Aqua made this anime quite hard to enjoy\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10  \\n\r\nThis anime could have been very promising. However, after watching both Sword art online, and No game No life, this anime was very underdeveloped and resulted in no measurable progression towards defeating the Devil King, which was the whole point of the anime. A fatal flaw in the anime was the incredibly irritating nature of Aqua who NEVER shut up EVER, FUCK. if she was replaced with another character that was more reasonable, I probably would've rated the anime a 7 or 8, but she was pure cancer, and that I cannot forgive. Overall, if you are really bored, you can watch this anime, but it is seriously not worth it, so don't watch it",

This tends to be something I can't agree with. Yeah, the animation gets a little weird at times but it honestly more of a stylistic choice to highlight the more comedic moments and sell the joke more. I liked a lot of the voice work thatwas done in the first season and somehow they were able to elevate that even higher in this season making the comedy even more sublime.

The comedy and lovableness of all its characters that I have developed from the first season are still there along with the kick ass humor that I know and and always laugh at. The story is still humorous and unique, and the ending music time around was definitely a good choice. Some people may complain about the change in art, but I for one absolutelylove it. The funny comic like reactions from the characters are amazing, and being a person who actually read the light novel, it's nice to see the people you read about finally being animated into a show.

Everything about it makes fun of typical anime tropesin the best way. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis\\n\r\nKazuma dies (hilariously) and is sent to a world where he is given the task of slaying the demon king and bringing peace to the world, and the goddess who sends him there is sent there with him (because karma is a B****). However when he gets there Kazuma basically says \u201cyea screw that I like living, and desides to do his own thing and try to make the most of this new life he\u2019s been given, which inevitably keeps dragging him and his motley crew of a party closer towards reaching that goal anyways. They get caught up in many unfortunate situations and, honestly? Fail more than they succeed. Which is also refreshing, because humor can often be found in failure. And boy is it in this gem.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe key to what I think makes this show so great, is the characters and how they interact with each other and everyone else in this world around them.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, the shut in NEET Who doesn\u2019t want to have to work hard to do anything, and is absolutely willing to cheat or be underhanded in order to succeed. He\u2019s a bit perverted, but not \u201cin your face\u201d perverted. It\u2019s a comedy. It\u2019s funny.\\n\r\n-Aqua the alcoholic goddess who is in most cases useless despite having maxed out stats upon entering this world. She is unforgivingly clueless, and also totally full of herself. Her and Kazumas back and forth banter is always hilarious.\\n\r\n-Megumin, an archmage, who wields all powerful explosion magic capable of leveling a city, that she can only use once a day because she collapses from exhaustion, every. Single. time. And it\u2019s never not funny.\\n\r\n-Darkness, the lovable tank of the team, who can take a ton of damage, and loves every second of it. Because, well, she\u2019s a masochist who takes \u201cglutton for punishment\u201d to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nNow the key here, is you would think this would equal a harem, but the author said \u201cyea no that\u2019s dumb let\u2019s be different\u201d and instead you have a main guy who acts like most times he\u2019s embarrassed even being around the others, because they\u2019re so practically useless in a fight. They don\u2019t secretly love him. In Fact? They all make fun of each other constantly and often act like they can\u2019t stand each other. So hopefully you\u2019ll find that dynamic as refreshing as I did.\\n\r\nThey call each other out on their stupidity, yet they remain together, because despite it all, they\u2019re friends. They fight like friends, rag like friends, and also care about each other like friends do. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nHonestly? The writing here is just too good. It\u2019s witty, it\u2019s goofy, sometimes a little over-the-top even. it\u2019s honestly just plain fun to watch. Nothing is to be taken too seriously. The point is to just enjoy and laugh. And I\u2019m pretty darn confident this show will make you do just that.\\n",

            "content": "Jumping into a second season of Konosuba, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. A comedy/fantasy show circling the highjacks of a group of weirdos in a time where adventurers and slaying monsters are relevant. Instead of boring myself with a show with an overused premise, I found this one to be quite unique. \r\nStory: 6\r\nSo there isn't really a linear story going on here. If you are familiar with the first season then you can already imagine how random and chaotic an episode is. The events that take place at the beginning may and probably will be completely different twenty-three minutes in.It may sound unappealing, especially for those who care very much about story but it doesn't hurt the show as much as you'd think. This is a comedy that does not require you to stay focused and capture every single detail. But if you are looking to see adventurers conquering challenges, you'll get it here in a silly manner. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started this series, I struggled to find any visuals that were attractive to my eyes. From the character animations to the different settings that our heroes were in, everything was as average as a white egg. However, I must admit that some \"explosive\" scenes were always nice to see as well as the opening for the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, everything seemed okay to me. Listening to the opening and ending songs for the first time never prompted my brain to rewind my video player to listen again. As for the voices from the many characters, it is the same as the environments, typical and unimpressive. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow I usually don't expect to care for the personalities or backgrounds of a character if it is a comedy series; I'm purely in it for the jokes and giggles. However, noticing back during the first season, I was surprised to see how much I liked the characters throughout the story, especially those in the main group that you will always see. If you don't know them, here's a quick summary. \\n\\n\r\nKazuma, the MC and unannounced leader of the wacky gang is my favorite part of the show. I'm usually disgusted with male MC's because of how clich\u00e9 they can be but Kazuma gives me zero reasons to hate. I found him to be very relatable, especially when he brought up something modern from his time.  Being the only male in the group, a certain quality about him is highlighted along with almost every other male surrounded by women but I never found it to impact his character negatively. \\n\\n\r\nAqua on the other hand, goddess of the group who is probably my least favorite character of the heroic bunch could've been a lot worse. She has a huge ego and often gets in the way. I find her annoying and completely senseless at times but it is the interactions between her and her comrades that really saved her from meeting my mute button. \\n\\n\r\nDarkness, the beautiful, energetic, heroic masochist is a worthy addition to the group of strange oddities. I find her hilarious at times when all is going wrong. Megumin is the final concluding member of the group who is a young, hyper arch wizard that surprisingly contributes to the group when all else is lost. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I could say a lot more about these four characters but I think I'll lock my descriptions and allow you to unlock them yourself and determine whether they are appealing or not. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really liked this anime. I started this series wanting to laugh and I got exactly what I wanted. It's not easy for a show to make me laugh. And when I mean laugh, I don't mean the laughs you keep in your head. I eventually grew tired of smiling because I could not watch an episode without smirking. Every episode left me wanting more and it was all good while it lasted. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I liked the show and gotta say that this is one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. I feel like the jokes were of mixed variety and context, minus one kind that I ended up excusing. It really sucks that this season only has ten episodes but I think I received a lot out of them. I'd be stoked to see another season of Konosuba and hopefully by the time you finish this season you'll feel the same way. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah Konosuba undoubtedly one of the funniest animes ever.  With a talented cast, a great cast of characters and an interesting setting this anime is one of my favorites. I saw the first season back in 2016 and I loved it and I was glad to hear that it was getting a second season. This is one anime that I hoped will get plenty of seasons.  \r\nSetting and story \r\nLike the first season the story of Konosuba follows the adventures of Kazuma a human who was killed in an accident in the real world that was awakened in a fantasy world where magic,monsters and adventurers exist thanks to meeting the goddess Aqua. After dragging Aqua to the world as well the pair encounter their new party members after putting up a notice. These being the extremely powerful mage that has only one spell Megumin and the strong crusader that also likes to be punished Darkness. Season 2 takes place straight after the events of the last episode of the first season. Like the previous season this season has several story arcs that has its own unique characters and quests/ antics. \\n\r\nThe first arc that the cast goes through is the arc with Sena. This arc is a direct consequence of their actions back in their first season where their actions in destroying the devil army\u2019s weapon the destroyer resulted in them destroying a noble\u2019s mansion when they teleported the power source of the machine into it. This arc itself was quite funny in that it involved nearly every character that Kazuma had unintentionally hurt or embarrassed in the past. The fact that Kazuma was accused of conspiring with the devil king due to this was funny as was the subsequent trial that was obviously stacked against him. This act I felt was good as it revealed not just what Aqua and the members of the party think of Kazuma but also what the members of the support cast think of him. \\n\\n\r\nThe next arc that the cast goes through is Varnirs act.  This arc is a consequence of the previous arc in which after clearing a dungeon of enemies that dungeon become the new home of a powerful member of the Devil king\u2019s army. This arc was notable in its main villain who though certainly powerful and deadly was more comical than dangerous. This arc was also notable in that it showed just how powerful Darkness is in combat as she was able to take on quite a few foes and still not be stopped. The interaction between Varnir and Darkness was also amusing. \\n\r\nThe last arc that the cast goes through and arguably the most Significant arc. As a consequence, resolving the previous arc Kazuma ends up getting into a business partnership and in the process, make a large amount of money that causes things to become slow for the party. At this point the cast decided to maybe take some time to relax and head to a nearby resort town. Of course, in true Konosuba fashion this trips turns out to be anything but relaxing. This arc had quite a few surprises that actually was pretty unexpected which made this arc one of my favourites in this season. The first was the fact that the town\u2019s population all believed in one god which was unusual to say the least. Maybe this world only has a limited number of gods in it. The second thing was how creepy these people are when they are trying to get people to join their church. It\u2019s certainly disturbing when you see everyone try and be nice to you while at the same time trying to get you to sign a contract. Talk about creepy salesman lol. The third thing however was how the arcs main villain who looked like a rather normal guy was anything but when he revealed himself. Now that was a impressive transformation there. \\n\\n\r\nAll three of the story arcs for this season was pretty good in my opinion in that each of them had a unique villain that was both strong and each arc requiring the cast to work together to solve the problem that each of those arcs presented. I also liked the fact that each of these arcs are connected with one another in that the consequences of one arc is the catalyst for the start of the next arc.  \\n\\n\r\nKazuma \\n\r\nKazuma voiced by veteran voice actor Jun Fukushima is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the de facto leader of the main party. A simple minded, fast thinking and loyal person Kazuma often is the voice of calm within a party especially when Aqua or darkness goes on their antics. As revealed back in the first season Kazuma is not a original inhabitant of the world that he finds himself in and was in fact a 16 year old teenager that was also a shut in that was brought to this world through Aqua. Thus, Kazuma unlike other adventurers is free to allocate points to skills that he would useful rather than follow a specific class. Although this season takes place straight after the events of the first season Kazuma\u2019s skill at various techniques is good. True to his personality Kazuma\u2019s skills are mainly focused on stealth as with his hide ability or aids him in exploration such as his sense ability. When combat is unavoidable Kazuma adapts the use of a bow as his main offensive power. Even though his party is hard to control at times and it will perhaps be better to form a better party with others Kazuma is in fact very loyal to his friends and indeed is nice to just about everyone. Despite that he can feel stressed at times especially when dealing with the likes of Aqua and Darkness and to a lesser extent Megumin. One of Kazuma\u2019s most impressive traits is his ability to come up with some impressive tactics when dealing with sudden situations that is borne out of his strong observational skills as well as prior knowledge. His tactics though usually unusual and sometimes strange most often do work with this seasons being the battle against the herd of monsters in the desert and the climactic battle in the last arc. Often at times I feel sorry for Kazuma as he has to both manage his party and at the same time manage their finances. I felt that Kazuma\u2019s voice actor Jun Fukushima did a pretty good job in voicing Kazuma. \\n\\n\r\nAqua \\n\r\nAqua voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Akame ga kill fame and my third favourite seiyuu is one of the main characters of the show. A goddess of water who was supposed to have been assigned the role of judging humans that were to be sent to the world where Kazuma and the others reside. This later turned sideways when Kazuma who grew tired of Aqua\u2019s attitude dragged her along with him to the RPG world. Aqua is an energetic, inattentive and bossy that also has a goddess complex in which she likes to be revered by others. Within the story Aqua has the role of a arch mage which is a powerful type of mage that makes use of holy power that allows her to purify both the undead and objects such as water. However, unlike Kazuma whose skills do try to benefit the party Aqua spends all her points in getting party tricks true to her personality. Despite that Aqua does actively care about people and her party members which is made apparent in the first arc when she tries hard to save Kazuma from imprisonment and in the last arc where she tried saving the towns source of income despite the risks in doing so proves that while Aqua certainly can be stubborn and childish at times Aqua\u2019s heart is certainly in the right place. One recurring gag about Aqua is her acts of badmouthing her replacement for her role of judging humans Eris usually by saying someone about her bust size compared to Aqua\u2019s own. This always turns out to be hilarious whenever she says it. As a arch mage Aqua makes use of holy power that also has the tendency to cause trouble for the party as undead creatures will naturally be drawn to her much like how moths are drawn to light sources. It\u2019s funny that when Aqua tries to be useful she often is the reason that the party is in trouble though. Overall, I felt that Sora Amamiya did a great job portraying Aqua. \\n\\n\r\nMegumin \\n\\n\r\nMegumin voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero fame is a mage and one of the main characters of the show. A powerful mage that specializes in the use of explosion type magic Megumin often acts as the voice of reason within the party when either Aqua or Darkness gets too worked up. Megumin\u2019s personality can be described as both honest and caring but at the same time she can be malicious at times. However she does value the bonds and friendships that she has forged with not just the party but also with other people that she has encountered over the years like YunYun for example. Although Megumin is a powerful mage she only knows one spell which while impressive in terms of both attack power and range of impact has the comical effect of incapacitates her for the rest of the day when cast. Although Megumin clearly has the talent to learn different types of spell for some reason she doesn\u2019t. In truth Megumin would be more useful in combat if she is able to use more different types of spells rather than being used as a one-shot weapon. In this season Megumin develops a more closer relationship with Kazuma becoming friendlier actively caring about him when he\u2019s down. Megumin and Kazuma\u2019s interactions have always been funny but in this season, it was even funnier. Megumin\u2019s act of naming Kazuma\u2019s new sword without his accent was probably the funniest. Rie Takahashi as ever did a great job portraying Megumin. \\n\\n\r\nDarkness \\n\r\nDarkness played by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and Guilty crown fame is a crusader and one of the main characters in the series. A member of the RPG worlds crusader class which essentially serves as a party\u2019s main tank Darkness plays an important role within the party\u2019s combat line-up and composition. Though certainly powerful in combat this is offset by one of her traits in that she often misses her attacks even when fighting at point blank range. One notable trait of Darkness that I find amusing is the fact that she is a masochist which means that Darkness actually dreams of being punished by monsters or punished in some other way. This means that more often than not in a situation where the party have adapted a textbook formation or plan that Darkness would ruin it when this urge to be punished comes. The third arc is a good example of this. \\n\\n\r\nDarkness\u2019s personal life wasn\u2019t very much explored in the first season which was remedied in this season. It was actually quite surprising to find that she\u2019s was actually a high-born noble that decided to become an adventurer to escape her family. Darkness\u2019s personal life was actually the focus for one of the smaller sub arcs in the story and that was actually quite entertaining in part because Darkness and Kazuma had differing reasons and agenda\u2019s. That was quite funny to see. Ai Kayano as usual did a great portraying Darkness. \\n\\n\r\nSena \\n\r\nSena voiced by veteran seiyuu Hitomi Nabatame is a support character that was introduced near the end of the first season. A prosecutor that works for the crown Sena serves as the main villain for the first arc that the cast goes through in the anime. Unlike other villains in the series Sena isn\u2019t doing this out of malice or ill will but rather she is doing this as part of her job. From what was seen of her personality Sena she seems to be one that hates injustice and sees her job as vital to the land. One of Sena\u2019s most notable traits is that she has two different personalities that are actually quite different from each other. These two personalities were actually pretty different from each other and it was amusing to see a person such as Sena have these differing personalities. \\n\\n\r\nYunYun \\n\r\nYunYun voiced by veteran seiyuu Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Knights of Sidonia fame is a support character that was introduced in this season. A powerful mage like Megumin YunYun is a capable combatant that does not have the limitations of Megumin and is capable of using a larger variety of spells. YunYun is a former classmate of Megumin\u2019s and is the daughter of the crimson demons unlike Megumin who is a descendant of them. Unlike Megumin who has a rather peculiar personality which has the effect of making her stand out YunYun is the opposite in that she has what can be described as a rather normal if plain personality. This personality unfortunately caused her to be ignored and neglected by her classmates which caused her to have a relatively Hard school year where she had not one friend. This itself I felt was pretty sad. One of YunYun\u2019s most notable traits is her self-described rivalry with Megumin in which she sees Megumin as her eternal rival and constantly tries to challenge her to often hilarious results. One scene that stood out the most with regards to Megumin and YunYun was their interaction with the friendship crystal at wiz\u2019s shop. I felt that Aki Toyosaki did a pretty good job of portraying YunYun and I kinda wished that she was part of the party\u2019s line-up as her spells would have proved pretty useful.  \\n\\n\r\nVanir \\n\r\nVanir voiced by voice actor Nishida Masakazu of Gunslinger strato\u2019s fame is a support character that served as the main villain for the second arc and later a recurring character. A member of the Devils king army and a high ranking one at that has a rather special ability in that he can read everything there is about someone. This means when facing normal adventurers, he will have the advantage as he will know what his opponents is thinking and how they would react to certain situations which I think is an interesting advantage. However, this power while powerful has its limits as he can\u2019t use it against someone that\u2019s either more powerful than him, and those that are weaker than him. So basically, this power can only be used on those that are equal in power to him. Vanir however is no pushover in combat though but an interesting thing about him is that while he is powerful he refuses to use his most powerful skills on humans which means that he has some sense of honor in him despite being an enemy. The manner of Vanir\u2019s defeat itself was quite funny and I was glad that it ended the way it did. Despite being a powerful enemy Vanir was also rather comical in the manner that he spoke.\\n\\n\r\nWiz \\n\r\nWiz played by veteran seiyuu Yui Horie is a character that was introduced back in the first season as a guest character that eventually was given a more permanent role. A former member of the Devil Kings army unlike the others Wiz respects life and people and as a result voluntarily left it becoming neutral to them under specific terms. Like in the first season she continues to run a magic tools shop in town that the cast frequents. Wiz is given much more of an expanded role in this season not acting as just comic relief but also a good source of advice for the cast in the final story arc. Despite leaving the army Wiz is still a capable combatant as evidenced by her display in the last arc battles. The last arc also expanded a little about Wiz\u2019s morals specifically her unwillingness to kill innocents as well as her unwillingness to fight. I felt that Wiz\u2019s character was expanded a great deal making her a far more interesting character rather than being mere comic relief. The last act also revealed that Wiz actually has another side to her usual bubbly and clueless personality that is unleashed when she gets really angry and that was quite a surprise to see.\\n\\n\r\nHer hardworking personality and the fact that she gets nervous easily was nice to see as was her interactions with Aqua. I thought that the series did well to make her part of Kazuma\u2019s group even a temporary member as she brings plenty of positive things to the group in addition to comic relief. Overall, I felt that Yui Horie did a great job in portraying Wiz and I hope that she continues to be present if this gets another season. \\n\\n\r\nArts and Animation \\n\r\nCharacter designs for the show I felt were as good as ever and I felt that the environments that the cast go through in this season was beautifully designed and rendered. In terms of animation I felt that it was done pretty well. The combat scenes that were present in the season I felt were beautifully designed and rendered and animated with the battle against Vanir and the battle against the final boss being my favorites. \\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for this series I felt was pretty good particularly the opening theme which was sung by veteran singer Machico and the ending theme which was sung by the seiyuu\u2019s that voiced Aqua, Darkness and Megumin who are Sora Amamiya, Ai Kayano and Rie Takahashi respectively. The scene music also felt appropriate for the respective scenes as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba\u2019s 2nd season is still as impressive as the first in that it still manages to create an impressive and fun setting while balancing the need to be both serious and at the same time comical. I felt that the overall story was done reasonably well with each of the story arcs having some memorable villains within them. in true Konosuba fashion none of these villains are not actually overly evil but are simply evil. While the focus for the 1st season was focused more on gathering the party members and get them to work as a group this season took the focus on forging bonds with them and let us as viewers see a little of the backstories. Seeing Darkness\u2019s reason for becoming a crusader and seeing what her family was like was interesting. The voice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done with particular praise going to Sora Amamiya, Rie Takahashi and Ai Kayano who voiced the three main heroines. Aki Toyosaki and Yui Horie who voiced YunYun and Wiz I felt also did well. In terms, of character development it was nice to see Kazuma taking more of a leadership role in the party as well as develop some actual skills that will be useful to him whether alone or with his party.  In conclusion i really enjoyed the second season of Konosuba as its the type of show that is smart enough to be serious one minute and be comedic the next without sacrificing either. In fact I actually use Konosuba as a means to relax after a days work and having a good laugh is one thing that it never fails to do. This is one anime that i hope will get renewed for another season. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I think in all 10 episodes there were maybe 4 or 5 jokes that were funny. \r\nGood comedy is about good material and good delivery. Neither angle was covered in this sequel season. The characters were established season 1, but seemed to crumble into a kind of brown paste in this season. The art work was just really bad. Sloppy keyframing leading to sloppier animation. \r\nBitter disappointmentreally. \\n\r\nI gave the sound a 5 because I always try and skip the music. Its in Japanese, with a sprinkling of English and usually nothing at all to do with the story. \\n\r\nWith season 1 I couldn't believe something so good ended with just 10 episodes. With season 2 I wish it had ended sooner.",

            "content": "The season is over :-(. What am I going to watch now?\r\nThis is more of the same thing as the first season - light-hearted show that does not take itself too seriously, but makes fun of fantasy tropes, game-like worlds, etc. If you liked the first season, I think you'll like this one too. It is not an azumanga level comedy, but it is entertaining, and it kept me interested for the duration of the whole season. There was one episode I didn't quite enjoy - 5th episode - but overall it was very good.\r\nDetailed breakdown:\r\nStory: Lighthearted, and does not take itself seriosuly. Events followeach other in order, so the episodes are not isolated from each other, but there isn't really an \"overarching goal\" in this season. Things just happen one after another, so it sorta has \"slice of life\" feeling to it as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Actually, after watching the first episode I thought that art quality went down. Basically, compared to the first season, this one has slightly more dynamic art, meaning that individual frames may look more... rough compared to the first season. Quality overall isn't bad, it is just characters occasionally take a bit of a sketch-like aopearance, with light lines - it looks good in motion, though. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSame as the first season. Solid overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOnce again, they follow their preassigned roles and mostly act for comedy purposes. They feel believable enough and even life-like on occasion, despite being stereotypical. In the end, however, it is a comedy show, so no deep thorough character development here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIT was fun to watch, and it matched my expectations perfectly. Was waiting for the next episode every week, pretty much, and the anime did not disappoint me. As I said, not an azumanga level, but interesting/amusing enough. I'd say that level of comedy (i.e. amount of \"punch\" in it) was comparable to Yuyushiki, or is slightly above it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nRecommended to watch, especially if you watched the first season, or want something lighthearted and a bit relaxing.  It is not a masterpiece level material, but it is a quality show, and it was fun to watch for me.",

            "content": "God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! with another season of KonoSuba and to be expected it's glorious with some flaws here and there but who cares...\r\nWell LA will start this anime review by saying that this second season is by an extension of the first season with a bit more world building through our lovable idiot party and by all accounts, the craziness and comedy is ramped up twofold.\r\nLet's start with the characters, something LA didn't put into more detail in LA's first season review. First would be Kazuma Satou voiced by Jun Fukuyama, the perverted karmic thief main protagonist and really, Kazuma gets hisconsequences and dues in this season with all the culmination of the offhanded events of the first season into a HUGE courtroom climax and it's hilarious. That leads into Darkness voiced by Ai Kayano's arc where we see more about her home life as well as her unpredictable marriage plotline, this thankfully gives her much needed character development she desperately needed in the first season although as a bit of a flaw to her mini-arc is that she'll be in the forefront with her annoying masochistic nature BUUUUUT we get to learn more about her and as to why she has this tendency in the first place. Once again due to Kazuma and his perceived perverted tendencies he gets the short end of the stick and later on Darkness' min-arc we get into..well finally a beginner's dungeon which also gets flipped on it's head with Darkness at the forefront again and another \"threatening yet not\" villain by the name of Vanir voiced by Masakazu Nishida and him as a villain as theatrical as he is, his hamminess in TRYING to be threatening along with coupled with Darkness actually made a pretty good combination oddly enough making Darkness' second half pretty well done. Megumin voiced by Rie Takahashi might have gotten less screentime and is a bit of a punchline now but she too got at least one episode worth of character development in the form of Yunyun voiced by Aki Toyosaki who was first shown in the first season's OVA and Megumin's one episode gave us a bit more insight as to why Yunyun has a friendly rivalry, but nonetheless development. Finally we get Aqua's Hot Springs arc and that is just glorious, everything from the setup, to the setting of the Hot Springs town who is actually affiliated with Aqua's cult church sect is just amazing AND is topped off with an amazing finale (like KonoSuba did in it's first season's finale). From all this, LA's favourite character actually goes to Aqua this season NOT Megumin (though she is LA's overall favourite character of KonoSuba) all due to her being a catalyst ALOT this season as well as her annoying tendency is there sure, but for LA not soo much this season as the punchlines to and from her were GREAT.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the comedy being very much linked to our lovable idiots, they as a group as very good chemistry with each other, be it character jabbing of just having great comedic timing, the comedy just worked brilliantly with it's characters AND what's better is that the anime's second season expands on the world Kazuma and the gang are in as well as flipping our expectations as usual really helped make the comedy work well. On the flaws side of things, the ONE thing LA will take note on is the the fact that the running gags with our main cast is still looming to most of the characters, from Darkness' annoying masochism, Aqua's idiotic tendencies and bitchin' to the people who doesn't like Megumin's explosions and Kazuma being once again an asshole with heaps of lucky karma to him...the running gags are there. But to this defense, due to the world building being expanded and explained (as well as tying up loose plotlines and putting them to the forefront to work to it's advantage in making those first season one-shot episodes to be linked), it causes even the running gags to have a new spin on things (not just change of setting, more like a bit more of self-awareness and making fun of the situation to an almost Seinfeldian level) can easily diminish in seeing the running gags as a foundation to even better comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Studio DEEN once again, LA will say that DEEN actually put in alot more detail and \"polish\" to their animation, sure they still have their purposefully derpy character facial and body animation but it being more detailed and polished they still had the same \"flavour\" from the first season. From what LA said in LA's first season of \\n\\n\r\n\"however LA kinda finds it funny that the character designs are \"weak\" although it kinda emphasizes the entire \"playing against the guy going into an RPG world and becoming a badass\" into the animation with it's weak character designs (though the character designs do look unique at least)\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is still in play even if Studio DEEN stepped up their game in the animation department, it just got a face lift...but still same face is the best analogy LA can say about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, LA feels like the KonoSuba voice cast were just having soo much fun with this and with Jun Fukuyama's ad-libbing to the masochistic Ai Kayano to the tsundere Sora Amamiya, just this voice cast is as bombastic and crazy as the anime itself, what else can LA say but this voice cast is AMAZING, want to see crazily well done ad-libbing to hamminess that is actually worth it then this voice cast is pristine as hell. LA's favourite voice actor would go to Jun Fukuyama as well as Sora Amamiya all due them just having soo much fun with this anime and it CLEARLY shows even in this season of KonoSuba.\\n\\n\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 is a great continuation to already crazy ham-fistedly crazy world Kazuma and his gang gets up to, sure it has it's problems concerning the characters on-going running gags and LA didn't say this but some of the arcs did have a longer \"build up-time\" before it gets to it's climaxes but still even with that, LA will give this season a blessing  (HA!) to it's flaws as LA still enjoyed this second season VERY much due to it's world building through it's lovable idiots and even crazier \"mundane made awesome RPG elements taken up the rear\" events to the second season's finale was AMAZINGLY done in how it was all setup and all the punchlines from it's characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis second season of KonoSuba is undoubtedly and obviously one of the best comedy of Winter 2017 for LA and for those KonoSuba fans, it's an obvious choice to watch this season especially if you want to see more world building and more Seinfeldian RPG fantasy comedy.\\n\\n\r\nGod must have blessed this season and Studio DEEN hit the comedy goldmine...because LA wouldn't mind getting a third season, because this comedy anime series is REALLY great, even at it's worst.",

            "content": "KonoSuba season 2 is wacky and fun, but lacks the necessary comedic diversity to keep the jokes running. \r\nSTORY\r\nKonoSuba continues with another season filled with crazy, wacky adventures. And boy are we ready for some out of the world adventures\u2026Right? Except that didn\u2019t happen. The story slows to a stop in terms of progression in this season. We get introduced to a few new characters. The setting expands a bit; however, other than that nothing happens. The series continues to use the same jokes instead of venturing off into other comedic areas. This makes the series lose its flare. However, the story does improve thelore and character settings and the jokes still stick. The only question is for how long? \\n\\n\r\n\"The Axis Church can get things done. And because you can get things done, even if it doesn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s not your fault! It\u2019s society\u2019s fault that things don\u2019t work out!\u201d \u2013 Axis Church \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS & DIALOGUE \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are basically the same. Not much of their personalities change. Instead I will focus on two of the supporting characters. These characters will most likely reappear in the next season as well. \\n\\n\r\nEris: Yes, I know she is not new; however, we see much more of her in this season. She is a junior goddess with a strong following. In this season, we learn that she sneaky visits the parallel world in her spare time. Obviously, she will become a semi-main character in the future season(s). She is very kind, lighthearted, fair, friendly (basically the opposite of Aqua), and seems to be a potential ship with the MC (if you are into that type of stuff). Overall, Eris is a decent supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nYunyun: Yunyun is the only other supporting character worth mentioning. She is Megumin\u2019s childhood friend (kinda) and self-proclaimed rival. The series uses Yunyun as comedic relief; however, she does play a semi important role in her intro episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue also falls flat. They reuse too many of the same jokes, which becomes tiresome after a while. Outside of the reused jokes, the character spend most of their time roasting (talking shit to a person) each other. A large chunk of the dialogue is pointless and does not help progress the story. \\n\\n\r\nAUDIO & VISUAL\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the visuals could be better. I\u2019m not sure if the studios changed, but you can clearly see a difference in the overall production of the anime. The backgrounds feel too gritty at moments. Some scenes were simply too dark or tilted, which does not fit the fell-good mood of the series. The fighting scenes also seemed a bit rushed and cluttered this season. However, the mythical creatures are very well done. The series throws several more creatures at us. Each set of the creatures possess their own styles, color, and life-like (in a sense) interactions. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio is great. The voices are wacky, obnoxious, and wild. The voice actors went for the \u201chome run\u201d on this one. Each voice actor/actress did an amazing job. The opening and ending scores were also great. They matched the series' theme perfectly. Finally, the sound effects were goofy, but goofy in a good way. There was no scene in which the sound effects or background music overshadowed the series' fell-good mood. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nOverall KonoSuba season 2 performed poorly when compared to season 1. The jokes stated to become stale, the animation seemed sloppy, and the story moved at a sails pace. Hopefully season 3 can remove these problems, and lock down what made season 1 such much fun. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL GRADE\\n\r\nC\\n",

            "content": "Deen's lazy, and they're feeding you an unpolished product, and you're accepting it as it is. \r\nStory : 8/10\r\nIn all honesty, the first 7 episodes were just a repeat of season 1. If the show would have went on like that, I would have rated the show a 5. Good thing the \"hot spring arc\" came by and actually explored a new location. KonoSuba has a great setting, so the various towns/locations need to be explored more.\r\nArt : 3/10\r\n\"BUT THE ARTSTYLE IS INTENTIONALLY BAD CAUSE IT'S FUNNY\"- let me stop you right there. \r\nSure, the derpy art does add some comedic value, after all, Deensomewhat knows how to do derpy art, with Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka? being a perfect example, but that's not the problem. It's rushed. There's a limit between derpy art and bad art, and KonoSuba falls very close to the boundary between those 2. The art was screaming \"WE ARE SAVING MONEY\" shamelessly. This can be forgiven, since some frames actually made me chuckle, but that's not the biggest problem either.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation. Oh god do I cringe everytime I watch the opening, the ending with poorly drawn still images, the episodes with poor proportions on characters, unnatural not even derpy movement, nothing is shaded.. The list goes on and on. The animation in KonoSuba S2 is objectively bad. The art falls under some kind of subjectivity, but the animation is inexplicably poor and, yet again rushed. A perfect example of this would be an opening scene of episode 9, with a priest character walking towards Kazuma unshaded, poorly drawn, shifting in size, and poorly proportioned. Sadly this repeats throughout the anime. If the animation didn't make me cringe, I would have rated the anime an 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that Deen knows how to animate things properly. Episode 10 had very good animation and a perfect balance between derpy and good art. But for some unknown reason, I cannot say that same for the rest of the show. Most likely money saving.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character voices are sometimes irritating, but most of the time the voice acting is on point. Sadly the opening song, as well as the ending song just sound like a copy of the OP/ED from season 1. This doesn't lower the mark, I'd just like to hear something more original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where KonoSuba shines. The show focuses on character interaction and does so very well. I would think that season 2 would just be a repeat of the same jokes used in season 1 (which it sort of was the case), but it deviated enough from season 1 and brought more original humor and specific character traits to every character. The only bad thing I could say is that some of the characters, such as Wiz, weren't developed enough. Being my favourite, I would love to see some more backstory and jokes to Wiz, instead of only having a small part dedicated to her in episode 10. Same goes for Yunyun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFaltered by the poor animation, I enjoyed season 2 less than season 1. If season 3 comes around, I'm hoping for the same level of quality as seen in episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend watching both of the KonoSuba seasons if you manage to not pay much attention to the art or the animation. It's a good, funny show to kill time when you're bored. It could have been better.",

Even though humor pretty much is like Aqua makes trouble, they try to fix things and Darkness is the masochist and loli witch is cute. Some episodes are less funny but still way over average. Plot/story... it kinda floats like in real RPG, doing random stuff allover places, some things are more fun than others but overall they are fun just like episodes in this anime. Especially in the latest episodes when they are changing scenery, itis refreshing and really really fun watching interactions of various other people in addition to the main chars.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall this season especially to the end is getting better and better that is why  it gets 8,4/10 rounded to 8/10.",

Lot's of cool action, lots of comedic action, lots of comedic fanservice and in general very bright and light hearted Anime with quite a mean yet very funny comedy. Cannot say much else regarding story.\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\r\nThen Art&Animation got hell of a downgrade. It's been a while since S1 but I do remember that S1 did impress me much more with visuals, this one felt oddly cheap. Was still good enough the the style of the Anime, but neverthelessvisual side was a downgrade.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music and ost. Found it really fitting and fun. Listening OST separately is quite epic.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nLots of fun, odd and eccentric characters. Superb enjoyment regarding them. A lot of fun side-kicks, side-characters, villains and so on. Stereotypes/roles set in this anime are absolute bliss. Even though Kazuma is absolute nerdy mean cowardly douche, but in comedic aspect in this particular Anime, it makes it just superb.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nDid enjoy it a lot, aside visual downgrade found it as much fun as the first season.",

            "content": "For me this anime was an unexpected discovery. One rainy day I was wandering through some internet anime fan\u2019s pages when I suddenly saw \u201cthe best 2016\u2019th anime\u201d discussion, and this show(1\u2019st season) was in top. I seriously don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been in the previous year, but without a shadow of a doubt I can call it one of the best.\r\nNow that the 1\u2019st season is over, the second one not only didn\u2019t low its level, but made a step forward. The jokes became funnier, characters are more versatile, secondary characters appear more often on the screen and are paid more attention to, andfinally - some new locations(besides the newbies town and the castle that Megumin used to blow every time). \\n\r\nIt\u2019s been 7 episodes so far, but from what I can judge the creators will not please us with the big final  - the takedown of the Demon King, and there is a possibility that we will see the 3 season(I really hope this will happen).  \\n\r\nNow I\u2019m about to be more specific (that\u2019s the info for those who didn\u2019t see the 1 season).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and common to many animes. The main guy suddenly wakes up in another reality/world (which, by the way, is very similar to some MMORPG game) and in order to survive he must assemble his crew. Storyline is nothing but 100 times used cliche, with one but. It could be shallow and boring in any other show, BUT NOT in this one. It is brought to viewers mixed up with tones of great (perverted) humor and funny (ecchi) situations, unlike each other (very very weird) main characters and\u2026 Aqua. Well, not the water, but the goddess of water. She deserves a special attention, because she is that cherry on top of a cake, she makes the whole mood of the show and brings the joy and laughter to every moment she appears on screen. \\n\\n\r\nCreators paid much attention to different kinds of moods that we can see on our characters\u2019 faces and \u2018ve made them realistic and colorful. The openings/endings are great, art style is beautiful, dialogs are entertaining and creative, the enjoyment is very high.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is everything I did not expect it to be \u2013 exciting, full of action, unique in its own way and full of joy. This show is definitely worth watching, unless you want to miss to see one of the best waifus (Aqua) in action;)\\n",

            "content": "Man, I hate that seasons of this anime are only 10 episodes and not a full 12 or 13, it leaves you wanting more.  This is hands down the funniest fantasy adventure anime I've ever seen.   The starring quartet of Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness are one of the funniest groups I've seen in years.  This is especially true of Kazuma and Aqua, who have no sense of shame or scruples 90% of the time.  While Darkness' theme of the Masochist is a worn out gimmick, Konosuba manages to revive the trope with just how off the wall she iswith her \"M\".  It was a great improvement from the first season and got me to like her more.  Although, Megumin seemed to fade a little bit in the second season, I still love her character.  The addition of Wiz to the group as the \"normal\" one, was a nice touch and I hope she becomes a permanent member of the team in season 3.  \\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the strength of Konasuba rests upon its absurdist and dark humor.  The events within the story aren't all that remarkable on their own (Going to the hot springs, scouring a beginner's dungeon, for example), but when told with the level of humor that Konosuba generates, it makes even mediocre events much more hilarious than they would normally be.  You find yourself watching just one more episode in order to see what happens next, until suddenly your realize the anime is already over and you blew your whole day watching an anime, instead of working.  LOL!  \\n\\n\r\nThe weak point of Konosuba this season however, is exactly the same as last season was: The ending.  The endings continue to feel not like the end of a season or arc, but just the end of the episode.  It felt that way in season one when they defeated the Destroyer, and it especially felt that way with the ending of this season.   I understand that its because they are working up to the Devil King, but the anime would improve if they started an overarching narrative that leads to the final battle, rather than just foisting it on you in episode 9 and concluding it in episode 10.   \\n\\n\r\nThis weakness however, like all of Konosuba's weaknesses, is eliminated by the humor.  Even if the art work is on the weak side (similar to Log Horizon), even if the events aren't really memorable or unique, even if the ending is kind of lacking in punch, the characters are so good and the story is so funny, you just don't really care and enjoy it like crazy, anyway.   I definitely recommend this anime with the highest overall mark, because it excels at what a comedy is supposed to really do: put you in tears while you choke on laughter.   \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n",

Adding the fact that none of them will ever correct their obsessions which caught them in bad situation all the time. And it WORKS.\r\nDespite seeing some fans complaining about the animation quality, I find it improved instead. The characters facial expression and movement only reinforce the humor ithad me chucking laughter around friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost go hand in hand to support the atmosphere and humor. Not to mention the voice actors who all seem to enjoy playing their characters. I find myself listening to the opening and ending on each episode just because how well done it is.\\n\\n\r\nChances are people who enjoyed the first season will feel right at home.

            "content": "Unlike my previous review of KonoSuba, I am a bit more optimistic towards this season. And I have a few reasons why. For starters, the negatives. Will just get them out of the way now.\r\nIt has basically been solidified by this point that this anime slowly, but surely, took together the trope of the male character receiving the most blame. Still don't like this since, well this anime clearly proves to the audience that the female members of the group are the most reckless, the civilians themselves consider Kazuma the scum of the group. In other words, it follows the trope that I have complainedabout many times before.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if it wasn't for the fact that Kazuma is actually quite the pervert, I would be angrier about this. He certainly contributes the most among the team as far as planning out how they go about using their powers, but he's still a pretty big pervert at times, so the innocence card isn't for him. After all, if you're reading this, I assume you've seen the previous season and know already that he sexually violated one of his teammates. Even if it wasn't a dream, he was quite lewd and this proved that he's a pretty big pervert.\\n\\n\r\nWe're already at the positives. And speaking of, I feel I didn't mention this in my other review, but I actually quite enjoy the flow that this anime has to offer. The writing is just as good as it was before and I found myself laughing out loud a few times during some of the more comical moments, which is something I haven't done in a comedy in a while. That's mainly thanks to the witty nature of the writing and the characters complementing each other rather well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is, more or less, the same. The soundtrack is also the same, but most anime normally inherit the same soundtrack throughout their entire run, so this is no shocker. It's still pretty enjoyable, but this time around, I did not quite enjoy the opening and closing credits. The opening felt a bit more generic, well the closing is basically a remix, if not remaster, of the one they used before. I enjoyed it for its calm nature, but this time, they made it more peppy and now I do not enjoy it the same way I once did. What a shame, really, cause now I lack as positive of an opinion about the soundtrack as I did before.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is about the same as before. All of them are trying to defeat the great evil one step at a time, but it's mainly just more leaders. I believe they defeat two in this season if memory serves me right. I finished this up a little while ago, so I forgot how many it was. But, the story is just there to be story and the anime's main focus is still on the comedy aspect of their adventures, which it does a good job at.\\n\\n\r\nLoved the first season of KonoSuba? Then for sure watch this one! It offers more of the same humor that you grew to love and more. I only rate it a bit higher than the previous one simply because the anime has established the tropes that it's following, so I can respect it for that at least. I was disappointed more in areas that I was not disappointed in before, but the areas that did improve were the ones I wanted to. And for that, it deserves more respect.",

But someone at DEEN said to make the art derpier to gave more emphasis on the comedy, and they did. Which fails horribly. But for Konosuba, the story and the comedy saved the horrible art choice.\r\np.s. From episode 5 onwards, the animation quality got a whole lot better.\r\nCompared to the first season, the second season's animation quality has gotten a lot worse. For a quick comparison, you might want to take a look at both the first and second season's OP back toback and notice the quality drop. The boobs got saggier, derpy faces, unsteady animation. It's just horrible. Some of you might not really notice the art difference, good for you, I hope I didn't too since it made me can't fully enjoy the episode.\\n\\n\r\nApparently the worsening animation quality was intended, which sounds stupid, but it's true. Konosuba is one of the most popular DEEN's anime adaptation, so it wasn't about budget. And we know DEEN is capable of putting good quality anime (might want to take a look at Rakugo). And most importantly: Animation quality was fixed from episode 5 onwards (probably they heard people's complaint and fixed it right away, but idk really).\\n\\n\r\nSo at this point you might want to wait for the BD version of the anime, and hope for improvements on the earlier episodes, because some studio usually changed/fixed their animation quality on BD release according to popular demand.",

This is actually as poor as humanly possible from every freaking single aspect from which an anime can be judged. \r\nLet's let alone the art cuz this series has an 'unique' kind of art that somehow synergy pretty ok with its theme. So i'd give it a 7 and leave it there. The character somehow got an a-ok development from ss1 considering that this is a 10-episode anime. Also, I'd not complaint abt some like this-anime-is-more-slice-of-llife-than-adventure because i can justignore that kind of crap and enjoy it as a slice-of-life just fine. Given that the silliness dumb and dumber kind of thing is the main source of enjoyment in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the bad part: This anime season had like 2 arc and a half of content. This is quite a rich overstatement because the judge arc and the tomb arc was meant to be 1 arc. So basically it has 2 arcs for a freaking anime season. Also, don't hope for the arc they advertised in the anime's OP, you'd be disappointed. Basically the second season has not every near 1/3 of the previous season's content value, and the ending's not even half as rich as the 1st. The only way i can forgive this is the possibility that there'd be a ss3 coming soon and this serves as the a middle season as well as a way to milk more money out of this series. However if there's nothing happen (again) in ss3 i'd consider this a fcking scam and drop this series.\\n\r\nThe enjoyment and comedy stepped up a bit compared to the 1st season but they seemed to run out of ideas pretty fast. Basically they just add more characters to the main casts and put more emphasis and amplification on each character's \"weaknesses\" and apparently the viewers are fine with it but from the technical standpoint this approach is damn lazy and mediocre. Basically they're just saying \"Hey, these stuffs work all the time so let feed them again again and again with them.\" \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, finally, there's the characters. These idiots are obviously the only bright side of this series, who we'd love to meet again soon.",

            "content": "Ah, Konosuba.  The fantasy RPG parody that swept the anime community by storm with its bizarre mix of problematic characters and real world cruelty put in a fantasy setting ushered in a new thing for those in the anime community to fawn over.  Many were swayed into the cult of explosions, and no one still likes Aqua.  So it was natural that a second season would be coming in order to keep the hype train rolling.  Though shorter, how does season two compare with its season one predecessor?  Um...well...\r\nStory: Konosuba.  Boy dies in a hilarious accident, transports him andthe most useless goddess in the world to a fantasy world where he becomes an adventurer and realizes that the hopes and dreams of being a world renowned protagonist adventurer are nothing more than dreams because the world sucks.  Meets a pyrotechnics obsessed loli and a hardcore M crusader, blah blah blah, you're probably aware of the series's synopsis in some way or another.  (I assume)  \\n\\n\r\nAs per usual with continuation cours of an existing series, Konosuba 2 continues the story of our merry band of dysfunctional characters as they deal with various other events, characters, and pains in the neck where the important thing to remember is, \"Anything and everything can and will go wrong.\"  This key component is what keeps the series going as it allows the various outlandish character interactions to continue on and on without end, thus creating the series's comedy and largely is the reason why people like this series so much.  \\n\\n\r\nBut what separates this season from its first one is one thing: Intensity.  While the first season definitely showed that each of these characters had a few screws loose in their head, this season on the other hand shows us just what it means to crank something up to eleven.  There's more Aqua whining, more Darkness masochism, and more Kazuma being an all around asshole, showing us just how mentally deranged all of these characters are and boosting the show's concept of \"anything and everything can and will go wrong\" as a staggering amount of the comedic scenes are thrown off the rocker to become far wackier than what may have originally been expected.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever because the series does so much to try and ramp everything that it did in season one to an extreme, a lot of the jokes end up becoming reused and the gag usually runs its course extremely quickly.  The biggest example of this is Darkness's masochism, where she gets off on something every episode, squealing in glee that she's getting physically abused, thrown around, verbally abused, or deprived of something for about two minutes and making the entire scene very awkward for the viewer.  We get it, she's a pervert.  Don't shove it in our face in every other scene.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Konosuba 2's story is, as expected, a continuation of the first season with the only difference between the two is how far the jokes go.  Konosuba 2 really tries to push the boundary as to how far they can go on any given gag which vary in success depending on which gag that they're trying to 'improve' on.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Largely the same story\\n\r\n+/- Well executed situational and character interactions (Comedy is subjective.)\\n\r\n-  How far they took the jokes had some negative impact\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The four party members of Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness take on the same roles of the asshole, the useless goddess, the loli nuke, and the masochistic tank.  They're largely the same characters, have the same relationships with one another, and bounce off each other in the same dysfunctional way that they did in season 1, so there's little to say here.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters though, season 2 gives us quite a number of...interesting individuals.  There's Yuyun, several other members of the Demon King's commanders, a cat, and an entire town full of very problematic individuals.  The side cast dictates the situation that our troublesome adventurers have to deal with, and these largely one-off villains/characters manage to give off an impression (though not always positive) that makes them memorable.  Is it the good kind of memorable?  Eh...it's at least not the bad kind, so that's a plus I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n+ Main 4 characters still bounce off each other well\\n\r\n+ Side cast manages to be memorable (Though wanting to remember them is debatable)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Studio Deen's track reputation has always leaned on the idea that they're bad at animation/art.  Konosuba is no different.  Its first season raised a few eyebrows on how they did fanservice, and the characters' expressions never seemed human.  Konosuba 2 continues that track record, and manages to make Deen's art quality crystal clear.\\n\\n\r\nThe rise in intensity of the series's jokes and gags are coupled with similarly exaggerated facial expressions and movements by our cast of characters that gradually seem more inhuman as the episodes roll by.  The animation is choppy sometimes, the art deforms the characters greatly in some scenes, and sometimes it just looks...ugly.  But for Konosuba, it works.  \\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the series being this wild and crazy comedy series, the art coincides with the voices to give off the series's crazy feel.  The constant screams of comedic agony are coupled with wild faces crying their eyes out, characters awkwardly stare in the distance looking stonefaced, and movements are exaggerated to coincide with whatever crazy thing is going on on-screen.  So yes, the art sucks.  There may not be any fluidity, the characters look off a lot of the time, and physics sometimes shits itself, but hey, it works.  And that's the important thing.  I think.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ The art just...works.  Somehow.\\n\r\n-  Extremely inconsistent and sometimes downright ugly\\n\r\n-  Choppy animation\\n\\n\r\nSound:  In my opinion, Konosuba's OST doesn't really have much to it.  Its OP is a generic pop song that doesn't feel like anyone would give two thoughts about, and the ED, while nice due to the fact that it serves as a complete contrast to the series's usual tone, is a mellow piece that's ok, but doesn't really have much to it.  Sure it can be memorable, but it doesn't have any kind of wow factor.  \\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes to voice acting, Konosuba is something else.  Amamiya Sora's screams as Aqua are still ear gratingly good, and Kayano Ai manages to keep up Darkness's masochistic tendencies to the level of \"Should I be watching this...?\".  The voice acting honestly makes the scene, and without the kind of intensity that the seiyuus give for their performance, the impact of each comedic moment would be lost.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great voice acting\\n\r\n+/- Good OST, but doesn't feel memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  I like Konosuba.  It's a far cry from most shows featuring a dude thrown into a fantasy world surrounded by women (which is surprisingly a very common setting) by making him incredibly weak and turning him and everyone around him into nutjobs for the sake of comedic value.  This season however...I'm not a big fan of it.  Contrary to the first season, I didn't feel the urge to watch the next episode as it came out and for good reason: It was difficult to watch.  As mentioned before, the increased intensity of the jokes runs the gag very quickly, and as such, makes the joke not funny and more awkward.  This is what I didn't like.  While I still say that Konosuba is a good comedy series, the comedy that it tries to pull this time around is something that I would regard as 'unfavorable'.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I did like watching it.  It's fun watching second seasons of stuff and seeing what more the story has to offer.  I did genuinely laugh at a good chunk of the series, and I still enjoyed myself.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nTo point something off easily, Darkness.  While I would say Aqua is my least favorite character in this series, Darkness takes the cake as the one thing about this season that I didn't like.  Every scene with her is just another round to show off how much of a masochist she is, and while yes, she does show us what else she can be (as the early episodes have a bit of an arc devoted to her), the only impression that I can get from her is \"More, more, more!\" said in ecstasy.  While yes, it is a large part of her character, you could at least try to not make it fucking awkward to watch her get off on shit.  Like jesus christ you could make a full-length episode or two just out of her masochistic shenanigans this time around!\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched season 1 and liked it, then yes, you probably should watch this.  Otherwise, I'd honestly be careful with Konosuba.  As always, comedy is subjective, and the wackiness of this series won't sit well with some people.  This season in particular I'd tread lightly cause, some of the scenes can get pretty awkward and for me at least, kind of killed my enjoyment of the series, leading me to not like it as much as I did in the first season.",

            "content": "When season 1 ended everyone wanted more even after a lackluster ending. Ten episodes feels too short but maybe that's all the creators really want, to goof off with these characters. And I honestly can't say for sure if I'd want a season 3, well definitely for the gags yes. But eh I'll explain more in this review. \r\nStarting off with the soundtrack, which again was perfect really it's oozing with comedy. Seriously you have to notice how well it supports the comedy with the characters. The opening is fun silly while the ending was beautifully relaxing. Both of them are perfect showcasing the charactersand how they interact with each other. XD\\n\r\nMoving onto the animation which was defiantly more spectacular in season 2. The explosions were vivacious and just every action scene was well a treat. All thanks to Shinya Takahashi-san being brought into season 2. Even the comedic scenes were more of a treat. More proportions are being played with, remember when Aqua went all looney toons that was fun to watch! (Episode 5 I think) And I applaud the key animator who was in charge of that part for playing around with Aqua's reaction.  \\n\r\nMoving on the plot well it's more of a laid back, \"well eventually defeat the demon king,\" to me. But that's fine that's exactly what konosuba is \ud83d\ude02 and that's why it's so good. No one really cares about that obviously that time may come, but enjoying these characters hilarious circumstances is what's best for it right now. Which leads to my only issue... yes the jokes are hilarious. However it depends how long you are willing to go with the same spoof. They do mix it up and make different situations, but it's always based on the same starter. Aqua is a useless goddess and Darkness is a masochist. I found myself laughing less in season 2 for this reason. This is why I'm not sure if I'd want another season, I'm afraid I'll laugh less. And this is a series I love so that's not something I'd want to happen. \\n\r\nSeason 2 ended ended with the best bang, so this leads me to rating it higher than season 1. I recommend this to anyone who is a comedy nut like me, and loves character's jokes bouncing off each other.    \\n",

            "content": "There's a trend in anime where, a series may receive a fantastic and highly acclaimed first season, but then a second season is released that is a mediocre cash grab made for the sole purpose of selling Blu Rays and making a quick profit. The second season of KonoSuba is a prime example of this trend.\r\nSynopsis:\r\nSince this is a review of the second season of KonoSuba, I don't feel any need to give any backstory or a summary of the plot, since you've probably already seen the first season. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story in this season is pretty much nonexistent. There's literally nothing done to further theparty's goal of defeating the devil king. For the majority of the season, Kazuma and crew pretty much just wander around, accepting quests, coincidentally stumbling upon the Devil King's generals, etc. If you've seen season 1, they pretty much use the same formula, here. Kazuma's party accepts a quest, difficulties arise caused by the \"unique \" (read:problematic) personalities of each of the party members, there's a few \"haha\" moments and the episode ends. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this season has a horrible habit of recycling the same humor from the previous season. After awhile, the jokes just become stale and lose all comedic value that they once held, which is in part due to the fact that the characters never actually break OUT of character (more on this in a minute).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nJust like how the plot is directionless, so are the characters. You have your NEET otaku (who happens to be a pervert), your dimwitted goddess who causes trouble for the party, your masochistic crusader, and your chuunibyou mage who just loves to cast explosion magic. While this lovable party did well in delivering comedy through their unique personalities and interactions with each other in season 1, it just wasn't enough to keep me engaged this time around. For one, they NEVER break out of character. While some may praise the series for this, for me, it made the comedy seem stagnant and utterly boring. In my opinion, there's only so many times you can laugh at the same scenarios that have already been done numerous times before. To remain fresh, the comedy needs to change and constantly reinvent itself, which is probably the largest reason why I think this season failed. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nIf all of my above complaints weren't enough to drive home the fact that this season was mediocre, there's also the sub-par animation quality. The first episode, especially, was horrible in terms of animation. Throughout the season, there were numerous off-model shots, low overall detail quality (this can be seen in cities and scenery shots), and character faces were just \"off\" at multiple points in the series. Oh, and did I mention the nightmarish CGI horses? Because there's a few of those. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was...nothing to write home about. At the very least, the OP and ED songs were quite good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word that I can use to describe how I felt about the second season of KonoSuba, it would be disappointing. I had hoped that I would see some sort of plot progression, and that the humor would reinvent itself in a way that would prevent the comedy from becoming stale. But alas, this wasn't the case. In the end, I give Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 a 4/10.",

But nevertheless Wiz, Yunyun and Megumi sounded just right, but not enough for me to give this category a score higher than just a mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, so I'm giving this category a good 7, for the introduction of some new characters like Wiz who later on become part of Kazuma's harem and Yunyun, and the Vanir the antagonist of somewhat, that I wish he is dead, there is also the slime villain on the last episode that has broken the boredom of this anime since they have added some spice into this anime's , if not for them this anime would have been boring with just the 4 of the main characters so ....EXPLOSION!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, it was good, but not very good, it's only as good to a certain point when there were episodes that  I'm just not laughing, only chucking, but still , it wasn't something that you'd feel like a chore, so it's a 7 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave an 8 cu'z studio Deen, didn't try to prolong this anime to 12, and just focus on how they can make it better with just 10 episodes , which                     good, so IMO, this is worth watching, just don't expect a lot , but still all worth it.........\\n\\n\\n\r\nEXPLOSION!!!!!!!!!",

Which is both good and bad. Comedy through failure was core in making the first season such a hit and most of the second season was just that: comedy through failure. It\u2019s the same food in different packaging. Some will like it. Others won\u2019t.\r\nWhere the first season subverts our expectations and kept us guessing, making for a very fun ride, the second season is to some degree one note and predictable. Where the firstseason continually pokes fun at the many isekai tropes, the second season opted to ride the \u201cDarkness is a masochist\u201d stick so hard.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of finding new ways of interaction, like a certain bath scene in the second season\u2019s second episode, S2 sticks to what is safe: the same old character defects already exploited in S1. Aqua\u2019s dumbassery and Darkness\u2019s masochism are especially grating because they keep falling back to it for the humor even if it\u2019s been done to death. Yes, the cast of KonoSuba are a bunch of likeable failures who bumble their way to victory most of the time and it\u2019s part of their charm. Asking them to lose their defining character defect is changing the nature of the show entirely. The problem isn\u2019t their defining character trait. The problem is that the show relies on it too much instead of introducing inventive interactions and concepts.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains introduced add virtually nothing to the show. Heck, Verdia\u2019s dead and done and he still managed to funnier and much more interesting with less than a minute of screentime. And since the villains and the background characters add so little, the main cast is left to carry the show\u2019s comedy. In the case of Aqua and Darkness, they failed spectacularly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while S2 didn\u2019t have a time jump like that one time on S1, the continuity feels more jarring. The comedy breaks the narrative a lot. Certain events and plotpoints tend to get nowhere. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything so just observe Darkness -she is by far the biggest offender. It\u2019s amazing how stagnant her character is in spite of everything that occurred since the first episode of S2. There are a lot of interesting ways they could have taken her character with everything that happened so far buuut noooo they stuck to the same old gag.\\n\\n\r\ntl:dr I ragged on Darkness so hard she orgasmed, repeatedly.",

This series is the most enjoyable comedy anime i've ever seen in my life. Don't argue about that, taste of humour from other people different and it's including me. I love this series so much and feel empty after the ending credit, and not anyone feel same about that. \r\nI try to write this review without making spoiler or some rant.\r\n1. Story\r\nSame like previous season, this series keep the comedy as their main root. Notmany progressing into demon king camp, just they become their usual personalities like we've seen in season 1, playing around and make jokes. But this season have more world-building, more scenery to explore, and more joke about two things i mention before. For LN readers, keep the portion about LN version and anime version. I already read LN too so please not to be Axis cult with every spoiler as their dissapointment. They include many source for LN but to keep it interesting they mix it with their original idea, that i said not bad too. For anime viewers, comedy somehow kinda stale but that's their comedy. You can't change your style of comedy so easy.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art\\n\\n\r\nIt's comedy anime, why you take your hope so highly for high quality art ? It's their style since season 1, to different themself than LN. And to silent many complain about their art, they mix it with good art in many episode, but they keep some goofy, derpy, hilarious face model. Animation not their problem, it's always great, can't you see how fluid and good they manage every movement ?\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack so much, perfect so much to build every moment. You can learn from this anime if you want to make anime or film to build up into something.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\\n\r\nSame like season 1, character is the number one aspect for Konosuba. We can see 4 characters again, making foul of themself, embarass themself in front of people. Somehow it will be stale and boring, but Konosuba manage it very well and make that 4 always refreshing to see. This season seems to make their character give strong impact to anime viewer, make them so memorable and lovable, in different ways.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI can't express my enjoyment. God gifting us this wonderful anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show making more impact than season 1. World-building, More exploration into their world, and more hilarious moment to witness. I will ending this review with most notable word from this show.\\n\\n\r\n'EXPLOOOOSION'\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much",

Well\u2026I was kinda disappointed.\r\nI still enjoyed and laugh at all the jokes, believe me. I even rewatched some epic funny moments just to make me laugh. But the thing is, it gets old and boring. The more I watch this series, the more I find it stagnant and repetitive. It\u2019s like the plot was not moving forward, at all. Everything was like compensated through the use of comedy which was only okay on the surface level.\r\nAt least, Idid saw some character depth. I got to know more about Darkness and Megumin. I even learnt more stuff about Aqua\u2019s goddess powers. But character development\u2026.nah. They are still the same since season 1. Well, I think they become worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was indeed sloppier than on previous season. It\u2019s like the studio didn\u2019t give a damn about how they\u2019ll look like as long as it will be funny. Indeed, it definitely added more flavor to the comedy that was already present in the series. I do hope that when the season 3 comes, thing would get moving while still maintaining the right amount of comedy & hilariousness that made Konosuba different from other Isekai animes.",

Megumin is the same, just level up a bit in term of fire power.

Great animation, great music, great flailing arms, 10/10.\r\nOther than that, the show doesn't add anything to the table for a while. The first 5 episodes were bland and trying to play to the show's strengths. But its strengths are the same old 'jokes' we saw multiple times in season 1 so they become weaknesses after being overused. Darkness likes to be hit, we get it. We learned a bit about her past but she is still thesame character. I feel like Vanir was wasted due to Darkness humor.\\n\\n\r\nThen it got better though. The show let the characters and the audience figure out Kazuma's 'power' in a funny way. Kazuma and Aqua trying to best each other at living fabulously while Megumin went nuts was hilarious. Honestly, Megumin is my favorite character at this point. She is somewhat sane compared to the others and it's refreshing when she neutralizes the absurdity sometimes. Though she didn't have as much screentime as in first season, I liked her a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, then the group went on a 'long' (by this show's standards) adventure. Pacing was good and I enjoyed the journey. The fanatic town wasn't great but those episodes served as a nice foundation for the final one. I think the final climax was entertaining and beautifully animated. Actually, the animation was a lot better this season overall. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, I think this season started 'meh' but got better and funnier in the 2nd half. I don't know if a 3rd season is coming, but I'd be interested to see more. Recommended to anyone who found season 1 enjoyable.",

The lack of a good background score was also not felt because the humor quality in itself was better than the 1st season. Also I have grown to acknowledge the traits of characters, and especially like Megumine, perhaps because she is the least awkward and least irritating of the three girls.\r\nI did not resent watching this season at all (Considering the factthat I didn't like the 1st season) .

            "content": "My opinion of Konosuba remains much the same as the first season. The bottom line is, if you like Konosuba's first season, this is going to bring you more of the same. If you weren't entirely sold on it before, this isn't going to improve anything.\r\nVery little actually changes for better and worse. So a lot of what I said in my review of the first season holds true here as well. The characters remain just fleshed out enough to service as the main cast and their interactions, bizarre quirks and bad habits remain a constant source of their own trouble. Character development is non-existentand the format remains entirely episodic with nothing truly meaningful happening in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, Konosuba is still one of those shows that really isn't trying for anything majorly deep or impactful. It sets out to be a funny show and it succeeds at that. I had just as many laughs in this season as I did last with one exception.\\n\\n\r\nThe final four episodes are the show's first attempt at an actual arc, all taking place in a different city and can't be taken on their own like other episodes can. There weren't as many jokes as the entire plot feels stretched thin with far too much being placed on repeating the same gag over and over again. This is something the show is already known for with a few character tendencies forming the basis of the comedy but without us being attached to the characters involved the repetition grew thin (a solid fifteen minutes of the same joke on repeat, taking up most of one of the four episodes) and I felt that this really should have been condensed into a single episode and it would have been better off as well as fitting well with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed it, however. If you liked the first one check it out, but the first season I think is better entirely because of the failed arc.",

Take the intro for example season one (once again the character models are not beautiful) the animation is smooth the facial expressions are with in reason, but season two the animation feels really choppy and half assed. Especially for an OP\r\nThe overall story wasnot as goal oriented as the previous season which is fine because the show itself is episodic ish. To me this season felt a lot like a season of OVA instead of a second season, just a personal feel on that.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sound goes, nothing really stood out nor did anything stick out for being bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it was still a pleasant watch but it did not feel as quality as season one. and for that I must be a harsh critic and give it a 6.",

Now I've already written an in-depth review for konosuba s1, where my main issues were its art and story. In season 2, the art looked far more polished, and the fight scenes were actually....good! The story has finally anchored itself down and we see two more major progresses in their rather half-assed quest at defeating the Devil King.\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nMy only qualm would be Darkness. I find her rather...random and inappropriate. I don't outright hate her, if only because of how the other charactersare given even more opportunities at making jokes. The other three are as hilarious as ever.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nthe seiyuus once again brought their A-game, and even the opening was rather entertaining this time around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI think it's impossible to NOT enjoy KonoSuba. Even if you don't double over laughing, you'll sit through the whole thing in one sitting, hands down. My evenings will now suddenly feel rather hollow... what am I supposed to have my dessert with?

I like adventure genres and stick around for the unique character personalites, comedy,good pacing,standard consistent art. I think the story was taken from the perspective of the MC. All the characters are likable except for that Sena the prosecutor, she's so irritating I hate her since episode 1. I really like the main characters tho. The story can still branch so there's that. Ending 5/10. Voice actors did a good job (JP) I rarely watch dub. Good catchy OP and ED.Not my genre of music so will pass on the ost. It's a goodstress reliever anime tho viewers should also have that level of humor or a adventure-fantasy-comedy fan as well,or knowledge on rpg games etc relatable. Currently watching some episodes from hereon, hoping for season 3.",

Season 2 lets us get to know more of the characters, their skills and their lives.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nKazuma: Still the leader of the group, funny, wields a sword & can build and repair weapons and armors on the side. There are some cases where he can come off as a pervert.\r\nAqua: Water Goddess, powerful, likes to have fun and get turnt up, and sometimes can be selfish.\r\nMegumin: Powerful, magical witch wearing an eye patch, and can STILL only use one magic spell. Don't worry guys, she still loves explosions!\\n\r\nDarkness: (aka Lalatina Dustiness Ford) She's part of a noble family, and a very powerful fighter and mascohist. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I still really enjoy Konosuba. Since they are continuing from season 1, this season adds more to it. More characters, more in depth info of the plot and characters itself and more hilarious moments that you don't want to miss!",

            "content": "Having JUST finished by review for last season, I'll now gush about how much better this season is.\r\nStory: Again, nothing special beyond a better version of last season. 8/10\r\nCAUSE AND EFFECT BABY, EPISODIC SHOW CAN SUCK IT (blanket statement, I don't hate all episodic shows; there are quite a few I love, like Nichijou). The smallest of details that would maybe be a single joke in a less amazing show spirals into an entire arc. The 10 episodes that this show has fits the pace perfectly and allows the show to end at a satisfying time at a suitable pace for the type of showthis is. While the cause-and effect chain in season one was just a nice touch that made it stand out as having a proper flow. Here, though, it gets into logical flow OVERDRIVE. The last season's ending is not only referenced, but becomes an important and logical plot point. The last episode of last season sets up the entire show, and the structure of the story is really interesting when compared to other shows. I can't properly put it into words, which you probably realized when I used the same point twice. ANYWAY-\\n\\n\r\nArt: *JOJO REFERENCE* there are no flaws. It's actually perfect. 10.\\n\r\nThe animation is not only hilariously (and purposely) derpy, but absolutely stunning when the animator can justify is. Explosions have gotten better, other, new abilities are just amazing, and the artstyle/backgrounds are still beautiful. Nobody can say that the animation is bad without someone proving it wrong outright. As usual, the effects work is amazing, the explosion casting still being the highlight of that just because of how much better they've gotten. The OP and ED have BOTH gotten better, with the both being some of the best of the season. The ED's purpose is the same; to demonstrate that the town and the characters in it have their own lives, identities, and relationships with each other. It's just as heartwarming as last season's, if not more. The OP now demonstrates the characters and their dynamics more clearly and in a more hilarious fashion, show how every character has their own design and showing the characters that have the screentime to be given a personality, with even more details and subtleties on top of the obvious jokes. The new episode preview screens are also really funny, especially when we get to Yunyun.\\n\\n\r\nSound: VAs TURNING UP, BAYBEE 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDarkness' VA turns it up this season, probably helped by the fact that she gets more screentime than before. Kazuma's VA also adds some small little lines that really shows how much the VAs were having fun with their roles. Megumin and Aqua don't do more than before, mostly due to the fact that they were giving it their all from the beginning. Yunyun and Wiz are also great, along with the other named characters. The OP song isn't as bad as before, and is something that I might end up downloading, and the ED is as great as before, with Darkness' VA having a beautiful voice, showing up the other two who I also love. But the thing that's keeping the sound score down is the lack of memorable bgm. Again, The only song I can remember is the explosion theme. Even so, the music is not bad, and helps out the show a lot, along with the sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: YESYESYESYESYESYESORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA (10)\\n\\n\r\nDarkness gets much better in this season. She gets much more of the focus and has way more opportunities to be hilarious than before, while still not taking over too much time. The reoccurring side characters get more personality and times to shine with the new additions being fantastic as well. I con't really elaborate without stealing the surprise factor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: is this even a question?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you liked last season, you'll like this one more. If you didn't like last season, I think it's worth trying this one. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you liked this review, check out my others. If you have any advice regarding how I can improve my reviews, or just want to talk anime or something, contact me, assuming that's a feature MAL has. Hopefully, you watch and love this series (including season one, as implied by the word 'series') as much as I did. Have a nice day.",

            "content": "There's nothing particularly wrong with the premise, in fact i'm sure it appeals to more people than we would all expect, consisting of an average (as the Japanese would call it) \"NEET\" individual being transported into a fantasy/RPG style world where the protagonist needs to fulfill a pivotal role there. Not to go so far as to say the narrative is bad, but it is becoming tired. A host of titles bare this concept as its premise including, but not limited to RE:Zero, Zero no Tsukaima (and its sequels), Sodo Ato Onrain [SAO] (and its sequels), Overlord, Ixion Saga DT, Endride and to a lesserdegree Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, which all execute it with varying levels of success.\\n\\n\r\nHowever unlike Sodo Ato Onrain which focuses on pure nerdy childhood fantasy and takes itself somewhat too seriously, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku Wo! exists as a parody of just that. Just Like One Punch man is a meta parody for action anime and its tropes/clich\u00e9s made infamous by such titles as Dragon Ball Z, KSSnSw is a meta parody to the RPG fantasy getup made infamous via SAO and its predecessors like .hack//SIGN.\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest the animation art has a tendency to leave a lot to be desired, but in its own weird way it actually makes the show somewhat endearing and cheerful. Adding to the idea the show is not to be taken seriously, though i do wonder how the show would appeal if it had a contemporary standard of aesthetic. For this reason i'm not taking this criteria too much into consideration in my final scoring because it doesn't detract from the overall experience. It does its job, though it should also be said the background art is not noticeably lacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe support characters are complete jokes in the context of the show as a fantasy title due to their completely impractical abilities and sensibilities, they're all ludicrous and unhinged, but you're able to sympathise because their strengths are their weaknesses and their weaknesses are their strengths. Basically they're (mostly) human despite the fantastical setting. One of the characters is literally a goddess, but is largely useless except when it comes to clearing up a huge mess (usually caused by herself) thanks to her personality type and another has insanely strong magical abilities, but not the capacity to use it more than once a day, then there's their \"tank\" (RPG character class reference) character who has a fetish for pain despite being of noble class and the main character is not an archetypal hero, but more of an anti-hero that is perpetually stuck in their developmental stage, with his modern societal sensibilities contrasting with the fantasy world. He's likable and relatable because he's your every-man and his antics as such are believable.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the humour is concerned, it's mostly slapstick with references to RPG gaming, youth culture and typical fantasy lore, if you're a fan of any of that, then it adds to the appreciation of its content. It's very rare that a show will consistently have me laughing out loud, certainly multiple times an episode. It makes fun of our childhood fantasies. I'd even go so far as to say it's well written as some of the jokes really build up across several episodes in unpredictable ways. All in all the show is simply a pleasure to watch; but should come with a disclaimer that it may be more niche than your average anime due to the nature of the genre.",

Aqua is the goddess of water and honestly i dont mind her but the bitching and moaning can get old after awhile but i do like her character so yeah. Megumin so again im calling out Veronin he or she basically said that shes out of the anime like 90% of the time which isnt true otherwise Megumin is the clam and really chill type the only decent person who doesnt really have thing too them pre say also she kinda doe shave a bit of chunnibyo. Darkness is basically the perverted and werid one she basically likes getting told off also getting in things just too get turned on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: easily funny was hell i can understand that the characters jokes might get old after awhile but for me it was hella funny also that the characters were great like in last season \\n\\n\r\nOverall: giving this a 8 only reason it doesnt get a 9 from me is because episodes 7 and 8 werent really that good otherwise id so watch this anime funny as freaking hell",

            "content": "Ohayo everyone and thanks for reading my reviews.\r\nIt has been another season where our lovable and incompetent party wandered around in a RPG world, TROLL and GET TROLLED by many individuals. A pleasure  from my side watching all of their mishaps and accidents.\r\nIn this review, I may use one or two references from other sources and my opinions are, methinks, unusual so if it ticks off anybody, please have mercy! I'm just a weird dude anyway.\r\nOverview: \r\nKonosuba 2, well, certainly has own its own charm and drawbacks. Like season 1, it has a lot of jokes, puns, gags that make you laugh your assoff. The sound effect, notably voice acting and OP/ED, shines better than many other animes. I don't think you will be able to find a lot of shows that the voice acting actually delivers the content and materials with top notch quality like Konosuba. Aqua's cries, the scream of Darkness (for convenience, I'll call her Miss Lalatina :D) and Megumin EX-PRO-SON is always repeated but never felt out of touched. You can always enjoy these instances and naturally they have become character's traits. An \"A\" mark for the sound cast.\\n\\n\r\nNow we go to the show's rougher edge - the art. A lot of people say it is outright bad, many say the are OK, the rest likes it. I won't say who is right and who is wrong here, they have their own reasons but my opinion is a little bit of all - it's a hit and miss. The change of art style is most visible in the first half of seasons 2 (from ep1 all the way to Vanir's offer). The characters are definitely drawn differently in a couple of cases and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. For example, Kazuma's distorted face when he know he is being recorded, Darkness's overgrown and saggy air bags, they are a few times when it's kind of awkward looking at the characters. Yet, when Aqua is about to be trampled by runners her face is just priceless. In conclusion, I would say that probably it's best if the animators keep it like in season 1. If things don't break, don't change it. The change is less notable in the second half (from the trip to hot springs till the end of season) and I guess that may be the art style has come back to normal.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nA lot of people dislike Konosuba since it doesn't have a story. I can't argue with that since the anime dedicates most of it air time for jokes anyway. With that, how can you have a serious story with numerous plot twists??? I get the feelings that these guys are watching the wrong anime and if they are looking for story, probably Fate series would be much better. It would be good if the anime has a richer plot but i'm quite happy with what it is shown right now. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the character:\\n\\n\r\n- Aqua: a goddess of water who cannot afford a single pair of panties\\n\r\nYeah, she is a goddess of water with below average IQ. Due to her low intelligence (I'm sorry, I love you Aqua but I have to say the truth), she's always in debt and constantly causes troubles for herself and others. Of course, she wouldn't know how to solve it herself. That leaves her in a sobbing state so comically that we just want to see her suffer more. Haiz!\\n\\n\r\n- Megumin: our little adorable demolitionist\\n\r\nOur crazy girl of the year. She blow shits up with style. She has the tendency to name things in a weird way that puts off others. She has a cat the loves boobs. Do you need more??\\n\\n\r\n- Lalatina Dustiness Ford: I don't know how you still are a virgin.\\n\r\nOur noble suffers from a severe case of persistent arousal disorder, and she enjoys it. When you think about it, what kind of personality that a tanker will have - of course it's masochism. They are getting hit and abuse all day, and they like it.\\n\\n\r\n- Kazuma: the one hiki to bind them all.\\n\r\nIn my eyes, leaving any of the above characters on their own and they will head straight into a disaster so you will need some sort of a mediator, a glue  kind of. In this case, you get it in a form of an average boy who is a wee-bit smarter than everyone else and definitely is having an affair with Lady Luck. He is lazy (all men are), greedy (come on, who doesn't love money) and a sneaky bastard who holds no chivalrous values at all (you can go talk to the wall if you're trying to tell me what is right and wrong). He has his unique way with women (mostly sexual harass and verbal abuse in comedic manner) and shows no qualm when exact his idea of \"gender equality\". Yet he won't take the reward if it's is because of them that troubles arise and ready to do everything to get matters done right. You just need to give him a BIG, BIG PUSH ><.\\n\\n\r\n*Side note: I don't know how but I see great resemblance between him and one iconic character from gaming industry. It's Geralt that I'm talking about. Yes, Kazuma is not mutated and nearly 100 years old but in term of personalities, they are like the younger and older version of each other. They both use sword (Geralts has two cutlass-like ones and Kazuma has one kodachi), possess basic magic for utility purpose (Geralt has signs and Kazuma has low level spells) and has god-blessed witty mouth. They kill monsters (not sure if kazuma is entirely happy with it though but in the end, he does). They are also level-headed when others go nuts and they both really into women.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nThis seasons, despite a few rough moments, still worth every minute of your time. Highly recommended and i'm looking forward to season 3.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2. This season was entertaining but, a bit less so than the original. Lets jump into why.\r\nThe story continues where we left of on the first season. We join Kazuma after defeating the destroyer. This time however the story takes a more slice of life approach to the story. In the first season nothing really happens to progress the goal of slaying the demon lord. However they made it entertaining by throwing trials at Kazuma that seems menial to RPG heroes. He has to build a party with worthless people, heneeds to get money in order to survive, etc. Even though this takes the whole show to wrap up, it felt like progress and was entertaining to watch. This season however there is no progress. Each event that happens has the same flair and theme as the first season but the only concession to progressing the story is in the beating of the demon Generals. Even these demon generals felt flat and uninteresting when compared to the dullahan from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great, cant complain at all. Great scenery and characters. The soundtrack was also good.\\n\\n\r\nThis season also dropped the ball on the character side of things as well. Sometimes the characters would suddenly change character or even worse, would be obnoxious in their unique traits. For example Darkness's Masochist side would be the entire punch line for an entire episode. This actually happened two or three of the 10 episodes. I loved all the characters before but this time it felt like they relied too heavily on these awesome quirks and it made the characters stale and boring. On the other hand they downplay some character traits like Kazuma's underhanded way of fighting, and replace his personality with a horny harem MC. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season because I enjoyed the first one so much. They made me love their characters and world and I was allowed to see them all again. However it felt a bit disappointing. It was like they opened a Konosuba theme park and though everything was technically correct it felt fake and empty. Look Kazuma is bullying the girls with some bit scummy logic, *hold up the laugh cue card*. Look darkness is being aroused by pain *hold up laugh and fan service cue card*.  I hope you see my point. That isn't to say that this season wasn't worth a watch, I still recommend this show to fantasy fans. I just wonder why so many good shows have a hard time making a decent follow up season.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Its the theme park Konosuba. Still worth a watch, but might be a bit disappointing to some.",

            "content": "Lemme say I was really excited when I heard the sequel to Konosuba was going to come out in Winter 2017. Season 1 only had 10 episodes and when it ended with a cliffhanger, it left me yearning for more. I was really hoping Konosuba would bring equal enjoyment or even better, surpass its first season. I sadly was wrong, this too ended in 10 episodes but it didn't leave me hyped for another season, no. It literally made me really disappointed and not even think about a season 3 coming. The comedy barely made me laugh compared to first season. I personally thought mostof the comedy in this sequel was forced (my opinion). I  noticed the slight art change but It didn't bothered me because It wasn't too major of a difference and Konosuba was still the same. I guess a couple things that were good about this sequel was more new characters I guess, and we got to know a bit more about everyone's favorite masochist crusader \"Darkness\".\\n\\n",

            "content": "The second season of the anime dropped dramatically in art quality and the storyline stagnated and didn't seem to advance at all. The facial expressions suffered a lot from the first to second season and it seems they didn't have any budget for art. The audio remained quite good with Megumins explosion always sounding great.\r\nThe second season takes itself way less serious than the first season which is saying something considering that the first season was not a very serious anime at all. I think the creators have lost sight of their vision for the show, with many episodes devolving into silly problems that thegroup cause and then fix themselves in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little they show of the villains is trivialized by them becoming best friends with the group after being defeated. I feel that season 2 was just produced as a quick cashgrab to take advantage of fans of the show and can be skipped as it is just filler for the most part.",
