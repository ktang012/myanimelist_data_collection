            "content": "\"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\" \r\nThis is the cornerstone expression that drives 91 Days. An expression that it lives and dies by, down to the very fabric of its being. One that we're quickly made aware of from the opening act that plants us into its world.\r\nThe arms of the clock tick in reverse, as we travel back to the days of the prohibition era. It's a cold night in April, and our young protagonist, Angelo Lagusa, enters frame. In the warm glow of his household, behind the thick wooden walls that push the harsh cold out, he's at ease with the comfortof his family filling in the spaces of his living quarters. Cushioned by a blanket of security, Angelo and his little brother, Luce, awaits their father's return, hiding away in anticipation for the moment he walks through the door. It's a brief hallmark moment, the siblings' father cheerfully calling out their names, waiting for a likely response to ring out from within the closet. But little does Angelo know, that everything he's known up to this point is about to come to an end with the sudden knock of a visitor at the door\u2014dun! dun! dun!\u2014... and so it begins. \\n\\n\r\nThree burly figures draped in thick trench coats steps inside. And just like that, the warm radiance that once filled the house is immediately sucked out. In its place, the thick stench of malice creeps in, seeping through the floorboards, suffocating the very air around them. Something is about to happen, and every beating heart in that room could feel it coming. Angelo's father lounges forward, blade in hand and his little brother bolts out the 2'x8' coffin to come to his parents' aid before Angelo could even react. Stifled by the linen hanging behind him and the fear of what he's witnessing in front, our young protagonist is left frozen to look on, powerless to take action against the chaos looming right outside his hiding space. Peaking through the wooden panels of the cramped closet, he bares witness to a sight that will forever haunt him. Bullets leave their chamber, the thunderous clap marking their departure, as they tear through the flesh of what he once called family.\\n\\n\r\nThis is it. This is the event. This is the anger that fuels him. This is the removal of normalcy. This is the motivation that keeps him going. This is the beginning of something sinister. This is the landmark moment that will forever pave his path with blood stains of burgundy and the sulfuric stench of gunpowder. \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" and Angelo is determined to deliver it, even at the cost of innocent bystanders that are oblivious to his vendetta. The cost of him ever living a normal life. And at the cost of what little shred of humanity was left during that cold winter night. When he goes through with this, there's no turning back. No one to turn to. No one to pray for his godforsaken soul. And so we depart with him, down the topsy-turvy course of trust and betrayal, with a hit list in hand and a determination that refuses to yield. He begins his journey; the first steps are taken, day one begins. \\n\\n\r\nBearing a similar tone and structure to projects done by movie heavyweights Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, 91 Days plays out like a love-child of these two worlds being brought together. This is immediately felt with the sultry musical backing, soft piano keys being carted off by bellowing brass instruments, stylistically cropped with titles cards and blood-curdling violin strings, as the camera slowly pans across the landscape. Traversing the fledgling stages of a city aiming to shoot their infrastructures towards the heavens, we're made aware of this place that's aptly named Lawless; a nesting ground for those trying to carve out a living for themselves, as well as the mafia families that make up the seedy underbelly of the booming alcohol smuggling trade. After laying low for seven years, Angelo makes his return to this city, reborn under the alias Avilio Bruno. Here he set the plans in motion for his revenge, enlisting the help of his childhood friend, Corteo, using his talents as a brewer to get closer to the crime syndicate that massacred his loved ones on that cold night in April.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as his plans begin to unfold, everyone is slowly entangled within it. A sprawled-out web that's inhabited by family feuds over the dominion of the city and pretexts made at a moments notice to insight altercations. A breeding ground for mutual partnerships and calculated backstabbing, with Avilio fanning the flames whenever he sees fit. These warring family factions include the Vanettis, Orcos, and Galassias. All of which participate in this codependent dance of charades that are set to the music of a zero-sum game. With lots of twists and turns scattered along the way, every chapter adds a new piece to the playing field. This, combined with the brisk, yet methodical pacing, made 91 Days a title that constantly had you wanting to see what would happen next. There were no guarantees on who will live or die, only the falsehood of plot armor that's immediately revoked when two opposing parties meet. \\n\\n\r\nThis became one of the show's greatest strengths; suspense backed up by tangible results. \\n\\n\r\nRevenge stories that slowly taper off as it pushes forward aren't uncommon. There have been many examples of this occurring across several storytelling mediums, with the usual morality message regarding the perpetual state of hate being the star attraction set on display. Thankfully, 91 Days isn't another statistic. It sets the stage early on and delivers on its promise from beginning to end. There aren't any trade-offs made to extend anyone's relevance, if they're ensnared in a situation that they can't walk away from unscathed, they receive their just desserts like everyone else. There are still explicit messages regarding the cost of revenge, as well as themes that come default with these scenarios, but the story doesn't bend at will to adhere to the warnings of it. Revenge isn't just worn as a shiny badge before flipping the script to see the apparent wrongs of the actions being taken, no, in 91 Days, revenge is carried out without compromise. And nowhere is that made more prominent than with the cutthroat mentality adopted by the main lead, Angelo \"Avilio\" Lagusa.\\n\\n\r\nIf Angelo were summed up with one word, it would be merciless. An empty shell that lives solely for his objective, Angelo knows nothing else, adjusting his life around the need to make his targets pay. He isn't just satisfied with merely killing them; he wants to crush everything that they stand for. Dismantling the very foundation of their family's name by orchestrating events that will see them tearing each other apart. He's determined to see his plans through to the end, becoming another cog in the machine without so much as flinching at the prospect if it benefits his cause. Step by step, he draws closer to his end goal, the phantom resemblance of a smile just below the surface as bodies begin to fall. It's an obsession that borders on madness. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's this same obsessive state that gives birth to paranoia among all camps of the conflict. Men hunched over in their local speakeasies, glancing over their shoulders in fear of other families taking them out. Restless faces marked off by bags under their eyes, dispatching hit men before someone else gets them first. And standing in the cross-hairs of this chaos is Nero Vanetti, a man deeply devoted to his Don and father, and the extended crime family, and unfortunately, another name on the checklist to be snuffed out. Where Angelo is driven to dismantle everything around him, Nero is committed to keeping it together, who, like Angelo, is obsessed with his cause, but instead of being duty-bound to some vendetta, he instead wants to maintain the integrity of his family's name. A task that proves nigh impossible with Angelo offering a handshake in comradeship, while the other hand carries a pistol erected in his direction. A give-and-take relationship where one man stumbles in the dark, oblivious to the others malicious intent. \\n\\n\r\nBut not everything in 91 Days compliments this gripping narrative. For one, the art direction and presentation often fell short of expected standards. Instead of becoming an animated series that could go toe-to-toe with the giants it patterns itself after, it only manages to measure up by the skin of its teeth. By no means should anyone approach this work expecting something on Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino's level. When I said, \"similar tone and structure\" that was the extent to which I think this anime achieves when pulling from its influences. At best, it's a slightly better rendition of the 3rd movie in the Godfather franchise, which admittedly isn't much of an accomplishment, but still, I'll give it credit for where credit is due. Regarding general scriptwriting, cinematography, and fully developed personalities, 91 Days remains an imitation of these great creator's works, but still a gripping imitation nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of eye-grabbing textures, unique shot compositions, color saturation, or other presentation nitpicks could be ignored if you're invested in the story. Although, some aspects might stick out far too often to turn a blind eye to. Such is the case with characters like Fango, who might have been an honest attempt at creating a sadomasochistic individual, but ended up resembling an off-brand Joker villain instead. Where every character involved aimed for an early Film-noir performance set in the 1920s, Fango came flying in like a man transported straight from the 1970s; complete with the general attire and appearance to boot. And as detracting as his antics were at times when placed in a setting not meant for him, after awhile, his role in the story meshed in more effectively. May have been too late by then, but at least the effort was there to course-correct the problem. There are also a few character dynamics that could have benefited with a bit more time dedicated to it, like Angelo's connection to his childhood friend Corteo, which felt too much like an afterthought at times, only there to get his foot in the door and serve as a catalyst for certain events to happen. With a bit more meat to their relationship, pivotal narrative moments could have become emotionally gripping ones as well. There's an excellent storyboard there, just not enough attention-to-detail in-between plot points make it moments with long shelf-lives in the collective conscious of the viewership. \\n\\n\r\nAnd despite this list of shortcomings, 91 Days remains a welcomed addition to its niche genre appeal, because when everything is said and done, the self-respect in which it carried itself made it far easier to forgive where it may have stumbled. We've had a fair share of mobster-inspired works before this, from the more character-centric ones like Gungrave and Gangsta to the rule-of-cool beat-em-ups of Darker than Black and Baccano, but there's never been a more faithful rendition of the traditional mafioso story in anime up to this point. Where those titles are riddled with supernatural occurrences that are dipped in the flourishings of the mobster lifestyle, 91 Days trades this in for a more grounded approach, containing characters that draw closer to real-world personalities than the more zany ones found in some of its contemporaries. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not have the energy of Baccano, the fully developed characters of Gungrave, the well-choreographed fights of Darker than Black, or Gangsta's\u2014... oh wait, Gangsta sucks. But what it does have is an appreciation for the classics that preceded it and the commitment needed to see its vision through.",

            "content": "No, it\u2019s not a show that spans for 91 episodes, a Baccano\u2019s second coming, or in fact anything like that at all. On paper, 91 Days is a revenge story, a show about a guy named Avilio Bruno (real name: Angelo Lagusa) who seeks vengeance against the Vanetti Family. Why? It\u2019s because they ruined his life many years ago when he was a child. His family was murdered (or more precisely, double crossed) by the mafia. This all happened during the Prohibition Era and it\u2019s hard to imagine at the time what Avilio was going through. Simply put, 91 Days strives to prove itself asa successful crime-drama thriller; one that hopes to make it memorable as for you as it can for itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs an original series, 91 Days isn\u2019t being held back by any adaptation hindrances or an established fan base. However, the show is hardly anything original either. Picture this. It\u2019s the Prohibition Era and mafia, gangs, and mobs rule the street. Liquor is like gold while the police force is anything but useful. Organized crime is almost everywhere you see and so common that it\u2019s practically accepted. At the top of the food chain are the mafia organizations that controls the system. The Vanetti Family is one such mafia that emerged as a powerful group led by a man named Don Vincento. He also got a son named Nero who he hopes will protect his family\u2019s treasure. Avilio is able to get involved in this family\u2019s affairs as a subordinate while others remain oblivious to the fact that he wants to destroy them from within. Sounds quite appealing right? It\u2019s almost sounds like a revamp of a gangster story from the 80s or something out of a James Bond movie. \\n\\n\r\nEven judging by the promotional poster itself, the show can feel intimidating. You literally got two guys standing on opposite ends of each other while pointing a gun with the intent to kill. They are Nero and Avilio. As a story about crime, revenge, and murder, there\u2019s also a lot that goes beyond that. 91 Days starts off by making its intentions pretty clear. Mafia really are like Gods in their world who plays by their own rules. Unfortunately, Avilio\u2019s family were killed and the laws never delivered justice for him. It\u2019s why he wants revenge. At the same time, Avilio is a clever man. He\u2019s been hiding himself for almost 7 years until the moment he has the chance. On surface, Avilio is someone that is hard to approach. He hides his emotions and not easily befriended.  His friendship with Nero is one of the most interesting dynamics in the series as they are very different. Nero is the one with the bright personality and also has full of pride for his family. We learn that Avilio lost his family already so there\u2019s not many people he can turn to besides his childhood friend Corteo. So in his head, we got Avilio who tries his best to carry out vengeance that being transformed from a sweet kid to this avenger. At the same time, Avilio\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t just revenge. He wants to bring pain and suffering to his enemies so death sometimes may not be enough to satisfy. Talk about intense feelings. Living in pain may feel even worse than death itself.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, cleverness alone isn\u2019t just what describes Avilio as a character. The people he wants dead are often planned out in his head like a chess game, where he anticipates the moves of his opponents. In this game, Avilio uses tricks until he catches his prey off guard and goes for the kill or make them suffer. It\u2019s like an assassination except Avilio does more than just carry out his mission. He wants the most out of them and even manages to get other people involved in such dangerous affairs when they weren\u2019t to be. Remember, this is a society where trust is an obscure word. People have to rely on themselves and family feuds are pretty evident. The most noticeable ones are between the Vanetti, Orco, and Galassia. In the meantime, the show makes some families look like hypocrites, especially with they celebrate events. In essence, there\u2019s really no sincere character coming from the families as they all seek to make themselves look good. One of the most noticeable characters in the show is Fango, someone that viewers will see as a psychopath. It\u2019s pretty evident that he has murderous tendencies and really doesn\u2019t care much about anyone but himself. The mind games you see he plays with others also makes him a manipulative individual as well. Perhaps Fango is a bit of extreme example but the point is that there\u2019s pretty much no character in the show with a pure heart.\\n\\n\r\nAmong all the antiheroes and crime, the story itself is pretty much a dark thriller. It\u2019s obvious already in the first few episodes so expect nothing less throughout the rest of the season. There is actually one breather episode that connects the friendship more between Avilio and Nero. However, most of the season is tainted with bloodshed, murder, and tragedy. Death is quite real and really, no one is safe. There may even be a few plot segments where you\u2019ll feel like experiencing the unexpected. Every episode builds on the overall story and characters more whether they are from extravagant revelations or small pieces by pieces. The show is about revenge but the characters in them are more than just chess pieces in a board game. Sure, each of the have their roles to fulfill but most of the character also has a purpose. In the meantime, the comedy of the series is portrayed more as dark humor. The violence is portrayed as real. The crimes are lawless.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, I was initially somewhat worried. The show is adapted by studio Shuka who is only known for their recent work, Durarara!! sequels. From a technical perspective, the show looks decent and portrays the dark thrilling mood quite well. The best parts about the show is the character emotions as we see how they show their feelings \u2013 hatred, sorrow, pity, regret. 91 Days portrays character expressions at their best when they are in conflict. The historical background settings of the Prohibition Era also has fine details although not as emphasized as the violence. Expect graphic violence especially during death scenes and murder. It\u2019s a dark story after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack makes sense in most respects with the eerie atmospheric setting. Even the OP and ED theme songs are haunting with a soft paced beat. Character voice mannerisms in the show is also a positive with Avilio being a believable character with his quest of revenge. However, my biggest impression of the character voice mannerism is Fango. His eccentric speeches, crazy personality, and psychopathic tone reflects exactly how 91 Days\u2019 society can be so unconstitutional. And his voice is pretty damn good at showing that.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a show that goes beyond the mafia wars, revenge story, and crime. Every now and then, we get a gangster story of violence. Some of them really is nothing more than pandering fans with fan service. Others really portray how dark humans can be while there\u2019s a society without laws. 91 Days is the type of series that show the darker side of humanity. I must say\u2026that is something to watch out for.\\n",

            "content": "During 91 Days I felt like watching the movies Godfather, Lawless, Donnie Brasco and Public Enemies all at the same time, with a complex but solid plot, suspense backed up by factual consequences that keep you on the edge of your seat and solid characters that live up to the expectations combined with genuine mafia tactics and actions resulted in a good watching experience that felt like a breath of fresh air because 91 Days was different from other shows, it avoided being generic or cliched. \r\nThe story takes place in the prohibition times and it is about a young boy named Angelo who hadhis family murdered by mafiosos right before his very eyes, leaving Angelo with no reason to live other than seeking revenge for the family he lost. \\n\r\nWhat appeared to be a generic \u201crevenge\u201d scenario turned out to be a complex but believable look into the workings of the mafia, filled with suspense, thrilling moments, betrayals and plot twists.\\n\r\nThe veritable mafia manner of doing things such as making \u201clasagna\u201d out of an adversary, ordering hits on family members, different mob families battling over territory, family members double crossing and betraying each other and the paranoia created by that were great additions to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does have some flaws regarding its execution and methodical pacing but I am too lazy to get into details. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters come in great numbers but few of them get proper characterization or development, most of them being one-dimensional and some of them even coming off as cartoon-ish characters (Ex: Fango).\\n\\n\r\nAngelo (the protagonist) is an empty shell of a man that lives only to obtain his revenge against the people who murdered his family. He is patient, clever, level headed and merciless not being satisfied with just killing his targets but wanting to destroy his targets and everything they wish, care and stand for. \\n\r\nAt one point Angelo kills his childhood friend, the friend he considers family, in order to avenge the family he once lost. Angelo erased what family he had left just to achieve a distant goal, that goes to show how damaged and obsessed to the point of madness Angelo really was.\\n\r\nAngelo is determined to see his plans through to the end no matter the consequences, with each kill he draws closer to his final goal thinking once that goal is achieved he would be free and given a reason to live. \\n\\n\r\nNero is one of the people who murdered Angelo\u2019s family and one of the man Angelo seeks to destroy. Nero is a man deeply devoted to upholding the crime family\u2019s integrity, name and pride. While Angelo seeks to destroy and crush that family, Nero seeks to keep that crime family together, thus making them opposite forces. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the two main characters, after Nero\u2019s family is killed according to Angelo\u2019s plan, they are both able to understand each other on a deeper level. \\n\r\nEven though they both hate each other, they also understand and sympathize with each other. Nero was the only person that Angelo did not want to kill, as he said in the end \u201cIt is because I didn\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d \\n\r\nThey both needed what only the other could offer, for Angelo it was salvation through death and for Nero it was redemption and forgiveness for his crimes.\\n\\n\r\nI did not pay much attention to the aesthetics since the plot is very interesting.\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good but nothing special although it is fluid, the character design and overall art is good although it lacks dynamic and that \u201cnice\u201d color saturation.\\n\\n\r\nDecent opening/ending themes and little background music, I personally did not miss it nor wish for more.\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this series, it felt like a breath of fresh air in a world polluted by cliched and generic shows. Even with its flaws, 91 Days was absolutely worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nSince some viewers seem to not understand the ending, here is a short explanation:\\n\\n\r\nAngelo tells Nero to drive to the ocean, they both know what will happen there, it is a matter of \u201cwhere\u201d rather than \u201cif\u201d or \u201cwhen\u201d. Once they arrive to the ocean, they start walking along the beach, Angelo showing his sympathy towards Nero, confessing he grew to like Nero and did not want to kill him. As Angelo walks in front, Nero pulls a gun and after hesitating, he pulls the trigger and kills Angelo, not because he wanted to but because Angelo needed to be freed (as shown a few minutes earlier when Angelo said \u201cYou should have killed me 7 years ago\u201d). On the car ride away from the beach, Nero looks down and smiles at a can of pineapples sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, reminiscing about the time when Angelo bought all those pineapples on their first trip together. The ending scene shows the footprints in the beach sand being washed away by waves, suggesting closure, like turning a new page.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a show that goes beyond the revenge story, showing mafia wars and the darker side of men. I highly recommend watching this show.",

            "content": "The brisk night air whispers across your face, gently stringing hairs in front of your eyes. Stars are barely visible above through the thicket of bare winter trees and your body aching and languid from the effects of tracking in the cold. Your target is about 100 yards away, the dim glow of their headlights is the one thing keeping you on the trail. Tonight is the night justice will be dealt, the night a culmination of seven long years of anticipation will finally come to a head. They don't deserve to live after what was done to your family that horrific night. \r\nSuddenly thecar begins to slow to a halt. The final destination has been reached. Still crouching you strafe to the side of the vehicle, your numb hand clutched on your pistol's grip like a precious keepsake. Your heartbeat escalates as the door of the caravan creaks open. Your target emerges, dressed to the nine and grinning confidently. You hesitate to pull out the gun, hands trembling. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is it so hard to finish the job? \\n\\n\r\nYou've killed countless times to get to this point. Everything has been assimilated into the single, perfect moment of revenge. You slowly raise the gun up, shaking and unable to steady your aim. Your eyes cloud as warm, fresh tears begin to stream down your icy face. You can't do it.\\n\\n\r\nIs this really happening?\\n\\n\r\nFrustrated, you holster your gun and creep back into the shadows of the dark woods and recollect yourself. The target proceeds to his destination leaving you with an unfulfilled mission. \\n\\n\r\nShows like 91 Days always put you in the moment, make your chest pound and your pulse quicken. They seek to place you in the character's heads and are often atmospheric. The tension and scenery is almost palpable to me, flooding my head with inspiration to write. I love the mafia and suspense genres.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is an anime that immediately had me intrigued based on its mafia setting. It's a genre that always seems to have me on the edge of my seat with excitement as in Gungrave or Baccano, and unfortunately one that doesn't get as much proper attention anymore. Sure, watching \"Americans\" in Illinois speak Japanese to members of an Italian mafia can sound confusing, but these gripes are easily overlooked as the series builds with suspense. This anime is a classic story of revenge where a grieving son seeks to exact vengeance against the mafiosos who killed his family several years back. This original work sucks the viewer in with its compelling premise and doesn't let go, often leaving us with a heart-pounding cliffhanger or unanswered conflict at the conclusion of each episode. It has plenty of flaws but still manages to hit the mark for overall enjoyment with its great pacing and episode structure. Minor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my biggest complaint with this series is the amount of predictability within its writing. The stereotypical depiction of most mafia characters is laden with selfishness and greed, with the old adage \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" playing a key role in character relationships. 91 Days doesn't stray far from the path here. Many characters seek power and wealth over all things, ultimately leading to their demise. This element only deters the viewers from being able to identify with the characters within the story because they'll often come across as mostly single-faceted. Those few characters with alternative motives tend to fair better from a survival standpoint as the series chugs on. Those who connect to neither Avillo or Nero will find themselves scrambling to identify with someone, anyone in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this predictability also exists in the plot of 91 Days as well. We can almost predict the progression to a tee:\\n\\n\r\n-Guy is mad and wants revenge.\\n\r\n-Guy joins ranks and befriends future target\\n\r\n-Guy has a hard time killing target because of their new relationship.\\n\r\n-Lots of people die due to betrayal, greed and desperation along the way.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't necessarily rocket science but the main question to ask yourself is if you feel cheated because of that. The only real element of mystery here was who wrote the letter that told Avillo the identities of his family's killers? (Which, you probably forgot about after the first episode anyway). I guess I can't get too upset about it, it's always nice now and then to sit back and just enjoy an anime without being intellectually challenged the entire time. Sometimes in these mafia style shows, the family associations can be a bit discombobulated, and alas, it's no different here. A predictable plot here is a slight hindrance, but didn't necessarily change my overall opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI can easily compare 91 Days to Gungrave on a few different levels. First is the narrative of revenge. Sure, they aren't exactly for the same reason, but they both capitalize on this idea. The setting is slightly different, with Gungrave taking place in a semi-futuristic present, while 91 Days exists within an older America. I personally feel that Gungrave ultimately takes the cake based on animation, atmosphere and plot twists, but the latter has some highlights of its own. The one big flaw when comparing the two was the lack of satisfaction I felt at the end of 91 Days. It just kind of... Happened. Gungrave had great closure, and kind of made me smile at the end. 91 Days just felt a tad stale.\\n\\n\r\nWith the bad, there is also plenty of good to speak of in 91 Days. The cliffhangers were for the most part well placed, and I always felt a sense of tension in certain scenes, adding to the show's overall atmosphere. The episodes are well paced, and I never felt like certain scenes were being too rushed. I also have to give kudos to relatively new studio Shuka or tackling the often insurmountable task of animating an entirely original series. The lack of source material at least quells the incessant whining of manga purists. This also gave them the freedom to do what they wanted, and I think they handled it quite well for being such a rookie studio. The existence of Prohibition set up some interesting plot devices and discussion of politics within the series, making it feel more like I just dropped into this world. I appreciate writers that take the time of day to jam little nuances like this into their work. Overall, I ended up getting caught in the whirlwind and hype behind the show, which may have caused me to appreciate it more, but it was still highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nMost gangster or mafia shows have the luxury of crafting some of the most polarizing characters we've ever come across in entertainment. I thought Nero was very believable and justified in his personality and actions. He valued family above all else, even though they often aimed to undermine him. Charismatic yet firm in his demeanor, he contrasted Avillo's solemn aura quite well and I felt their chemistry was rather downplayed by most. I wasn't too keen on Avillo as an MC since  the only chance for the audience to relate to him is strictly out of emotional revenge. He doesn't necessarily exude many traits the rest of us have. Fango started off as a very enjoyable character. Sadistic and impulsive as all hell, he really served to make things interesting. However, just like most characters exhibiting these traits, his presence grew stale over time. None of the other characters really mattered to me since most of them got the axe at some point, but they all exist to propel the story forward and reinforce the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nI have some major issues with the animation. At times it can be downright ugly and inconsistent. There's a specific scene I remember from early on in the series during a fight with Fango that a few clips existed that made him look basically distorted. In today's world, there's no excuse for the lack of editing here. Other times, the art felt very on point and helped to mold the serious tone of the show. With mafia shows it can be hard to distinguish certain family members from others, something 91 Days did quite well. It was also exciting to see TK drop another powerful track, as the OP for the series has been on my playlist ever since I heard it. The song is really something. Voice acting is also well done and reminds me of some other similar shows. Looks like they may all have some shared actors :D\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a quality anime with a gripping plot line, guaranteeing to keep you engaged throughout its 12 episodes. Sure, it has issues and the end is lackluster but still left that taste of satisfaction on the lips after the final credits rolled. I'd highly recommend this series to those of you who've enjoyed things like Gungrave, Hitman Reborn, Phantom Requiem or shows with a similar premise. It'll definitely scratch that figurative mafia itch some of us seem to have. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my summer 16 reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-4\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall-7.1",

            "content": "91 Days is a good choice for you if you enjoy a revenge story where a character exploits other people's self interest and/or schemes them in order to achieve his revenge. 91 Days becomes a bad choice once you start expecting anything other than onedimensional characters, and also if you hate main characters that are displayed in a way that makes them feel flawless without giving them any personality traits, especially negative.\r\nYou see, what ruined this series for me was the characters. Most of the characters are presented as onedimensional, with each being from x side or the y side or the z side. Ifthey're particularly important characters, they will have a trait or aspiration which will rule their personality without giving them any further complexity, like friendship, family, power, greedyness, psychopathy, etc. Each character will operate under one role and that role only and they won't have any sort of trait that would give them a more complex and more human personality. Thus they feel very onedimensional and they were hard to feel any attachment to, because you constantly knew which is their one and only priority. The two characters the series treats as the main characters are pretty much the only two people that feel like more or less people, because they do things that occasionally clash with their goals, but I didn't personally enjoy their portrayals. \\n\\n\r\nOne of said characters is the main character, Angelo, or Avilio as he's known by everyone other than a single person. Of the two I'll talk only about Avilio because the other character doesn't enough depth to live on its own. I didn't like Avilio's character. For the reason that he doesn't seem to have any flaws other than him being emotionally damaged and having no desire to live life outside of his revenge. But these are not used at all to impede his goal, so he's pretty much a Jesus character. Avilio manages to constantly scheme and use characters to his purpose, planning things just the right way through all adversity and always coming out unscathed 100% of the time pretty much because he's the main character who delivers his vengeance. There's not really any time where things seem to remotely go against him specifically. The group he is in may suffer. His \"friends\" might be in a disadvantageous situation. But as far as Avilio is concerned, he never seems to be at odds for the vast majority of the series, even in a situation where he's at a complete disadvantage. The one very good moment in the series, is when that actually finally happens, he finally is forced to do something he doesn't want to and has no other choice and can't create bullshit out of his ass. Which I can't talk about because it would be spoiled. Outside of that one moment he always seems to be the perfect man who's gonna reap vengeance and deliver his justice. Which isn't a good thing. The only thing flawed about him is his goal. Nothing else. As far as his actual personality goes, Avilio never displays enough emotions to engage his character from a viewer's perspective, merely showing short glimpses of very minor reactions that would build his character more as a person. Avilio is portrayed as a silent husk of a person, which makes him as engaging as a toenail, with the personality of the doorknob to boot. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna deny that the type of person Avilio is does deliver this series' point, but a good drama should have some way to make me care about its characters. And the main character is bland, and everyone else seemed even worse. For instance, in a setting where there's 3 big families from the mafia, other than power \"levels\", I can't tell you any thing that differentiates them from one or the other, except for their leading dons which are onedimensionally portrayed characters. And this is in a story where all of these families are relevant to the world and Avilio's goals, in a series where common traits might hint at things to exploit which would help Avilio. This is in a story where you should also empathize with another character that aspires to constantly help his family, with his family's only saving grace being... that they're related? I can't honestly find any side to root for, for neither a moral reason, or a reason based on ideals or anything of the sort. Everyone seems to be after the same thing, which is power and money. I'd classify henchmen that sacrifice for the family into the power category as well, because they might not be doing it to promote their own, they're doing it for the person who they're supporting. If the story is a drama, there's nothing that compels me to interact with the characters, because they feel too shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simply about revenge. But I can't be engaged in a story about revenge when I simply just don't care about the characters and simply see them as set pieces. Yes, there are one or two things that aren't purely minded towards that goal and it does present revenge in a negative light. The best moment of the series is when finally the main character has to do something he just simply would rather never do, which I've mentioned before. But otherwise, it's a story about a guy who lost his family killing those who wronged him. Which is a standard plotline. And any elements that could make it interesting, its setting, its characters, everything is not noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite everything I said, the story did have a theme that I felt it did get to go through. Due to its ending mostly and... that means I can only give you vague things to avoid spoilers and even then I can't guarantee there's nothing that is gonna give away how the series will end in this paragraph. So I advice you to just to skip this whole paragraph in order to avoid spoilers if you'd rather stay clean. The theme of the series is about living in the past. If you let your past define who you are today, once everything that kept you in the past is gone, you're a nobody. If that's what builds up your life, the only option left once all of that is gone is to move on. Power means nothing without the reason you've aspired to it. I know how vague all of this sounds, but I can't get into it any deeper. It's far bleaker and vague, however, this is the essence of it. Take it or leave it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, I wouldn't call this series an action series as much as I would call it revenge porn, with everyone falling in the front of the one and only God, Avilio. Most of the action is comprised of shootings but there's one or two more brutal moments, which I'll just leave unsaid since they bank on the shock factor to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artstyle, the series is mostly fine, but the overall color balance with cold colors and low saturation didn't really help make the world more vivid for me. I think the world is too bleak and makes the story too serious. Otherwise, I like the overall art, but for once I wish a series would be a little more colorful. In terms of sound, I found nothing noteworthy to be said, negative or positive.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days was a dissapointing experience for me. Because, it had very little going on for itself and it failed to make me care about its world, its characters and its events. While I think it did succeed in its theme, there's a lot of moments that just didn't help and seemed to serve  only simply as revengeporn. So ultimately, I think 91 Days can be a fun ride if you just wanna see how a character dismantles organizations in order to achieve the justice he thinks he deserves, and you just wanna see how he succesfully and consistently does it. Basically if you think the revenge porn aspect is the only thing that will carry you through. Because otherwise I can't really recommend it on any other factor, perhaps its theme, but I can't assure you that it will pay off for you. I think the series was ruined by character portrayal, and how nobody seemed to matter and have any value to the story. There were only a few people that really mattered and were focused on, and they aren't particularly engaging either, they're just there so that Avilio the doorknob wouldn't just boringly sit there and brood. The show lacked tension because the main character seemed to almost always achieve his goals, the show lacked engaging characters, because they were one dimensional, the show lacked drama, for the same aforementioned reason. It was lacking in a lot of ways, ways which make this anime hard to recommend. So if you think the said things would be roadblocks for you too, I suggest you avoid this. 91 Days is one of those series that I think are enjoyable only if they're exactly what you're looking for.",

A drama in a city. Heavily supported with character development. There are no unique stylistic on storytelling, it just goes. And the end of story (no spoilers here) forces you to face with the absurdity (as in Camus) of life and motivation and meaning of living (and you can sense this in the dialog between Nero and Angelo in camp in the ending episode).\r\n## Art\r\nArt is so unique. The show has specific color schemes and drawing has unique styles like details onface. Addition to color schemes, just saying there are no particular color schemes based on context. However, the choice of lighting in intense scenes overcomes this.\\n\\n\r\n## Sound\\n\r\nOpening band is Sigure, same band in first season of Psychopass. I somehow like their style of vocals. Opening is good, ending is also good (and needs a goddamn lyrics video btw). OST's are okay.\\n\\n\r\n## Character and Character Development\\n\r\nCD is very great in this show. When I say \"CD is good/great\", I mean that characters have their own limits based on their personality. And in this show, only handicap is Angelo's decision on Nero, but it had a reason (you will see in the end).\\n\\n\r\n## Enjoyment\\n\r\nYou will enjoy every moment.\\n\\n\r\n## Finally\\n\r\nYeah, very good.",

            "content": "Okay, I never expected it to be good but it surely exceeded my expectations, usually i find genres involving mafia, guns, gangsters.. etc. to be just pure action and fireworks anime, which for me is kinda dull and overused, maybe that's the reason i wasn't really looking forward for this one, but it convinced me by around the sixth or seventh episode, i guess what made it different from black lagoon or any similar anime from the same genre, is the intense execution of the story, the goal of the story, which was actually being carried out throughout the whole series, it never diverted, usuallystories related to revenge, vengeance, specially in recent years, you see an exciting plot and a potentially good series but things get ruined halfway because most of them divert, or just totally try to distract the viewers, sometimes it makes me feel like the existing plot's main purpose was to attract viewers without actually going along with it fully, there are many anime ive seen that revolve about the idea of vengeance but i can't remember seeing one that went through with it to the very end, well this is a one thing, other trait that made it stand out between all the similar shows from the same genre was the genuine drama and the real tragic atmosphere that many recent works lacked, gangsta being the newest one. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nthe story doesn't attract people who've been disappointed before with something similar, but once you actually see it everything changes, but that gives it a good old 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: great set of characters, very unique indeed, realism was kinda lacking not noticeably if i say so myself, the variety of characters that stood out in a short amount of time was something worth complimenting, i felt very close to the two main characters and i felt the all around intensity of their relationship, i know it sounds corny but i think i connected very well with everyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI've seen few fantastic works this summer but this one was definitely the most enjoyable, without a doubt, it had pretty much everything an anime from its genre should produce, Dark atmosphere, actual genuine drama, and a good story with a great execution, absolutely no attempts in tricking at any way. I just loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nan 8 for me isn't a big deal but not always actually, i have grades for \"9\" and its actually the most charming grade i could give to a show, it expresses many emotions between bewilderment to honor, i give 8 in an attempt of doing my list justice, \"8\" is the savior and the most graceful grade, it symbolizes the great and the less great, when its too good for a 7 or a bit deficient for a solid 9, thats when an \"8\" comes in.",

            "content": "(It's 2AM and this is my first anime review. Bear with me.)\r\nTHE SHORT OF IT:\r\nLet me say this straight. 91 Days is an anime you should watch for the thrill of it---ignore the animation quality slips that newborn-studio Shuka is still outgrowing. This is a highly story-driven, character-development heavy show with a very twisted but still realistic plot that likes to seduce you into thinking you got her all figured out. 91 Days is quite the summery masterpiece, although with (jarring) flaws; and it is the gritty mafia, Prohibition era revenge anime you want.\r\nFair warning, however. There will be blood, but the murder-happy beware! Thisisn't Re:Zero or Hamlet!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (rounded up 8.5) - Technically I've placed 91 Days as 10 on my list although here it's 8.5. That's because I'm being more critical here for the sake of review. I'm a writer who's always looking for a good story and 91 Days delivers a freaking great story with just enough meat for people to analyse or to just enjoy. However Shuka's growing pains are still, well, pains.\\n\\n\r\nRATING EXPLANATIONS:\\n\r\nSTORY (10) - I sat with excited anticipation for every episode, my emotions shifting wildly like Angelo drives his car (you'll get what I mean if you watch). Like I said, it's one to watch for the brilliant, bloody plot.\\n\\n\r\nART (6) - I love Shuka like I love my phone. It's fast and fluid and wonderful when you first get it and the unboxing experience is heart-pumping. But like a phone, the more you store in it, the slower and clunkier it gets... But it still runs like a charm sometimes! And that is baby Shuka as they pour everything into the story. Question is: do you accept that your phone is dying? Or do you replace it?\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9) - The OP and ED are cinematic and touch up 91 Days like sprinkles on ice cream. The OP acts like 2 minutes for you to gird ye loins. The ED is the first few seconds after the rollercoaster comes to an end, as you figure out how to walk again. The OST was great, but as a story-junkie, I lost track of it at times. But when they really want you to listen, oh my do you really listen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10) - Amazing. Actual writer goals. Shuka's writers for 91 Days are brilliant at character development---whether it's over 1 episode or over the whole series. Realistic, dirty, crazy, family-loving, friendship-bound: each named character is multi-layered. Just as they should be.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9) - Originally a 10, then I wrote the explanation for the Art rating. As I've said, it's a thrill to watch. The episodes all seemed too short. They left you wanting for more story, more of these characters, more of this world and situation! If you can forgive Shuka for the animation, the joy is grand.\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Ratings: Character Design - 10 ; Directing/Cinematography - 8 ; CGI - 8 ; Pacing within Episodes - 10 ; Pacing Overall - 9 ; Seiyuu - 10",

            "content": "\"Why is the pineapple can there?!\"\r\nAnyway the show is good. It's definitely for you guys who like mafia stories with Japanese characterization. The art is okay at close-ups but really sucks at portraying landscapes. I dig opening song but that's just about it.\r\nIt's an anime that you'd have fun more if you follow the week's progression instead of actually binge it, but nonetheless it's still a good anime.\r\nThe storytelling can be jumbled up sometimes. Mafia movies always related to how many characters they try to introduce, but in the end, only some of them can stand out, and in this case, Avilio/Angelo and Nero areboth in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the episodes you will see Angelo's attempt at revenging his family death, the Lagusas, that he knew was done by Vanneti family. The story revolves around internal conflict and mafia politics as usual, yet they all seemingly not the main point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe true point of the story relies on how Angelo acts as a character. The wounded character shows his sleek plan towards 12 episodes only to see what his revenge actually does to him at the finale. I must tell you, it's something quite shocking yet to be expected in this kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: I hate Vango for some reason, mainly because I think he doesn't deserve to be in this universe. Shows like Baccano should've done him more justice.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Seven years ago, a dispute within the mafia lead to the violent murder of the Lagusa family save for their youngest son who escapes into the night. Years later, hollow and lusting for revenge against the Vanetti Family, young Angelo Lagusa (Kondou Takashi) is offered an opportunity to fulfill his ambitions when he receives a mysterious letter detailing the family members involved that night. Returning to Lawless, a town steeped in the black market liquor sales of the prohibition, Angelo takes up the name Avilio Bruno and befriends Nero (Eguchi Takuya), the eldest son of donVincent Vanetti as he takes the first steps towards exacting his terrible revenge.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nBeing the organized crime drama that it is, 91 Days hosts a fairly substantial cast of characters in order to really flesh out the mafia dynamic of each of the families and provide a genuine feel to the cast. And that\u2019s what most stands out about the characters of 91 Days, their authenticity. The show focuses heavily upon Angelo and his relationship with his close friend Corteo as well as Nero as they each subtly develop as the narrative progresses. While the supporting cast isn\u2019t given this same kind of attention, the number of named characters, of family allegiances, and minute character details brings them to life. None of these people are good or evil \u2013 they all operate based on circumstance, because of their past, the family, and their future. They might not all stand out distinctly in the long run, however the atmosphere they provide and the legitimacy of their portrayal is striking and adds immensely to the story.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk briefly about Angelo, he\u2019s a husk of a person. He lost everything when the Vanettis killed his family and ever since has fostered a deep-seated hatred for them that drives his revenge. He isn\u2019t all that diverse of a character as he keeps his emotions quite muted and though the show at times eludes to his underlying feelings or humor he mostly conducts himself in a stiff and methodical manner. This isn\u2019t somebody who has been driven mad by his hate but rather someone who feels they have nothing left to live for, who desperately latches onto this chance of retribution in order to give their life meaning again.\\n\\n\r\nAngelo\u2019s humanity, whether he fully throws himself into his vengeance or finds a new way to live again, is what is held in contention throughout the show \u2013 at times wavering and solidifying with each dramatic movement. To Angelo, his very existence is pain. His cleverness makes him interesting to watch as well and the way in which he goes about manipulating others and steadily carrying out his plans paints an engaging story even early on in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNero is an interesting character as well. As the eldest son of the Vanetti Family, he embodies the mafioso ideals of family above all else. The Vanetti\u2019s continued existence and image mean everything to him. His relationship with Angelo, known as Avilio to him, influences both characters a good deal and is one of the major cruxes of the show. In the same way that the supporting cast doubles and triples down on their excellent portrayal of the 1930\u2019s mobster atmosphere, Nero breathes life into the narrative through his strong sense of family and responsibility.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps more than anything else, 91 Days is a show about presentation. The setting, the character designs, the color palette all ooze that iconic mafioso charisma and panache. The most outstanding visual quality of the show is its directing which features great shot composition, a film-esque sense of perspective, and great subtext which feeds into the show\u2019s foreshadowing and complicated appeal. Homages to other famous gangster films as well as The Godfather were also included, emphasizing the passion and vision behind the show\u2019s visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has a lot of emotive movement which further emphasizes the authenticity of the cast however the character designs can admittedly look off-model at times and low quality. Small details such as attention to gun handling and reloading bring everything together atmospherically in a believable and immersive way. The various backgrounds and scenery of the show look fantastic and while they are delivered in a slightly different style, their subdued colors and earthy tones fit the setting incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off to a thrilling beginning, opening on the appropriately brutal murder of the Lagusa family and young Angelo\u2019s escape from the residence. It was a strong hook into the show, starting off with the flashback to 7 years ago and ending with a bootleg deal gone wrong while establishing the setting and various mafia names and interests. From the get-go, 91 Days makes it clear what kind of show its going to be \u2013 a bloody period piece delivered in a muted aesthetic with a western-style dramatic narrative. It follows up on this over the rest of the show substantially well, launching right into Angelo\u2019s revenge plot very early on and featuring tons of world-building details such as family politics and territory disputes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not all that thematically complicated, the show\u2019s use of foreshadowing and imagery is put to good use and underscores its presentation-centrique style. 91 Days is slow and methodical in how it unfolds, placing a lot of its appeal in its grounded atmosphere and stylish cinematography. It\u2019s not so much thrilling as it is tense and high-strung, slowly building to a grand finale at the end of the show but for the most part avoiding doing so on a scene by scene basis. This generally will mean that 91 Days will expect a bit of patience out of its viewers and might seem to drag on or loose focus for those that aren\u2019t as invested. While it\u2019s slow to unfold, the show lives for its big, payoff moments which happen frequently enough. These are big developments in the plot and sometimes quite interesting twists in the story which keep things entirely engaging as the show builds towards its ultimate conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the show was great. In more lighthearted times it was jazzy and upbeat but once the drama and intrigue set in it was able to match the tonal shift. This is what I feel the soundtrack did best. While its tracks weren\u2019t individually memorable, the music\u2019s ability to match the show\u2019s different modes and accentuate the story at each turn was impressive. As the narrative sat brooding, as it climbed, and as it climaxed, the music was there at each stage emphasizing the scenes exceptionally well, especially towards the end.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\n91 Days was thrilling and dramatic and absolutely overflowing with style. While it wasn\u2019t as engaging at every step of the show as it was at its peaks, those big, dramatic moments that strung everything together were highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave 91 Days an 8 because of how each of its elements, its characters, its story, and visuals, all fed into one grand, immersive presentation. While the characterization of the cast was kind of subdued, they were a good deal of fun regardless of this. The show had a handful of unexpected twists and a great ending which tied together its most decisive elements.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nI think because of how heavily the show relies on its sense of style and subject matter, that those viewers who know they enjoy the kind of gangster, mafia stories will undoubtedly enjoy the show more than others. That isn\u2019t to say it can only be enjoyed by those people as I myself don\u2019t have a history with those films or shows but it certainly lends itself better to some audiences. It\u2019s got a lot of great drama and should entertain anybody looking for a solid revenge story.",

            "content": "Very few anime these days tend to do something different from the norm, and when something does do so, it\u2019s very easy for it to fail. But even if they are failures, their ambition to do something different is respectable. 91 Days is not only a unique anime, but a good one too. It\u2019s fairly rare to find a series that takes place in a western setting with mafia characters taking place during the post-WWI era. 91 Days takes that setting and adds a story of revenge to it, and it\u2019s a story that is handled great and executed well. 91 Days manages to bea thrilling and stylish mafia story from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Angelo Lagusa, who\u2019s family died in a mafia dispute, is now hungry for revenge and is willing to destroy the Vanetti family, the ones who killed his family. Changing his name as Avilio, he becomes the Vanetti don\u2019s son\u2019s right hand man, only to break the family from the inside. Overall, the story is handled pretty well and a lot of sub-plots get introduced along the way. The series not only focuses on Avilio\u2019s revenge, but also focuses on the Vanetti\u2019s relationship with each other and other competing families. The main story about revenge gets put in the background during the second third of the series, but the series still manages to entertain with its subplots. But it\u2019s the last third when the main story comes back, and that\u2019s when the series reaches its heights. The ending might be a mixed bag for some, but I appreciate how it was executed and it\u2019s the type of conclusion I wanted from this series. However, if more of the main plot was present in the series, the series as a whole would\u2019ve been more enjoyable.\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen the key visuals, watched the PV and read the synopsis, it should be well apparent that the series is a very unique one and it\u2019s hard to find something like this. The anime takes place during the prohibition era and the series does a good job in depicting that setting. Characters act and behave how they should be in that era, and buildings and clothing match the setting. The tone of the series is mostly dark and gloomy and it consistently stays like that for the rest of the series. Humor is quite rare, but there are some slightly funny comments made by certain characters, but overall, the series still retains its serious tone. The pacing is a generally speaking alright, but it is a little inconsistent. Things slow down a little in favor for more building and more development for its subplots, but the pacing picks up in the final third, however things do appear to be a bit rushed. But overall, 91 Days does a good job with their setting and tone. \\n\r\nPresentation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters in 91 Days are really good, unique, and well handled. Our protagonist, Angelo Lagusa (or his alias Avilio Bruno) is a really well-handled character who\u2019s thirsty for vengeance. His goal and believable and understandable, even if what he does isn\u2019t always the good choice. He has flawed characteristics that make him a complex character with immoral, yet not incorrect, goals. Our other main character is Nero Vanetti, who is the son of the Vanetti\u2019s don and Avilio is his right hand man. He has a cheerful personality, but he gets serious when he needs to be. He is a really good character and is used well in the story. His and Avilio\u2019s relationship is showcased well and he becomes more complex in the second half. The series features a lot of other characters that are likable or well handled, like Corteo and Fango. Some of the supporting characters were a slight bit weak, but overall it was alright. Just remember: Fango makes the best lasagna\u2026\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe studio of 91 Days, Shuka, doesn\u2019t have the best reputation when it comes to their consistency in art quality. As seen in their previously made Durarara!!x2 series, the series had plenty dips in its quality. However Shuka, for the most part, keeps the art quality in 91 Days consistent and pretty. First of all, the character designs are really well done. All character designs match their setting and personality. I liked the fact that Avilio had a simplistic look to him, despite being the protagonist. The setting looks great and the buidlings are matching its time period. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed and its bleaker color palette works nice and complements the tone of the series. The character detailing is alright and lighting is really good. Overall, the art quality manages to stay consistent most of the time and so far is Shuka\u2019s best looking series.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nJust like their art quality, Shuka is also well known for their animation quality drops. However, 91 Days is an exception as the animation quality also manages to be just as consistent as its art quality. For the most part, the series is animated fluidly and there\u2019s no noticeable animation quality drops. 91 Days isn\u2019t that action-heavy, so there\u2019s not many moments where Shuka needs to put extra effort in. But when action is present, especially gunfights, the animations stays consistent and looks really good. The backgrounds are pretty well animated and the lighting is put into good use in the series too.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast also does a really good job in representing their characters and adding more to the atmosphere of the series. Kondou Takashi did a great job as Avilio as he was able to showcase his character\u2019s vengeance and hostility, while making his character have subtle expressions. Eguchi Takuya, who is one of my favorite seiyuu, did a great job as Nero and got his cheerful attitude perfectly well. He does a really good job during his character\u2019s serious moments too. The supporting cast is also made up of pretty talented seiyuu like Sakurai Takahiro, Ono Daisuke, Nakamura Yuuichi and many others, and they all do a very good job. Overall, the cast does a great job in depicting their characters, especially the two main characters.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in 91 Days is also really good and elevates this series. The OP, \u201cSignal\u2019, is done by the same person who did that extremely popular Tokyo Ghoul OP, and he did a very good job with the OP for 91 Days. It\u2019s almost on par with \u201cUnravel\u201d and it\u2019s better than the Psycho-Pass OPs. The vocals are top notch as expected from him, but the music is good too. The ED, \u201cRain or Shine\u201d, doesn\u2019t have much lyrics to it, but it really matched the series, plus the vocals are really good. The background music in 91 Days is pretty good and matches the context of the series. It has more of a western and 20-30\u2019s feel to it, and it matches the atmosphere of the series well and makes scenes have more impact. \\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI had high expectations for 91 Days as I like anime with a westernized feel to it, and when I found out that it\u2019s a revenge story that takes place in the prohibition era, focusing on mafia characters, I couldn\u2019t hold my excitement. After feeling slightly underwhelmed from Joker Game, I thought that 91 Days can be the next Baccano for me. Luckily, 91 Days didn\u2019t disappoint as I found it almost as enjoyable as Baccano. The main story was really intriguing and I really liked the characters and setting. And the final third of the series was really intense and was a satisfying payoff for a series like this. Though the pacing wasn\u2019t the most consistent and some of the sub-plots weren\u2019t as exciting as the main story, overall I got a lot out of 91 Days.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, 91 Days manages to live up to its potential and it is just what you would want from this series. Revenge stories aren\u2019t quite common in anime, especially ones that take place in the post-WWI era, so seeing an anime like this was a fresh breath of air. Though the series isn\u2019t perfect, especially with its pacing, but the series manages to be an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. The final third of the series in particular is amazing and all the buildup leading to it payed off well. Avilio manages to be one of the best protagonist of the series and his motives are complex and his hunger for vengeance was well depicted. 91 Days is easily one of the best series of the season and you\u2019re missing out if you\u2019re skipping this one. \\n\\n\r\n+ It handles it\u2019s prohibition era and mafia setting perfectly well.\\n\r\n+ The main story, focusing on Avilio\u2019s revenge, was really well done and is really satisfying. \\n\r\n+ Amazing final third as all buildup pays off well and things get really intense \\n\r\n+ Both Avilio and Nero are well handled characters with contrasting personalities. \\n\r\n- Pacing remains inconsistent things start to slow down in its second third, and the conclusion is slightly rushed.\\n\r\n- Some of the sub-plots are slightly underwhelming, especially compared to its main story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "91 Days is a pointless revenge story which leaves an aftermath of pointless deaths in the end. I love it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis is basically the story of Angelo plotting his revenge against the local mafia family for killing his parents and brother. He takes up a false name and infiltrates the family in order to bring his revenge to fruition. You can easily see it in the OP that it will result in a final duel between Nero and Angelo. From the summary, is a good ending expected? Hahahahaha. No. That's the point which the shows hammers in from the start. Revenge is pointless and leavesboth parties worse off than when they started.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nFair, considering their low budget. Wonky character models here and there. Distracting, but overall, not unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nGreat background music. Jazzy. Sometimes silly. Very post-WW2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nDuring moments when he's not obsessed with revenge, Angelo starts seeing things from the other end. His family was killed not because of anything personal, but it's just business. The gang he hates so much are pretty much just regular guys. Eating normal food. Discussing normal stuff. Fighting normal turf wars. They're not the abominations Angelo thought they were when he started.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is intertwined with mob wars and intra-family conflict. You're already fighting off a rival gang who wants your territory, and now there's a large outsider gang joining in as well. Do you fight or do you negotiate for peace? Everyone in the family has their own opinion on this issue and they're really vocal people. That guy who's warming up to the rival gang. Is he a cowardly traitor or does he think peace is a good option? The other guy who wants to fight. Is he a warmonger traitor or does he think that nothing good comes from conceding to rivals? Everyone thinks about the family's \"good\", but what is \"good\" to begin with? Just because you're family, it doesn't mean you're safe. What you think is good for the family, another thinks it's cancer. \\n\\n\r\nThe pressure both from without and within can be seen on the character's faces. The more stressed out characters get black sleepless rings around their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat story hampered only by art and money. It's very good and worth watching. Could've been a masterpiece with a greater budget. But it's an A+ effort from a small studio.",

            "content": "91 days is a series with an interesting premise. It's a crime drama set during the US prohibition. I'll let you al know right from the outset, I'm not going to know how historically accurate it is. I am basically familiar with what happened during prohibition. There was an amendment making alcohol illegal, Crime rates surged as it became a criminal commodity. After thirteen years it was repealed with another amendment. I don't, however, know the specifics. The point is, if the series gets something historical wrong I probably won't catch it. The anime was handled by Shuka, a studio best known for producing Durararasequels. Six of the nine series they've produced were based on Durarara light novels. Two of the others were 91 days and a recap for 91 days. So, I haven't looked at anything by them before. The series was written by Kishimoto Taku, the same gentleman who wrote the anime adaptation of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi. Of course, that was an adaptation and this is an original work. Let's take a look at how he does with this one, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAngelo Lagusa's life changes completely on one fateful birthday. His parents and brother are murdered by Mafioso that his father has ties to. He manages to escape, takes on a fake name and learns to survive. Seven years later, he receives a letter from someone claiming to be his father's friend. The letter is unsigned and gives the names of three people. Supposedly, the people who killed his family. With the letter in hand, Angelo returns to the town of Lawless, which is probably entirely fictional, in order to take violent revenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the narrative is with the flashbacks. There are quite a few and they generally don't contribute anything. They just kind of waste time. The final episode also jumps around quite a bit. Again, it doesn't really contribute anything to the narrative. You just see an event, then an event that took place prior and then return to the event and then see another that took place before. There's no narrative reason that the episode shouldn't have just been in chronological order and it's the only episode that jumps around that much.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the narrative is really compelling. While the whole revenge narrative is nothing new, 91 Days gives us one that's well told, overall. It has some strong sources of tension surrounding Mafia work and Angelo's hidden agenda. It also keeps things interesting by having Angelo come up with complex, clever plans in order to carry out his objectives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the series falters a bit. The main cast does have quite a few interesting characters with developed motivations. However, the supporting characters are largely generic mobsters Angelo himself is kind of the standard hero for revenge narratives as well. About the only thing that sets him apart is his dynamic with Nero, which, in all fairness, is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is nicely done. The backgrounds have nice details, particularly when it comes to cityscapes. The action sequences are solid. The characters are varied. The various objects like guns and vehicles are well drawn & animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has some strong acting. Kondou Takashi and Eguchi Takuya both give strong performances. Tsuda Kenjirou is really good as the complete and utter nutter, Fango. Saito Soma also does really well. The music is nicely done as well. Kaida Shogo did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Angelo and Corteo is a bit suspect. They both seem to value the other over themselves. Whether it's an incredibly strong friendship or beyond that is debatable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n91 Days isn't among the best series I've ever seen. That being said, it is really good. The narrative is compelling. The major characters are interesting, mostly. The acting and art are both strong. I would recommend it if you're the type of person who likes revenge narratives or if you're into historical dramas. My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Sket Dance.",

            "content": "I dunno why is this anime getting all the hate, cause for me, it's definitely one of the gems of '16 summer. An advice from a tired anime fan- don't listen to people on this site, you yourself are an amazing person and only you should be the judge of everything in your life, including anime. So, watch it yourself first, later, come back to read some butthurt reviews.\r\nSTORY: 9/10 \r\nSo I've heard people say that the story is so overdone and that there is no point in even creating this anime. I agree that it may not be the most original idea around. Butwhat makes a good story? Is it time travelling? Is it something that you have never seen before? Not necessarily. You see, most of the time the charm of the story lies not in the premise itself but rather in the storytelling. And let me tell you this- this anime is told in a very grim way, subtly shaping its characters. It is paced well. Even though you can probably tell what's going to happen next, you still find yourself striving for more, waiting for another week to pass by. There are a lot of psychological elements, so you always keep your eyes open, catching those little details that make the story all the more enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nNot the greatest thing around, but it does help set the mood. There are poorly executed scenes, but they aren't really an eyesore, believe me. I've seen worse. To be honest, I liked the character designs. The scenery could have been more detailed and stuff, I agree.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10 \\n\r\nIt's not distracting, fitting to the times that the anime portrays, and compliments the scenes very nicely. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThere aren't a lot, but the are great. You know that feeling when you're playing a game and you go down the genocide path, become an evil guy and have to fight good guys in order to win? When you're facing a boss and you're hoping that he'll win? That's how I felt when I watched 91 days. Our protagonist most of the times seems more like a villain, but he has his share of quirks, that are nice and shape his personality. He isn't just revengeful spirit- he has some deadpan humor, he has some human feelings, he makes decisions that make you question yourself and whether or not you're really hoping that he'll get what he wants. Nero is a very charming character, with his share of quirks as well, plus, it's anything but boring to watch those two, each with different ideology and purpose, interact. And it always leaves you wanting more!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nIt had it's downfalls, but it was very enjoyable. If you're a kid that can only enjoy it when everything's spelled out for you, when there's a clear line between good and evil, when harems ensue, this isn't for you. This show is for an adult audience, an audience that appreciates a splendid story telling and subtle characters. I feel sorry for people who rated this anime badly, cause it only proves that to this day anime community is infested with people who can't appreciate something different than you're everyday mediocre anime. \\n\r\nCan I just say that the ending was epic? To be honest, most of anime these days is either unfinished, so it leaves you hanging, or it's ended in a very distasteful way. This ending is fulfilling and gripping, overall 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, just give it a try. Prove that you're not a weeb 12-year old that only watches anime to fap to some flashing panties. ///you can hear a bunch of triggered weebs crying out in the distance, clutching their anime figurines to their chest, repeatable hitting the report button.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.\\n",

            "content": "The very funny thing about this show, is the fact that the name itself doesn't seem to make much sense. But, many would guess that this is the amount of time that our MC will actually revenge his fucking family by killing everyone that's associated with the murder. But really, It makes no sense, nor does it imply anything about it. But what really get me to actually watch this anime, was because it have been so long since i first see an anime with so much realism in the plot involving the revenge thing, and the setting of it. Or some may says thatthis anime kinda reminds me of Baccano or some shit because of the artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nOn the very first sight, all of us (and myself) may have thought that this anime was just a simple ass story about a guy who seek revenge, and will most likely kill them when he have made it in the end. However, the way the author wrote this story is pretty interesting in many ways. Including many different factors involved in the relationships between the MC, the killers, and his childhood friend, Corteo. The complications doesn't stem from the plot in itself, but its setting and the relationships between families, people and the MC. The very odd thing about this anime though. That would be the unfitting artstyle for western characters in the show with japanese fucking looking facials, and their looks basically. And the Fango guy who looks like some dude from the carribean, or a pirate movies. In addition to that, the relationship kinda got me confused, and pretty much surreal as fuck. At times it does makes alot of sense, but later on in the story, especially halfway towards the ending episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle may lack consistency as you progressively watch the anime, and you may also noticed it as well that the animation aren't that good in comparison to other show with good budget and shit. But this never been a problem to me while i watch this anime. Since I actually came to watch for the sake of the plot, and its twists in it. And dont forget about that amazing movie vibes with its cinematography, and cinematic techniques involves. Half of its OST is very fitting to the setting and the characters, but some of the OST sounded more eastern than western. But that's very rare when they decided to put those OST in. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the extremely structured plot in the mafias system, and its organization may confuses some watchers that haven't familiarized themselves with how the mafia and world in the past with them there works. So basically, many of its organization would call themselves, and its follower, their family. There're 4 main family that you've gotta familiarize yourself in order to really understands what's happening in this anime. Basically, there's the Vanetti (ones that killed our MC's family), Orco, Galassia, and the Lagusa families. \\n\\n\r\nThus, 91 day was a pretty well done one with the way they uses different elements in the anime, to either cause a conflicting thought of having an actual friendship > getting his revenge, different actions made my others that triggers different results, and the apparent character development and its effects of that in the story. And because this anime gives out a very movielistic vibes, i would recommend you to watch it in marathon in order to saves the vibes that the anime production gives out while you're watching, and to not get confuse about the shit that went down, or wtf just happen. I sometimes feel the lack of interest when i planned to watch 91 days as well, but that's different when i became watching it of course. But hey, that might just be me, but this anime is pretty entertaining man. Definitely give it a go if you're into these sort of genre. \\n\\n\r\nP.S the plot is complicate as fuck, i wouldn't really say that it's simple. There are tons of twists to the ending as well. Be prepare for that once you start watching it.",

            "content": "91 Days came so goddamned close to being great. Unfortunately, due to a few significant faults, it's merely good.\r\nIt's hard not to admire 91 Days for what it attempted, though. When it began, it immediately drew comparisons to Baccano, another mobster anime set in Prohibition-era America. In spite of this, though, 91 Days and Baccano are very different anime. Baccano was a romp, full of larger-than-life characters, absurd anime tropes, and fantastical plot elements. 91 Days is the exact opposite - it's dark, dry, and incredibly grounded. The only reason 91 Days draws this comparison so much is because it is the only anime thatit shares this setting with (and one of precious few about gangsters at all, let alone during Prohibition).\\n\\n\r\nSo it's hard not to admire 91 Days for taking such a unique setting. Better yet, though, it's such an anomaly in today's anime industry in that it is almost comletely void of anime-isms. There's no comic relief, exaggerated character designs, no goofy reaction faces, no shoehorned-in fanservice, and no overblown grandstanding while the protagonist sets off his revenge plan (as opposed to characters with similar arcs such as Light Yagami and Lelouche Lamperouge, for example). 91 Days sets up a consistently dark and realistic tone throughout, something it shares with almost no other anime. There's nothing here that would even be out of place in an American TV drama (on which note, I recommend the dub - the acting isn't amazing, but the tacky accents fit the tone far better than the rather pedestrian Japanese performances).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Angelo Lagusa, under the assumed name of Avilio Bruno, infiltrating the mob to avenge his family, who they murdered. He is spurred onto this revenge quest by an anonymous letter identifying three of the four mobsters who killed them. Angelo then has to get close to the three killers he knows, and identify the fourth, all without his cover being blown.\\n\\n\r\nThis creates a solid hook to keep up invested the series - watching Angelo devise his way through the mob keeps the tension up, whilst creating mystery over who the fourth person was and who sent the letter.\\n\\n\r\nIt plays out as a suspenseful thriller, as Angelo's revenge plot pits multiple mobsters families against one another, leading to a staggering death toll. You can expect multiple named characters to die in every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of 91 Days' greatest strengths - once the setup is out of the way, it moves at an absolutely breakneck pace, enough to keep you consistently engaged but never to leave you behind. Every episode* will kill several named characters, introduce more, add a plot twist, and make it all organic to the story.\\n\\n\r\n*\u1d49\u02e3\u1d9c\u1d49\u1d56\u1d57 \u1d49\u1d56\u1da6\u02e2\u1d52\u1d48\u1d49 \u2074 \u22c5 \u1d40\u02b0\u1d43\u1d57 \u1d52\u1db0\u1d49 \u02b7\u1d43\u02e2 \u02b7\u1d49\u1da6\u02b3\u1d48\u22c5\\n\\n\r\nWhile this pacing does make the show consistently engaging, it does come with a major drawback. The lack of any breathing room in the plot leaves little room to flesh out the characters, leaving most of them little more than a single character trait. While they are still passable, stronger characterisation could have made the drama in this series so much more engaging, especially when personal grudges drive most of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis hits the hardest when it comes to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe non-spoiler version of my opinion on the ending is this: It is not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe spoiler version is far more in-depth, so if you haven't seen 91 Days yet, please look away now (because in spite of its flaws it is still very much worth watching).\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile everything up until the final episode had been a nonstop rush of characters being killed, betrayed, betraying, and so on, by the time the final episode rolls around almost everyone is dead and Angelo's secret is out.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing we're still waiting for is for Angelo to kill Nero, Nero to kill Angelo, or both.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this happen? Well, your guess is as good as mine, because the ending is left ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the episode revolves around Angelo being tied up, switching from being in one person's custody or another, and eventually being hauled off with Nero where they have heart-to-heart conversations about why they did what they did.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this is that it hinges on our investment in the friendship between these two, which the series absolutely has not given us any reason to be invested in, no has it given us a reason to be invested in these characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt ends in an ambiguous scene that begs the question of whether Nero actually went through with killing Angelo, with hints that Nero may have died shortly thereafter as well.\\n\\n\r\nA better question is why we should care.\\n\\n\r\nAnother better question is, what was the point of making it ambiguous?\\n\\n\r\nYet another better question is, why not have the two confront each other, leading to one or both of their deaths in a tense and dramatic scene? This is, after all, what the series was building up to for its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hadn't decided to lean on its weakest element for its conclusion, 91 Days would have been an exceptional anime. It's almost frustrating how close it came, considering how out of step it is with anime as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: A unique anime with impressive tone and pace that lets itself down with poor characters and an unsatisfying ending.

            "content": "I don't know which is more prominent at this point, lasagna or canned pineapples but I definitely know one thing - 91 Days /is/ worth the watch.\r\nTo say that 91 Days is like any other series that attempts to exploit the theme of \"vengeance\" is a slight understatement. Truly, the series works on Angelo's plans of \"an eye for an eye\". But it doesn't simply exploit how vengeance works in the mafia world, or how vengeance can drive you to be a cold-hearted bastard and ruin people's lives. Rather, it presents the question if revenge is really worth fighting for and that at the endof the day, will you truly find the happiness you believe you lost because of those who took it away from you? Would it not be better to live in the present and appreciate what is around you? It isn't that philosophical so fret not, it won't be a boring ride. The story achieves that by incorporating the theme of revenge into the main story where mafia groups attempt to overpower each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear to say that 91 Days has solid, consistent writing with the appropriate tone. They don't shove bullshit into your face (yes it will lose some of its pacing along the way) because by the time you finish the whole series, you will understand how they are inter-related and work to exemplify the significant of relationship formed between the main characters, Angelo and Nero. Even canned pineapples are significant. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you can actually predict each episode, really, I couldn't. 91 Days basically gives you the expectation of what may happen in the upcoming episode but always works to overrule every single expectation you have. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, 91 Days fails at the quality of its art. The animation lacks fluidity. It doesn't give viewers scenic views but instead a backdrop of lackluster colours, and lifeless buildings and objects. Then again, this does help to provide a serious, mature tone to the setting. If you have already watched the series, you may find that certain scenes have more vibrant colours in order to lighten the atmosphere and bring out the light interactions between the characters. Well, at least you make up for those sad backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather unmemorable. Especially when they look almost the same with the same hair colour. Those who particularly struck out (hair colour, hair styles) were of more importance (well, that's honestly nothing new). It fascinates me that there was no access into any of these characters minds, in a way dehumanizing them. Not that its a new thing but it really works when the camera techniques are nuance in its attempts of capturing the character's emotions, Avilio in particular who is the hardest character to actually read. The usage of certain close-ups, or even wide shots of Avilio made me wonder what Avilio is thinking at that moment, what is he planning, or is he genuine? Because of this, I struggle with my own opinions of certain characters because they would be subtly antagonized throughout the story. Without a reason behind their actions, unless stated, I was momentarily lost between who was right and wrong. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 91 Days is that one series you don't want to miss. If you've dropped it because you were put off by the slow pacing during Episode 4 and 5 or the art, give it another try until Episode 6 and see if you still enjoy it. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea though. I mean, you won't enjoy lasagna that much after watching that one particular episode.",

            "content": "\"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\" \r\nThis is the cornerstone expression that drives 91 Days. An expression that it lives and dies by, down to the very fabric of its being. One that we're quickly made aware of from the opening act that plants us into its world.\r\nThe arms of the clock tick in reverse, as we travel back to the days of the prohibition era. It's a cold night in April, and our young protagonist, Angelo Lagusa, enters frame. In the warm glow of his household, behind the thick wooden walls that push the harsh cold out, he's at ease with the comfortof his family filling in the spaces of his living quarters. Cushioned by a blanket of security, Angelo and his little brother, Luce, awaits their father's return, hiding away in anticipation for the moment he walks through the door. It's a brief hallmark moment, the siblings' father cheerfully calling out their names, waiting for a likely response to ring out from within the closet. But little does Angelo know, that everything he's known up to this point is about to come to an end with the sudden knock of a visitor at the door\u2014dun! dun! dun!\u2014... and so it begins. \\n\\n\r\nThree burly figures draped in thick trench coats steps inside. And just like that, the warm radiance that once filled the house is immediately sucked out. In its place, the thick stench of malice creeps in, seeping through the floorboards, suffocating the very air around them. Something is about to happen, and every beating heart in that room could feel it coming. Angelo's father lounges forward, blade in hand and his little brother bolts out the 2'x8' coffin to come to his parents' aid before Angelo could even react. Stifled by the linen hanging behind him and the fear of what he's witnessing in front, our young protagonist is left frozen to look on, powerless to take action against the chaos looming right outside his hiding space. Peaking through the wooden panels of the cramped closet, he bares witness to a sight that will forever haunt him. Bullets leave their chamber, the thunderous clap marking their departure, as they tear through the flesh of what he once called family.\\n\\n\r\nThis is it. This is the event. This is the anger that fuels him. This is the removal of normalcy. This is the motivation that keeps him going. This is the beginning of something sinister. This is the landmark moment that will forever pave his path with blood stains of burgundy and the sulfuric stench of gunpowder. \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" and Angelo is determined to deliver it, even at the cost of innocent bystanders that are oblivious to his vendetta. The cost of him ever living a normal life. And at the cost of what little shred of humanity was left during that cold winter night. When he goes through with this, there's no turning back. No one to turn to. No one to pray for his godforsaken soul. And so we depart with him, down the topsy-turvy course of trust and betrayal, with a hit list in hand and a determination that refuses to yield. He begins his journey; the first steps are taken, day one begins. \\n\\n\r\nBearing a similar tone and structure to projects done by movie heavyweights Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, 91 Days plays out like a love-child of these two worlds being brought together. This is immediately felt with the sultry musical backing, soft piano keys being carted off by bellowing brass instruments, stylistically cropped with titles cards and blood-curdling violin strings, as the camera slowly pans across the landscape. Traversing the fledgling stages of a city aiming to shoot their infrastructures towards the heavens, we're made aware of this place that's aptly named Lawless; a nesting ground for those trying to carve out a living for themselves, as well as the mafia families that make up the seedy underbelly of the booming alcohol smuggling trade. After laying low for seven years, Angelo makes his return to this city, reborn under the alias Avilio Bruno. Here he set the plans in motion for his revenge, enlisting the help of his childhood friend, Corteo, using his talents as a brewer to get closer to the crime syndicate that massacred his loved ones on that cold night in April.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as his plans begin to unfold, everyone is slowly entangled within it. A sprawled-out web that's inhabited by family feuds over the dominion of the city and pretexts made at a moments notice to insight altercations. A breeding ground for mutual partnerships and calculated backstabbing, with Avilio fanning the flames whenever he sees fit. These warring family factions include the Vanettis, Orcos, and Galassias. All of which participate in this codependent dance of charades that are set to the music of a zero-sum game. With lots of twists and turns scattered along the way, every chapter adds a new piece to the playing field. This, combined with the brisk, yet methodical pacing, made 91 Days a title that constantly had you wanting to see what would happen next. There were no guarantees on who will live or die, only the falsehood of plot armor that's immediately revoked when two opposing parties meet. \\n\\n\r\nThis became one of the show's greatest strengths; suspense backed up by tangible results. \\n\\n\r\nRevenge stories that slowly taper off as it pushes forward aren't uncommon. There have been many examples of this occurring across several storytelling mediums, with the usual morality message regarding the perpetual state of hate being the star attraction set on display. Thankfully, 91 Days isn't another statistic. It sets the stage early on and delivers on its promise from beginning to end. There aren't any trade-offs made to extend anyone's relevance, if they're ensnared in a situation that they can't walk away from unscathed, they receive their just desserts like everyone else. There are still explicit messages regarding the cost of revenge, as well as themes that come default with these scenarios, but the story doesn't bend at will to adhere to the warnings of it. Revenge isn't just worn as a shiny badge before flipping the script to see the apparent wrongs of the actions being taken, no, in 91 Days, revenge is carried out without compromise. And nowhere is that made more prominent than with the cutthroat mentality adopted by the main lead, Angelo \"Avilio\" Lagusa.\\n\\n\r\nIf Angelo were summed up with one word, it would be merciless. An empty shell that lives solely for his objective, Angelo knows nothing else, adjusting his life around the need to make his targets pay. He isn't just satisfied with merely killing them; he wants to crush everything that they stand for. Dismantling the very foundation of their family's name by orchestrating events that will see them tearing each other apart. He's determined to see his plans through to the end, becoming another cog in the machine without so much as flinching at the prospect if it benefits his cause. Step by step, he draws closer to his end goal, the phantom resemblance of a smile just below the surface as bodies begin to fall. It's an obsession that borders on madness. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's this same obsessive state that gives birth to paranoia among all camps of the conflict. Men hunched over in their local speakeasies, glancing over their shoulders in fear of other families taking them out. Restless faces marked off by bags under their eyes, dispatching hit men before someone else gets them first. And standing in the cross-hairs of this chaos is Nero Vanetti, a man deeply devoted to his Don and father, and the extended crime family, and unfortunately, another name on the checklist to be snuffed out. Where Angelo is driven to dismantle everything around him, Nero is committed to keeping it together, who, like Angelo, is obsessed with his cause, but instead of being duty-bound to some vendetta, he instead wants to maintain the integrity of his family's name. A task that proves nigh impossible with Angelo offering a handshake in comradeship, while the other hand carries a pistol erected in his direction. A give-and-take relationship where one man stumbles in the dark, oblivious to the others malicious intent. \\n\\n\r\nBut not everything in 91 Days compliments this gripping narrative. For one, the art direction and presentation often fell short of expected standards. Instead of becoming an animated series that could go toe-to-toe with the giants it patterns itself after, it only manages to measure up by the skin of its teeth. By no means should anyone approach this work expecting something on Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino's level. When I said, \"similar tone and structure\" that was the extent to which I think this anime achieves when pulling from its influences. At best, it's a slightly better rendition of the 3rd movie in the Godfather franchise, which admittedly isn't much of an accomplishment, but still, I'll give it credit for where credit is due. Regarding general scriptwriting, cinematography, and fully developed personalities, 91 Days remains an imitation of these great creator's works, but still a gripping imitation nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of eye-grabbing textures, unique shot compositions, color saturation, or other presentation nitpicks could be ignored if you're invested in the story. Although, some aspects might stick out far too often to turn a blind eye to. Such is the case with characters like Fango, who might have been an honest attempt at creating a sadomasochistic individual, but ended up resembling an off-brand Joker villain instead. Where every character involved aimed for an early Film-noir performance set in the 1920s, Fango came flying in like a man transported straight from the 1970s; complete with the general attire and appearance to boot. And as detracting as his antics were at times when placed in a setting not meant for him, after awhile, his role in the story meshed in more effectively. May have been too late by then, but at least the effort was there to course-correct the problem. There are also a few character dynamics that could have benefited with a bit more time dedicated to it, like Angelo's connection to his childhood friend Corteo, which felt too much like an afterthought at times, only there to get his foot in the door and serve as a catalyst for certain events to happen. With a bit more meat to their relationship, pivotal narrative moments could have become emotionally gripping ones as well. There's an excellent storyboard there, just not enough attention-to-detail in-between plot points make it moments with long shelf-lives in the collective conscious of the viewership. \\n\\n\r\nAnd despite this list of shortcomings, 91 Days remains a welcomed addition to its niche genre appeal, because when everything is said and done, the self-respect in which it carried itself made it far easier to forgive where it may have stumbled. We've had a fair share of mobster-inspired works before this, from the more character-centric ones like Gungrave and Gangsta to the rule-of-cool beat-em-ups of Darker than Black and Baccano, but there's never been a more faithful rendition of the traditional mafioso story in anime up to this point. Where those titles are riddled with supernatural occurrences that are dipped in the flourishings of the mobster lifestyle, 91 Days trades this in for a more grounded approach, containing characters that draw closer to real-world personalities than the more zany ones found in some of its contemporaries. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not have the energy of Baccano, the fully developed characters of Gungrave, the well-choreographed fights of Darker than Black, or Gangsta's\u2014... oh wait, Gangsta sucks. But what it does have is an appreciation for the classics that preceded it and the commitment needed to see its vision through.",

            "content": "No, it\u2019s not a show that spans for 91 episodes, a Baccano\u2019s second coming, or in fact anything like that at all. On paper, 91 Days is a revenge story, a show about a guy named Avilio Bruno (real name: Angelo Lagusa) who seeks vengeance against the Vanetti Family. Why? It\u2019s because they ruined his life many years ago when he was a child. His family was murdered (or more precisely, double crossed) by the mafia. This all happened during the Prohibition Era and it\u2019s hard to imagine at the time what Avilio was going through. Simply put, 91 Days strives to prove itself asa successful crime-drama thriller; one that hopes to make it memorable as for you as it can for itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs an original series, 91 Days isn\u2019t being held back by any adaptation hindrances or an established fan base. However, the show is hardly anything original either. Picture this. It\u2019s the Prohibition Era and mafia, gangs, and mobs rule the street. Liquor is like gold while the police force is anything but useful. Organized crime is almost everywhere you see and so common that it\u2019s practically accepted. At the top of the food chain are the mafia organizations that controls the system. The Vanetti Family is one such mafia that emerged as a powerful group led by a man named Don Vincento. He also got a son named Nero who he hopes will protect his family\u2019s treasure. Avilio is able to get involved in this family\u2019s affairs as a subordinate while others remain oblivious to the fact that he wants to destroy them from within. Sounds quite appealing right? It\u2019s almost sounds like a revamp of a gangster story from the 80s or something out of a James Bond movie. \\n\\n\r\nEven judging by the promotional poster itself, the show can feel intimidating. You literally got two guys standing on opposite ends of each other while pointing a gun with the intent to kill. They are Nero and Avilio. As a story about crime, revenge, and murder, there\u2019s also a lot that goes beyond that. 91 Days starts off by making its intentions pretty clear. Mafia really are like Gods in their world who plays by their own rules. Unfortunately, Avilio\u2019s family were killed and the laws never delivered justice for him. It\u2019s why he wants revenge. At the same time, Avilio is a clever man. He\u2019s been hiding himself for almost 7 years until the moment he has the chance. On surface, Avilio is someone that is hard to approach. He hides his emotions and not easily befriended.  His friendship with Nero is one of the most interesting dynamics in the series as they are very different. Nero is the one with the bright personality and also has full of pride for his family. We learn that Avilio lost his family already so there\u2019s not many people he can turn to besides his childhood friend Corteo. So in his head, we got Avilio who tries his best to carry out vengeance that being transformed from a sweet kid to this avenger. At the same time, Avilio\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t just revenge. He wants to bring pain and suffering to his enemies so death sometimes may not be enough to satisfy. Talk about intense feelings. Living in pain may feel even worse than death itself.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, cleverness alone isn\u2019t just what describes Avilio as a character. The people he wants dead are often planned out in his head like a chess game, where he anticipates the moves of his opponents. In this game, Avilio uses tricks until he catches his prey off guard and goes for the kill or make them suffer. It\u2019s like an assassination except Avilio does more than just carry out his mission. He wants the most out of them and even manages to get other people involved in such dangerous affairs when they weren\u2019t to be. Remember, this is a society where trust is an obscure word. People have to rely on themselves and family feuds are pretty evident. The most noticeable ones are between the Vanetti, Orco, and Galassia. In the meantime, the show makes some families look like hypocrites, especially with they celebrate events. In essence, there\u2019s really no sincere character coming from the families as they all seek to make themselves look good. One of the most noticeable characters in the show is Fango, someone that viewers will see as a psychopath. It\u2019s pretty evident that he has murderous tendencies and really doesn\u2019t care much about anyone but himself. The mind games you see he plays with others also makes him a manipulative individual as well. Perhaps Fango is a bit of extreme example but the point is that there\u2019s pretty much no character in the show with a pure heart.\\n\\n\r\nAmong all the antiheroes and crime, the story itself is pretty much a dark thriller. It\u2019s obvious already in the first few episodes so expect nothing less throughout the rest of the season. There is actually one breather episode that connects the friendship more between Avilio and Nero. However, most of the season is tainted with bloodshed, murder, and tragedy. Death is quite real and really, no one is safe. There may even be a few plot segments where you\u2019ll feel like experiencing the unexpected. Every episode builds on the overall story and characters more whether they are from extravagant revelations or small pieces by pieces. The show is about revenge but the characters in them are more than just chess pieces in a board game. Sure, each of the have their roles to fulfill but most of the character also has a purpose. In the meantime, the comedy of the series is portrayed more as dark humor. The violence is portrayed as real. The crimes are lawless.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, I was initially somewhat worried. The show is adapted by studio Shuka who is only known for their recent work, Durarara!! sequels. From a technical perspective, the show looks decent and portrays the dark thrilling mood quite well. The best parts about the show is the character emotions as we see how they show their feelings \u2013 hatred, sorrow, pity, regret. 91 Days portrays character expressions at their best when they are in conflict. The historical background settings of the Prohibition Era also has fine details although not as emphasized as the violence. Expect graphic violence especially during death scenes and murder. It\u2019s a dark story after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack makes sense in most respects with the eerie atmospheric setting. Even the OP and ED theme songs are haunting with a soft paced beat. Character voice mannerisms in the show is also a positive with Avilio being a believable character with his quest of revenge. However, my biggest impression of the character voice mannerism is Fango. His eccentric speeches, crazy personality, and psychopathic tone reflects exactly how 91 Days\u2019 society can be so unconstitutional. And his voice is pretty damn good at showing that.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a show that goes beyond the mafia wars, revenge story, and crime. Every now and then, we get a gangster story of violence. Some of them really is nothing more than pandering fans with fan service. Others really portray how dark humans can be while there\u2019s a society without laws. 91 Days is the type of series that show the darker side of humanity. I must say\u2026that is something to watch out for.\\n",

Its inspiration's become apparent the moment the show begins and no time is wasted to  let the story go in full throttle.\r\n91 Days is a revenge story through and through but still manages to keep the viewers on their feet. It is best to take breaks between episodes to let the suspense set in as almost every episode ends in a cliffhanger. \r\nSadly the animation is inconsistent. The fact that the studio had to suffer through budget constraints becomes apparent half waythrough the show. However that is also when the show increases tension and thus still manages to keep the viewers engaged. The sound, music and voice action is spot on at all times. \\n\\n\r\nA revenge drama is nothing without its characters. The main cast and important supporting characters manage to have multilayered personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was one heck of a ride and is my 3rd favorite anime of the season after ReLIFE and Mob Psycho 100.",

            "content": "During 91 Days I felt like watching the movies Godfather, Lawless, Donnie Brasco and Public Enemies all at the same time, with a complex but solid plot, suspense backed up by factual consequences that keep you on the edge of your seat and solid characters that live up to the expectations combined with genuine mafia tactics and actions resulted in a good watching experience that felt like a breath of fresh air because 91 Days was different from other shows, it avoided being generic or cliched. \r\nThe story takes place in the prohibition times and it is about a young boy named Angelo who hadhis family murdered by mafiosos right before his very eyes, leaving Angelo with no reason to live other than seeking revenge for the family he lost. \\n\r\nWhat appeared to be a generic \u201crevenge\u201d scenario turned out to be a complex but believable look into the workings of the mafia, filled with suspense, thrilling moments, betrayals and plot twists.\\n\r\nThe veritable mafia manner of doing things such as making \u201clasagna\u201d out of an adversary, ordering hits on family members, different mob families battling over territory, family members double crossing and betraying each other and the paranoia created by that were great additions to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does have some flaws regarding its execution and methodical pacing but I am too lazy to get into details. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters come in great numbers but few of them get proper characterization or development, most of them being one-dimensional and some of them even coming off as cartoon-ish characters (Ex: Fango).\\n\\n\r\nAngelo (the protagonist) is an empty shell of a man that lives only to obtain his revenge against the people who murdered his family. He is patient, clever, level headed and merciless not being satisfied with just killing his targets but wanting to destroy his targets and everything they wish, care and stand for. \\n\r\nAt one point Angelo kills his childhood friend, the friend he considers family, in order to avenge the family he once lost. Angelo erased what family he had left just to achieve a distant goal, that goes to show how damaged and obsessed to the point of madness Angelo really was.\\n\r\nAngelo is determined to see his plans through to the end no matter the consequences, with each kill he draws closer to his final goal thinking once that goal is achieved he would be free and given a reason to live. \\n\\n\r\nNero is one of the people who murdered Angelo\u2019s family and one of the man Angelo seeks to destroy. Nero is a man deeply devoted to upholding the crime family\u2019s integrity, name and pride. While Angelo seeks to destroy and crush that family, Nero seeks to keep that crime family together, thus making them opposite forces. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the two main characters, after Nero\u2019s family is killed according to Angelo\u2019s plan, they are both able to understand each other on a deeper level. \\n\r\nEven though they both hate each other, they also understand and sympathize with each other. Nero was the only person that Angelo did not want to kill, as he said in the end \u201cIt is because I didn\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d \\n\r\nThey both needed what only the other could offer, for Angelo it was salvation through death and for Nero it was redemption and forgiveness for his crimes.\\n\\n\r\nI did not pay much attention to the aesthetics since the plot is very interesting.\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good but nothing special although it is fluid, the character design and overall art is good although it lacks dynamic and that \u201cnice\u201d color saturation.\\n\\n\r\nDecent opening/ending themes and little background music, I personally did not miss it nor wish for more.\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this series, it felt like a breath of fresh air in a world polluted by cliched and generic shows. Even with its flaws, 91 Days was absolutely worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nSince some viewers seem to not understand the ending, here is a short explanation:\\n\\n\r\nAngelo tells Nero to drive to the ocean, they both know what will happen there, it is a matter of \u201cwhere\u201d rather than \u201cif\u201d or \u201cwhen\u201d. Once they arrive to the ocean, they start walking along the beach, Angelo showing his sympathy towards Nero, confessing he grew to like Nero and did not want to kill him. As Angelo walks in front, Nero pulls a gun and after hesitating, he pulls the trigger and kills Angelo, not because he wanted to but because Angelo needed to be freed (as shown a few minutes earlier when Angelo said \u201cYou should have killed me 7 years ago\u201d). On the car ride away from the beach, Nero looks down and smiles at a can of pineapples sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, reminiscing about the time when Angelo bought all those pineapples on their first trip together. The ending scene shows the footprints in the beach sand being washed away by waves, suggesting closure, like turning a new page.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a show that goes beyond the revenge story, showing mafia wars and the darker side of men. I highly recommend watching this show.",

            "content": "The brisk night air whispers across your face, gently stringing hairs in front of your eyes. Stars are barely visible above through the thicket of bare winter trees and your body aching and languid from the effects of tracking in the cold. Your target is about 100 yards away, the dim glow of their headlights is the one thing keeping you on the trail. Tonight is the night justice will be dealt, the night a culmination of seven long years of anticipation will finally come to a head. They don't deserve to live after what was done to your family that horrific night. \r\nSuddenly thecar begins to slow to a halt. The final destination has been reached. Still crouching you strafe to the side of the vehicle, your numb hand clutched on your pistol's grip like a precious keepsake. Your heartbeat escalates as the door of the caravan creaks open. Your target emerges, dressed to the nine and grinning confidently. You hesitate to pull out the gun, hands trembling. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is it so hard to finish the job? \\n\\n\r\nYou've killed countless times to get to this point. Everything has been assimilated into the single, perfect moment of revenge. You slowly raise the gun up, shaking and unable to steady your aim. Your eyes cloud as warm, fresh tears begin to stream down your icy face. You can't do it.\\n\\n\r\nIs this really happening?\\n\\n\r\nFrustrated, you holster your gun and creep back into the shadows of the dark woods and recollect yourself. The target proceeds to his destination leaving you with an unfulfilled mission. \\n\\n\r\nShows like 91 Days always put you in the moment, make your chest pound and your pulse quicken. They seek to place you in the character's heads and are often atmospheric. The tension and scenery is almost palpable to me, flooding my head with inspiration to write. I love the mafia and suspense genres.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is an anime that immediately had me intrigued based on its mafia setting. It's a genre that always seems to have me on the edge of my seat with excitement as in Gungrave or Baccano, and unfortunately one that doesn't get as much proper attention anymore. Sure, watching \"Americans\" in Illinois speak Japanese to members of an Italian mafia can sound confusing, but these gripes are easily overlooked as the series builds with suspense. This anime is a classic story of revenge where a grieving son seeks to exact vengeance against the mafiosos who killed his family several years back. This original work sucks the viewer in with its compelling premise and doesn't let go, often leaving us with a heart-pounding cliffhanger or unanswered conflict at the conclusion of each episode. It has plenty of flaws but still manages to hit the mark for overall enjoyment with its great pacing and episode structure. Minor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my biggest complaint with this series is the amount of predictability within its writing. The stereotypical depiction of most mafia characters is laden with selfishness and greed, with the old adage \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" playing a key role in character relationships. 91 Days doesn't stray far from the path here. Many characters seek power and wealth over all things, ultimately leading to their demise. This element only deters the viewers from being able to identify with the characters within the story because they'll often come across as mostly single-faceted. Those few characters with alternative motives tend to fair better from a survival standpoint as the series chugs on. Those who connect to neither Avillo or Nero will find themselves scrambling to identify with someone, anyone in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this predictability also exists in the plot of 91 Days as well. We can almost predict the progression to a tee:\\n\\n\r\n-Guy is mad and wants revenge.\\n\r\n-Guy joins ranks and befriends future target\\n\r\n-Guy has a hard time killing target because of their new relationship.\\n\r\n-Lots of people die due to betrayal, greed and desperation along the way.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't necessarily rocket science but the main question to ask yourself is if you feel cheated because of that. The only real element of mystery here was who wrote the letter that told Avillo the identities of his family's killers? (Which, you probably forgot about after the first episode anyway). I guess I can't get too upset about it, it's always nice now and then to sit back and just enjoy an anime without being intellectually challenged the entire time. Sometimes in these mafia style shows, the family associations can be a bit discombobulated, and alas, it's no different here. A predictable plot here is a slight hindrance, but didn't necessarily change my overall opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI can easily compare 91 Days to Gungrave on a few different levels. First is the narrative of revenge. Sure, they aren't exactly for the same reason, but they both capitalize on this idea. The setting is slightly different, with Gungrave taking place in a semi-futuristic present, while 91 Days exists within an older America. I personally feel that Gungrave ultimately takes the cake based on animation, atmosphere and plot twists, but the latter has some highlights of its own. The one big flaw when comparing the two was the lack of satisfaction I felt at the end of 91 Days. It just kind of... Happened. Gungrave had great closure, and kind of made me smile at the end. 91 Days just felt a tad stale.\\n\\n\r\nWith the bad, there is also plenty of good to speak of in 91 Days. The cliffhangers were for the most part well placed, and I always felt a sense of tension in certain scenes, adding to the show's overall atmosphere. The episodes are well paced, and I never felt like certain scenes were being too rushed. I also have to give kudos to relatively new studio Shuka or tackling the often insurmountable task of animating an entirely original series. The lack of source material at least quells the incessant whining of manga purists. This also gave them the freedom to do what they wanted, and I think they handled it quite well for being such a rookie studio. The existence of Prohibition set up some interesting plot devices and discussion of politics within the series, making it feel more like I just dropped into this world. I appreciate writers that take the time of day to jam little nuances like this into their work. Overall, I ended up getting caught in the whirlwind and hype behind the show, which may have caused me to appreciate it more, but it was still highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nMost gangster or mafia shows have the luxury of crafting some of the most polarizing characters we've ever come across in entertainment. I thought Nero was very believable and justified in his personality and actions. He valued family above all else, even though they often aimed to undermine him. Charismatic yet firm in his demeanor, he contrasted Avillo's solemn aura quite well and I felt their chemistry was rather downplayed by most. I wasn't too keen on Avillo as an MC since  the only chance for the audience to relate to him is strictly out of emotional revenge. He doesn't necessarily exude many traits the rest of us have. Fango started off as a very enjoyable character. Sadistic and impulsive as all hell, he really served to make things interesting. However, just like most characters exhibiting these traits, his presence grew stale over time. None of the other characters really mattered to me since most of them got the axe at some point, but they all exist to propel the story forward and reinforce the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nI have some major issues with the animation. At times it can be downright ugly and inconsistent. There's a specific scene I remember from early on in the series during a fight with Fango that a few clips existed that made him look basically distorted. In today's world, there's no excuse for the lack of editing here. Other times, the art felt very on point and helped to mold the serious tone of the show. With mafia shows it can be hard to distinguish certain family members from others, something 91 Days did quite well. It was also exciting to see TK drop another powerful track, as the OP for the series has been on my playlist ever since I heard it. The song is really something. Voice acting is also well done and reminds me of some other similar shows. Looks like they may all have some shared actors :D\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is a quality anime with a gripping plot line, guaranteeing to keep you engaged throughout its 12 episodes. Sure, it has issues and the end is lackluster but still left that taste of satisfaction on the lips after the final credits rolled. I'd highly recommend this series to those of you who've enjoyed things like Gungrave, Hitman Reborn, Phantom Requiem or shows with a similar premise. It'll definitely scratch that figurative mafia itch some of us seem to have. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my summer 16 reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-4\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall-7.1",

            "content": "91 Days is a good choice for you if you enjoy a revenge story where a character exploits other people's self interest and/or schemes them in order to achieve his revenge. 91 Days becomes a bad choice once you start expecting anything other than onedimensional characters, and also if you hate main characters that are displayed in a way that makes them feel flawless without giving them any personality traits, especially negative.\r\nYou see, what ruined this series for me was the characters. Most of the characters are presented as onedimensional, with each being from x side or the y side or the z side. Ifthey're particularly important characters, they will have a trait or aspiration which will rule their personality without giving them any further complexity, like friendship, family, power, greedyness, psychopathy, etc. Each character will operate under one role and that role only and they won't have any sort of trait that would give them a more complex and more human personality. Thus they feel very onedimensional and they were hard to feel any attachment to, because you constantly knew which is their one and only priority. The two characters the series treats as the main characters are pretty much the only two people that feel like more or less people, because they do things that occasionally clash with their goals, but I didn't personally enjoy their portrayals. \\n\\n\r\nOne of said characters is the main character, Angelo, or Avilio as he's known by everyone other than a single person. Of the two I'll talk only about Avilio because the other character doesn't enough depth to live on its own. I didn't like Avilio's character. For the reason that he doesn't seem to have any flaws other than him being emotionally damaged and having no desire to live life outside of his revenge. But these are not used at all to impede his goal, so he's pretty much a Jesus character. Avilio manages to constantly scheme and use characters to his purpose, planning things just the right way through all adversity and always coming out unscathed 100% of the time pretty much because he's the main character who delivers his vengeance. There's not really any time where things seem to remotely go against him specifically. The group he is in may suffer. His \"friends\" might be in a disadvantageous situation. But as far as Avilio is concerned, he never seems to be at odds for the vast majority of the series, even in a situation where he's at a complete disadvantage. The one very good moment in the series, is when that actually finally happens, he finally is forced to do something he doesn't want to and has no other choice and can't create bullshit out of his ass. Which I can't talk about because it would be spoiled. Outside of that one moment he always seems to be the perfect man who's gonna reap vengeance and deliver his justice. Which isn't a good thing. The only thing flawed about him is his goal. Nothing else. As far as his actual personality goes, Avilio never displays enough emotions to engage his character from a viewer's perspective, merely showing short glimpses of very minor reactions that would build his character more as a person. Avilio is portrayed as a silent husk of a person, which makes him as engaging as a toenail, with the personality of the doorknob to boot. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna deny that the type of person Avilio is does deliver this series' point, but a good drama should have some way to make me care about its characters. And the main character is bland, and everyone else seemed even worse. For instance, in a setting where there's 3 big families from the mafia, other than power \"levels\", I can't tell you any thing that differentiates them from one or the other, except for their leading dons which are onedimensionally portrayed characters. And this is in a story where all of these families are relevant to the world and Avilio's goals, in a series where common traits might hint at things to exploit which would help Avilio. This is in a story where you should also empathize with another character that aspires to constantly help his family, with his family's only saving grace being... that they're related? I can't honestly find any side to root for, for neither a moral reason, or a reason based on ideals or anything of the sort. Everyone seems to be after the same thing, which is power and money. I'd classify henchmen that sacrifice for the family into the power category as well, because they might not be doing it to promote their own, they're doing it for the person who they're supporting. If the story is a drama, there's nothing that compels me to interact with the characters, because they feel too shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simply about revenge. But I can't be engaged in a story about revenge when I simply just don't care about the characters and simply see them as set pieces. Yes, there are one or two things that aren't purely minded towards that goal and it does present revenge in a negative light. The best moment of the series is when finally the main character has to do something he just simply would rather never do, which I've mentioned before. But otherwise, it's a story about a guy who lost his family killing those who wronged him. Which is a standard plotline. And any elements that could make it interesting, its setting, its characters, everything is not noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite everything I said, the story did have a theme that I felt it did get to go through. Due to its ending mostly and... that means I can only give you vague things to avoid spoilers and even then I can't guarantee there's nothing that is gonna give away how the series will end in this paragraph. So I advice you to just to skip this whole paragraph in order to avoid spoilers if you'd rather stay clean. The theme of the series is about living in the past. If you let your past define who you are today, once everything that kept you in the past is gone, you're a nobody. If that's what builds up your life, the only option left once all of that is gone is to move on. Power means nothing without the reason you've aspired to it. I know how vague all of this sounds, but I can't get into it any deeper. It's far bleaker and vague, however, this is the essence of it. Take it or leave it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, I wouldn't call this series an action series as much as I would call it revenge porn, with everyone falling in the front of the one and only God, Avilio. Most of the action is comprised of shootings but there's one or two more brutal moments, which I'll just leave unsaid since they bank on the shock factor to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artstyle, the series is mostly fine, but the overall color balance with cold colors and low saturation didn't really help make the world more vivid for me. I think the world is too bleak and makes the story too serious. Otherwise, I like the overall art, but for once I wish a series would be a little more colorful. In terms of sound, I found nothing noteworthy to be said, negative or positive.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days was a dissapointing experience for me. Because, it had very little going on for itself and it failed to make me care about its world, its characters and its events. While I think it did succeed in its theme, there's a lot of moments that just didn't help and seemed to serve  only simply as revengeporn. So ultimately, I think 91 Days can be a fun ride if you just wanna see how a character dismantles organizations in order to achieve the justice he thinks he deserves, and you just wanna see how he succesfully and consistently does it. Basically if you think the revenge porn aspect is the only thing that will carry you through. Because otherwise I can't really recommend it on any other factor, perhaps its theme, but I can't assure you that it will pay off for you. I think the series was ruined by character portrayal, and how nobody seemed to matter and have any value to the story. There were only a few people that really mattered and were focused on, and they aren't particularly engaging either, they're just there so that Avilio the doorknob wouldn't just boringly sit there and brood. The show lacked tension because the main character seemed to almost always achieve his goals, the show lacked engaging characters, because they were one dimensional, the show lacked drama, for the same aforementioned reason. It was lacking in a lot of ways, ways which make this anime hard to recommend. So if you think the said things would be roadblocks for you too, I suggest you avoid this. 91 Days is one of those series that I think are enjoyable only if they're exactly what you're looking for.",

A drama in a city. Heavily supported with character development. There are no unique stylistic on storytelling, it just goes. And the end of story (no spoilers here) forces you to face with the absurdity (as in Camus) of life and motivation and meaning of living (and you can sense this in the dialog between Nero and Angelo in camp in the ending episode).\r\n## Art\r\nArt is so unique. The show has specific color schemes and drawing has unique styles like details onface. Addition to color schemes, just saying there are no particular color schemes based on context. However, the choice of lighting in intense scenes overcomes this.\\n\\n\r\n## Sound\\n\r\nOpening band is Sigure, same band in first season of Psychopass. I somehow like their style of vocals. Opening is good, ending is also good (and needs a goddamn lyrics video btw). OST's are okay.\\n\\n\r\n## Character and Character Development\\n\r\nCD is very great in this show. When I say \"CD is good/great\", I mean that characters have their own limits based on their personality. And in this show, only handicap is Angelo's decision on Nero, but it had a reason (you will see in the end).\\n\\n\r\n## Enjoyment\\n\r\nYou will enjoy every moment.\\n\\n\r\n## Finally\\n\r\nYeah, very good.",

            "content": "Okay, I never expected it to be good but it surely exceeded my expectations, usually i find genres involving mafia, guns, gangsters.. etc. to be just pure action and fireworks anime, which for me is kinda dull and overused, maybe that's the reason i wasn't really looking forward for this one, but it convinced me by around the sixth or seventh episode, i guess what made it different from black lagoon or any similar anime from the same genre, is the intense execution of the story, the goal of the story, which was actually being carried out throughout the whole series, it never diverted, usuallystories related to revenge, vengeance, specially in recent years, you see an exciting plot and a potentially good series but things get ruined halfway because most of them divert, or just totally try to distract the viewers, sometimes it makes me feel like the existing plot's main purpose was to attract viewers without actually going along with it fully, there are many anime ive seen that revolve about the idea of vengeance but i can't remember seeing one that went through with it to the very end, well this is a one thing, other trait that made it stand out between all the similar shows from the same genre was the genuine drama and the real tragic atmosphere that many recent works lacked, gangsta being the newest one. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nthe story doesn't attract people who've been disappointed before with something similar, but once you actually see it everything changes, but that gives it a good old 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: great set of characters, very unique indeed, realism was kinda lacking not noticeably if i say so myself, the variety of characters that stood out in a short amount of time was something worth complimenting, i felt very close to the two main characters and i felt the all around intensity of their relationship, i know it sounds corny but i think i connected very well with everyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI've seen few fantastic works this summer but this one was definitely the most enjoyable, without a doubt, it had pretty much everything an anime from its genre should produce, Dark atmosphere, actual genuine drama, and a good story with a great execution, absolutely no attempts in tricking at any way. I just loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nan 8 for me isn't a big deal but not always actually, i have grades for \"9\" and its actually the most charming grade i could give to a show, it expresses many emotions between bewilderment to honor, i give 8 in an attempt of doing my list justice, \"8\" is the savior and the most graceful grade, it symbolizes the great and the less great, when its too good for a 7 or a bit deficient for a solid 9, thats when an \"8\" comes in.",

            "content": "(It's 2AM and this is my first anime review. Bear with me.)\r\nTHE SHORT OF IT:\r\nLet me say this straight. 91 Days is an anime you should watch for the thrill of it---ignore the animation quality slips that newborn-studio Shuka is still outgrowing. This is a highly story-driven, character-development heavy show with a very twisted but still realistic plot that likes to seduce you into thinking you got her all figured out. 91 Days is quite the summery masterpiece, although with (jarring) flaws; and it is the gritty mafia, Prohibition era revenge anime you want.\r\nFair warning, however. There will be blood, but the murder-happy beware! Thisisn't Re:Zero or Hamlet!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (rounded up 8.5) - Technically I've placed 91 Days as 10 on my list although here it's 8.5. That's because I'm being more critical here for the sake of review. I'm a writer who's always looking for a good story and 91 Days delivers a freaking great story with just enough meat for people to analyse or to just enjoy. However Shuka's growing pains are still, well, pains.\\n\\n\r\nRATING EXPLANATIONS:\\n\r\nSTORY (10) - I sat with excited anticipation for every episode, my emotions shifting wildly like Angelo drives his car (you'll get what I mean if you watch). Like I said, it's one to watch for the brilliant, bloody plot.\\n\\n\r\nART (6) - I love Shuka like I love my phone. It's fast and fluid and wonderful when you first get it and the unboxing experience is heart-pumping. But like a phone, the more you store in it, the slower and clunkier it gets... But it still runs like a charm sometimes! And that is baby Shuka as they pour everything into the story. Question is: do you accept that your phone is dying? Or do you replace it?\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9) - The OP and ED are cinematic and touch up 91 Days like sprinkles on ice cream. The OP acts like 2 minutes for you to gird ye loins. The ED is the first few seconds after the rollercoaster comes to an end, as you figure out how to walk again. The OST was great, but as a story-junkie, I lost track of it at times. But when they really want you to listen, oh my do you really listen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10) - Amazing. Actual writer goals. Shuka's writers for 91 Days are brilliant at character development---whether it's over 1 episode or over the whole series. Realistic, dirty, crazy, family-loving, friendship-bound: each named character is multi-layered. Just as they should be.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9) - Originally a 10, then I wrote the explanation for the Art rating. As I've said, it's a thrill to watch. The episodes all seemed too short. They left you wanting for more story, more of these characters, more of this world and situation! If you can forgive Shuka for the animation, the joy is grand.\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Ratings: Character Design - 10 ; Directing/Cinematography - 8 ; CGI - 8 ; Pacing within Episodes - 10 ; Pacing Overall - 9 ; Seiyuu - 10",

            "content": "\"Why is the pineapple can there?!\"\r\nAnyway the show is good. It's definitely for you guys who like mafia stories with Japanese characterization. The art is okay at close-ups but really sucks at portraying landscapes. I dig opening song but that's just about it.\r\nIt's an anime that you'd have fun more if you follow the week's progression instead of actually binge it, but nonetheless it's still a good anime.\r\nThe storytelling can be jumbled up sometimes. Mafia movies always related to how many characters they try to introduce, but in the end, only some of them can stand out, and in this case, Avilio/Angelo and Nero areboth in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the episodes you will see Angelo's attempt at revenging his family death, the Lagusas, that he knew was done by Vanneti family. The story revolves around internal conflict and mafia politics as usual, yet they all seemingly not the main point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe true point of the story relies on how Angelo acts as a character. The wounded character shows his sleek plan towards 12 episodes only to see what his revenge actually does to him at the finale. I must tell you, it's something quite shocking yet to be expected in this kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: I hate Vango for some reason, mainly because I think he doesn't deserve to be in this universe. Shows like Baccano should've done him more justice.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Seven years ago, a dispute within the mafia lead to the violent murder of the Lagusa family save for their youngest son who escapes into the night. Years later, hollow and lusting for revenge against the Vanetti Family, young Angelo Lagusa (Kondou Takashi) is offered an opportunity to fulfill his ambitions when he receives a mysterious letter detailing the family members involved that night. Returning to Lawless, a town steeped in the black market liquor sales of the prohibition, Angelo takes up the name Avilio Bruno and befriends Nero (Eguchi Takuya), the eldest son of donVincent Vanetti as he takes the first steps towards exacting his terrible revenge.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nBeing the organized crime drama that it is, 91 Days hosts a fairly substantial cast of characters in order to really flesh out the mafia dynamic of each of the families and provide a genuine feel to the cast. And that\u2019s what most stands out about the characters of 91 Days, their authenticity. The show focuses heavily upon Angelo and his relationship with his close friend Corteo as well as Nero as they each subtly develop as the narrative progresses. While the supporting cast isn\u2019t given this same kind of attention, the number of named characters, of family allegiances, and minute character details brings them to life. None of these people are good or evil \u2013 they all operate based on circumstance, because of their past, the family, and their future. They might not all stand out distinctly in the long run, however the atmosphere they provide and the legitimacy of their portrayal is striking and adds immensely to the story.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk briefly about Angelo, he\u2019s a husk of a person. He lost everything when the Vanettis killed his family and ever since has fostered a deep-seated hatred for them that drives his revenge. He isn\u2019t all that diverse of a character as he keeps his emotions quite muted and though the show at times eludes to his underlying feelings or humor he mostly conducts himself in a stiff and methodical manner. This isn\u2019t somebody who has been driven mad by his hate but rather someone who feels they have nothing left to live for, who desperately latches onto this chance of retribution in order to give their life meaning again.\\n\\n\r\nAngelo\u2019s humanity, whether he fully throws himself into his vengeance or finds a new way to live again, is what is held in contention throughout the show \u2013 at times wavering and solidifying with each dramatic movement. To Angelo, his very existence is pain. His cleverness makes him interesting to watch as well and the way in which he goes about manipulating others and steadily carrying out his plans paints an engaging story even early on in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNero is an interesting character as well. As the eldest son of the Vanetti Family, he embodies the mafioso ideals of family above all else. The Vanetti\u2019s continued existence and image mean everything to him. His relationship with Angelo, known as Avilio to him, influences both characters a good deal and is one of the major cruxes of the show. In the same way that the supporting cast doubles and triples down on their excellent portrayal of the 1930\u2019s mobster atmosphere, Nero breathes life into the narrative through his strong sense of family and responsibility.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps more than anything else, 91 Days is a show about presentation. The setting, the character designs, the color palette all ooze that iconic mafioso charisma and panache. The most outstanding visual quality of the show is its directing which features great shot composition, a film-esque sense of perspective, and great subtext which feeds into the show\u2019s foreshadowing and complicated appeal. Homages to other famous gangster films as well as The Godfather were also included, emphasizing the passion and vision behind the show\u2019s visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has a lot of emotive movement which further emphasizes the authenticity of the cast however the character designs can admittedly look off-model at times and low quality. Small details such as attention to gun handling and reloading bring everything together atmospherically in a believable and immersive way. The various backgrounds and scenery of the show look fantastic and while they are delivered in a slightly different style, their subdued colors and earthy tones fit the setting incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off to a thrilling beginning, opening on the appropriately brutal murder of the Lagusa family and young Angelo\u2019s escape from the residence. It was a strong hook into the show, starting off with the flashback to 7 years ago and ending with a bootleg deal gone wrong while establishing the setting and various mafia names and interests. From the get-go, 91 Days makes it clear what kind of show its going to be \u2013 a bloody period piece delivered in a muted aesthetic with a western-style dramatic narrative. It follows up on this over the rest of the show substantially well, launching right into Angelo\u2019s revenge plot very early on and featuring tons of world-building details such as family politics and territory disputes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not all that thematically complicated, the show\u2019s use of foreshadowing and imagery is put to good use and underscores its presentation-centrique style. 91 Days is slow and methodical in how it unfolds, placing a lot of its appeal in its grounded atmosphere and stylish cinematography. It\u2019s not so much thrilling as it is tense and high-strung, slowly building to a grand finale at the end of the show but for the most part avoiding doing so on a scene by scene basis. This generally will mean that 91 Days will expect a bit of patience out of its viewers and might seem to drag on or loose focus for those that aren\u2019t as invested. While it\u2019s slow to unfold, the show lives for its big, payoff moments which happen frequently enough. These are big developments in the plot and sometimes quite interesting twists in the story which keep things entirely engaging as the show builds towards its ultimate conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the show was great. In more lighthearted times it was jazzy and upbeat but once the drama and intrigue set in it was able to match the tonal shift. This is what I feel the soundtrack did best. While its tracks weren\u2019t individually memorable, the music\u2019s ability to match the show\u2019s different modes and accentuate the story at each turn was impressive. As the narrative sat brooding, as it climbed, and as it climaxed, the music was there at each stage emphasizing the scenes exceptionally well, especially towards the end.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\n91 Days was thrilling and dramatic and absolutely overflowing with style. While it wasn\u2019t as engaging at every step of the show as it was at its peaks, those big, dramatic moments that strung everything together were highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave 91 Days an 8 because of how each of its elements, its characters, its story, and visuals, all fed into one grand, immersive presentation. While the characterization of the cast was kind of subdued, they were a good deal of fun regardless of this. The show had a handful of unexpected twists and a great ending which tied together its most decisive elements.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nI think because of how heavily the show relies on its sense of style and subject matter, that those viewers who know they enjoy the kind of gangster, mafia stories will undoubtedly enjoy the show more than others. That isn\u2019t to say it can only be enjoyed by those people as I myself don\u2019t have a history with those films or shows but it certainly lends itself better to some audiences. It\u2019s got a lot of great drama and should entertain anybody looking for a solid revenge story.",

            "content": "Very few anime these days tend to do something different from the norm, and when something does do so, it\u2019s very easy for it to fail. But even if they are failures, their ambition to do something different is respectable. 91 Days is not only a unique anime, but a good one too. It\u2019s fairly rare to find a series that takes place in a western setting with mafia characters taking place during the post-WWI era. 91 Days takes that setting and adds a story of revenge to it, and it\u2019s a story that is handled great and executed well. 91 Days manages to bea thrilling and stylish mafia story from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Angelo Lagusa, who\u2019s family died in a mafia dispute, is now hungry for revenge and is willing to destroy the Vanetti family, the ones who killed his family. Changing his name as Avilio, he becomes the Vanetti don\u2019s son\u2019s right hand man, only to break the family from the inside. Overall, the story is handled pretty well and a lot of sub-plots get introduced along the way. The series not only focuses on Avilio\u2019s revenge, but also focuses on the Vanetti\u2019s relationship with each other and other competing families. The main story about revenge gets put in the background during the second third of the series, but the series still manages to entertain with its subplots. But it\u2019s the last third when the main story comes back, and that\u2019s when the series reaches its heights. The ending might be a mixed bag for some, but I appreciate how it was executed and it\u2019s the type of conclusion I wanted from this series. However, if more of the main plot was present in the series, the series as a whole would\u2019ve been more enjoyable.\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen the key visuals, watched the PV and read the synopsis, it should be well apparent that the series is a very unique one and it\u2019s hard to find something like this. The anime takes place during the prohibition era and the series does a good job in depicting that setting. Characters act and behave how they should be in that era, and buildings and clothing match the setting. The tone of the series is mostly dark and gloomy and it consistently stays like that for the rest of the series. Humor is quite rare, but there are some slightly funny comments made by certain characters, but overall, the series still retains its serious tone. The pacing is a generally speaking alright, but it is a little inconsistent. Things slow down a little in favor for more building and more development for its subplots, but the pacing picks up in the final third, however things do appear to be a bit rushed. But overall, 91 Days does a good job with their setting and tone. \\n\r\nPresentation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters in 91 Days are really good, unique, and well handled. Our protagonist, Angelo Lagusa (or his alias Avilio Bruno) is a really well-handled character who\u2019s thirsty for vengeance. His goal and believable and understandable, even if what he does isn\u2019t always the good choice. He has flawed characteristics that make him a complex character with immoral, yet not incorrect, goals. Our other main character is Nero Vanetti, who is the son of the Vanetti\u2019s don and Avilio is his right hand man. He has a cheerful personality, but he gets serious when he needs to be. He is a really good character and is used well in the story. His and Avilio\u2019s relationship is showcased well and he becomes more complex in the second half. The series features a lot of other characters that are likable or well handled, like Corteo and Fango. Some of the supporting characters were a slight bit weak, but overall it was alright. Just remember: Fango makes the best lasagna\u2026\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe studio of 91 Days, Shuka, doesn\u2019t have the best reputation when it comes to their consistency in art quality. As seen in their previously made Durarara!!x2 series, the series had plenty dips in its quality. However Shuka, for the most part, keeps the art quality in 91 Days consistent and pretty. First of all, the character designs are really well done. All character designs match their setting and personality. I liked the fact that Avilio had a simplistic look to him, despite being the protagonist. The setting looks great and the buidlings are matching its time period. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed and its bleaker color palette works nice and complements the tone of the series. The character detailing is alright and lighting is really good. Overall, the art quality manages to stay consistent most of the time and so far is Shuka\u2019s best looking series.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nJust like their art quality, Shuka is also well known for their animation quality drops. However, 91 Days is an exception as the animation quality also manages to be just as consistent as its art quality. For the most part, the series is animated fluidly and there\u2019s no noticeable animation quality drops. 91 Days isn\u2019t that action-heavy, so there\u2019s not many moments where Shuka needs to put extra effort in. But when action is present, especially gunfights, the animations stays consistent and looks really good. The backgrounds are pretty well animated and the lighting is put into good use in the series too.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast also does a really good job in representing their characters and adding more to the atmosphere of the series. Kondou Takashi did a great job as Avilio as he was able to showcase his character\u2019s vengeance and hostility, while making his character have subtle expressions. Eguchi Takuya, who is one of my favorite seiyuu, did a great job as Nero and got his cheerful attitude perfectly well. He does a really good job during his character\u2019s serious moments too. The supporting cast is also made up of pretty talented seiyuu like Sakurai Takahiro, Ono Daisuke, Nakamura Yuuichi and many others, and they all do a very good job. Overall, the cast does a great job in depicting their characters, especially the two main characters.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in 91 Days is also really good and elevates this series. The OP, \u201cSignal\u2019, is done by the same person who did that extremely popular Tokyo Ghoul OP, and he did a very good job with the OP for 91 Days. It\u2019s almost on par with \u201cUnravel\u201d and it\u2019s better than the Psycho-Pass OPs. The vocals are top notch as expected from him, but the music is good too. The ED, \u201cRain or Shine\u201d, doesn\u2019t have much lyrics to it, but it really matched the series, plus the vocals are really good. The background music in 91 Days is pretty good and matches the context of the series. It has more of a western and 20-30\u2019s feel to it, and it matches the atmosphere of the series well and makes scenes have more impact. \\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI had high expectations for 91 Days as I like anime with a westernized feel to it, and when I found out that it\u2019s a revenge story that takes place in the prohibition era, focusing on mafia characters, I couldn\u2019t hold my excitement. After feeling slightly underwhelmed from Joker Game, I thought that 91 Days can be the next Baccano for me. Luckily, 91 Days didn\u2019t disappoint as I found it almost as enjoyable as Baccano. The main story was really intriguing and I really liked the characters and setting. And the final third of the series was really intense and was a satisfying payoff for a series like this. Though the pacing wasn\u2019t the most consistent and some of the sub-plots weren\u2019t as exciting as the main story, overall I got a lot out of 91 Days.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, 91 Days manages to live up to its potential and it is just what you would want from this series. Revenge stories aren\u2019t quite common in anime, especially ones that take place in the post-WWI era, so seeing an anime like this was a fresh breath of air. Though the series isn\u2019t perfect, especially with its pacing, but the series manages to be an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. The final third of the series in particular is amazing and all the buildup leading to it payed off well. Avilio manages to be one of the best protagonist of the series and his motives are complex and his hunger for vengeance was well depicted. 91 Days is easily one of the best series of the season and you\u2019re missing out if you\u2019re skipping this one. \\n\\n\r\n+ It handles it\u2019s prohibition era and mafia setting perfectly well.\\n\r\n+ The main story, focusing on Avilio\u2019s revenge, was really well done and is really satisfying. \\n\r\n+ Amazing final third as all buildup pays off well and things get really intense \\n\r\n+ Both Avilio and Nero are well handled characters with contrasting personalities. \\n\r\n- Pacing remains inconsistent things start to slow down in its second third, and the conclusion is slightly rushed.\\n\r\n- Some of the sub-plots are slightly underwhelming, especially compared to its main story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "91 Days is a pointless revenge story which leaves an aftermath of pointless deaths in the end. I love it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis is basically the story of Angelo plotting his revenge against the local mafia family for killing his parents and brother. He takes up a false name and infiltrates the family in order to bring his revenge to fruition. You can easily see it in the OP that it will result in a final duel between Nero and Angelo. From the summary, is a good ending expected? Hahahahaha. No. That's the point which the shows hammers in from the start. Revenge is pointless and leavesboth parties worse off than when they started.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nFair, considering their low budget. Wonky character models here and there. Distracting, but overall, not unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nGreat background music. Jazzy. Sometimes silly. Very post-WW2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nDuring moments when he's not obsessed with revenge, Angelo starts seeing things from the other end. His family was killed not because of anything personal, but it's just business. The gang he hates so much are pretty much just regular guys. Eating normal food. Discussing normal stuff. Fighting normal turf wars. They're not the abominations Angelo thought they were when he started.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is intertwined with mob wars and intra-family conflict. You're already fighting off a rival gang who wants your territory, and now there's a large outsider gang joining in as well. Do you fight or do you negotiate for peace? Everyone in the family has their own opinion on this issue and they're really vocal people. That guy who's warming up to the rival gang. Is he a cowardly traitor or does he think peace is a good option? The other guy who wants to fight. Is he a warmonger traitor or does he think that nothing good comes from conceding to rivals? Everyone thinks about the family's \"good\", but what is \"good\" to begin with? Just because you're family, it doesn't mean you're safe. What you think is good for the family, another thinks it's cancer. \\n\\n\r\nThe pressure both from without and within can be seen on the character's faces. The more stressed out characters get black sleepless rings around their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat story hampered only by art and money. It's very good and worth watching. Could've been a masterpiece with a greater budget. But it's an A+ effort from a small studio.",

            "content": "91 days is a series with an interesting premise. It's a crime drama set during the US prohibition. I'll let you al know right from the outset, I'm not going to know how historically accurate it is. I am basically familiar with what happened during prohibition. There was an amendment making alcohol illegal, Crime rates surged as it became a criminal commodity. After thirteen years it was repealed with another amendment. I don't, however, know the specifics. The point is, if the series gets something historical wrong I probably won't catch it. The anime was handled by Shuka, a studio best known for producing Durararasequels. Six of the nine series they've produced were based on Durarara light novels. Two of the others were 91 days and a recap for 91 days. So, I haven't looked at anything by them before. The series was written by Kishimoto Taku, the same gentleman who wrote the anime adaptation of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi. Of course, that was an adaptation and this is an original work. Let's take a look at how he does with this one, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAngelo Lagusa's life changes completely on one fateful birthday. His parents and brother are murdered by Mafioso that his father has ties to. He manages to escape, takes on a fake name and learns to survive. Seven years later, he receives a letter from someone claiming to be his father's friend. The letter is unsigned and gives the names of three people. Supposedly, the people who killed his family. With the letter in hand, Angelo returns to the town of Lawless, which is probably entirely fictional, in order to take violent revenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the narrative is with the flashbacks. There are quite a few and they generally don't contribute anything. They just kind of waste time. The final episode also jumps around quite a bit. Again, it doesn't really contribute anything to the narrative. You just see an event, then an event that took place prior and then return to the event and then see another that took place before. There's no narrative reason that the episode shouldn't have just been in chronological order and it's the only episode that jumps around that much.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the narrative is really compelling. While the whole revenge narrative is nothing new, 91 Days gives us one that's well told, overall. It has some strong sources of tension surrounding Mafia work and Angelo's hidden agenda. It also keeps things interesting by having Angelo come up with complex, clever plans in order to carry out his objectives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the series falters a bit. The main cast does have quite a few interesting characters with developed motivations. However, the supporting characters are largely generic mobsters Angelo himself is kind of the standard hero for revenge narratives as well. About the only thing that sets him apart is his dynamic with Nero, which, in all fairness, is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is nicely done. The backgrounds have nice details, particularly when it comes to cityscapes. The action sequences are solid. The characters are varied. The various objects like guns and vehicles are well drawn & animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has some strong acting. Kondou Takashi and Eguchi Takuya both give strong performances. Tsuda Kenjirou is really good as the complete and utter nutter, Fango. Saito Soma also does really well. The music is nicely done as well. Kaida Shogo did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Angelo and Corteo is a bit suspect. They both seem to value the other over themselves. Whether it's an incredibly strong friendship or beyond that is debatable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n91 Days isn't among the best series I've ever seen. That being said, it is really good. The narrative is compelling. The major characters are interesting, mostly. The acting and art are both strong. I would recommend it if you're the type of person who likes revenge narratives or if you're into historical dramas. My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Sket Dance.",

            "content": "I dunno why is this anime getting all the hate, cause for me, it's definitely one of the gems of '16 summer. An advice from a tired anime fan- don't listen to people on this site, you yourself are an amazing person and only you should be the judge of everything in your life, including anime. So, watch it yourself first, later, come back to read some butthurt reviews.\r\nSTORY: 9/10 \r\nSo I've heard people say that the story is so overdone and that there is no point in even creating this anime. I agree that it may not be the most original idea around. Butwhat makes a good story? Is it time travelling? Is it something that you have never seen before? Not necessarily. You see, most of the time the charm of the story lies not in the premise itself but rather in the storytelling. And let me tell you this- this anime is told in a very grim way, subtly shaping its characters. It is paced well. Even though you can probably tell what's going to happen next, you still find yourself striving for more, waiting for another week to pass by. There are a lot of psychological elements, so you always keep your eyes open, catching those little details that make the story all the more enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nNot the greatest thing around, but it does help set the mood. There are poorly executed scenes, but they aren't really an eyesore, believe me. I've seen worse. To be honest, I liked the character designs. The scenery could have been more detailed and stuff, I agree.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10 \\n\r\nIt's not distracting, fitting to the times that the anime portrays, and compliments the scenes very nicely. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThere aren't a lot, but the are great. You know that feeling when you're playing a game and you go down the genocide path, become an evil guy and have to fight good guys in order to win? When you're facing a boss and you're hoping that he'll win? That's how I felt when I watched 91 days. Our protagonist most of the times seems more like a villain, but he has his share of quirks, that are nice and shape his personality. He isn't just revengeful spirit- he has some deadpan humor, he has some human feelings, he makes decisions that make you question yourself and whether or not you're really hoping that he'll get what he wants. Nero is a very charming character, with his share of quirks as well, plus, it's anything but boring to watch those two, each with different ideology and purpose, interact. And it always leaves you wanting more!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nIt had it's downfalls, but it was very enjoyable. If you're a kid that can only enjoy it when everything's spelled out for you, when there's a clear line between good and evil, when harems ensue, this isn't for you. This show is for an adult audience, an audience that appreciates a splendid story telling and subtle characters. I feel sorry for people who rated this anime badly, cause it only proves that to this day anime community is infested with people who can't appreciate something different than you're everyday mediocre anime. \\n\r\nCan I just say that the ending was epic? To be honest, most of anime these days is either unfinished, so it leaves you hanging, or it's ended in a very distasteful way. This ending is fulfilling and gripping, overall 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, just give it a try. Prove that you're not a weeb 12-year old that only watches anime to fap to some flashing panties. ///you can hear a bunch of triggered weebs crying out in the distance, clutching their anime figurines to their chest, repeatable hitting the report button.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.\\n",

            "content": "The very funny thing about this show, is the fact that the name itself doesn't seem to make much sense. But, many would guess that this is the amount of time that our MC will actually revenge his fucking family by killing everyone that's associated with the murder. But really, It makes no sense, nor does it imply anything about it. But what really get me to actually watch this anime, was because it have been so long since i first see an anime with so much realism in the plot involving the revenge thing, and the setting of it. Or some may says thatthis anime kinda reminds me of Baccano or some shit because of the artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nOn the very first sight, all of us (and myself) may have thought that this anime was just a simple ass story about a guy who seek revenge, and will most likely kill them when he have made it in the end. However, the way the author wrote this story is pretty interesting in many ways. Including many different factors involved in the relationships between the MC, the killers, and his childhood friend, Corteo. The complications doesn't stem from the plot in itself, but its setting and the relationships between families, people and the MC. The very odd thing about this anime though. That would be the unfitting artstyle for western characters in the show with japanese fucking looking facials, and their looks basically. And the Fango guy who looks like some dude from the carribean, or a pirate movies. In addition to that, the relationship kinda got me confused, and pretty much surreal as fuck. At times it does makes alot of sense, but later on in the story, especially halfway towards the ending episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle may lack consistency as you progressively watch the anime, and you may also noticed it as well that the animation aren't that good in comparison to other show with good budget and shit. But this never been a problem to me while i watch this anime. Since I actually came to watch for the sake of the plot, and its twists in it. And dont forget about that amazing movie vibes with its cinematography, and cinematic techniques involves. Half of its OST is very fitting to the setting and the characters, but some of the OST sounded more eastern than western. But that's very rare when they decided to put those OST in. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the extremely structured plot in the mafias system, and its organization may confuses some watchers that haven't familiarized themselves with how the mafia and world in the past with them there works. So basically, many of its organization would call themselves, and its follower, their family. There're 4 main family that you've gotta familiarize yourself in order to really understands what's happening in this anime. Basically, there's the Vanetti (ones that killed our MC's family), Orco, Galassia, and the Lagusa families. \\n\\n\r\nThus, 91 day was a pretty well done one with the way they uses different elements in the anime, to either cause a conflicting thought of having an actual friendship > getting his revenge, different actions made my others that triggers different results, and the apparent character development and its effects of that in the story. And because this anime gives out a very movielistic vibes, i would recommend you to watch it in marathon in order to saves the vibes that the anime production gives out while you're watching, and to not get confuse about the shit that went down, or wtf just happen. I sometimes feel the lack of interest when i planned to watch 91 days as well, but that's different when i became watching it of course. But hey, that might just be me, but this anime is pretty entertaining man. Definitely give it a go if you're into these sort of genre. \\n\\n\r\nP.S the plot is complicate as fuck, i wouldn't really say that it's simple. There are tons of twists to the ending as well. Be prepare for that once you start watching it.",

            "content": "91 Days came so goddamned close to being great. Unfortunately, due to a few significant faults, it's merely good.\r\nIt's hard not to admire 91 Days for what it attempted, though. When it began, it immediately drew comparisons to Baccano, another mobster anime set in Prohibition-era America. In spite of this, though, 91 Days and Baccano are very different anime. Baccano was a romp, full of larger-than-life characters, absurd anime tropes, and fantastical plot elements. 91 Days is the exact opposite - it's dark, dry, and incredibly grounded. The only reason 91 Days draws this comparison so much is because it is the only anime thatit shares this setting with (and one of precious few about gangsters at all, let alone during Prohibition).\\n\\n\r\nSo it's hard not to admire 91 Days for taking such a unique setting. Better yet, though, it's such an anomaly in today's anime industry in that it is almost comletely void of anime-isms. There's no comic relief, exaggerated character designs, no goofy reaction faces, no shoehorned-in fanservice, and no overblown grandstanding while the protagonist sets off his revenge plan (as opposed to characters with similar arcs such as Light Yagami and Lelouche Lamperouge, for example). 91 Days sets up a consistently dark and realistic tone throughout, something it shares with almost no other anime. There's nothing here that would even be out of place in an American TV drama (on which note, I recommend the dub - the acting isn't amazing, but the tacky accents fit the tone far better than the rather pedestrian Japanese performances).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Angelo Lagusa, under the assumed name of Avilio Bruno, infiltrating the mob to avenge his family, who they murdered. He is spurred onto this revenge quest by an anonymous letter identifying three of the four mobsters who killed them. Angelo then has to get close to the three killers he knows, and identify the fourth, all without his cover being blown.\\n\\n\r\nThis creates a solid hook to keep up invested the series - watching Angelo devise his way through the mob keeps the tension up, whilst creating mystery over who the fourth person was and who sent the letter.\\n\\n\r\nIt plays out as a suspenseful thriller, as Angelo's revenge plot pits multiple mobsters families against one another, leading to a staggering death toll. You can expect multiple named characters to die in every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of 91 Days' greatest strengths - once the setup is out of the way, it moves at an absolutely breakneck pace, enough to keep you consistently engaged but never to leave you behind. Every episode* will kill several named characters, introduce more, add a plot twist, and make it all organic to the story.\\n\\n\r\n*\u1d49\u02e3\u1d9c\u1d49\u1d56\u1d57 \u1d49\u1d56\u1da6\u02e2\u1d52\u1d48\u1d49 \u2074 \u22c5 \u1d40\u02b0\u1d43\u1d57 \u1d52\u1db0\u1d49 \u02b7\u1d43\u02e2 \u02b7\u1d49\u1da6\u02b3\u1d48\u22c5\\n\\n\r\nWhile this pacing does make the show consistently engaging, it does come with a major drawback. The lack of any breathing room in the plot leaves little room to flesh out the characters, leaving most of them little more than a single character trait. While they are still passable, stronger characterisation could have made the drama in this series so much more engaging, especially when personal grudges drive most of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis hits the hardest when it comes to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe non-spoiler version of my opinion on the ending is this: It is not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe spoiler version is far more in-depth, so if you haven't seen 91 Days yet, please look away now (because in spite of its flaws it is still very much worth watching).\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile everything up until the final episode had been a nonstop rush of characters being killed, betrayed, betraying, and so on, by the time the final episode rolls around almost everyone is dead and Angelo's secret is out.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing we're still waiting for is for Angelo to kill Nero, Nero to kill Angelo, or both.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this happen? Well, your guess is as good as mine, because the ending is left ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the episode revolves around Angelo being tied up, switching from being in one person's custody or another, and eventually being hauled off with Nero where they have heart-to-heart conversations about why they did what they did.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this is that it hinges on our investment in the friendship between these two, which the series absolutely has not given us any reason to be invested in, no has it given us a reason to be invested in these characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt ends in an ambiguous scene that begs the question of whether Nero actually went through with killing Angelo, with hints that Nero may have died shortly thereafter as well.\\n\\n\r\nA better question is why we should care.\\n\\n\r\nAnother better question is, what was the point of making it ambiguous?\\n\\n\r\nYet another better question is, why not have the two confront each other, leading to one or both of their deaths in a tense and dramatic scene? This is, after all, what the series was building up to for its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hadn't decided to lean on its weakest element for its conclusion, 91 Days would have been an exceptional anime. It's almost frustrating how close it came, considering how out of step it is with anime as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: A unique anime with impressive tone and pace that lets itself down with poor characters and an unsatisfying ending. Still definitely worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nActing (dub): 6/10\\n\r\nActing (sub): 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Gungrave, Joker Game",

            "content": "I don't know which is more prominent at this point, lasagna or canned pineapples but I definitely know one thing - 91 Days /is/ worth the watch.\r\nTo say that 91 Days is like any other series that attempts to exploit the theme of \"vengeance\" is a slight understatement. Truly, the series works on Angelo's plans of \"an eye for an eye\". But it doesn't simply exploit how vengeance works in the mafia world, or how vengeance can drive you to be a cold-hearted bastard and ruin people's lives. Rather, it presents the question if revenge is really worth fighting for and that at the endof the day, will you truly find the happiness you believe you lost because of those who took it away from you? Would it not be better to live in the present and appreciate what is around you? It isn't that philosophical so fret not, it won't be a boring ride. The story achieves that by incorporating the theme of revenge into the main story where mafia groups attempt to overpower each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear to say that 91 Days has solid, consistent writing with the appropriate tone. They don't shove bullshit into your face (yes it will lose some of its pacing along the way) because by the time you finish the whole series, you will understand how they are inter-related and work to exemplify the significant of relationship formed between the main characters, Angelo and Nero. Even canned pineapples are significant. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you can actually predict each episode, really, I couldn't. 91 Days basically gives you the expectation of what may happen in the upcoming episode but always works to overrule every single expectation you have. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, 91 Days fails at the quality of its art. The animation lacks fluidity. It doesn't give viewers scenic views but instead a backdrop of lackluster colours, and lifeless buildings and objects. Then again, this does help to provide a serious, mature tone to the setting. If you have already watched the series, you may find that certain scenes have more vibrant colours in order to lighten the atmosphere and bring out the light interactions between the characters. Well, at least you make up for those sad backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather unmemorable. Especially when they look almost the same with the same hair colour. Those who particularly struck out (hair colour, hair styles) were of more importance (well, that's honestly nothing new). It fascinates me that there was no access into any of these characters minds, in a way dehumanizing them. Not that its a new thing but it really works when the camera techniques are nuance in its attempts of capturing the character's emotions, Avilio in particular who is the hardest character to actually read. The usage of certain close-ups, or even wide shots of Avilio made me wonder what Avilio is thinking at that moment, what is he planning, or is he genuine? Because of this, I struggle with my own opinions of certain characters because they would be subtly antagonized throughout the story. Without a reason behind their actions, unless stated, I was momentarily lost between who was right and wrong. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 91 Days is that one series you don't want to miss. If you've dropped it because you were put off by the slow pacing during Episode 4 and 5 or the art, give it another try until Episode 6 and see if you still enjoy it. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea though. I mean, you won't enjoy lasagna that much after watching that one particular episode.",

            "content": "EDITED FOR GRAMMER\r\nAh it\u2019s been a while since we've got an anime that veered away from the usual cliches and tropes that could be found in nearly every single show nowadays. I'm talking about the moeblob characters, the endless amount of exposition, girls getting their clothes ripped to shreds for the purpose of fanservice, spiky haired characters screaming their lungs out at their opponents and so on. Therefore it\u2019s refreshing to see a show that stays far away from many of these cliches and tries to gather inspiration from another medium instead: western gangster films. \r\nA 1900s setting, mafia members, tommy guns, the prohibition, boozeand lots of people getting turned into swiss cheese by bullets. This ladies and gentlemen is what 91 Days aspires to become. A show that takes many of its influences from gangster flicks such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. And it shows. There is a lot of emphasis on \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d which is a great storytelling choice that is highly lacking in modern anime to this day. Lots of things are presented to us rather than told through pointless exposition sequences and certain clues are left to the audience to figure out rather than just handed to us on a silver platter straight away. It\u2019s a show that respects the mature audience it\u2019s catering towards which is something I really appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is that of a typical revenge thriller. Some bloke called Angelo Lagusa witnesses his family being murdered by a collection of Mafia members and flees the scene of the crime to safety. Years later, he emerges under a new name: Avilio Bruno. His only goal: to obliterate the very men who were responsible for the death of his family and his one lead is a letter that points to the Vanetti Family as the perpetrators of the crime. This tale follows Avilio as he tries to get involved with the Vanettis in an attempt to stealthily pick his opponents off one by one.\\n\\n\r\nAs a revenge thriller, 91 Days pulls no punches. Don\u2019t get attached to any character in this series because it will wreck you emotionally in the end. A lot of characters die in this series as part of Avilio\u2019s revenge plan. Nearly nobody is spared. Blood will be split and the show only gets more brutal towards the end. At first I wasn\u2019t too blown away too much but later on the show presents itself as being rather unpredictable and able to catch audience members off guard with all the deaths and plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nBut unlike works such as Another, the show doesn\u2019t go all out with trying to make the series as shocking as possible. A lot of subtlety is added and the show is often a bit quiet and less dramatic compared to a lot of anime of this calibre. The tone is often sombre and serious, comparable to some western works such as Sicario than anything loud and dramatic. The pacing is also slow at times and the show itself is quite atmospheric, allowing audience members time to take in the feel of the show\u2019s setting. The series increases in terms of intensity with every episode but still keeps its tone relatively consistent throughout.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode (with the exception of 4 which acts as a breather episode) has a part to play in the overall plot of the series. However my biggest qualm about the series would be the ending. Every single episode towards the second half of the series seems to build up to a bombastic climax but the series never seemed to provide that. Instead there was no showdown nor were there many deaths. It was in fact quieter than anything else. It felt more like the earlier episodes of the series. Some audiences may be a bit let down by this if they were to be expecting some showdown or something along the lines of that. It was like the final two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion; its thematic powerful but most likely won\u2019t be remembered (at least not by me). Another flaw was that the show never seemed to portray anything new that wouldn\u2019t be found in any other revenge flick or gangster film. It seemed more like a homage than anything else, a love letter to a gangster film that the writers just happened to have watched and liked. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their voice actors all fit their roles within the grand scheme of things. Avilio is cold, calculated and sometimes even intimidating for a protagonist. Sometimes a little too cold; I was finding it hard to relate to him as his sole motivation was revenge, but later there were some moments that showed that he still had some life in him. Nero was more \"human\" compared to Avilio, leading to him almost being a complete contrast to him. But by far the best character in the series is none other than Fango. Imagine Ladd Russo mixed in with the craziness of The Joker and you have this crazy gangster. This character is so over the top that you will either love him for bringing some Baccano esque insanity and humor into this show or you will despise him for ruining the sombre mood brought forwards by the show from the very first episode. Nevertheless he is an outlier among all the other characters who seemed more down to earth. But the show also brings another problem to the table; the other cast members don\u2019t feel as memorable as these three. Some characters actually perish before we\u2019ve gotten a chance to know them and this diminishes a lot of their memorability and value.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw 91 Days offers is its animation. A lot of the fluidity and creativity we\u2019ve grown to love in certain anime is lost here and the show feels like its on a budget. Inconsistency is prevalent and off model shots are visible in many scenes. This isn\u2019t too bad considering that Studio Shuka is a relatively new studio, however more should be expected from a Studio that was in charge of the highly popular Durarara series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the lack of animation quality was made up for with the music. It\u2019s very reminiscent of old gangster flicks and compliments the mood of the entire show. Sometimes it intensifies when some of the more violent moments are shown. I\u2019m not an expert with the music component of shows but if you like soundtracks with a lot of calm, collected tunes and violins playing in the background, you\u2019ll love this.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to add would be the show\u2019s overall setting and world. The 1900s prohibition setting was well utilized here through its vehicles, to the prevalence of alcohol, to various store fronts and so on. In fact one way to tell how well the setting is shown to us as viewers is to watch the opening credits in the first episode as it presents shots of various different places and activities that would be visible in such a time period. Its architecture is also very unorthodox from most anime out there, which tend to dabble in the usual retro or modern era Japanese architecture or one that is very stylized. The show is grounded more in realism but due to some of its characters it doesn\u2019t forget that it\u2019s an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly enthralled from start to finish by this show. It\u2019s a nice breath of fresh air to finally get something that\u2019s more realistic and more devoid of the usual anime tropes in today\u2019s anime. There are no magical elements in this show which is something I was really surprised by; usually modern anime would include a lot of magic, time travel elements and so on. It\u2019s an outlier amongst the cesspool of mediocrity that summer seems to have given us and well worth the watch as a result. Anyone who is a fan of revenge thrillers or crime dramas with gangsters in it should give this one a try.",

            "content": "91 days is a historical drama anime that sets in the Prohibition Era of alternate United States . I was really hyped for this anime since the start of the summer season and boy did it showed. The anime gave us a an amazing presentation of the grim world of the mafia, somewhat realistically resembles what mafia families are like.\r\nStory: Its your standard revenge story but its somewhat more deep and personal alongside the character arcs and why the main character was so driven to achieve his goal into killing his family murderers\r\nArt: The art style reminds me of Durarara!! and Baccano. Color palates thatsometimes fit within the scenes well including the dark and somber moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Pretty Good overall, it plays like a film noir but not as a classic noir however. The sound design are pretty good to listen to especially the opening theme and the ending theme as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You can feel the life into the characters if that makes any sense. I feel like there much realism into the characters itself and not too over the top anime-like. Characters are well polished and their and each of their own motivations helps strengthens the story even more. Personally they are the highlight of this anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: From start to finished, i liked this anime even though its your standard revenge story but the characters itself proves itself you don't need narrative to tell the story its the characters\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pretty Awesome i would say about this anime. However i felt like it never lived up to its own hype as it did show some promise this year of anime. Sadly, another good anime with wasted opportunity",

            "content": "Prohibiton Era and a WHOLE LOT of Bloodshed and Revenge\r\n91 Days is a mafia-revenge story of one Avilio Lagusa voiced by Takashi Kondou and really 91 Days breathes in that classic mafia story a la \"Godfather\" from the aesthetics to it's similar plot beats.\r\nBefore LA talks about the \"classic mafia\" elements of 91 Days...let's get to the technicals.\r\nFor the most part, the characters all have the distinct characteristics, though yes it has that classic mafia cliche characters, from the one who wants revenge no matter what Avilio, Corteo voiced by Soma Saito, Avilio's best friend who gets roped into all this, Fango voiced by KenjirouTsuda, a no-holds bar unpredictable madman and leader of Orco family to Nero Vanetti voiced by Takuya Eguchi, one of Avilio's targets. If anything the plot can really kill off any character it wants to due to the nature of 91 Days and being a mafia-revenge story and all, the only two characters who have some sort of plot armour are Avilio and Nero until the finale (considering the anime poster...it's to be expected). LA can overlook it as well...91 Days is a revenge story...really we just don't know if Avilio's revenge will get him and Nero or BOTH of them killed off which makes the plot armour to these two rather unpredictable. In terms of character development, again due to the nature of these characters dying left, right and centre, you'd expect the deaths to be meaningless, unless your a main character or a part of Avilio, because certain character do get the shaft and they were developed quite nicely before their brutal exits...LA can't say who as that goes into major spoilers but you know the ones. Ultimately, even with the nature of this anime, it keeps it balanced and focused on it's characters, the development does focus on the characters who are crucial before their untimely exit but what development they gave is still enough for LA to care and it increasingly show Avilio's revenge to be more destructive and \"nothing to lose\" for him to succeed. Revenge is a typical motif in 91 Days and quite clearly shows that revenge leads to destroying others around you as well as yourself and it's shown as a manifestation of this theme most prominently in Avilio.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio Shuka, well it really feels like Prohibition era American mafia film styled animation, the character designs are well detailed and the gunfights are crazy to say the least. If the aesthetics to 91 days is anything to say, they invoke the classic mafia movie styling and LA would praise 91 Days for that quite easily. Though when it gets really dark, LA couldn't even point out who's who...yes even in gunfights but you LA's deal...we kinda NEED to see in order to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well considering that there are lots of *ahem* Engrish *cough* at times, nonetheless, when the voice acting gets serious, it gets serious. LA's favourite voice actor easily goes to Kenjirou Tsuda as Fango as his unpredictable volatile nature was a BLAST to see. There isn't much to say about the voice acting besides, it was great across the board and didn't stray away at any point with 91 Days serious tone, again keeping with the classic mafia tone.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot twists, really the plot twists comes in the unexpected/expected red flagged deaths, yes LA was rather mixed with these as 91 Days had a habit of trying to get us to be invested in some of these off-beat characters, then gives us some hint that they're gonna die soon, it didn't happen to EVERY character, just something LA noticed, the other plot twists comes in if any of the Vanetti family came to discover Avilio's secret plan that might jeopardize his revenge plan and this easily coincide with the \"unexpected deaths\" plot twists as well. Avilio's plan however is pretty rock solid until the finale, as most of the deaths are either intentionally cause by him in the name of revenge, without leaving any trace of Avilio in the process, a shadow behind the works as it were.\\n\\n\r\nNow LA keep saying \"classic mafia\" and really that is really where 91 Days might slip for some people, LA still enjoyed it nonetheless, having something of an original anime with this kind of theme to back it, but for others it being a \"classic mafia story\" can lead to TONS of cliches within this genre and thus can be easily predictable what gonna happen to it. This \"flaw\" really is the only \"flaw\" LA picked up while watching 91 Days as once LA picked up some hints, LA KNEW who was gonna die (not always but you get LA's point).\\n\\n\r\nThe finale...well it wouldn't be a mafia story without a massacre to go with it and there is A LOT, but from the focus to the families assimilating one another due to the result of Avilio's action really just to Avilio and Nero by the end of it and the fate of the our main protagonist is left nearly ambiguous bringing in that classic mafia cliche again, but it does really bring about what revenge can do to you which is manifested in Avilio but going by what the finale gave us, this \"cycle\" ends in Avilio.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is by all means an intriguing and refreshing anime with it's classic mafia setting and a revenge story. LA quite enjoyed it even with it's cliches, as well as it's interesting characters who have a target on their heads. Avilio's revenge leads to suffering which brings about more suffering.",

            "content": "Something that genuinely bothers me about a lot of brand-new anime that focus on adult-situated subjects is the lack of allowing the audience to gather everything themselves. They spoon-feed the story to the audience, aside from allowing them to use their brains. However, there are the very few that don't do that. I believe that this is that 1/1,000 series that lets the audience use their brain, and figure things out on their own. That is by far the most unique thing about the entire series, however, there is so much more to talk about when it comes to the most underrated show of thelast year.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite thing about this anime is the magnificent opening theme, \"Signal\" by TK. The song itself was so catchingly lively, yet so melancholic and beautiful. I could listen to it for hours on end, and now it has become probably my second-favorite opening of all-time. I know it's a bit of a stretch for a lot of people to say that this was so good of an opening that I would even say that it's upon that list. However, it's my opinion at the end of the day, and the 91 days opening is on my list for my favorite opening themes in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Studio Shuka was great. They genuinely put 110% into making this series feel like a classic mobster anime, which hasn't been done this well since Baccano! back in 2008. However, what this show does better than Baccano! in my opinion is establish the setting of the story, which it does surprisingly well. There is always an eerie atmospheric presence luring in the shadows of each scene, which made you question \"what was going to go wrong.\" The character designs as well were very interesting. I don't know if I would say they were unique, but they definitely were quite interesting to look at, especially Fango's. Fango was a creepy character which was done surprisingly well in the midst of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the fantastic voice-acting done by the dubbing cast. I watched this series in it's English Dub, which was fantastic. They all emulated accents and dialect in a manner that few shows I have ever seen have been able to replicate. Everyone working on the dubbing for this series, from the cast themselves to the ADR Directors, did a fantastic job. This was, in my opinion, one of my favorite dubs. Stellar work Funimation!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that this series surprised me with was the amount of focus on plot instead of simply focusing on characters. This show had serious emphasis on the story rather than character development, which was both a good thing, and a bad thing. Disregarding that much, the story was quite entertaining, from it's dark themes, to it's more light-hearted scenes, to the background of our main character, Angelo Lagusa. Learning about the story on why Angelo is even trying to do what he will was interesting enough, but seeing how strongly he simply to do it just shows how much he cares about this. The falling to darkness for Angelo was prevalent throughout the plot, as you can tell just how much he cares about this. Not only that, but the story's development throughout was nice and slick. I must also say that the story was slow-paced, but it worked well... for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've brought up Angelo, I feel like now's a good time to bring up the characters in the series. Angelo, our protagonist, is a troubled young man with simply nothing to lose, and one goal on his mind: Kill the Vanettis for what they did to his family. Seeing him plan everything out to eventually get what he's wanted all this time was really interesting. He was purposed character done right, because you could simply tell how much he was willing to give up in his life just to get revenge. Not only Angelo, however, but his partner and secret rival Nero Vanetti was also really likable throughout the series. He was super entertaining, from his foil to Angelo, being more upbeat than Angelo ever was, but he was also a really likable, nice, and trustworthy dude who didn't want to be involved in all the gang stuff. In fact, it was made quite evident that he didn't want to continue being a part of the Vanetti mob. I should also mention Angelo's friend Corteo, who was really likable, as he was just a good friend to Angelo, but it felt like Corteo lacked in development. Similarly, Fango was a really entertaining crazy dude, who just lacked in development. Aside from that small issue, most of the characters in the show were at the very least decent.`\\n\\n\r\nHowever, you have to take another look at this review before choosing my verdict. Assuming that I found this show flawless would be a poor assessment, as frankly, I did have some minor problems. For example, most of the characters in this show lacked on so much development that it hurt. For example, Fango was so bland of a character in terms of development, despite him being such a fantastic \"creepy guy\" character. His character, along with Corteo, could've been done so much better throughout the course of the series. It's not a game changer, but it was a bit annoying how they didn't get that much backstory given to them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that being annoying, my biggest problem with this show was undoubtedly the same thing that made this show so unique in the first place- the story. Though it was fantastic in it's execution, it was still quite boring at times, as it was quite confusing, to the point of pure boredom among the audience. That may just be me, because I have yet to see anyone else admit to being confused by a lot halfway through the series. Regardless of that much, it was still baffling to me how something would confuse me on such a level that actually wasn't speaking of how the team behind Skelter;Heaven and Mars of Destruction got their budget.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those insignificant issues, this series was still fantastic from it's gorgeous animation, to it's interesting story and characters, and utterly magnificent opening theme.Good crime dramas are a dying breed, especially in anime, but this show may just bring back the medium in my book.\\n\\n\r\nLater!",

            "content": "Preface:\r\nOccasionally, we get that one anime that could as well have been something else. Occasionally even, it could have been an American TV show. 91Days sure does remind you of that and, as a result, 91Days feels un-anime. Fortunately though, it _is_ a bit of a breath of fresh air and doesn't feel like a kneejerk reaction to the current state of the industry, attempting to save us from moe, unable to save itself from a financial disaster. It's no Under The Dog and to be honest, every time a project like this comes up that's seemingly more Western, a good portion of anime fansseems to assume just that. 91Days did not call your waifu a bug-eyed whore, chanting \"USA! USA! USA!\" on top of her corpse. Under The Dog did. There. Go fight that windmill. I'm sure it'll be a respectable foe.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for 91Days though, it's also hardly among the greatest I've ever seen despite showing promise.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this review contains spoilers. No individual scores though.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, technically speaking, is solid. The premise is simplistic. Masked men kill Avilio's entire family so he wants to see all of them dead in return. From that simple point on, you could go many ways and branch out. Unfortunately, 91 Days doesn't really do any of that and instead decides to keep being just that simple and restrained. For instance, there is little engagement from other characters and the plot is solely focused on Avilio. One could argue that makes sense as he is the key player. Quite frankly, that's not exactly it though. He's the only player. He is the only one on the move and that turns the entire matter into a rather one-sided affair. In other words, 91Days lack depth and complexity.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really, really hurts the show is its protagonist who never changes. He never doubts himself for one second, his revenge is a straight path and little else. That's not always a bad thing per se but once again, you're not exactly selling a complex, engaging character here or a plot highlighting several aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe acts of revenge themselves aren't even that bad. Quite the opposite actually, they are the highlights of the show. How will Avilio kill several people, highly guarded, in succession while getting away with it? That's an interesting question keeping you on the edge of your seat and the writing is clearly clever enough to come up with tricky scenarios and equally tricky ways of getting around those. The element of surprise, more often than not, is on 91Days' side. There admittedly isn't much of a battle of wits as the opposing side is way too passive for its own good but Avilio's hurdles are steep and seeing him overcome those and decimate those waning themselves to be on his side is a great source of entertainment. There's a bit of a goldmine of keikaku doori to be found with this one and that is very laudable.\\n\\n\r\nThat, however, isn't much of an excuse that Avilio has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There are traces of that every now and then but largely, he remains a flat character, going through the motions. Yes, that's what his character description intentionally states but it does not make for compelling character writing. At all. At the end of the day, you want to see the plans play out and little else, so whenever that isn't the case, the show suffers massively from pacing issues. Who cares about Corteo worrying about Avilio for an entire episode with the plot meanwhile being on a standstill? I certainly don't. Emotional investment is practically nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, while Avilio doesn't fare well as a character, the same can be said for everyone else involved. Corteo exists. His entire role in the show is to be the one human factor at Avilio's side, tossed into a world where none of the likes exist. From the very beginning on, it's apparent that Corteo is just there for the element of tragedy and nothing else. He did surprisingly well with killing Fango but given that that was yet another Avilio-driven action, it only gets the point across that Corteo is a character solely defined by his relation with Avilio, unable to function without him. Barbero, too, exists. He voices his suspicions but that's about it. The Barbero Corteo thing got absolutely nowhere at all and he, too, is entirely bound to another character, namely Nero. Barbero admittedly gains some points for being competent and perhaps the sole voice of reason in the show but never really succeeds with it. He's a passive element that's meant to be taken as a potential threat to Avilio but with absolutely no intention from the writing's side to get that anywhere, the entire subplot is all bark and no bite. Which could also be said for Nero. Even when Nero gets to be the boss of his family, he doesn't do anything. He might as well not have been the boss. There is only symbolic value to be found with Nero rising to the top before being robbed off everything but that's about it. Nero, too, remains largely passive. There are some attempts at humanizing both Avilio and Nero  along the way, take the entire showing magic tricks to kids thing or Avilio being really bad at driving but it's little, barely matters and the attempts are so obvious, it's kind of amateurish. With Fango, we have some tonally jarring issues as he is entirely too cartoonish for an anime that aims to be as grounded and realistic as possible. And yet, amusingly, he does leave the strongest impression among a pool of characters with no impetus on their own and barely any relevance to the overarching plot. At least that can't be said for the madman. The rest of the characters have names but little else can be found.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions aren't even particularly bad and the dialogues can be snappy at times, yet the main issue clearly boils down to these characters having been constructed with the sole purpose of being killed off. Some character relationships here and there so the tragedy of loss gets across but individually, they are weak. They are all part of a huge collective Avilio needs to get rid off and are sadly treated as such. The characters aren't individual human beings rather than roles. Frequently the same roles even.\\n\\n\r\nSo whenever 91Days tries to be a human drama, attempting to tell us something meaningful, it fails. And while there are some poignant moments, they are never really enough. It doesn't come close to, say, the Sopranos' deeper instances, occasionally dipping into existentialism. When, after several seasons, we have Tony ask himself \"Is that all there is?\" and seriously attempting to think things through, that's a powerful moment. 91Days, by comparison, feels rather hollow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the anime is essentially one big revenge plot, the payoff certainly tends to play a big part. Yes, the journey also matters but the premise, from the very get-go on, is one to care about results. Things can and will get very frustrating, however, with the anime itself stalling progress. There are plenty of instances where Avilio could have killed Nero but refused to do so, with more teasing than actual consequences being the result. There is reason as to why Avilio spares Nero until the end but given that that's the ultimate goal of the show, it feels like a huge anticlimax and a lot of postponing during the journey. And Nero potentially killing Avilio but perhaps even not, we'll just leave that for the audience to decide, was a huge buzzkill. But does it even matter? Isn't revenge ultimately pointless? Isn't there something to learn from all of this? Aren't the true 91Days the corpses we made along the way? \\n\r\nOh, wait, it does matter. Well, too bad.\\n\\n\r\nThere admittedly was some melancholy to the montage at the end of two killers who took everything from each other sharing a journey of bliss, even building up trust towards each other, only for things to end... whatever way they ended. It still doesn't make up for the 1,5 minutes of wave-watching I had to get through but at least the waves were properly animated. Yeah, I was just as surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"Revenge is bad and doesn't really make you feel any better. It's all pointless.\" moral lesson also felt tacked on. Yeah, who would have thought? I, for one, prefer my \"Nero shot a bird as he dislikes things that are alive and more expressive than Avilio. Avilio got sick of being even remotely human and turned into a pineapple can. Nero then traced back his own footprints and took off to Hawaii.\" interpretation. Now that's got some spark to it. Moreso than symbolic footprints at the very least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisual Execution:\\n\\n\r\nThe direction rarely ever excites although there are admittedly laudable attempts at times. The entire behind the curtains affair with Corteo killing Fango was really well-done for instance. Moments like those are positive surprises but few and far inbetween.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the rest of the visuals, art, animation, you name it. Shuka is Omori's new studio and in case you've forgotten, they were in charge of the Durarara!! sequels, with those ones' visual execution reaching the heights of mediocrity, oftentimes not even that and at their worst, the production problems got really, really nasty.\\n\r\n91Days isn't quite as bad as that but with its uninspired, just functional character designs, it's never been a good-looking affair to begin with and the production melt-down offed what little chance it had to impress visually. It was bad enough for the production to require the stalling of a recap episode. You're not watching this for the sakuga fx during heated gunfire or lively character acting, I can tell you that much.\\n\\n\r\nFor better or worse, I seriously, absolutely do not remember the OST. Take that as you will. No unqualified statements from my side of things then.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line:\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I can't really fault 91Days too much. It never does anything terribly wrong. None of the characters are annoying. I sincerely liked how, at the beginning, they tested the quality of the alcohol through its color. There was no exposition on that as it would have been the case in most other anime and that really goes to show that there is some fundamental quality to be found. More often than not, it's an entertaining little thing. Apart from some glaring issues, there is little it does badly. It also doesn't do a lot right however.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can be said is that you can't make much of a mistake by watching it. You could also always do better though. It works as seasonal entertainment where beggers can't be chosers but specifically going back just to experience the better moments of 91Days might be a bit of a fruitless undertaking.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it's mediocre. Admittedly at the decent end of the scale of mediocrity but oh well. There is some goodwill to be found as well as base competency down the line - but never too much of either, hardly making it beyond the premise of \"These people must be killed.\". Avilio never really felt like a character that got out of his wardrobe from back when he witnessed his parents' murder - and quite frankly, the same applies to the writing, never really leaving its familar ground, never really leaving its wardrobe either.",

This is a story about redemption...\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.3/10):\\n\r\nLiving a fun happy life until the night of the massacre, Angelo witnessed the murder of his parents and younger brother at the hands of a mafia group called the Vanetti family. Making a run for it at last moment and remained silent in hiding.\\n\r\n7 years later he was sent a message giving him the signal to start the long-planned revenge that started by him infiltrating the Vanetti family as a fresh member, climbing the ladders and taking down his family's murdered until he makes it for the top dog, the Don of the family. Along with his path to revenge, he becomes the best buddy with one of the murderers with only makes it far more emotional and hard to finish what he started. Would he disregard his feelings? would he leave everything behind and start anew? These kinds of questions happen to pass through your mind every so often while watching this show for how characters interact with one another.\\n\r\nThe story follows a linear path, no excessive flashbacks, and no rushing through the events. The protagonist plays his moves carefully and plans further steps ahead of the viewer every moment.\\n\r\nI really think that 91 Days stands out from other similar shows/movies with its fresh ideas that make up for the minimalistic clich\u00e9, as it draws heavily from the likes of The Godfather franchise.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI'm very open-minded about different art styles, and one that I don't get to see very often is this generic simplistic art style that represents people from western countries the best, it goes really well with the Victorian and prohibition eras, it adds a lot of realistic feel and depth to the characters as there are no overkill eyes that seem to cover half of the face or a super Sayan hairstyle that's out of this world. Everything adds depth to the era and help convey the message.\\n\r\nThe animation was good, above average most of the time but at its best on highlight moments, gun shootouts, knife fights, and hand to hand combat seem fluid and realistic, no over the top speed and nothing non-worldy.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI have to come straight and say this, this is one of those shows where the DUB is ways better than the SUB. Going through the prohibition era again, they absolutely nailed the accent, I had little problems with the female voice acting where it sounded very forced sometimes, but the main cast that had 90% of the show focused on them was just amazing. The soundtracks and sound effects were stunning as well, puts you in a strong mood to wearing a tuxedo and buying a luxurious classic vehicle and go for a hike on the countrysides.\\n\r\nI'm a begger for great opening and ending theme songs, and this one didn't disappoint at all. from the same artist(s) that made Tokyo Ghoul's and Psycho-Pass' theme songs. One would argue it doesn't fit the tone of the era, but it really suited the theme of revenge with its dark tone.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\\n\r\nThose weren't the best characters out there, but damn they weren't the least annoying, everybody was likable on their own way, aside from a few that were supposed to be disliked. They really pushed the boundaries and made you see the enemies, the people that killed the protagonist's family as humans, they feel for each other, they love, they care about their loved ones as well making you question morality in Angelo's revenge.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThere were those moments that really made me invested so much in the show I could have sworn I wanted to give this one a greater score if it weren't for some downfalls. Almost all episodes ended with a twist worthy of making you start the next episodes until you run out of them, a solid crime Anime right there.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThis one would be a hidden gem especially for The Godfather fans, it really is a solid crime show, covers a lot of historical themes and focuses on the might of mafia families and their powers, I would absolutely recommend this if you're in the mood for some old school crime thriller show.",

            "content": "91 Days is a perfect anime for fans of the Prohibition Era. It's true that it doesn't stand up to the king, \"Baccano!\", but it reaches a good spot, good enough to be mentioned.\r\nTalking about the Story, its a good drama and it rolls from episode to episode. It has a good pace. This only fails to the later episodes where they kind of need to rush the story so it doesn't feel heavy. Story and Characters are the best this anime has to offer. The characters have nice backgrounds and plots. You either feel for them or you relate (relate in a certain perspective,not because you are a gangster of any kind...i hope).\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are pretty dope!A lot of tension, smart moves and realism. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nProbably what gets this anime down its the animation. Sometimes it feels flat, dark (meaning you can't see) and the background images normally are not animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not that memorable. You may like the OP and the ED and some themes but I don't believe you will stick with it for too long.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the enjoyment is naturally outstanding, you will be on the edge of your seat/sofa/chair for at least most of the moments.\"91 Days\" knows how to present itself to the audience.",

            "content": "Imagine. Baccano without the random time skips and junk and instead of Firo, you have a crazy, revenge bent shell of a man named Angelo. You've got a lot of the storyline down.\r\n91 Days is a gritty anime about the mafia in Italy during the 1900's. This anime is more geared towards adults so it would be understandable if this anime isn't exactly your cup of alcohol. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe storyline is amazing with your daily dose of action, bonds of friendship, and dun dun dun moments. Here's your overview!\r\nA once lively and wealthy boy, Angelo Lagusa now is an empty shell of a man whohad witnessed the mafia take everything from him. His father had gotten mixed up into a mafia family's business and was killed along with his brother and mother. Angelo was lucky enough to be able to escape but had to live under a different name and go into hiding. His house was then burned down and all evidence of the murder was lost and labelled as a tragic fire accident. Angelo, now named Avilio, receives a mysterious letter telling him the names of the people that had killed his family and ruined his life. With a new purpose, Avilio sets out to infiltrate and kill the men that had taken everything, in a dangerous revenge mission on the wrong side of the law. Will he succeed or will Avilio find that all that awaited him at the end of his journey was death?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style definitely fit the gritty and adult theme of the anime in a very Baccano style. It used mainly darker colors and realistic palettes that helped with the mafia feel of all the scenes. I commend the producers for their shading as there were a lot of shadows in the right places.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime, being set in the 1900's, has a matching soundtrack. Each track has an older feel to it that helps to add that extra touch to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very lifelike and a few were quite relatable. Each one has great depth and they develop nicely. The character's interactions with each other just adds to how lifelike they are as well as the lifelike movements. Each one has plenty of flaws that is very refreshing, especially with all of the overpowered characters anime has been producing lately. These flaws are what make you so attached to these characters which is another reason why I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime was able to keep me at the edge of my seat as there were many moments were it seemed as though the characters were in a pinch. Avilio's journey was especially interesting as you're constantly afraid to see if his plans fail. In the mafia, death is always right around the corner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a great anime that I recommend you watch for those that like anime like Baccano or for those that just have a plain liking for smart but slightly off their rocker characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope that it gets more credit than it is now as I think the producers did a wonderful job.\\n\\n\r\nQuote!\\n\r\n\"Think carefully, then walk forward with purpose.

            "content": "91 Days is one of those rare series that doesn't get the praise it's due. There's a lot of subtlety here that can't be appreciated without the proper view. Naturally being a work of art like all anime, not everyone will find it to their liking. \r\nOne of the things about 91 Days that i just loved was the masterful way Angelo got his revenge. I guess to some people it would be confusing and hard to follow. Like, why doesn't he just shoot person A and be done with it? Or why not snipe them all from the rooftops, plant bombs, etc. The pointwasn't to kill them, it was to make them feel the same pain and suffering Angelo himself had suffered when he lost his family and was forced to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a very strong human element to the story that is quite easily missed and had I not been truly watching and instead simply enjoying watching anime (as is usually the case) I believe I would have found the series a bit confusing in more ways than one. There's a lot of dry humor in 91 Days, personally I love dry humor especially with expressionless characters, I ended up laughing way more than I felt I probably should have watching a more morbid series. I know some people don't like that kind of humor and unfortunately 91 Days didn't really have any other kind (at least that I noticed, which I'm also guilty of). Another confusing thing about 91 Days is that is jumps from one goal to another without explaining, personally I thought that was one of the things that made it so good, it gave it something of a detective type anime feel to it, I'm all about that stuff. This could get a little weird for people in the (Who the hell is this guy) kind of way. There's also a few hinted relationships (between Angelo and Strega and his family) that just leave you with a question mark hanging over your head. The series also switches between absolutely morbid (the lasagna incident and Orco, those who watched know) and absolutely hysterical (Angelo running people over with cars on 'accident'). \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has it's faults and I think to most casual anime watchers it would be a hard to understand show, but in reality this show is a work of art. It tells the story how it is and for once it doesn't change mid-way through the series and get all rainbows and butterflies and then horribly sad ending. I appreciated how human Angelo and Nero were, I loved that Angelo continued to hate Nero even though in the end he didn't want to kill him. The story painted the realistic picture of revenge and what it really cost you and those around you. It didn't make it pretty. It didn't have a happy ending (though the ending is up for interpretation). It was all very HUMAN and I loved that. I love Angelo's mastery of his skills, how he killed without regret but later on shows extreme distress after Corteo's death. Again, the human factor in this anime is the strongest I've seen in an anime in a very very long time. There's a lot of subtleties with human nature playing out in this series that I think a lot of the younger watchers wouldn't completely understand. There are also some complexities that are just beautiful to watch unfold before your eyes.   \\n\\n\r\n This is worth the watch if you tend to gravitate to the more mature or psychological thrillers but also enjoy a good laugh. \\n\\n\r\nI will say my one disappointment regarding the show was the OP. I had no issues with the music, rather it was the animation that bothered me. Maybe I'm just used to being spoiled (and even as I'm writing this I can comprehend the reason behind their decisions) but typically the OP has scenes or characters you can look forward to seeing in the anime. In 91 Days that's not the case, while this amps you up I was also disappointed because at one point I really thought the man with the glasses getting shot was Corteo (valid conclusion right?) nope, it's Angelo's dad. The OP is a mix of past events and normal mafia behavior, I was disappointed when some of the more interesting scenes never came up but understanding that the OP was filling in the blanks so to speak and showing the world that Angelo immersed himself in to get his revenge has it's merits. \\n\\n\r\nI could sit and write forever about this show but I'll wrap it up. For all of you potential watchers out there I recommend giving this show a shot, look at it through serious eyes ready to learn something about humanity instead of looking at it as just another show to watch. I will say the animation lacked in some ways but it never bothered me, it's anime so anime is anime in my opinion, it's not completely about the art and it's not completely about the story, merging the two in a way that works best for both so they can each shine together is what anime is supposed to be. (in my opinion).",

Personally I love all things Mob, Mafia, Gangs you name it, not to mention having a deep love for historical settings in the 19th and 20th century. I was weary at first as I always am when starting new shows but boy am I glad I did. I absolutely loved this show, the story and characters were compelling and the plot didn't get bogged down with unnecessary characters and romance. Some of the cinematography was simply beautiful and I was invested the whole way through binging it in one day. I'd say if you enjoy things like Durarara, BungouStray Dogs, Baccano, or hell even the Godfather i'd recommend this to you, or even if you just love plot driven and character heavy stories. Overall I'd say this a great and quick watch.",

            "content": "Seeing as this is only my second review on this here fine establishments website i humbly ask that you try to refrain from sh*ting all over my verbal balls but do indeed ask for constructive criticism. Much love.\r\nBrief summary: Our main man for this here pulse pounding plot is Angelo Lagusa, a melancholic young miser  that was orphaned as a result of the brutal back stabbing nature of the mafia. The plot follows Angelo on his quest for revenge but is more about the conflicting morality issues that arise as a result of circumstance from being a part of the \"Family\" rather than asimple black and white revenge story which added a phenomenal amount of intrigue for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nWhat puts this show ahead for me is the feeling of unease every time our protagonist is on screen, that his revenge could really come to fruition at any moment in any episode and you want him to have his revenge so badly but at the same time you really don't as it would end the most interesting character dynamic that exists in the show. It does an excellent job of dabbling in they grey area of morality rather than having a clear cut start goal and end objective. The whole plot hinges on a \"will he/ Won't he\" question rather than the standard kill the bad guy, save the day approach.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little fat to be trimmed from the story of 91 days with almost each episode containing three to four major events that heavily impact the overall story but if there had to be a gripe of mine it'd probably be the fact that it's kind of standard mafia movie set up. (you'll see what i mean at the end of the show)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI'm not much of an artist, don't know a whole pile about the fine lines people find in anime artwork but in my humble opinion the art does a great job of portraying the feeling of prohibition era America, to be more specific, the artwork had a very cool feeling to it and made me feel like a suave mofo whilst watching it. It's not a anime that requires a whole bunch of flashy animation, it does it's job in helping the main focus of the show (it's character interaction) move along.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nPhenomenal, fucking phenomenal. Most of the pieces used are orchestral ballads that perfect compliment the feelings of mystery and unease that are presented by our protagonists morale dilemma regarding his revenge. I didn't pay much attention to the music upon my first viewing of 91 days but i found the entire soundtrack on youtube and upon listening to it i could almost play the scenes in which these musical scores were used in my head which strikes me as having done a damn fine job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion are the driving force behind the shows appeal. Whether it's Angelo going from being a dreary sullen character to finding a reason to live and developing a sense of humor as he accompanies Nero Vanneti (Episode four remains my favorite due to this) Or Nero's usual calm, charming and in control character revealing his morale quandaries about his occupation and life.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's easy to prattle on about the main characters and their developments, Where the real joy lies is in the shows side characters, almost but not quite every one feels like a fully fleshed out character with their own reasons for living the lives they live be it the emotional but morally upstanding corteo, Vincent vanneti's true reasons behind why he killed his best friend or the sheer lunacy of personal favorite Fango (LLLLasssagnaaaa, remember it takes Fango to tango). But i find it difficult to write about all the characters that stood out to me in this show so take my word that it has a host of fantastic characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPure enjoyment, Should have been anime of the year in my opinion and although it does hold a strong score i still feel as if this show was somewhat looked over this year (Yeah I'm talking bout them crunchyroll awards, you fucks)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is a show that left me with a hole in my soul when it ended as i was completely invested in the characters, their relationships and their emotions. I wanted more than 12 episodes from a show entitled 91 days and spent the good part of an hour perusing the internet with tears in mah eyes after the show ended looking for any possible way in which the show could have continued. Watch it, Love it, Cherish it.\\n\\n\\n",

Couldn't help but finishing it.\r\nRevenges stories are always interesting but this one gotta be one of the best story out of them, heavy plot with an intelligent, VERY smart protagonist who keeps his cool and puts his emotions under control even when he's only inches away from his enemies. Angelo is the reason why this anime is so great! If it's another protagonist I wouldn't love this anime as much as I do now. \r\nEven when Angelo is so cold you still can feel his sadness, reallyattached to him and  understand his motivation. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much, each episode just takes my breath and in some scenes I couldn't control my tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: absolutely 10/10",

            "content": "Overall Rating: somewhere between 7 and 7.5\r\nWow...I completed misread this anime. I watched the first 2 and a half episodes and I was so bored. I nearly dropped it, but I kept seeing it get high ratings and accolades so I decided to finish it. It's only 12 episodes so hey, no big deal. I'm glad I did because it was definitely worth my time.\r\nI have a soft spot for any anime that has a Western setting or anything outside of Japan that involves lots of gun fights, booze, and characters with deplorable behavior. However, I almost always do not like Mafia stories. Maybe justAmerican Italian mafia stories (I loved Black Lagoon). They bore me. So picking up 91 Days was something I did extremely hesitantly. If you're like me and you're debating whether or not you want to spend your time watching because of that element, trust me when I say it's definitely still worth it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes 91 Days so gripping is how the revenge plot unfolds. The first several episodes are such a bore, it was a pain to get through them, but by the end of episode 5, I was hooked. After a certain point, almost nothing pans out the way you expect it. I can't count how many times I ended an episode with my mouth hanging wide open as each plot twist is so unexpected. With the amount of death in the anime you really shouldn't be surprised, but every murder is still a shock each and every time.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are a piece of shit and have just about 0 redeeming qualities except for Corteo. HOWEVER, given that this story focuses around the mafia you can't expect them to be bound by any sort of sensical moral center. I mean, these men go to church and talk about family but then won't hesitate shoot up the place in the next second. It's obviously a purposeful depiction of what the mafia was like that you're supposed to analyze, but I honestly just rolled my eyes at the hypocrisy and unabashed greed of the men.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is a revenge story, so you do end up empathizing with the main character because you understand his reasoning for revenge, but as it becomes his reason for living, nothing and I mean NOTHING will stand in his way or jeopardize his goal. He is ruthless until almost the very end so you'll probably experience a lot of mixed feelings and question a lot of choices he makes. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a decent amount of depth to the story and significant symbolism that you can get into if you like that sort of thing. However, while the mastery is somewhat there, the overall appeal is definitely lackluster (this may be in part due to the art which I will briefly mention after this) and does not at all match up to other revenge stories like Code Geass or Gankutsuou. The ending messages are deep but nothing to leave you in awe over. It's an obvious kind of final message for revenge stories as well as a commentary on the stupidity of gang violence. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely the weakest aspect of the anime and at first made watching all the more unenjoyable. The aesthetic was so blas\u00e9 and maybe its to fit the tone of the story (Prohibition era, Mafia, Gun Violence, etc.) but I'm thinking it probably had a low budget. I was not a fan in the least bit of the art and it is definitely nothing noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nStill, I highly recommend! It was a decent watch.",

It uses absolute realism, there is no plot armor, there is no coincidental anime cliche, none of it, absolutely none. It is quite immersive and also quite stimulating. The show is very dark and twisted, to the point the show portrays the protagonist as the bad guy, but no, heis not. They even had to put a recap episode along the anime just to remind you one last time, that the protagonist is indeed not a bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a realism anime comes with a realism ending, just how it should be. Dark, twisted and real. But goddamn that part where he tries to assassinate that guy! Who the *BEEP* does that! I mean seriously *BEEP*, i could have done so much *BEEP* better with my eyes close!",

            "content": "Anime: 91 days\r\nEpisodes: 12\r\nGenre: Action, Drama, Historical\r\nWell this anime is so interesting that I felt like I should write a review. Not writing may get counted as a sin. xD\r\nSynopsis:\r\nTesta Lagusa, The Consigliere of the Vanetti Family was killed along his family in his own house except Angelo Lagusa, Testa's only son. Angelo somehow escaped and was living hopelessly until a mysterious letter comes to him with the name of attackers. Angelo then changed his name to Avilio Bruno and set his journey to get revenge. Well this was the plot. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole anime because it was revealing this and that, thisand that again and again and you're like OMG what's gonna happen next? who will eliminate whom?. The main and foremost rule to become a successful crime drama. 91 day perfectly executed it. The theme is similar to Baccano, Monster and Joker game. So why watch this? because it doesn't show the power of immortals, the madness of a cold hearted man or not some games. Its completely realistic. Its totally unique in its own way. So better try this anime. Its really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\r\nThe art here is similar to Parasyte: The Maxim. But the theme is dark. They tried their best to make this look realistic and as for animation, the show looks decent and portrays the dark thrilling mood quite well. The best parts about the show are the character emotions as we see how they show their feelings \u2013 hatred, sorrow, pity, regret. The expression they make when they are in conflict are quite something.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n91 days has decent openings, ending and soundtracks. The opening 'Signal' by TK was so awesome that I didn't even think about it skipping. The ending 'Rise and shine' by Elisa was good too. The soundtracks are also good. When you'll hear Signal you'll feel like riding a feel train. Be sure to hop on that train. :3 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf I were to describe main character Angelo in just 2 words that will be merciless and cunning. Well he couldn't survive if he didn't abandon sanity. As for Nero Vanetti I should say he's a good thinker and careful. Then there's Fango, a Psychotic character. Corteo, Angelo's friend is a not liking problem type guy xD .Other characters didn't get importance like these 4 did. Overall I will say characters are unique to each other and each has their own uniqueness and weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime is too complex yet so normal. Seems interesting, isn't it? Yes you can't tell when what's going to take place. It's very enjoying and cliffhangers they show at the last moment of each episodes are awesome. Every episode has something important and unexpected to show. If you like crime-drama, you will definitely like it. That's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis type of anime are pretty rare. I was looking at my monitor whole time without tipping my eye petals. Its one of best anime I have seen so far. I wont say its a masterpiece, wont say one of the greatest but its still one great anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory         8.5/10\\n\r\nArt             9/10 (based on reality cuz theme is realistic)\\n\r\nSound       8.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter  8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment  8/10\\n\r\nOverall       9/10\\n\\n\r\nQuotes:\\n\r\nA raison d'\u00eatre gives a person power. Friendship is more reliable than a knife - Angelo Lagusa\\n\\n\r\nThere's no pointing in protecting our family if we cant protect our pride - Nero Vanetti\\n\\n\r\nThink carefully, then walk forward with purpose. The faster you rush out, the more likely you are to trip and fall - Don Vincente Vanetti\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Baccano, Monster, Joker Game\\n\\n\r\nNow go watch this anime :3\\n\\n",

            "content": "91 Days is a decent revenge story made unbearably excruciating by a terrible lead character, god awful animation and design and an incredibly confusing first half. Seriously, it\u2019s the first time I had to watch a recap episode \u2018cause I had no idea what the hell was going on.\r\nNot to mention that, being a native Italian speaker, it was quite painful to see characters called \u201cMud\u201d, \u201cBend-aid\u201d, \u201cSorry\u201d or \u201cCool Guy\u201d. \r\n*Mild Spoilers ahead*\r\nStory\r\nThe story itself is pretty simple, too cool for school-kun receives a letter that lists the names of the people who murdered his family 7 years ago. He then sets a planin motion to get revenge on those people and somehow destroy every mafia family.\\n\r\nThe pacing is a little bit too rushed in the first episodes but definitely ok in the final ones. Right at the beginning of the story you\u2019re introduced to a bunch of characters with totally made up italian names, you look at all of them and think \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d. It\u2019s when they start to die that things get easy, don\u2019t worry. But the story itself has some very serious issue, it wants to portray the cruel world of mafia during the prohibitionist era through the eyes of stereotypical anime characters, making it incredibly unrealistic. I really enjoyed the final two episodes cause it finally started to look like a mafia story, but again, some of the things that happened looked a little bit weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe only two decent characters were Vanno and Nero. Simple mobs who had a dream. That\u2019s it.\\n\r\nAnd then we have the rest of totally useless characters, Uncle Fatguy and Hannibal Lecter-chan. But they\u2019re not even the worst thing. Let\u2019s talk about Avilio and Corteo. The first one acts like \u201ccool people don\u2019t turn to look at explosions\u201d, the second one is the equivalent of someone looking for a friend on 4chan. We never know what happened to Avilio in his 7 years away from home, he just says that he learned how to steal wallets, he never shows any kind of emotion, he even does something very very bad in order to move on with his agenda. WHY?! Goddammit, it doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t make sense. Revenge is something that should give you some kind of closure and enable you to move on with your life, Avilio\u2019s revenge not only fails on both aspects, but doesn't even seem to be something he himself is enjoying. Again, WHY? \\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Simple Guy Corteo. Simple Guy Corteo basically spent the past seven years waiting for Avilio to come back, he joins the mafia cause Avilio said it\u2019d be cool, then he kills people cause reasons, then attempts to save Avilio. I mean, Best Friend Avilio disappeared for 7 years, but who cares? Simple Guy Corteo will always be there. Makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nOh boy, I don\u2019t even know where to start here. Let\u2019s just say that everyone in Lawless drives the same car. \\n\\n\r\nMusic & Voice Acting\\n\r\nMusic wasn\u2019t too bad, the OP was quite decent and it really captured the spirit of the show. The music that plays in the opera scene in episode 11 is quite good too. Voice acting wasn\u2019t the best imo, every voice kinda sounded the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nNot a bad anime, per se. But if you\u2019re expecting a realistic mafia story, relatable characters and pleasant visuals, better find something else. Also, WHY is the title 91 Days? Did I miss something?",

After a young boys family had been shot dead in front of his very eyes, Angelo Legusa starts plotting his revenge, a revenge that will take just 7 years to come into light.The anime follows him and Mafia-related families having to deal with the illegal transportation of alcohol and the violence between eachother. After conspiring with the man who help kill his family (Nero Vannetti) Angelo works his way up until he has higher groundthan the Vannettis. The story of 91 Days is quite complex and requires much concentration to be able to watch to know what's happening on screen. With a broad range of families and characters, 91 Days covers all aspects of the story, yet complicates the task of remembering which character belongs to which name. Although complex on the outside, this anime really only had one underlying theme, Revenge. The way Angelo hides his emotions around those who hurt him most, and how he buried his feeling in the sole purpose of revenge and building a relationship with those he hates gives his character so much more depth, which really is what 91 Days is all about.\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I didn't say that I felt some episodes were dragging on, but really what can you do, I couldn't say if I would recommend 91 Days as a first anime to watch as it can get boring at times and leave the audience baffled as to what had just happened. But as a whole I would recommend this anime to anyone who loves the Crime, violence and mystery drama genres. I personally wasn't overly thrilled by the ending, but it did conclude to a certain extent, but I was left wondering what happened next? But overall I thought that 91 Days was a very good anime, but would I watch it again? Mabye not.",

As one of the more mature series of Summer 2016, 91 days is a great anime for those who wants to take a break from the usual popular series. Angelo Lagusa who enters the underworld knowing very well that exacting revenge on the mafia means being one of them - cold hearted, manipulative and ruthless killer. We follow his revenge story and the downward spiral of his and their world. Is revenge worth it? Or is it all for nothing?\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy only real complaint about this series is the lackluster animation. However, this jest is overshadowed by the great directional artistry of the show - the music that perfectly captures the tone of the scenes and the cliffhanger (or plotwist) every end of the episode that makes you anticipate on the next one. 91 Days is my pick for anime of the season for Summer 2016.",

(I'll also try not to spoil anything that's in the story)\r\nStory (8/10)\r\n91 Days follows Angelo Lagusa, using the name Avillio Bruno, who has returned to his home of Lawless to plan his revenge on the Venetti Family who killed his entire family in front of his eyes. Now even though story sounds like a \"oh cool another revenge story\", it also follows the feud between the Venetti Family and the other mafia families, a family conflict, and rivals becoming allies. The story for 91 Days is very good, with Avilliojust following orders for the Venetti Family while waiting for the opportunity and the right timing to kill one of the Venetti members.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nIt's alright, this will be short, but the art is okay, the theater in the 11th episode does look good and Lawless is well, ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe music for 91 Days Is good, the old music fits since it does take place in the 1920s.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in 91 Days are very good, Angelo is man who wanted to get revenge on the people who killed his family, Nero Venetti, and in the backstory, he doesn't want to mess anything up and doesn't want to disappoint his father. Corteo, Avillio's friend, is just a man who didn't want to be involved with the mafia but gets involved because of Avillio, he also has a skill to make brew which the Venettis began to sell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you like Mafia-related stuff, this anime may be good for you and I believe this is the only Mafia anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nIn conclusion, 91 Days is great, for anyone who like Mafia-releated, I'd recommended it to anyone who likes anything that's Mafia and are non-anime watchers",

I enjoyed Aneglo's cool character, and the way that his story evolved, on getting his revenge against the Vanetti family. Another good point, would be the way that the series did keep you on your feet a bit. I was a bit shocked when suddenly his attitude changed, towards Nero, and the way that Angelo went around the issue in a  sneaky manner. But on the other hand, I feel like the story was too short, and there was so much more space to involve other characters much more.",

            "content": "Story/Characters(9-10): 91 days story structure is a combination of the classic mafia-revenge story, and a bit of the road trip adventure. Each semi split into two archs across this series. The short length of the series makes each arch very succinct and well put together, not wasting even a single minute. The director clearly knew how to get the most out of each scene, and used a unique technique you don't often see in anime like this. He removes all internal monologue, allowing us to see the story without knowing the thoughts of our protagonist. By doing this, the twists and turns feel more impactful,and the periods of tension are truly racing, even though many of these are rather slow and calm. The only, and I mean ONLY complaint I have is an episode where a random hulk like guy appears, gets beat up and it feels like an awkward filler episode. This structure gives us a cast of strong though flawed characters that are equally likable and despicable. The characters truly show the underbelly of mafia life while trying to convince us that they are still good people. In the end, the characters feel human, which for me, is probably the best part of this story.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9): The art is very simple, and very muted, which works well in the more morose setting the story takes place in. however, when color pops, it truly shines, and allows for the imagery to add to the emotional depth of a scene. The character designs are semi-reminiscent of baccanno, mainly our supporting cast, but they have a more gritty shading to them. The art, though not really something that stands out or seems truly fantastic, perfectly supports the themes and story that is being told. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8): the sound design is honestly quite minimal, and isn't that memorable over all. However, this minimalism was a smart choice by the dev team, as it allows more intense scenes to flow naturally and hold a feeling of realism. The music that is there is often very emotional, and usually present in slow scenes to build tension in a more subtle fashion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): The series has a slow pacing, similar to Monster, and awards viewers with pay offs that could make the fourth of july jealous, and with characters that are truly relatable. If you enjoy the slow methodical world building of Monster, or the politics of the Godfather, you will love this story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): In the end 91 days, is a short inspired by western mafia tales, and directly parallels most of them. And in my opinion, tells the mafia-revenge tale better than most. This is not a series for everyone, as it is not fun, its not cheerful, and it does not give a positive message. However, for those who enjoy the darker, more somber side of life, this is a great slice of melancholy with a side of existential dread.",

            "content": "91 Days is an interesting anime so i decided to check it out, here are my thoughts\r\nStory 8\r\nThe story of 91 Days is about a man named Angelo who is looking for revenge against a mafia family after they killed his parents and younger brother. The story is more so made for an american tv show/movie instead of an anime, but it's really good and pretty original (for an anime). The pacing of the story is pretty good too, it stays on what it wants to be, a crime drama anime and i think it succeed in doing that. My problem though is that thestory is somewhat predictable thanks to a lot of movies i have watched but that's a minor problem, i really like the story of 91 Days and i think you guys would too if you like Crime Dramas\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nThe art of 91 Days is also pretty good as well, the animation isn't clunky/blocky and the colorization is also pretty good, it sets the tone of a historical crime drama pretty well, but the facial expressions sometimes get a little bit to monotone when they talk and it also gets somewhat slow and clunky during the action sequences. All and all the animation is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\r\nNothing really stands out from the soundtrack except for the phenomenal opening by TK\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10\\n\r\nEveryone from 91 Days isn't really likeable, not even the main protagonist but that's perfect for a crime drama, you're not suppose to really like anyone in the anime cause everyone's a fucking douchebag in their own way, but their motives for being one really sets them apart and makes me like really everyone\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching 91 Days thanks to the characters and the well made story (also thanks to crime dramas being my favorite genre for anything)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\r\nIt's a really good show, and a fascinating one at that but it's not for everyone. If you like shows that have a lot of talking in it then this show is for you but if you don't then you'll probably hate this show a lot, for me i really like it and it's probably in my top 5 for last year in the drama category",

However, exactly these qualities are responsible for making it so unique and appealing.\r\n A masterfully written story of revenge unfolds in front of the viewer, as he watches the main character walk his blood-soaked path in pursuit of delivering ultimate retribution to the killers of his family.\r\n Having received a mysterious letter, which contained the names of the perpetrators of the crime that occurred 7 years ago, matured Angelo regains his purpose in life, joins mafia and vows to put hislife on the line to punish those who took everything from him, no matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\n The anime manages to depict Angelo's development nigh perfectly. With each name crossed out, he becomes colder and emptier inside. Still, despite his moral downfall he presses forward, sacrificing more and more for the sake of his cause. \\n\\n\r\n The key question asked by the anime is: \"Can hate be justified as a reason to live ?\". The answer we receive at the end leaves the one watching rather astounded: \"You actually don't need a reason to carry on living. You just live\". Clinging onto his past, the main character chose hate towards his enemies as his driving force, resulting in him experiencing even more suffering and loss.\\n\\n\r\n If you want to move on you shouldn't make your life heavily  dependant on something, for someday this something may vanish, leaving you devastated. Losing the object of his hate Angelo becomes a shell of his former self, giving up on life itself. And as we see muzzle pointed at his head int the end of the anime, the camera shifts to the scenery of the ocean and footprints on the shore, before switching to the credits, thus leaving a trace of ambiguity behind.\\n\\n\r\n If you seek a solid anime about crime, or simply search for an impressive story, I'd definitely recommend  you this show.\\n\\n",

Overall it was alright for me not the greatest but passable.\r\n I should mention I went through half of this show with a group of friends, but they never could get around to pinning a time to finish it. So after many months I finally decided to cap it off. \r\n91 days is a classic revenge story. As a child Nero's ( the main lead) family is killed by the mob family the Vinetti's and he swears to murder them to get back at them. I don't remember much ofthe cast other than that Nero is the cool silent type, his friend had a lot of heart, there was a crazy guy that was Nero's rival for a bit, but he was forgettable. Honestly, the story was a blur to me it was okay but nothing that resonated with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes were cool, and they nailed the prohibition era aesthetic perfectly. I also should mention I watched the dub, and they try to do Italian accents which are somewhat cheezy, but I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good show but not the most incredible thing I have seen this year.",

            "content": "91 Days was a strange anime to me. I watched it, thinking I was in for a Baccano!-like experience (same time period, mafia), but it was not at all what I expected. At all. The story is definitely its best point, for, even if it begins a little cliche, it explodes out of control. However, it is a plot that develops EXTREMELY slowly. In the beginning, it starts out strong, but the middle part of the anime is a little boring and dull. It even makes you wonder why you're even watching that part of the anime. It's forgettable andaltogether pretty boring, but it's all worth it in the end. When the story gets interesting, though, it gets INTERESTING. The plot develops very well, especially near the end, and does a wonderful job of surprising the viewer. Altogether, I'd say the plot is amazing and is great at leaving you on the edge of your seat at the climax of the plotline.\\n\r\n     The art and soundtrack were both very average. The animation was alright, but certainly isn't the best, and looks a lot like every other serious anime that has released recently. It doesn't have any special textures or quirks, like Death Parade, for example; if I had to compare it to another anime's style, it would be Gangsta. The reason why I rated the soundtrack as just being \"good\" is because for most of the anime, I had it on mute, but when I did hear the soundtrack, it was quite average, just like the art. I would say that it does, however, fit the anime well. \\n\r\n      Like the plot, the characters could be considered a strong point. They were fairly interesting, all of them, and there were some that were very likeable and some that weren't. The author/director made it VERY clear which characters were meant to be liked and which weren't, as the villains are just that--villains. Many have no redeeming qualities, and are very cliche. This may sound like I hated the characters, but honestly, I found the main two characters interesting and to stand out against the background of boring, one-dimensional characters. \\n\r\n     All in all, I found this anime fairly interesting, but it took me five months to finish because I had no motivation to actually watch it. But when I did get to the end of the anime, the story accelerated, and I found it to be very intriguing and great at always keeping me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this anime to people who enjoyed Spice and Wolf (both are very slow with lots of character development), Gangsta. (mafia/gangs), and Baccano! (mafia/gangs, similar characters). I would not recommend this anime to anyone who dislikes blood/gore, don't like EXTREMELY slow stories with lots of reading in between the lines, or stories that make little sense throughout some episodes. In the end, I would recommend it to some people but definitely not all, and 91 Days was an all-around average anime.",

            "content": "==Story==\r\n91 Day's story was a genuine surprise for me. Going in, I was initially interested in watching it because I've always enjoyed more serious anime. The first episode had me hooked from the get go, but I'm actually happy that it strayed from its initial path. As I generally enjoy Mafia movies, I went in thinking that it would be your run of the mill revenge story where the good guy gets revenge on those who did him wrong. This premise is still a major theme in a majority of the episodes, but the characters developments change it into more of a tragedy. Though Iwon't spoil anything, the ending was amazingly satisfying and changed it into one of my favourite anime. \\n\\n\r\n==Art==\\n\r\nThe art of 91 Days was probably its least strong category. Though the art was good for the most part, some episodes had very obvious animation problems, like characters being drawn poorly or some characters not walking properly. \\n\\n\r\nIn line with its subject matter, the art seems to be taken seriously. The characters never turn into chibis or do anything physically impossible. The art style is kept consistent throughout.  The serious mood is prevalent in the art and was very fitting for the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were designed well and suited everyone's personality. Taking place in the late 1920's, everyone looked like they belonged and no one looked like they couldn't be sketches of people from that time period. Nonetheless, everyone had a very unique design, making it easy to tell apart each character in this large cast.\\n\\n\r\n==Sound==\\n\r\nThe seiyuus for 91 Days were pretty good. There wasn't any lackluster performances but there were characters that stood out. Fango's voice actor, Kenjirou Tsuda, was absolutely perfect at conveying Fango's crazy ruthlessness. The way he inflects his voice is extremely fitting and conveyed him in a way that was very strange but not too over the top. Takashi Kondou portrayed Avilio's emotions very well, which I'm sure wasn't easy and Takuya Eguchi as Nero was terrific at portraying Nero as both playful and serious when it was needed. \\n\\n\r\nThough the dub is still airing, it does offer a perhaps more immersive feel for American viewers as they have given each character an accent. Though this wasn't present in the Japanese version besides on instance, the characters do sometimes speak in strings of Italian. Though it isn't personally my cup of tea, I could see how it would make some viewers more involved and familiar with the characters. Though this might be unfair, as I'm comparing it to the Japanese version, Brandon Potter as Fango was very different. He no longer conveys his craziness and now just has an American accent.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if I'm going to be honest, the in-show music didn't really stand out for me. I have never really paid much attention to music in anime, but, overall, I guess I would just describe it as mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening was terrific in showing Angelo's feelings towards his family's death and the bitterness he feels going forward without them. The singer's, who also sang the opening to Tokyo Ghoul, voice was very powerful. Even though it was very fitting for 91 Days, I could easily see someone who hasn't watched the show enjoying the song. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending actually doesn't have any real words, it's still very soulful and seems like something that would be playing at a nightclub in the 1930's. Each ending is slightly different. I think it actually makes the scene much more emotional during the more sad episode endings. \\n\\n\r\n==Character==\\n\r\nMy favourite thing about 91 Days was the characters. Though we have so little time with each character, the still express their personality and feelings easily. In 91 Days, we actually never hear the thought of a character unless they're expressed outloud. Each main character and many of the side characters go through development throughout. Going in, all we know is what Avilio does; the Vanetti's are evil and they deserve to be killed. As we go through though we get to see Avilio change as he ruthlessly takes his revenge while pretending to be their ally. We also see sympathetic sides of the Mafia family. None of the characters are black and white and each character has realistic and though-provoking feelings. The foiling of the two main characters, Angelo (also called Avilio) and Nero, are extremely interesting and its very interesting how they grow as they are thrust into difficult situations. \\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nI guess, to sum it up, I just want to say that I LOVED this anime. Every episode seemed to go by so fast and I truly wish 91 Days was longer. Though I know that there are many other animes that do this, I loved how everything isn't spelled out for us and that the same information isn't gone over a million times. As there aren't any anime cliches, I feel this would be great for anyone just getting into anime or who might not even typically enjoy it. Re watching it, there are still things that I didn't initially notice about the characters and I would absolutely watch it again. Even weeks after finishing it, I still miss it and go back and watch it. So many twists were clever and though-provoking. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, I'd most likely describe it as \"fresh.\" I loved that it averted so many tropes in both Mafia themed shows and anime. I know that it isn't as well known, but I really hope that people continue to watch and enjoy 91 Days and that it inspires creators to make more similarly serious anime.",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\n91 Days takes place in the early 1900's during Prohibition.  The location is Lawless, Illinois.  One night, Angelo Lagusa's family is murdered by the Vanettis over a mafia dispute.  This is the fuel for Angelo's hatred.  Angelo meticulously weaves his way into the Vanetti family and murders them one by one methodically and ruthlessly.  Violence, alcohol, and blood plague the anime to make it all the more satisfying and keep to the darker theme of the anime.  The story really brings out the pure hatred in Angelo and how one significant event can take away everything from aperson in a matter of seconds.  The story creates much suspense and keeps you on edge.  You anxiously await to see the outcome of Angelo's revenge plans and how they will play out.  Angelo killed anybody to get his revenge, a merciless killing machine.  You would never know who would die next.  At the same time there is a battle of ideals between some of the characters that keeps you questioning who is right.  Do you need a reason to live?  Is revenge truly the only way to quench the anger? The pain? This show captures and stresses pure hatred.  Nothing can stop Angelo's vendetta.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly average but it fits with the general theme of the anime.  It seems more dark and old, as it should be.  The animation is fluid and the lighting is emphasized in intense scenes and darker in moments of pain, suffering.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is done by TK and his unique vocal style really fits the theme of this anime.  It sets a very melancholy tone and reminds viewers this isn't a happy anime.  The music for scenes is fitting.  Atmospheric even.  The voice acting is on point.  Angelo sounds undoubtedly like a person who is empty, a shell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are well developed and fit the images.  Angelo seems exactly like a merciless killing machine filled with grief.  Nero Vanetti is kind of like comedic relief and to contrast Angelo, but we can see that he can be quite serious and intelligent at times.  Every character fits their description and no problems are raised throughout the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this anime.  A little more than average, I must admit.  It kept me on edge to learn who Angelo would kill and what he was planning to do.  To be completely honest, there were certain instances that I thought the pacing was too slow but it wasn't that big of a flaw that it would ruin the show.  \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: \\n\r\nWATCH IT! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "91 Days isn't unique. \r\nThis seems to be the biggest thing many people are focused on when critiquing this anime. Honestly, it's true. It's the typical mafia scenario\u2014you killed my family, so now I'll kill yours. It's not unique... but it works. \r\nPersonally, I loved the anime. In terms of story, it did a great job at following a good and steady pace, and it was one of those \"seamless stories\" that I so love (a story that can naturally incorporate different information and things into its episodes that all grow and tie in together at the end). Despite, the idea being somewhat cliche, its\"sub-arcs\" and its main-arc are all very interesting and beautifully hold the attention of the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, especially, I am a fan of. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that although it may start off not that unique, the ending is something wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also great in the story. Hardly any characters presented were two-dimensional (you know, the bad guy who's just bad, or the good guy who's just good)\u2014it gave us a complex show of many of the characters which made it hard to see any of them live/die/suffer loss (or whatever) even if we may have not liked them in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also loved about this story, was that it was... like life, kind of. You know those animes where everyone survives and all their battle scars heal and everything is rainbow and sunshine despite whatever odds they may have been facing? Yeah, 91 Days isn't like that. It doesn't make miracles happen... It stays true to the gruesome life of the mafia. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, the soundtrack is awesome. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, this was a fantastic anime. I highly highly enjoyed it, and I think many other people would too.",

Angelo infiltrates the family responsible for his family\u2019s demise, and meets with the second most noteworthy character Nero. \r\nAt first, seeing how direct and dark the premise of the show was, the pessimist in me feared that the show would rely on mindless action or edgyplot-twists that show up out of nowhere. I was pleasantly surprised to reach the end of the series, realizing that I had been fully immersed in what turned out to be a gruesome drama. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as complaints go I can only think of two things that could have been improved. First off, the animation-quality drops quite noticeably in one of the later episodes, to the point that the characters look like walking blobs out of MS Paint. Secondly, there is one episode early on that just doesn\u2019t fit the atmosphere of the rest of the show, one where a stereotypical and cartoony Mexican assassin shows up. Weighing two lesser episodes against the rest of the series however proves to only be a minor bump in the road, considering the quality of the story as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack finds a way to blend into the background. What that background has though is personality, filled with somber and melancholic moments, along with a setting filled with seedy characters that values family, wealth, and power above all. The music thus perfectly brings out the feeling of a classic gangster story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat raised 91 Days a bit above the standard level of quality for me would be the subtle exploration of its themes, which I personally would sum up as a battle between nihilism and optimism, embodied by the two leading characters in the show. Angelo is set on his self-destructive path to ruin, while Nero looks for meaning in all the horrible sacrifices one has to make in the criminal underworld, bringing them closer and closer to a final confrontation.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone that enjoys anime with a serious and gritty tone, stories that keep it simple, yet fill themselves with characters and ideas that can be analyzed further, 91 Days gets a high recommendation.",

            "content": "Mafia anime.\r\nA sub-genre left largely untouched by anime studios, and I can probably count on one hand the amount of them that actually exist. Baccano would be the only one that comes to mind immediately, but let me tell you\u202691 Days and Baccano are nothing alike. For starters, Baccano is completely crazy and relentless; its action thrilling and its plot just as off the wall. 91 Days, on the other hand is an introspective drama piece at heart. It\u2019s the story of a young man, Angelo, whose Mafioso family are murdered by the upper echelon to silence them since they know a little too much.Seven years later, he\u2019s all grown up and ready to infiltrate the family responsible, biding his time to exact his vengeance.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the story of Angelo\u2019s revenge, and it\u2019s packed with a surprising amount of symbolism, metaphors and psychological complexities-at its core, 91 Days is certainly very human. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps that\u2019s to do with the direction the series took, maybe a direct contrast to the expectations many (myself included) might\u2019ve had at the start. When you think about a revenge story involving mafia, you might think of thrilling action sequences (which is a good thing because the animation is not the best thing here), gore, an intense climax and some epic one liners; and ultimately, what you get out of 91 Days depends on what you expect to get from 91 Days. \\n\\n\r\nThe promotional poster is misleading; If you\u2019re looking for the anime version of The Godfather or Scarface, then you\u2019ll likely be disappointed and I would not recommend this series to you any time after the first 3 or so episodes. However, if you\u2019re looking for a human study full of ambiguity and philosophical themes revolving around questioning the meaning of revenge and how people go on living, then I\u2019d recommend this to you. I was shocked by how nihilistic the series became by the end and it\u2019s a route I was not expecting 91 Days to take. \\n\r\nBecause of this, I initially didn\u2019t think the opening theme fit the whole \u201cmafia revenge\u201d story well at all\u2026I\u2019d honestly not expected TK (the vocalist of Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s opening \u201cUnravel\u201d) to be the choice of artist, although the further into the series you get, the more you see why TK\u2019s \u201cSignal\u201d was chosen. It\u2019s a reflective, sombre song, much like the anime itself.\\n\r\nI for one was pleasantly surprised\u2026although I can understand why not everyone would be. \\n\\n\r\nNow, without spoiling too much, I will say that the kill count in this anime is ridiculously high although that\u2019s partially to be expected. The story does revolve around the prohibition, mafia and revenge and all of those things flag death. I advise not getting too attached to any characters, although to be fair the only ones a viewer might like are the two main characters, Angelo and Nero since they\u2019re the only ones that really get any development (or maybe I\u2019m wrong). It would\u2019ve been nice to let a few more side characters have the limelight because they had great potential, but I guess the plot didn\u2019t necessarily call for it with the limited number of episodes. That leads me to a high point of 91 Days, the complex yet implicit relationship between Angelo and one of the objects of his revenge, Nero. There is a sense of comradery and friendship between the two, and it\u2019s so natural and subtle that it\u2019s completely refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nTime and time again in anime are we force fed concepts of \u201cNakama\u201d and friendship speeches where characters pour their hearts out to one another to almost justify or consolidate their friendship to the audience. \\n\r\nWell 91 Days isn\u2019t like that, and it\u2019s the genuine nature of Nero and Angelo\u2019s relationship that makes the whole thing quite tragic. There\u2019s no cheesy epiphany of \u201coh, I suddenly can\u2019t kill you now because you\u2019re my bro\u201d thing going on here, and both characters foil one another perfectly. Nothing ever feels contrived or cheapened by these characters and their interactions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, clearly the most controversial thing here was the ending. An ending can make or break a series, especially when it\u2019s a shorter one like 91 Days and just let me forewarn that this is a very open ended and ambiguous ending. So if you don\u2019t like some serious food for thought and the idea of just \u201cnot knowing\u201d, then you should probably give this one a miss\u2026it\u2019s ending is quite similar in nature to that of Monster (albeit much less of a mind screw). \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I can\u2019t help but feel that this anime is criminally underrated, I found it to be one of the best from 2016, but there are probably many here on MAL that would disagree with me on that sentiment. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Haven't done too many reviews here, but I think I'll try and get into the habit of doing so; to be honest I enjoy it quite a bit, and if it helps anyone out there decide to watch something they might be interested in all the better.  So, let's get to it... 91 Days!\r\n91 Days is set in prohibition era United States, and revolves around three main crime stories.  Mob themes are not something I have seen a lot of in anime, and I'd have to say that overall I liked what I saw here.  Is it the anime-world's masterpiece version ofThe Godfather?  Not really, but still something I'm glad I took the time on.  The fact that it is just another 12-episode series with one conclusive story to tell is just another reason why it may well be worth it for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was about the quality I'd expect and want from any modern quality anime; no real qualms with it at any point.  What it was very strong at was using the animation to create the tone and style for this type of story.  It had a great balance of an \"anime\" type feel while providing that \"mafia style\" you would hope for in this kind of story.  It's not something I can put a specific finger on, just felt it was worth mentioning that the animation here complemented the style very well.  And while I can't  particularly call to mind any specific melody of the soundtrack, I do feel that the music does very much the same thing in regards for setting a tone (I will say that I absolutely love the intro and outro music).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it was pretty straightforward; a mafia themed revenge story.  Think something similar to \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" while being set in the world of organized crime.  The way the families and conflicts are set up is complex enough to work for what it is, though the general direction of the story is fairly standard and A-Z.  That's not to say there are no twists and turns to keep the story fresh, just that in terms of the way the story progresses didn't necessarily feel like it was breaking any new ground.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with any revenge based story like this, a story is based on the merits of its characters.  I can safely say that this anime deserves a solid score on that front.  The characters definitely feel individual in the world of this anime and each have their own place- most of them getting sufficient development (more on this a bit later).  While I would generally say the characters are a strong point for this show, it's worth mentioning I did have some personal issues.  A bit later on, I will vaguely say that I felt some of the motivation/decisions of the main character felt a bit uneven... and though they can easily be explained by their given psychological state, it still felt a little off to me.  Enough to notice and say that it's off, but not enough to really deter my enjoyment of what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, but it honestly had potential for me to enjoy it a little more; I mean this as both a compliment and a critique, if that makes sense.  I think the divisive line here that kept this from being a nine out of ten was the length.  Now, I wouldn't necessarily say that 91 Days feels \"rushed\" at any point... I think the argument could potentially be made, but I myself didn't really feel that way.  However, I think this anime would have benefited from being a bit longer.  The characters are developed well enough, but that and especially the relationships between them feel like they could've used a lot more room to grow.  It obviously isn't the kind of story that really needs to be told in long, separate arcs like a lot of anime out there likes to do, so essentially this is the one story you get.  And for a good one like this, I feel like we could've been given a bit more.  I'd say the safe bet would've been a 20-25 episode run, but if they could have found ways to keep the story fresh and interesting I think the time spent with these characters and the setting could have benefited a lot from maybe even a 50 episode length.  Overall, the fact that it's short isn't necessarily a bad thing; I'd even say it makes it more accessible for people with less time to be able to watch a good series in its entirety.  That said, it is my personal opinion that with more time, the characters would have been much more sympathetic, the conflicts a bit more epic, and most of all the ending would be more cathartic (and I do think it has a good ending).\\n\\n\r\nThis pretty much sums up my feelings here, any real problems I had were mentioned above.  Everything else was enjoyable... and while it falls short of being in a list of my all-time favorites, this is a solid show that I think is worth your time.  Especially if you have any interest in the organized crime genre.",

            "content": "--- No Spoilers ---\r\nIf you sit down for a second and think what kind of anime you like, a majority will undoubtedly say action. But action is nothing but violence. It's pretty twisted that we (me included) find murder and killing needlessly entertaining, but that's just the way we have trained our minds from infancy. If any sort of calamity, such as depicted in anime, were to befall us, I for one would be desperate not to shit my pants. Being enveloped by this fondness to violence creates a false sense of surety within. What do I mean by that? By watching \u201caction\u201d for solong, we are dulled to its reality. Statistically, if a hundred people read this, 99 will never kill someone, and less than 10 will ever experience a violent act first hand. Yet we think we know what violence is. Popular anime that depict violence as endlessly fun dull our minds to the horror and tragedy that is laced within death and killing. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore, revenge cannot be accurately portrayed without violence, and even then no one seems to get it right. The typical revenge clich\u00e9 is that if you seek out revenge, you won't be happy or satisfied in the end. (Why does every story have to adhere so closely to this!?! I, for one, would be beyond ecstatic to see a sadist as the protagonist). The main problem that arises when doing a revenge plot is that you realize that it's a clich\u00e9 for a reason. So many stories have been written involving that strain of thought that it's been beaten to death. If you are going to stick to a clich\u00e9, your story better be damn well amazing. Otherwise, I can guarantee you more critical success by wasting your time elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\n91 Days tried so hard to exit the whirlpool of the revenge clich\u00e9, but ended up drowning in the end after all. The biggest pitfall to the story was the pacing. The twelve episode restraint is perfect, but the poor pacing left a sense of emptiness after the conclusion. The story really doesn't pick up until a little over half way through. The first three episodes were solid, but it went downhill from there. The second pitfall goes hand in hand with the first: the story was juggling two different themes at one time. The first was the concept of revenge from the perspective of Avilio, the main character, and the second was the relationships that Avilio was forced to embark in. These two themes should not have been muddled up for they go well together, but poor scene placement ruined any chances.\\n\\n\r\nThere were two aspects that I feel needed improvement. Firstly,  Avilio\u2019s backstory is powerful and emotional, but all of that emotion is lost if the entire flashback unfolds in the first episode. The flashback is big enough to not have been told until crucial killing scenes. Secondly, watching Avilio indulge in vengeance will obviously leave him calloused to some extent. But calloused does not mean apathetic. I absolutely abhor the synonymity. The best example I can give is that of a guitarist. When you first learn to play guitar, an acoustic especially, your fingers will turn red and might even start to bleed if your dedicated enough. Eventually, you will grow extra skin on your fingertips from repeatedly pressing the strings to the fretboard. That's calloused. But if I prick my calloused fingers with a needle, I will still bleed. A calloused man isn't absent of all feelings, they are hidden behind stronger motivation to accomplish what's necessary. Avilio is depicted as apathetic when it should be calloused. He shows no emotion for a good portion of the show. If he was shown to cry a little more often or remember his childhood before killing someone, the story would be that much closer to escaping the whirlpool. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of 91 Days was pretty subpar. I enjoyed the animation; the scenery was beautiful, like the older Disney films. I found the smoke animation rising from the cigarettes uncannily good. I pride myself in being able to differentiate between good and bad musical scores, and 91 Days was nothing special. The OP, on the other hand, was very\u2026 VERY\u2026 good. The animation to the OP was terrible. If I'm not mistaken, they're the same guys who did the OP for Tokyo Ghoul. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend 91 Days as a must watch anime. There are definitely better shows that involve revenge, but if you've got time on your hands and want some violent entertainment, 91 Days won't disappoint. I am also the guy that looks for hidden meanings behind every dialogue, so you can take my criticism completely at face value. You might thoroughly enjoy the show and find nothing wrong with it, but I feel that there is a lot more that could've been done. I found myself having to infer way too much to fill in some minor themeatic gaps. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so if you have advice in how to make it better please feel free to tell me.\r\nSpoilers from the first episode ahead\r\nStory [8/10]\r\n91 days takes place during the Prohibition Era in the 1920s in a town called Lawless. Where our protagonist Angelo Lagusa is trying to get revenge on the people that killed his family. Pretty simple right? Is it ground-breaking? No. Is it original? Not really. But the feeling of not knowing what Angelo is going to do next is thrilling. Because if the mc doesn't know what to do next, why should you right? \r\nArt [8/10]\r\nIts nothing special,if I was to describe the art style in 91 days in one word it would be \"normal\". Despite that though it was really well animated, especially the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI am going to split sound into three parts, first being the music and the second being the sound effects, and third being the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nMusic [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the OST. It is amazing. No really, it was one of the best soundtracks that I've heard in a while. The intro (Signal by TK) was one of the best intros ever. I still go back sometimes to watch the intro because its that good. The soundtrack really made you feel part of the show. As every piece was as haunting as the last one. From pieces that sounds like it belongs in a church choir from the haunting and dark main theme. 91 days is a story about revenge, and the soundtrack reminds you about that. \\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the sound effects. It's good. Nothing much more to say about it. Everything was done well, from the sound of liquor being poured into a glass, to bullets hitting car windows. It's not spectacular, but it was done very well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI watched the sub first then the dub when it finished airing. The voice acting is good, both subbed and dubbed. As someone who despises watching dubbed I was really impressed at the dubbed voice acting. As the voice actors of the Vanetti family as well as the man characters sounded like they were from a gangster show. Except Fio, that was one of the worst voices I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nSound overall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow to the most important part of the show, the characters. Angelo Lagusa, Nero Vanetti, and Corteo are the three most prominent ones throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThey say the most dangerous person is someone who has nothing left to lose, and they would be right. Angelo's is a cruel person. He wants to make the people who killed his family feel the same way he's felt for 7 years. He wants to take everything away from them and crush it right in front of his eyes. He's basically a huge sadist. He lives for the sake of getting revenge, nothing else. \\n\\n\r\n\"Ohana means family, family means no one gets left behind\". This is Nero's character in one sentence. The man is always thinking about his family. Everything he does he does it for the family.\\n\\n\r\n\"Starting from today, me and you are brothers Angelo\". Corteo is the  childhood friend of Angelo who wants to see him happy again. Even if it means helping him kill people, that's a good friend. There is really no character development for Corteo other than the first episode, nothing much to say about him without spoiling really. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10] \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite shows to date. Enough said \\n\\n\r\nFinal words\\n\r\nSo who would enjoy show?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like revenge stories?\\n\r\nDo you like dark animes?\\n\r\nDo you enjoy violence? \\n\r\nDo you like classical music?\\n\r\nDo you care if the story isn't set in Japan?\\n\r\nDo you watch dubbed?\\n\r\nDo you watch subbed?\\n\r\nDo you like onions being cut under your eyes?\\n\r\nAre you a sadist?\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, consider the watch. All jokes aside Angelo's revenge story was an absolute blast to watch. \\n",

In the ending its not definite that avilio dies,we didnt see corteo fall,we didnt see the body,we didnt see blood,all we heard was the gun shot,there is always the possibility of him dying but a few episodes before avilio asks him if he was able to shoot the kid from back then now,he didnt answer meaning we cant be sure and the anime shows us tha revenge doesn'tfeel good in the end,avilio after finally accomplishing his revenge after all these years doesn't even smile or feel happy on the inside,so why would nero after killing someone he had good memories with feel happy and smiles when he enters the car,plus nero takes the same pose he did years ago,poses,falters,then shoots and misses on purpose so perhaps he does the same again AND nero shoots from point plank range so if he actually shot avilio he should atleast have bit of blood on he's clothes,the endings was left like that for us to create our own ending and speculate and this is what i believe\ufeff.\\n",

            "content": "This show is an absolute gem, in a pile of stones. Fantastic in every definition. Where do i even begin? \r\nThe story is your typical, revenge plot. Which on first glance, may seem cliche. And for the most part i would agree with that observation. But what 91 days does with this cliche is nothing short of miraculous. With every episode drawing you in more, and more. \r\nThe anime uses darker colors, and colder atmosphere to portray a sense of morbid, and cold scenes. And it does it extremely well. You can plainly see the attention to detail. From a cold, winter's day. To thewarm interior of a play theater. My only gripe with the art style, it can almost feel overwhelmingly cold, and sad. Even during moments of comedy, or enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nIf i had to pick one thing as my favorite about this show. It'd definitely have to be the opening, and ending. TK knocks it out of the park (as he always does) with the OP \"Signal.\" And the ED \"Rain or Shine\" performed by Elisa is no slouch either. But even besides the OP/ED, this show kills it with it's sound. Coupled with it's use a darker colors, and colder atmosphere. As well as the somber - almost haunting sound track. This show is able to create a sense of immersion, that not many shows are capable of. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, and overall enjoyment. I'll put it like this, I can name every character from memory. Because each, and everyone has so much personality. And is rich in development. But where the characters really shine, is the love, hate bond of Bruno, and Nero. The development of these 2 is something special. And makes the the inevitability of Bruno's ultimate goal. That much more of a pill to swallow. This show is a pleasure. In every imaginable way. My biggest problem with this show is, it only has 12 episodes to enjoy. I cannot sing it's praises enough. This is what other anime should strive to be.",

            "content": "Combine the typical mafia story of 3 rival families with a revenge story of the lone survivor; and this is exactly what you get. 91 days doesn't play with the viewers expectations, it rather knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn't stop at any point. It hopes to have our attention all the time and entertain us with everything it got, even though it sometimes works perfectly fine, but sometimes it simply doesn't. \r\nWelcome to America in the twenties and thirties! Mafias reigning over the city. In the middle of this decaying society, a young boy named Angelo is witness to the murderof his family and barely escapes alive. Angelo (renamed Avilio) will return to the city years later with the sole purpose of avenging them. With the help of his childhood friend Corteo, and his wonderful liqueur recipe, Avilio will target the three men who were directly responsible for his family\u2019s demise. \\n\r\nThe setting is pretty easy, and the story straight forward. Often too quickly, it manages to get it's story through very easily. The self-confidence is what makes each episode more watchable than anything else. It lacks at surprising elements, but becomes an interesting cat and mice game.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days tells us the story of Avilio, who is neither good, nor bad. He has a great and emotional story with both his childhood friend (Corteo) and with the guy who he desires to kill (Nero). The triangles in this story go beyond what we are used to in an anime (love and jealousy between teenagers at school). 91 Days introduces us to a perilous adult world through teenager characters instead. Some being complicated and deep, some being an easy read. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound reflect the theme of the anime perfectly. It lacks enjoyment, but combined with the story it's very convincingly.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 91 Days is a vertiginous ride into the dark and violent side of human nature. Made with quality and care, 91 Days will sometimes have you in the edge of your seat, while at others, it will pull you into a beautiful world where sometimes even death is portrayed in an aesthetic way",

A time when cars and telephones were in its nascent stage. The warm colours give a soothing feeling of nostalgia even without living in that time. \r\nThe story is about Angelo Lagusa living in Lawless town whose family was murdered by 4 members of the Vanetti family 6 years ago because of a power struggle between the three families, Vanetti, Galassia and Orco. \u2028\r\nSomeone mysterious sends him a letterwith the name of people responsible for his family slaughter.

Angelo plays everyone and I love how he did it.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, I\u2019ve to watch some episodes again (like Black Lagoon) to completely grasp the story or character because a lot of things go hand in hand with this kind of show but surprisingly I was able to follow up everything to the T.\\n\\n\r\nJust when I thought that this series won't get any better this episode surprised me yet again.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMy mother\u2019s favorite film is Overboard starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. Her second favorite film (which needs no introduction) is The Godfather.\r\nShe always sits down to watch it whenever it pops up on the television, and she owns a special, autographed print of the movie that hangs in the basement of her home for every guest to admire. She tends to enjoy every film she watches, but she really likes this one.\r\nThe Godfather is often lauded as a cinematic masterpiece due to its superb acting, great direction, crisp score, memorable scenes, and mature plot.91 Days is an anime that clearly got its inspiration from this juggernaut of a film. While the show does not reach the same historic status, it is by no means worth passing up.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn 91 Days, Angelo Lagusa, then a young boy, witnessed the deaths of his parents and his little brother at the hands of a handful of evil men. Seven years later, Angelo receives a letter from a mysterious confidant, informing him of the names of the people who ruined his life. With his newfound information, Angelo becomes Avilio Bruno and begins the long, violent path towards exacting his revenge.\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, 91 Days is nothing groundbreaking on a narrative level. However (and that\u2019s a big \u201chowever\u201d), it no doubt displays a rewarding plot that carries its audience along without any hardship.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of its moxie comes from how mafia movies influenced the direction of the story. The stylized, black-and-white logo make this assertion obvious. But when one considers the setting (Prohibition Era America), the large families (Vannetti, Orco, Galassias), and the content therein (alcohol, guns), it starts to make sense why some people refer to this show as Godfather: The Anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike its inspirer, though, 91 Days kicks it all off with gusto. The first half of the first episode gets right into it with the death of Angelo\u2019s family, showcasing an intense scene that sticks with the audience due to its severity and its importance. When one combines this opener with the opening-credits scrawl that shortly follows, the anime perfectly sets the tone for what\u2019s about to unfold.\\n\\n\r\nSaid unfolding unveils a tale of hurt and pain and vengeance. Angelo cares only about killing the men who wronged him and his family, dragging his best friend into the forefront and putting himself in immense danger by associating with these people. In doing so, the anime provides even more intense, high-profile scenes (like that of the beginning) which capture the mafia-movie spirit. Vanno Clemente\u2019s death. Fango feeding Don Orco to his executives. Nero taking out his own brother. Angelo forced to kill Corteo. The chaotic theater shootout.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a lot of distinct scenes which exist across the whole season, but chief among them is the one with the best directorial care: Corteo murdering Fango.\\n\\n\r\nCorteo\u2019s brutal attack method \u2013 first smashing and stabbing with a beer bottle (containing his own \u201cLawless Heaven\u201d drink) then bludgeoning with an old-style telephone \u2013 make the event a crazy one. But when the broken record acts as a metaphor for Corteo\u2019s own actions, and the audience simply sees his shadow striking in the light as the music continues to skip, 91 Days elevates this scene to high heights. (Fango dying is cheese on the lasagna.)\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the whole season, episode four is arguably the weakest part of 91 Days due to the one-off \u201cGoliath\u201d assassin who pursues Angelo and Nero and who serves no lasting plot purposes. Still, when the audience gets to learn more about these two men (Nero can juggle, Angelo can pickpocket), and the anime unveils a semi-plot twist (that a fourth member was there the night of the murder), it\u2019s not a total loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also touches on revenge. It ultimately goes the usual \u201crevenge is pointless\u201d route, but it makes sense within the context of the narrative. All revenge did for Angelo was get his \u201cbrother\u201d killed, ruin the lives of numerous others, and leave him without the reason to live he so desperately wanted. Essentially, everything he did throughout 91 Days meant nothing because, in the end, he has nothing.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads to that end. Arguably, the ending itself is overly ambiguous in that it tries too hard to be artsy rather than definitive. An odd choice given how direct the anime had been up to this point. The peaceful ocean, the movement of the characters, and the refusal to show tangible evidence of the outcome make it more of a guessing game than a ribbon to tie off this package.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not without merit, though. Especially on a character level. Angelo seems to no longer want to live, and Nero gets a second (fair) chance at following through on the \u201cmistake\u201d he made those many years ago. Nero\u2019s conviction as he stares ahead, gun upraised, should be the biggest indicator of what went down \u2013 or maybe not.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days does have smaller problems like the anticlimactic reveal of Angelo\u2019s identity to Nero and the inability to properly incorporate the Galassias family into the mix outside of hearsay. Even so, this classic revenge story does a lot right and deserves the praise it has gotten.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEasily, 91 Days falters hardest with its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo be positive first, the setting and backgrounds are appealing. The anime captures the spirit of the \u201820s with brick buildings, old-timey cars, suits galore, rundown bars, and a decrepit living quarters. The show both looks and feels like a mafia movie \u2013 a boon indeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the characters are not half bad either. Nero\u2019s handsome face and facial hair, Angelo\u2019s pale complexion and scathing eyes, and Corteo\u2019s soft expression and square frames give them a look that fits the setting and their personalities. The general manliness of the designs, as well as the variance (Cerotto has more of a monkey vibe, Ronaldo has a big nose, Barbero has business written all over him), keep up with 91 Days and its focus on the mafia.\\n\\n\r\nThe further along the anime goes, though, the more trouble it encounters artistically. It becomes more and more apparent how off-model some of the designs get, and, when the characters\u2019 walking cycles barely have them shuffling their feet, movement staggers, too.\\n\\n\r\nWorst of all are the noticeable inconsistencies. A repeated frame or incorrect cut makes Don Orco\u2019s food magically reappear out of thin air after he ate it. One scene starts with a wide shot of what is clearly day time (or at most early evening), but the next shot shows it is nighttime. And Don Vanetti seems to have misplaced the scar on the left side of his face since it vanishes quite frequently.\\n\\n\r\nMany anime will have small artistic issues that one can simply ignore. But the ones found here were too obvious and too common, leading to a reduction in the anime\u2019s overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is more plot driven than character driven, but that does not mean it ignores its cast.\\n\\n\r\nAngelo is the main protagonist of this tale. His family is murdered, and he is the one that kills those related to the incident that destroyed all he knew. Before he receives the mysterious letter, he describes himself as someone without purpose. An empty husk devoid of meaning and life. But, after getting the letter, he found what he needed to do.\\n\\n\r\nAs he assimilates into the Vanetti family, more is learned about him. He is conniving in his dealings with others, is an adept pickpocket, and is capable of doing what must be done. His emotionless personality keeps him soulless, but, on occasion, flashes of wickedness spread across his face as he comes one step closer to his ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, Angelo finds himself attached to two key figures: Nero and Corteo.\\n\\n\r\nWith Nero, he becomes a lot friendlier towards the man he wants to kill than he would perhaps like. Originally, he refrained from killing Nero to get closer to Don Vanetti. Nero, an honest, trustworthy man, quickly came to like Angelo\u2019s straightforwardness and his reliability \u2013 but never realizing he befriended the very man who was betraying him all along.\\n\\n\r\nWith Corteo, he grows increasingly distant from him. In the beginning, Corteo was someone he at least kept in mind, even if he used him (that is, his bootleg alcohol) to get started. Angelo confided in Corteo, letting him know of his plans and speaking with him in earnest. But the more that Angelo integrated into the mafia and his quest, the less Angelo kept Corteo around.\\n\\n\r\nOn both ends, it goes awry. When Angelo seems to have the perfect opportunity to kill Nero amid the chaos of the theater shootout, he chooses instead to not kill him. He later explains to Nero that he wanted him to experience \u201ca pain worse than death\u201d as his father lay dying in his arms. And while Angelo mends his friendship with Corteo through their small time away from the mafia, Nero forces Angelo to kill Corteo (Nero not knowing of their secret) so that Angelo could prove his loyalty. In doing so, Corteo dies and his image haunts Angelo, guiding him to the end.\\n\\n\r\nAngelo believed that following this bloody path would lead him to a reason to keep him going, keep him living \u2013 yet \u201cit was all for nothing.\u201d Shortly following these words of his, he has his best character moment where he screams at Nero out of anguish, wishing that this man had shot and killed him back when he had the chance. That way, neither of them would have needed to go through such endless, soul-crushing pain.\\n\\n\r\nAs the finale rolls near, Nero tells Angelo that one does not need a reason to live. Instead, he should just do so. Unfortunately, Nero\u2019s words do not have the most weight behind them since he never got as much time as he perhaps needed. He has moments with his dad Don Vanetti, he kills his brother, and he reveals his hesitation on that fateful night. But 91 Days does not give this deuteragonist his due.\\n\\n\r\nIn return, Angelo\u2019s final words correct his earlier explanation. He tells Nero that he didn\u2019t kill him simply because he didn\u2019t want to, demonstrating a lot of Angelo\u2019s change over the course of the season. He starts as an empty shell, he craves bloodlust, he slowly gains a sense of camaraderie, he loses himself again, and finally has no emotions left to give besides contentedness. Whether he lives or not after the end is not the point \u2013 rather he has achieved the satisfaction he has always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nFor all three of these characters \u2013 Angelo, Nero, and Corteo \u2013 a major theme persists: family.\\n\\n\r\nFamily drives these men to commit their heinous, violent actions. Angelo\u2019s family is murdered, so he takes it on himself to seek revenge. Nero\u2019s family wanted to survive, to keep their family prosperous, so they killed others regardless of who their victims were since for them family matters most. Corteo was Angelo\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cbrother,\u201d so his hit on Nero was, at its core, the only logical way to save Angelo from what Corteo felt was inevitable death.\\n\\n\r\nThe different family feuds that spark each conflict. Angelo, like Corteo, becoming Nero\u2019s \u201cbrother.\u201d A meta connection to mafia movies and their focus on families. Family seeps into 91 Days, giving its cast more to work with on a thematic level.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, as they say, \u201cblood is thicker than water.\u201d For this reason, the anime slightly missteps with Angelo\u2019s character. In short, he needs more backstory. Outside of the first episode and the brief conversation he has with Corteo at the zoo about his little brother wanting to go there someday, the anime does not delve deep into Angelo\u2019s background. His revenge is based on family, and the story overall is based on family, so not giving more on his family works against his character.\\n\\n\r\nNot that anybody needs more of a reason than the murder of one\u2019s family to get vengeance. However, on a character level, since the anime refused to show more of Angelo\u2019s upbringing and the relationships he maintained with his little brother (let alone his mother and father who interact with him next to zero times total), it stands as a missed opportunity to flesh out his character and the narrative at large.\\n\\n\r\nOne character not touched on yet is Fango. Fango can be summed up with one word: outlier. He is basically a sociopath who runs around the town, picking fights with the Vanetti\u2019s as the Orco\u2019s hired muscle man.\\n\\n\r\nAs an outlier, he goes against almost everything in 91 Days. His personality is messed up, indicated by the masochistic play he enjoys. He disrupts the balance held between the three biggest families. And he doesn\u2019t care about family at all; he only cares about himself.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Fango is too much of an outlier. In this world of drama and realism, Fango does not mesh with the entire package whatsoever. His overall tone and psychotic behavior often derails the show\u2019s seriousness, ruining what the anime has already accomplished. Again, yes, that\u2019s the point, for that\u2019s basically what an outlier does. But the anime still took him a bit too far.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the music within 91 Days follows the mafia\u2019s footsteps once more. Some pieces remind the audience of Italy with classical guitar, woodwind instruments, and oddly peaceful compositions. Tense, more dramatic moments get frantic and eerie when similar-sounding tracks start playing. And a slow, bleak piano arrangement keeps the somber atmosphere in check.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s opening track arguably goes too lofty in its presentation. 91 Days is a realistic, mafia-based drama, so the whispering vocals and orchestral backing stand in stark contrast to the Italian OST. However, it\u2019s not without style. The harrowing yet hopeful tone, the ending violin strings, and the haunting piano melody somewhere in the middle match the show\u2019s own cool delivery.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is by no means flashier than the OP, but that\u2019s precisely why it comes out on top. It\u2019s a smooth ride, the vocalist\u2019s constant \u201cLa\u2019s\u201d and the accompanying instrumental work \u2013 the acoustic guitar, piano, light taps on the drums, and what sounds like plucked cello strings \u2013 give the ED its mellow, bittersweet vibe. The slight changes in pitch only further cement this piece as the better of the two.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting contains nothing notable besides perhaps Kenjirou Tsuda as Fango. His bravado and insanity, as well as his masochistic tendencies, are more readily pronounced thanks to Mr. Tsuda\u2019s fine work.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI have respect for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt was an original outing that did not focus on the usual cutesy, ecchi side of the medium. Instead, it went for entertaining drama, bringing with it obvious inspiration from other sources and a complete story (which is rare for us anime watchers).\\n\\n\r\nDespite my affinity for moe and romance, and my distaste for gun-centric plots (since they usually devolve into the everyone-important-miraculously-does-not-seem-to-get-shot-until-required mentality), I cannot lie and say I disliked those more intense scenes. That first episode is gripping, Corteo murdering Fango was awesome, and the shootout at the theater brought character death after character death.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I wish the cast was stronger and the themes were explored more since these are two of my other go-to qualities that I look for in many of my anime. These qualities were fine here in this one, but they were also nothing I was hugely attached to.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely, while I am a big fan of avant-garde ideas and presentation, I\u2019m of the opinion that the ending would have been better suited without so much ambiguity. In fact, I wanted it to go all the way and have Angelo kill Nero. Give me the full revenge, then go for \u201crevenge is pointless.\u201d It would have been much more satisfying since the entire plot is predicated by his revenge, and it would have made going with the route it did an easier one to follow.\\n\\n\r\n91 Days stands as a solid anime. Intense plot points, a very fitting OST, and a look at how family influences one\u2019s actions make for a thrilling experience. The weak animation in the second half of the season, the lack of deeper character exploration, and the unnecessarily ambiguous ending hold the show back at times. Still, these issues thankfully do not throw the whole show overboard.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, while nothing groundbreaking, the intense moments, a thorough plot, and themes on revenge make Angelo\u2019s tale both gripping and interesting\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, while the artistic direction sets up the setting well, and the designs of the characters are varied, worsening actual animation and way-too-obvious inconsistencies hamper the visuals\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Angelo, Nero, and Corteo are motivated by family, with Angelo missing important background details, Nero needing more investigation, and Fango acting as too much of an outlier\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, great OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, much respect for what it set out to do\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Right of the bat 91 days is a series that wants to establish itself as average. Sure it's not a highscool or robot anime and it deals with real life issues like gangsters and turf wars but it does so in a very bland and predictable way. The story focuses on revenge and it does a decent job of getting the point across. But it also uses lots of cheap tricks like underdeveloped characters, confusing pacing and killing off like 90% of it's cast. The writers seem to think that the Mafia world is nothing but murder all the time and while that is necessiralytrue for the most part  it fails to develop the characters further than \"I want to kill you\". A lot of the twists are shocking at first but then you realize that they only happen because the plot demands it and the characters are given temporary stupidity powers. Obviously in the actual world of gangsters people would be more complex and less trusting. For the most part it is not a bad series and it is worth a watch because not many animes focus on this type of material. I just wish it would have presented it in a deeper way instead of using it as an excuse to kill off characters left and right. In almost every single episode a character dies and after a while it's not even shocking or meaningful. Even the main character acknowledges that it may have been all for nothing. That doesn't stop it from coming across as bland though.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nCookie cutter revenge plot with some twists and turns here and there but doesn't really go anywhere with it. The ending itself seemed anticlimactic and the overall story structure and pacing could have been delivered better. There are way too many plot convinieces that seem out of place and are just there to muddle the story even more than it needs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nFor the most part they are varied but apart from that they all come off as very one dimensional with not a lot of motives to work with. The names fit the setting but other than that some characters are killed off too quickly and too carelessly that it's hard to take them seriously. Betrayals become the order of the day and it makes one wonder how the characters made it so far if they are so trusting. As stated before, some characters appear to get stupid out of nowhere just as an excuse to make it easier to kill them off later. So some times it's hard to even take them seriously.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\r\nThe presentation itself seems solid enough, although the animations do seem a bit clunky at times. The art does it's job and shows a certain style to it that reflects that prohibition era setting. But other than that it's nothing to write home about. As far as the sound goes, the opening seems a bit out of place and a big band number or something having to do with music from that era would have been more appropriate. The ending theme \"Rain or Shine\" seems to fit the series a whole lot better. The tracks used in the anime itself are not really memorable but they also don't distract from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series depicts life during prohibition era in a somewhat lose fashion. It gets the point across but it also takes a lot of unnecessary liberties like making the action take place in a fictional town and having some unknown brewer make what seems to be the equivalent of liquid gold in the form of lawless heaven. It gets confusing at first because you are not sure whether the story takes place in our universe or a parallel version of 1930's America. It seems unnecessary in my opinion and they could have made the story take place in a real town while still making references to bigger cities.\\n\\n\r\n Worth a watch if you're looking for something other than high school anime. Just don't expect it to be anime of the year or anything like that.",

However in this place, I need to admit the opening song was one of the best of all time. It is so perfectly suited and the song is so good itself, also the animation in the opening isgreat. That's the reason why music is outstanding. You need to hear it on your own!\\n\r\nWhy I rated it as 9? Simply because it is not a story which should be watched many times. It is rather like a movie cut into episodes. You just sit and watch the whole story and then get the anime hangover. If I had to use only one word to rate it, I would say \"great\".",

            "content": "It\u2019s the 1930s. It\u2019s America. This can mean only one thing: Prohibition! Sex, drugs, alcohol and profanities are the signs of the times. The speakeasies are up and running, the moonshine is being made and the bootleggers and Mafioso are running around town shooting each other up and generally being a nuisance. It\u2019s a lawless age in the lawless town of, Lawless\u2026. That is actually what the town is called. Imaginative; right?\r\nWhen I saw 1930s America and Prohibition, my mind did wander towards comparisons to Baccano, set in the same time. However, and unlike 91 Days, Baccano is an absolute romp. It\u2019s fun and fast-pacedand inherently cool. 91 Days is a world away from that as a story primarily concerned with revenge, which is much darker. About the only thing the two have in common is a similar art style which appears to be a staple when it comes to anime about the 1930s, and a few jazzy soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nYet there is something about the world that 91 Days presents that is really attractive, especially to those who enjoy how \u2018sexy\u2019 the 1930s is, and how slick it can sometimes seem to the modern viewer. The production team did a really good job with creating an immersive atmosphere. There were a couple of occasions when there were a few problems (my mind recalls a scene in episode 2 when Nero and Avilio are walking through a market which looked distinctly out of place), but for the most part the production was generally excellent and did build an excellent town that felt like it could have been a real-life town in America. Adding to the setting was a combination of dark colour tones and melancholic, orchestral soundtracks with their distinctive violins and piano pieces. There were a few soundtracks that could be classed under \u2018jazz\u2019, but the intention of the writers, which fed into the narrative about revenge, was to craft a dark atmosphere to match the equally dark plot, characters and themes which the story was attempting to portray, and like I said earlier, the production team did an excellent job. The setting and atmosphere complimented the narrative and the characters really well. Not to mention that 91 Days has an element of Tarantino and Scorsese, and as a fan of their films, I really enjoyed watching an anime that felt like the gangster films of the aforementioned directors.\\n\\n\r\nRevenge stories, in one sense, are the easiest idea to conceive. All one needs is an avenger, the evil enemy that has wronged them, a credible motive and a shedload of betrayal. Yet executing a revenge story is far more complicated. What becomes clear is that the plot and main character become entwined. The plot of the anime is the story of the character who has been wronged. If both elements works, the anime is a triumph of excellence, as the plot and the lead character are knitted together superbly (Gankutsuo is something that does this really well). However, should the character seem badly written, or his motive useless, the revenge tale falls apart, as it becomes difficult to emphasise with the character\u2019s revenge or to take them seriously. This doesn\u2019t mean that the revenge tale has to be wholly realistic, but that the character\u2019s motives and actions make sense in the context of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, 91 Days does an excellent job as a revenge tale. Our hero or antihero Angelo Lagusa sees his family gunned down by the Vanetti family and vows vengeance against them. The story itself picks up about seven years later where Angelo (now under the pseudonym of Avilio Bruno) befriends the son of Don Vanetti, Nero Vanetti, with the clear intention of worming his way into the Vanetti inner circles to eliminate the Vanetti family and see his revenge come to fruition. Avilio\u2019s revenge tale is framed by a turf war between the Vanetti\u2019s and the Orco family as they attempt to control the town of Lawless.\\n\\n\r\nAvilio, the empty shell of our lead character, is a man driven by his thirst for revenge, and this can sometimes have him come across as mysterious (in the sense that he doesn\u2019t talk much and seems a bit dry as a character), but when push comes to shove and he is given the chance to execute aspects of his revenge, he comes alive. Avilio as a character is a ruthless, Machiavellian and opportunistic avenger. He has a plan, and exploits it with an efficiency and subtlety that doesn\u2019t always shout at the viewer what Avilio\u2019s plan is, and doesn\u2019t rely on shocking events solely to get some mileage out of an episode. Even when Avilio commits an action that seems out of place (something happens in the first couple of episodes that fits the bill) or teams up with the sadomasochistic and seriously deranged Fango (a character guilty of embellishing the insanity stakes for the sake of insanity and one of few failings in the show), Avilio always seems in control of his own actions and of those around him. Yet none of Avilio\u2019s decisions seem forced or unnatural. There is a natural progression to the plot and to Avilio\u2019s actions. His motives and actions make sense in the context of his revenge. Plus he looks as cool as all hell while executing his revenge plan. He might be difficult to connect with emotionally, but you have to admire his ruthlessness.\\n\\n\r\nAs with revenge tales, the viewer experiences the story through the prism of the main character. Avilio is the conductor of his revenge tale, and as such is something of the unreliable narrator. The viewer experiences Avilio\u2019s relationships through his point of view. Fango is the idiot puppet king being controlled by Avilio, yet it\u2019s his relationship with Nero that shows this unreliability at its fullest. Nero as a character is portrayed as the typical caring brother who cares not only for his family members but also for the Vanetti mafia family as well, always striving to please his father and accepts the burden of others. However, his future is shaped by his interactions with Avilio, and we the viewer are an extension of these interactions. One example is Avilio suggesting that Nero invest in an alcoholic drink made by his childhood friend Corteo. While Nero uses the drink to corner the alcohol market, Avilio uses it to further his ambitions by using Nero\u2019s influence to get the alcoholic drink Lawless Heaven into all the pubs, which has impacts later on in the narrative. Even more obvious is when Nero ascends to become the don of the Vanetti Family. Avilio\u2019s fingerprints are all over this scheme. It\u2019s obvious to the viewer what will happen when Avilio befriends Nero, yet the process by which he slowly betrays him is still intriguing, even if it isn\u2019t original, especially to those who have seen revenge stories play out.\\n\\n\r\nAvilio\u2019s relationship with Corteo, his childhood friend, is different to the relationship with Nero. Corteo gives Avilio his humanity and I enjoyed their to-and-fro interactions. I\u2019m not fond of characters like Corteo, who can seem a bit whiney at times, but he had a humanising effect on Avilio, which enriched both their characters. Corteo is the only character who gets angry at Avilio for his continued involvement with the mafia and is the moralising element in the story. With the exploration of betrayal and loyalty and the mafia, there needs to be a moralising character to keep the narrative human. This is especially prevalent in the later episodes, when Avilio and Corteo\u2019s relationship is explored in more depth, giving Avilio a surprising level of humanity to his personality. It can be easy to see Avilio as the Machiavellian puppet-master that he is for most of the story, but his interactions with Corteo give Avilio\u2019s personality some extra colour, and not just merely keeping him as the empty shell that he was for most of the series. Although they is a lack of subtlety to their relationship at times (including one memorable encounter), I appreciated the fact that the writers gave Avilio some humanity: it makes his inevitable betrayals that much more impactful, and makes the ending much more dramatic. After all, one cannot relate to an empty shell.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, 91 Days was an excellent revenge tale told in a wonderful setting with an excellent lead in Avilio, who is equal parts vengeful as he is human. The deconstructions of the ideas of betrayal, family and loyalty are nothing new, but the tale is told in a wonderful setting. The Prohibition town that is built is wonderful, truly excellent and in some ways, the setting that is used enhances the story of revenge being told. A really well-written, character driven story that worked better than it might have done because it was written in a context that perfectly aided the tale of revenge and vengeance. An anime for those who are attracted to the allure of America in the 1930s, for those looking for a good revenge tale and for anyone looking for a good, character-driven story.\\n",

            "content": "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. - The Godfather\r\nStory\r\nThere is something about mafia series that makes my heart flutter. It might be because I have a thing for anti-heroes, bag stabbing and questionable motives. Okay now I know there is something wrong with me... \r\n91 days is a series (With a very confusing name) where we follow Angelo Lagusa, or rather his alias Avilio Bruno, as he infiltrates himself close to the people who many years ago, killed his family, in mind killing them all and getting his revenge. We watch Avilio get close to the people, especially one Nero Vanetti, who wasalso part of the group who wiped out the Lagusas. \\n\r\nThe series likes to keep the audience in suspense, though the plot moves fast enough that it doesn't get boring. It's pretty much like this: everything is fine and cool, then something unexpected happens, the suspense \u2013 what is going on? What is going to happen? Then just when you think everything is fine again, everything goes bad-shit-insane. Repeat the cycle.  \\n\r\nThe only slight problem I had with the show, was the ending. I can see why some people would call it a \u201dbad ending\u201d because of it. Don't get me wrong, personally I liked it, it was all in all solid, and naturally I have my own theories of it, which I will not be going into. The fact that they let the audience make their own conclusions, not giving us a clear yes or no, is something that is a hit or miss when it comes to viewers. (Code geass, much?) Then again, isn't a good ending supposed to be something that sticks to your mind, be the conclusion to your liking or not. \\n\r\nTaking all that in to consideration, I'll be granting the story a score of \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the art was amazing. The tone of it is very serious, and the color scale is narrow, gloomy, sticking mainly to various shades of brown and grey. It fit the show very well, giving it that sort of natural look. The character designs themselves were rather detailed, when it came to their facial features. Though I'm not a big fan of the wide chin type of appearance, in this show it worked. There isn't much more I can say about the art, I mean, it was good in the first episode, it was good all the way to the last, seems like closed case to me. \\n\r\n9/10  \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nOh the soundtrack... the sweet sweet soundtrack. Who am I kidding, once again, I don't remember much of anything. Sorry people, I'm sure it was good, but it's been a while since I finished the show, and I'm just too lazy to go to and listen to two hours of soundtracks to be able to find about three sentences worth of text to say about it. \\n\r\nThe opening though, is pure gold. It is one of those openings that I didn't skip once during the show, and listened on my headphones even after finishing it, heck I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this, 29.12.2016, 6:17pm. But what can you expect when the same person who did this, did the storm breaking  Tokyo Ghoul opening. It fits the dark theme of the show perfectly, the almost whispered lyrics and delicate high notes, as if they were cries of despair, still give me shivers. Oh and hats off to both the Japanese and English voice actors, they pretty much nailed it, in my opinion. (It's not like Austin Tindle is one of my favorite voice actors or anything..*cough, cough*) \\n\r\nWith that, I give the sound\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nOkay now we get to business, if you're like me, and have a weird obsession of anti-heroes, then oh boy are you going to like these characters. The cast is rather large, taken that it's a mafia series, many characters are bound to appear. The main duo are Avilio and Nero, whom I already mentioned. Though, there are a couple other characters that were if not crucial, but at least important to the plot, biggest of all Avilios childhood friend Corteo. It's sort of weird, watching the characters form relationships with each other, forming trusting friendships, not knowing that they are lying to each other by a wide margin. It's also great to see how the things that happen during the show, not only affect the plot but the characters mentalities. Real humans wouldn't go by seeing death everywhere, murdering others and come out of it like they were on a leisurely stroll in the park, (unless you know, you're a psychopath) and neither do the characters of 91 days, which makes them so much more real and appealing to the audience. We see the character mentality slowly starting to crack when things start to swell up, to get out of hand and there is just something so satisfying about that. \\n\r\nSo for the characters I have to go all out and give it a full score.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm now going to dig deeper into Avilio as a character, if you haven't seen the show yet, I would advice not reading this and hop on to Enjoyment, as it is a spoilerific territory.\\n\\n\r\nAngelo Lagusa aka Avilio Bruno. In short, I like him, I really do. Here is why: \\n\r\nHe is mostly a blank faced young man, but then there are those moments when he actually uses his face muscles and you just know that this guy is crazy. It was what got me watching this show, in the first episode when he opens the letter and lets out that psychotic smile.  \\n\r\nAvilio is a character, driven only by his motivation to get revenge, to the point that he doesn't even care about his own life anymore, he just wants to avenge their death, so much so that I strongly believe that he would have eventually killed himself, for not having a purpose anymore. \\n\r\nDespite all that, he is not stupid, in fact he is very tactical, and a skillful liar. So skillful in fact, that I wouldn't mind lifting him to the anime hall of fame of liars, among such geniuses as Light Yagami and Lelouch vi Britannia. \\n\r\nDuring the series we see his character form, he starts to have genuine relationships with the people around him, still he never lets go of that final goal of his. The audience starts hoping that he'd take another course of action, until we get to the last episodes and we see what happens with him and Corteo. We as the audience just know that that was the straw that broke the camels back. I think Corteo was much like a moral anchor for him, the only thing keeping him human. But after what happened, there is nothing he could strap his humanity on to, and he breaks and is going through with his plan no matter what. \\n\r\nAnd just for fun, here is what I think happened in the end: he died. Simple as that. We see him asking Nero earlier on why didn't he kill him when he had the chance, he wanted to die, he would have wanted to die with his family, and if Nero wouldn't kill him, he'd do it on his own. Then on the beach as he walks past Nero, he knows it's coming, he want's it to come. That's him giving Nero permission to shoot him, as it's the same scene like the first time. Avilios back to Nero, fleeting to distance. So Nero shoots him, not because of revenge or hate, but because he knew exactly that Avilio wanted it, it was him granting the last remaining wish of a man that didn't have anything else left. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching this show, it was an ongoing series and I think I watched around the first 3 episodes like that and realized that I couldn't go on like that. This is not a show that impatient people like me can watch on a 1 episode week pace. So I was a good girl and waited till it was over and marathoned the crap out of it. If I had continued watching it like that, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much, simply because there are a lot of elements in the plot that I would have long forgotten during the wait. But because I knew myself so well, I happened to enjoy the show pretty damn much. 91 days is one of those shows that you can't put away before you get a conclusion, since every episode contained some sort of hook to keep the audience. So in short yes I did enjoy 91 days, definitely, but even though I'm now praising it, and I remember that when I finished it I was so overwhelmed by it, I couldn't think about anything else for like a week and then I pretty much forgot it, until my friend was like \u201dYou should do a review of 91 days\u201d and I'm like \u201dDamn I watched that, yea it was great!\u201d \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\n91 days is one of the rare animes that deal with the topic of mafia, and it does it really well. Yes it has it's flaws, all series do, but nothing so major it should stop you from watching the show. The ending divides people, and some may argue that it wasn't good, but I have to disagree. \\n\r\nThe absolute charm of the series for me were the twisted characters, and watching they grow and evolve during the show. \\n\r\nIt's one of those shows that is really easy to like, much like Death note, it's something I would recommend watching if you're new to anime, or if you're trying to get your friends into it. Not saying you shouldn't watch it, even if you're an old watcher like myself. \\n\r\nPlugging in numbers the average score that I got for 91 days was 9 and well that's what I was going to give it anyway, so great the overall score matched with everything else. \\n\r\n9/10 \\n",

            "content": "91 Days is a bit of a mixed bag. It has a classic revenge-saga setup, a rare-for-anime setting in gangland 1930s America, and some really standout moments of writing and animation. All this along with a story that sometimes drags, an impenetrable main character, and some downright boring episodes. My viewing recommendation - if you want to see this show but would prefer to avoid the weaker points - would be to watch episodes 1 and 2, then episodes 8 through 12. \r\nI had high hopes for this series after episode 2 because it felt like the plotting was moving briskly and the writing wasreally quite good. Unfortunately the series loses steam for the next few episodes, largely because the protagonist, Angelo Lagusa/Avilio Bruno, is never explored as a character. Much is made of his implacable poker face and inborn talent for gang politics, but any moments of insight into his psyche are few and far between. The supporting characters are explored much more, and that has the unfortunate result of making them more interesting than our MC. There are two female characters with speaking lines, whose character development is very limited. This is unfortunate, because Fango's tart seemed to be set up as rather cunning and shrewd, and I'd have loved to see her with a greater role in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are still moments here worth watching. Those first two episodes are good, and episode 8 is extremely good, largely because its focus is Corteo, one of the more accessible characters in the show. That episode had the right combination of dramatic story notes, character interactions, and skillfully utilized animation to make it the standout episode of the show, particularly its final, shocking scene. The episodes after 8 are not as good but are still very meaty, and the last three episodes finally crack open Angelo's shell, allowing the themes and message of the show to finally shine through. Violence begets violence begets violence, which is all, in the end, for nothing.",

In terms of Art, its not superb yet its not like Clannad which is why it received an 8. Based on sound, the voice actors were great and all but the gunshots thatwere presented was not too fantastic, worthy of an 8. For characters, Avilio draws a close similarity to Ciel from Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji) and hence my character rating is wayy lower than my other ratings. Most characters in the series are just your typical mafia members and out to have profit kinda guys and hence a 6 only. In terms of personal enjoyment, since I started the series since the first episode aired, I was surprised that it had me drawn to continue keeping up with it rather than me procrastinating, I actually wanted to find out more. Overall, an 8. 91 Days was a great series and does not seem to have any potential for a 2nd season considering everything has been drained out, however, an OVA might be possible to display the aftermath.",

From the amazing Op from the same people who did the Op for Tokyo Ghoul to the most soothing End that still manages to make it so relaxing with juts a tune no lyrics. I alsolove how it follows the main character avenging his family's death on his 12th birthday and ruining the life of the person who helped out with the killings. This is an anime worth watching and this is just my opinion but I hope you found this useful and probably give it a shot.",

It can bring up interesting storytelling, and action. Another thing that hooks me on these types of show is it keeps me on edge of my seat till the end.  This is an easy show to binge watch on. \r\nArt: The art is pretty decent. It has the noir style (which fits it really well).  It did it job reallywell, and that all I say. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is one of the instants that I will say watch the dub than the sub. I did finish this show in sub, but I did watch an episode dubbed, and I think these type of shows fit a dub really well. Funimatoon did the dubbing of this and they did really well on this, and it deserves all the praise it does. The opening was great, the ending didn't really catch my eye but it was OK.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In a mafia story thier are your basic characters the main, the villian, and the friends. You have to have a really great villain to make a story like this great, and I think 91 Days did that well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: As an overall value it a 10 an instant favorite for me. As for my enjoyment I very much enjoyed my time through this, and I think it worth a watch.",

            "content": "91 Days is a mixture of the Sopranos, Baccano and The Godfather.  It does a pretty good job through 95% of it, but in the same way the Sopranos left fans irritated by the ending, without spoiling anything, this anime will, too.   The true highlight of this anime was Angelo, the Protagonist, who reminded me a great deal of Lelouch from Code Geass.  In fact, I was thinking: \"I'd like to see Angelo vs. Lelouch in a battle of scheming.\"  That's how clever Angelo was as a protagonist.  (Although, I think Lelouch would win.).   \r\nAlong with Angelohowever was a cast of rich characters with actual motivations that went beyond the typical \"Good vs. Evil\" cliche.  The main targets of Angelo's revenge, the Verittis, put family above all as their main goal, and not just \"I want to be rich.\"  It added some depth and sympathy to Nero's character which really brought power to the story.   Of course, you did have some characters who were a bit cliche evil like Ronaldo and Fango (Who does one of the craziest things I've ever seen an anime character do.).  But, overall, the cast was very realistic and grounded.   This came off like a true mob story and not just an anime loosely based on the mob.   \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to knock the anime, it has to be the last 10 or so minutes of the anime.  \\n\\n\r\n(Don't read beyond this as it CONTAINS SPOILERS).  \\n\\n\r\nOnce everything was done and his revenge was had, I found it a bit ludicrous that they were having a long countryside journey together after killing each other's family.  A moment of levity, or a small moment of reminiscing before the final kill would make sense.  But a multi-day, cross-country trip to the beach?  It kind of ruined the immersion and realism set up by everything before.  They also tried too hard to be like the Sopranos in taking the final scene of that show and basically switching it from a restaurant to a car on a dirt road, with a \"Oh, what happened?\" kind of open ending.  \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, which hurt the anime, and why I gave it a 9 and not a 10 (plus Fango was a little over the top for this kind of story) this is a great anime you'll definitely enjoy.",

            "content": "This was an anime that I immensely enjoyed. It doesn't present any reinventions of the genre, but I feel like it accomplished what it set out to do: tell a compelling revenge story centered around the mafia. The plot was well focused; it didn't get lost in side stories, and there was just enough exposition and development to keep me engaged. I like to sit back and let the story drive, so if you're the type who likes to solve mysteries before their time, you may see some of the twists coming. I never did, personally. \r\nAs far as the characters go, some people findthem lacking, especially the \"protagonist\" Avilio/Angelo. After watching it through, I actually thought Avilio fit the part fairly well. His family was murdered as a child, and now he lives for the sole purpose of exacting his revenge on their killers. He's an empty shell. You do get to see some inner turmoil as the plot unfolds, but I think it's rather poignant that it isn't overplayed. \\n\\n\r\nI think my favorite thing about 91 Days is that there is no true protagonist. Everyone is a double crosser, everyone lies, everyone kills. But each character is also someone's friend, a part of someone's family. I was never fully on anyone's side, but I never fully hated any of the characters either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the soundtrack is superb, and the story feels just the right length. I would definitely watch it again just to try and see the twists coming.",

            "content": "\"Revenge and retaliation always a perpetrate the cycle of anger, fear and violence.\" \r\nRevenge is best serve cold. Everyone gets a piece of revenge in one way or another. When someone wants to take revenge, they bring everyone who is near them down with them. \r\nStory\r\nI have to say that the story is like a typical revenge story. The main character wants to take revenge for his family and he will go through any means necessary to fulfill that revenge. There were parts in the anime where I could not believe that things happened the way that it did and it made me feel abit depressed. I mean even when I knew how things were going to work out, I still felt sad and depressed. I would have to say that I found it really cool how the story took place during the Prohibition era. You get a chance to learn what sort of things were happening around that time; especially involving the mafia and the illegal distribution of alcohol. But overall I thought the story was good and I enjoyed it in some way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are nothing really special in my opinion. There is nothing really anything that stands them out in both personality and design. The main character Avilio is only special because he is the main character and he has a revenge plot against Nero. That is basically it. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAgain the art is nothing really special. The animation is also nothing special. Although it did give me Baccano vibes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEven though this anime consists of a sort of typical revenge story I would have to say that I did enjoy it. There were some things that I wished that they would address but overall it was enjoyable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "One of the most prominent issues with original anime is how the story does in a medium that relies on its quirks and niche appeal. 91 Days has this initial problem as it's a classic prohibition era gangster anime. No immortal gang members, no stupidly overpowered hitmen, and no gimmicks that are often seen in most anime that make them, well, anime. While a straight to the point gangster plot is somewhat refreshing in an otherwise crazy market, 91 days finds itself being lackluster as you don't end up comparing it to anime like baccano, but rather you compare it to any other western gangsterfilm that do it much better in a more suitable medium. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off with, the plot on paper is actually quite solid. We have a tale of revenge in which the main character's family is murdered by a mafia family that his father collaborated with, and he grows up trying to gain the trust of the gang while attempting to kill those involved with his family's murder While on paper this story is fine, there is this feeling where even though this anime is only 12 episodes, a lot of unnecessary things happen that aren't relevant to the plot. While there aren't any plotholes, there are many times that there isn't enough detail to really care about what goes on in the story. The pacing is actually a stronger component of the anime as I never felt that they were rushing the plot forward, but I do feel the end is somewhat disappointing and leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the animation is extremely dull and at times has its QUALITY moments. When I saw that this was the same studio that ended up animating Durarara's sequels, I knew immediately that animation may be a problem. Sure enough, 91 days is severely lacking in the animation department. It isn't based off of style of art, as the style doesn't explain instances in which animated characters look barely recognizable, or that a car accident looks closer to an older looney tunes episode than what we would see in modern day anime geared towards adults. Overall, the biggest disappointment with this anime would for sure go towards its animation\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the sound is actually fairly good at setting the atmosphere. TK has never disappointed in the music department, and the background music does a very good job creating a setting of prohibition America. The only concern is that while the music always seemed to fit the mood, it's very subtle and nothing really stands out musicwise aside from the OP. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. On one hand, these aren't your cookie cutter trope characters that only show personality that resembles their archetype, but on the other hand, none of these characters are really competitive against the likes in which this show can be compared to (baccano, black lagoon, any western gangster film). The main character is an anti-hero who has no real development, which isn't a problem as he's sort of a force of nature. There are a lot of characters that are introduced which are forgotten very early on, and you only really feel two characters are fleshed out well (Nero and Corteo) while the supporting cast does very little to make you involved with the exception of Fango. Another thing to note is that the characters don't particularly have unique personalities, and their interactions with each other are quite standard.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I noticed from watching this anime was that I never really cared what was going to happen right after each episode. While there were cliffhangers that piqued my curiosity on what would happen next episode, I found myself not wanting to continue and forced myself to watch the remaining episodes. It's not so much that this anime is bad, but it's very hard to casually watch it without paying attention. Add on the fact that it's quite boring at times, and you've got a show that requires your undivided attention while being just boring enough to make you not want to continue (kind of like a lecture you need to pay attention to in a class you're not really fond of). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a breath of fresh air from all the other generic anime, and does fulfill its role as a serious original anime with a relatively new premise. That being said, this premise has been done before in western media, and its been done much better by the likes of Scorsese. If you are a fan of crime dramas, 91 days won't bring anything new to the table, but it's worth watching if you've exhausted every other option for a crime drama.",

They did a fantastic job with accurate representation of the life back in the bootleg days in Chicago. The character development was a little bland, but the action and mental play was plenty. It did get a bit confusing; the family names and who is mad at who and why. It was crisscrossing all over the place and that was the only thing I struggled to keep up on. The ending of the anime left youwondering whether the series will continue. If not, I still think it's perfect where it left off. Kind of makes you feel a bit empty inside like something's missing. You'll know what I mean when you see the end of 91 Days. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, fantastic anime for those with more complicated relationships. Most impressive anime of 2016 in my opinion but not the best I've seen. I honestly don't think I'd re-watch the anime since there are quite a few times that situations just sort of dragged on more than I liked. Love the main character and his best friend though.

Baccano is a case in point, while91 Days was not quite as appealing; but it is turned out better than I expect from the first two episodes.\r\nAt first, I imagined this would be a long revenge driven dirge punctuated by lashings of the old ultraviolence.

            "content": "I don't really know how to write anime reviews, but 91 Days was a great anime imo!\r\nStory 10/10 \r\nI love the plot in general. The back story is great and there are surprises here and there. I had my rating set to a 9 until the last episode. The ending is amazing! It leaves you wondering because people have different interpretations of the ending. The story of Avilio trying to get revenge for his family, but slightly opening up to Nero, one of the Vanettis, is dark, depressing, and beautiful. It shows his struggles and how he believes that revenge would ultimately fulfill his life,give him a meaning, but it doesn't. Nice conflict and conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation was not amazing and detailed like other popular anime. However, I really liked this style. It matches the anime and the whole mafia older time setting. The colors are not bright and vibrant, and they shouldn't be. The characters look nice. I love the opening and ending scenes. They are also so beautiful and even though I usually skip those, I loved watching the opening and ending scene for 91 Days. The last ocean scene and ending theme for 91 Days are drawn nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nAmazing opening and ending themes. A very different theme than what I usually hear in anime and it's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful song and voice. I don't pay attention to sound effects, but I didn't have a problem with anything/nothing stuck out to me so it was probably fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters were great, though during the middle, I felt like development was lacking. The characters seemed static with a flat characterization instead of round. However, the ending proved them to be dynamic. Avilio and Nero had both changed in their way of thinking and so on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI loved it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "91 days (even though it doesn't even take place in 91 days, it's more like 2,555 days). Taking place in the prohibition era, this is about one man's quest for revenge against the mafia for killing his family. Angelo changes his name and joins the mafia to kill everyone from the inside without suspicion It's more than just revenge, because some other stuff happens. Either way, how is this show? Let's see\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story has some highs and some lows. When it's good, the story thrilled me. The best part about it is that one of the mafia men that killed his family is now afriend to the main character, and he's only being used until his inevitable murder. It was very suspenseful waiting for the question to be answered \"when will he die?\" Various other things, like \"will they find out Angelo's real identity?\" But on its low points, the show can feel kind of boring and slow due to the pacing and direction. It always picks up eventually, but it can be a drag at times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nHit or miss. Angelo, our main character is this show's weakest part, aside from the pacing and slow direction. He's the very quiet and reserved type of character. While this might work for a side character, it almost never works for the main character. 91 days is no exception. Except for his vengefulness, you know absolutely nothing about Angelo. There's also a scene in the last episode where he snaps and loses his temper which was just beautiful, so he's not always quiet. Everyone else, though, very good job. One of the driving forces of the show is that Angelo actually befriends one of the mob men, but he does so just so he can die. This character was amazingly written. He was developed to the point where I didn't want him to die, and at the same time I wanted Angelo to get revenge and kill him, thus conflicting me. Extra bonus points to any show that conflicts me with who I want to survive.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nExcellent. These characters look and feel so real, it's great. In the first episode, thee credits are intertwined with various shots, and those shots look real. I could've sworn it was a picture taken on a camera. With the characters, sometimes when they're far away, the animators don't bother to animate their faces or any drast detail, but that's kind of normal with anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNot much worth mentioning, except for the opening which kicked ass.\\n\\n\r\nOTHER THINGS\\n\r\nThe absolute best thing about 91 days is how absolutely different it is from all other anime. You hear anime and you think Japanese high school, super powers, giant robots, big boobs and such. 91 days follows no anime cliches whatsoever, and I can say without hesitation that it's the most stylistically different anime I've ever seen (that and Gankutsuou). It takes place in America, during the 1910's, with an all adult cast, none of which are Japanese. The only anime-like thing about this is the opening that's in Japanese. Major props for never delving into the supernatural or having fan service, it's 100% grounded, serious crime thriller all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Probably. I would suggest this in a heart beat because I loved it overall, but I'm aware why others might not. The pacing, direction, characterization, and lack of focus in the plot is jarring and might turn off some people, but to me those are mere cons in an overall great show.",

            "content": "Following the schemes and tribulations of Angelo Lagusa from the murder of his family to his inclusion in rum running during the American Prohibition, 91 Days is equipped with a plethora of suspenseful writing and devilishly unique characters.\r\nThis isn't to say that what audiences will get from 91 Days is especially new or original, following a very formulaic plot of murder-revenge set against an organized crime background. However, the vivid characters and how they react to one another sell the series as a subtle Hitchcockian tale rife with double dealings and chess-like stratagems.\r\nProduced by studio Shuka, it is obvious from the very first frame that91 Days was being guided by those who brought us the Durarara!! sequels, its characters easily slotting amongst the cast from Ikebukuro. Though this can be seen as recycling previous designs, there is enough anotherness in 91 Days' characters that suck the viewer in, and with the commitment of the voice cast (particularly Kenjirou Tsuda, who is far more lively and convincing in his role of Fango, than his role of Jirou Gamou in Joker Game), we are invested because we care for and remember these characters.\\n\\n\r\nNo individual element falls by the wayside to grandstand another, and thusly the whole of the series comes off as strong, intriguing, and even-footed through its 12-episode run, and I look forward to a continuation of what has been built here.",

This show is kinda more on the depressing side and like a gritty realistic ish show. \r\nThis show is not a common revenge anime where is just like Die DIE DIE but it really is well paced and calculated revenge. \r\nThe show is good the characters are interesting but thestory telling is the strong point  it is not the best but it puts you in the place and the time. The characters conflict is very involving and you don't know what to feel about main character, but i have to say this if you can't take the heat of the show don't watch it its not for everybody not everyone likes this type of anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nGive the show a shot see if you like it its not bad it has a nice story that is simple but told well, the characters are more or less interesting, its fun too watch and over all its an 8 and a half ish \\n\r\n Story 9\\n\r\nArt 7-8\\n\r\nSound 9 (music fits time and it is not over bearing too loud or quiet but not heart moving all the time)\\n\r\nCharacter 9 Interesting\\n\r\nFUN 8\\n\r\nOverall 8 1/2",

            "content": "91 Days is ambiguous but ambition alone doesn't make for a great watch. \r\nShallow would be decent one word description of the show,  while on the surface it's a 12 episodes long mafia revenge story with all the story beats you'd expect, ruthless murder, betrayal, patricide, sacrifice. But if you were to bite into this bloody pie your upper and bottom jaw would meet prematurely. The constant problem with the writing is that there's no weight at all. \r\nIt all starts off well enough, poor Angelo's family is killed in front of him in cold blood and he's was barely lucky enough to runaway, then, seven years later he receives an opportunity for revenge. Decent enough premise for a simple story yet it quickly becomes too ambitious for it's own good. Rather soon we're introduced to three major mafia families and power struggle between them but at no point they're fleshed out enough to give a damn, same goes for pretty much every character. Corteo is probably the closest this show comes to an interesting character. Smart kid who resents mafia had to drive into crime due to brotherly bonds between him and Angelo. Unable to see his brother turn into another criminal he takes action to make it stop, only to meet a very unfortunate end. Meanwhile our protagonist is just a guy who would do anything for revenge except for the part where he kills closest thing he got to family (for revenge), kills a mafia don which leads to collapse of Vanettis he's trying to kill but then doesn't kill one of the men on his hit list just cause didn't want to. \\n\r\nIt's all topped off with a classic, bothched ending, a tradition all too common in anime and manga. Spoilers ahead. Nero, one of Angelo's targets kills him... or he doesn't. The ending is too vague and needlessly open ended. If Nero doesn't kill Angelo then Angelo lives on after being determined to meet his dead friend (that he killed) and without competing his long useless revenge. If he dies then sparing Nero was rather useless and makes him the biggest asshole in the whole show (yes, bigger than Fango). Just awful. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation goes the show got style and decent colour direction bit outside of episode 1 it's hardly impressive and at times looks pretty wonky and cheap. Music is pretty good, orchestral score fits the period and while not outstanding, serves as good background. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this if you want but you should watch Godfather after that if you haven't already.",

            "content": "this anime gives me very conflicting feelings. some aspects of it were really strong, while others i felt lacked due to the nature of the storytelling. \r\nenjoyment and overall (7/10): overall, the anime was good. not great. not bad. just good. it wasn't ugly to look at, the voice acting was solid, the plot was engaging, it had the right about of plot twists and a host of likable (or hateable) characters to choose from. the ending -- while i HATE cliffhangers/open ended conclusions -- fit well here and i actually felt like it was appropriate. i didnt feel like i was wasting time watchingthis anime and i might watch the spin offs but im not sure if i would re-watch it later in the future.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10): the story was engaging but started off very \"Godfather\" like. ill mention this more in characters but personally, I was a little lost in the beginning episodes because of the rapid introduction of all of the main and supporting characters in a short period of time. it made following the plot and determining the importance of certain characters much more difficult. because the plot is packed with different characters, the character development takes a hit in quality, which also affects the plot. but as the anime went on, it definitely got more enjoyable and i started to really become invested in the characters and truly understand their motives. with that being said there, the anime does have its fair share of mafia tropes and cliches.\\n\\n\r\nart (7/10): the fight sequences were pretty solid. i like the color schemes throughout the anime; it really helped enhance the emotions of the scenes but that being said I wasn't really wowed by anything in this area. the characters were very distinct looking and the animation didnt seem to janky but that is to be expected of all animes, not something to give bonus points for unless it was done outstandingly well.\\n\\n\r\nsound (8/10): the sound design was awesome. the gun sounds were amazing and didnt sound like they were all the same gun. the soundtrack was a little boring but it fit the themes and scenes well so im not too bothered. the voice acing was done well, which is to be expected from people like ono daisuke. \\n\\n\r\ncharacters (7/10): like i said before, the beginning episodes kinda just dump a lot of characters on the viewer in a short amount of time, and if youre not actively paying attention you can very well miss something and completely throw you off. this makes trying to determine which characters are important and why difficult. it also messes with engaging with the plot; its harder to have some sort of connection to the characters when you dont know which character belongs to which family and who made alliances with who. the plot is jam packed with different people. but their development is compromised because there is limited screen time and the plot still needs to continue, so because of that, we see a lot of half developments or barely developed characters with potential. a good example is Fio and Ronaldo. i think them as a couple had some potential to really add some layer of drama and complexity to the story if their sub plot was more flushed out \\n\\n",

The protagonist's motive lacked in emotional depth, even though it was a classic one of getting revenge. The plot overall was complex, especially with the different family feuds, which was quite interesting. So although the plot would have been quite interesting, for me personally it lacked the emotional side which allows the viewer to immerse himself in story. \r\nArt\r\nI really liked the art. The style was nice to watch, especially the people. The landscape tended to be a bit unrealistic concerning perspectives. \r\nSound\r\nThe intro was nice (TK from Ling Tosite Sigure!)as well as the closing song. The scenes themselves were lacking from time to time an exciting soundtrack, but overall it was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nAhhh... All I'd like to say, is that the characters didn't quite have that emotional depth to them. I just didn't feel with them, nor did I feel sad or happy for them. They, and the story as well, left me pretty much cold\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it could have been an amazing Anime, if only for a bit more emotional depth and character building.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well that was a surprise, 91 days literally destroyed all of my expectations. 8.5 from me\r\nThis anime was like the freshly baked bread, still warm, straight out the bakery as compared to the one you usually get in the store, a rare treat. \r\nI'll start with the most important - Story:  It's a simple enough idea that you might think will follow a linear pattern, however, as the anime progresses the plot starts deviating from that line, it involves many characters and aspects, it takes unexpected turns and the more you watch the more confused you get and yet the more you actually followthe development with a better understanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Complex figures with individuality that does not have to rely on exaggerated features, all of them are portrayed as people who stand for their own and each is righteous in their thinking, none is introduced as the \"good\" or \"bad\" guy so the viewer is free to decide for himself whom to sympathize with.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply exceptional down to the last character. Very rarely have I seen an anime that does not need the emotional condition  of a character to be explained verbally. Yes, the art allows the viewer to see how the protagonists feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and voice actor selection was also beyond adequate. Beautiful music and amazing VAs, no squeaking, shouting, meowing or quacking, no female VAs voicing male characters or vice versa, pure goodness. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not perfect, it had its downsides as any other anime but it was a fresh sip of air that left me charmed and wanting to see more, like manga or continuation, and also disappointed at the same time because probably neither will happen.\\n\r\n Either way, 91 days is 1 of these shows that bring me back faith that anime has not fully become all about oversized breasts, harem, school cliches, moe and tsundere etc...\\n\\n\\n",

It was definitely an underrated anime back in 2017 and didn't get much appreciation it really deserved.\r\nMainly many of the story lead to the main lead Angelo, this is basically a revenge story with the time around 1800s or so in America and really portrayed a revenge story quite well. The art was a bit dull and dark in most places that didn't visually grab me as other anime would but was pretty good either way. The music didn't really resonate with me eitherand I didn't quite find it suitable for some parts but mainly was quite good as well. Characters all had a specific role to play either being really weird or just bonding a relationship. Mainly this goes with Angelo and Nero but other characters are into this relationship as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were into Baccano then I guarantee that 91 Days could be your anime as well. This is also quite similar to the new anime Banana Fish so if you were both into those anime then I suggest you check 91 Days out",

I haven't seen any other mafia centered anime so this was a first and I'm glad I went out of my comfort zone for this.\r\nThe art is very good. There's some nice scenery glances we get and of course there's alchohol (mafia, duh) so they do a goodjob with that as well. Studio Shuka is known for Durarara!x2, so if you have seen that show, expect similar animation and sound quality. Speaking of sound, they do a great job with the old car sounds, the gunshots and more. I enjoyed the series and look forward to each episode. It didn't feel like a chore to watch (we all have those animes...) Overall, it's a 9/10. I can't say that the animation and characters were 10/10, but they were still high quality. If you're looking for a great drama with a lot of emotional scenes, gunfights, secrets and tension, here ya go. Give 91 Days a shot!",

The plot is about a boy by the name of Angelo Lagusa who had his family taken away from him due to mafia-related business. He then begins to seek revenge on those who took his family away from him. I liked how this anime showed the main \"antagonist\" right off the bat and used the hatred in Angelo's heart to keep the ball rolling throughout the entire show. Angelo knows that he needs to hate Nero in order to get his revenge, but he also needs help from Nero todo that as well. I wasn't too satisfied with the way things turned out at first, but giving it a second look, thinking back to everything that happened, and getting a little help from a friend, i now understand that it all came together and everything makes sense now",

I found the story interesting and many of the characters likable. The Prohibition setting looked real and most of the character looked and dressed right for that time period.For the most part I enjoyed watching the show. There were times when the animation was off-model, but I did not mind it that much. The only problem I had with the show was that I did not like the main character(AngeloLugusa). I disliked him because there was nothing he would not do to get his revenge. He would lied,used, manipulated, betrayed and killed anyone he could as long it severed his plan or they got in his way. He just crossed to many lines for me to find him like able or sympathetic. He was very selfish and had no empathy for anyone but himself. In the end for me he was one of the worst characters in the show. The other character I did not like that much was Fango. Fango's character seemed very out of place in the story. His fashion and behavior did not seem to fit the time period. The character I like the most was Nero Vanetti. Nero was more sympathetic and likable then Angelo because he self-aware and showed guilt/regret and remorse thing he did. He also only killed or hurt other people out self-defense or protect the lives/ honor of his family/friends. I think that in the end he defies the cycle of revenge and show that even if you lose everything you do not have to live on hate to keep going.",

It's a traditional revenge based narrative that plays out for the protagonist to kill them all so that there's some \"justice\" in the world. It's not fancy, but it works.\r\nThe art is spot on for 1920s America before blue jeans came into style, everyone was well dressed even when they were going on murderous rampages orrioting.

            "content": "I came into this show somewhat optimistic. It has a nice premise: Set during the Prohibition Era, a man returns to town after years of being away because he receives new information into the deaths of his family. This is a revenge story, which is a popular focus in the mafia business \u2013 you leave one person alive in a killing spree and it will come back to bite you in the ass. However, the execution of this tale is terrible for a number of reasons.\r\nThe story starts off in Episode One by showing how the Lagusa Family was betrayed by the Vanetti Family andkilled \u2013 all but one, our protagonist, Avilio. The episode concludes by introducing our \u201cantagonist\u201d Nero \u2013 who, by the way, is the guy opposite Avilio on the poster. This automatically left me with a bad taste in my mouth as I ended the episode, because this is a revenge story and that means no matter what happens these two people are going to be alive until the end, when one or both inevitably die by the other\u2019s hand. A lot of the drama of the show is sucked up by this rule, and it adds to the predictability of an already subpar story. If the creators wanted this show to be remarkable at all, they would have kept the revenge plot from us for the beginning of the series and let the \u201cfriendship\u201d between the two blossom before hitting us where it hurts. Now that would have been entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show is so predictable it hurts. Sure, I was surprised in episode two, enough to keep me interested in the story and not drop it, but very rarely since then have I been genuinely surprised by a plot development. Some of this has to do with the rule stated above: neither Nero nor Avilio can die until the end. But some of it also because the writers feel the need to hold our hands so that a plot development doesn\u2019t confuse the audience. For example, the head Don of a rival gang loves lasagna, so much so that we get reminded of this at least three times in the first six episodes. So, when his gruesome underling challenges him, wins, and then brings all of the top gang members in for a \u201cnice\u201d dinner of lasagna, it\u2019s immediately apparent that the meat in the lasagna is the ex-head (Frey Pies, anyone?). The show also tries to convince us many times that Nero\u2019s life is in danger \u2013 how can it be when he is the \u201clast boss\u201d, if you will, in Avilio\u2019s revenge plan?\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other flaws in this story, all because the writers want to spice up the action with as much 1920s gang violence as they possibly can. There\u2019s Prohibition style law breaking, betrayals among many different families, violence galore, and barely explained gang politics. Major plot developments can be introduced in minute 3 and resolved by minute 13. Can I not have more than an episode of suspense? Will this character be caught? Will they drive out that cop in more than a day? Character motivations are glossed over at best for most of these events and we are just expected to go with it because plot. It doesn\u2019t help that the person I like the most is Corteo, a character that is barely seen in the first half but is probably supposed to be Avilio\u2019s moral compass. The writers of this series are trying too hard to add edgy things and Gotcha! moments to a story that might have been somewhat decent without all of that spice. The overall story is therefore mediocre at best and predicable and boring at worst. The ending is also completely unsatisfying, unsurprisingly, even though there were a few good moments sprinkled into the last few episodes. The last episode is weak, disjointed, and pointless and ultimately left me feeling cheated and angry. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned above that my favorite character is a background character \u2013 this is because almost every other character is complete garbage. Both Avilio and Nero are weak, horrible characters. Avilio is defined only by his need for revenge, and most of his dealings in the story revolve around that goal. Nero is a similarly weak character: he is the heir to the Vanetti family and kind of a complete asshole. The show tries to make him somewhat sympathetic with a flashback to the night he killed Avilio\u2019s family from his perspective, but the moment is immediately glossed over because he reveals crucial information about the night to Avilio, and Avilio only cares about his revenge. Avilio is somewhat decent at lying his way out of tight situations and getting on Nero\u2019s good side, but only a complete moron would trust someone so completely as Nero trusts Avilio is such a short period of time. This guy is asking to be killed. These characters are not convincing and, quite frankly, both of them are unlikeable assholes. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every other character is the same. Either the show doesn\u2019t spend much time on them or they are complete moronic assholes. Nero has a small group of friends, who, I can only assume, are all going to be cannon fodder because that guy is such a moron. I\u2019ll mourn for the dude in glasses, he seems pretty cool. Nero also has a father and two siblings, none of which are given any kind of screen time unless the plot demands it. Nero\u2019s brother is ridiculous. Nero\u2019s father is a pushover. Nero\u2019s sister seems nice but easily manipulated. None of these people are given any kind of development and some act certain ways because, as stated above, the plot demands it. Some of the things these characters do are never hinted at until it happens. There are people from the other two mentioned gangs that pop up occasionally, but the most important one is Fango, who is a crazy person working for the Orco family. A lot of the B plot in the first half revolves around him and his shenanigans \u2013 suffice to say, even then, it was difficult to decide who to root for in these fights because everyone in this show sucks. He comes into a lot of power as the show progresses, and it is fun to just sit there and laugh at the morons who helped him into power and immediately regret their decision. Idiots. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much else to say. The animation is mediocre and the color palate changes to fit the mood of the scene. The sound is not much better; I don\u2019t think the opening fits the show very well and I was hoping for a more Baccano! type song. The story is mediocre at best and predicable at worst and the characters are very poorly developed, which only adds to the story\u2019s problems. I don\u2019t usually complete shows I find this many problems with, which does show that it is somewhat entertaining, and by the end I was only invested to see how the Avilio vs Nero showdown happened. But entertainment does not equal good quality. All in all, 91 Days is horrible, from story to characters to even the animation. The creators are waving a set of shiny, blood red keys in our faces, hoping that it distracts us from the blatant problems with the story and characters. Well, I wasn\u2019t distracted. Do a better job next time.\\n",

            "content": "\u2018Wine, guns, mafia and top-notch animation to boot\u2019\r\nStoryline 8/10 \r\nThe writers have only 12 episodes for him to slot in a tale which describes a young boy and his journey for vengeance in which they did brilliantly. \r\nThe story itself does not seemed too rushed and not too compressed to which allows the viewers to understand the story even better at a decent pace. \r\nAside from that, the storyline is not so \u2018basic\u2019 that it does not reveal everything at the first few episodes of the series which incites curiosity and intrigues the audience to think and leaves them wanting to know more at theend of each episode. \\n\r\nPlot-twists and turning of events is to be expected as well, where everything might not seem as they suppose to be and can quickly catch one off-guard, most notably the ending, which I would not spoil too much of. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nGiven how it is still considered to be a modern-age anime, the graphics is expected to be up-to-par in which it did not disappoint. \\n\r\nThe characters and scenes were perfectly drawn and the colours were fitting, in which dull and low-tonne colours were used to supplement the fact that the theme of the anime centers on the underground mafia world. \\n\r\nNothing much to say about the art of 91 Days to which it was splendidly done and beautifully crafted. \\n\r\nSound and Music 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the best soundtracks that I have heard off. Well, at least for the opening\\n\r\nThe band for the opening is also the band that performed the iconic \u2018Unravel\u2019 from Tokyo Ghoul. The opening has a catchy tune and the slow and solemn voice of TK can be heard brilliantly where the \u2018emo\u2019 vibes can be felt from the singer portrayal of the song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters are decently created but fell short of in terms of variations and exclusivity. This is mainly due to that the characters were all pretty stereotypical of the \u2018mafia culture\u2019 and that most of them speak with crude and rude languages, which does hold some merits of associating it with reality that the audience can relate to. \\n\r\nThe main character, Avillo Bruno appeared to be a person that has all the ideas in the palm of his hand to which it makes the character flawless and unfazed which personally for me is not a good thing when it comes to storytelling. What is there to be expected where one is already omnipotent right? \\n\r\nThis concept is pretty much similar to Kirito from SAO and Tatsuya Shiba from Mahouka which is pretty much as perfect as it can get and it is predictable that at the end of the day, the main character can solve the issue at hand with relatively ease. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the storyline of the anime, at the end of each episode I wanted to know more about the story. \\n\r\nTherefore, I really enjoyed the plotline that keeps the audience to know more and there is no flat line where the story might be stalled and redundant. \\n\r\n91 Days offers plenty amount of eye-captivating actions and mind-intriguing dialogues which for me, has kept me occupied and curious. Curious to know more and to quickly find out how the protagonist is able to get out of the troubles that he got himself into in a witty way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nFor 12 episodes, I felt that the anime has done its job in providing the audience with plentiful of excitements and twists. Although there might not be any lovey-dovey and fan-service moments included in this anime, it is its atmosphere and portrayal of crime and revenge that captures the audience\u2019s attention and not the bras and panties. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story itself is good, it's a traditional revenge story with some twists and turns. I liked the opening a lot and the music as whole was very good.\r\nThe only problem that I had was the animation and art. I won't say that they were horrible, but I had problems looking at the anime sometimes.\r\nIn the end it's a very good Anime, and I hope that we can watch more of these takes on mafia and gangs life by Anime because 91 Days wasa good attempt.",

            "content": "Story 10/10:First, I'll give the very basics of this story: wealthy kid has a father who is involved with a crime family, crime family kills his family, kid disappears, kid reappears grown up to take revenge on the crime family by getting close to them. What really stuck out about the story of this show is it's setting. It is strictly prohibition era America; no AU prohibition era with fantasy-like elements, no futuristic space setting that has some kind of prohibition in place on a made up substance, straight prohibition with bootlegging crime families. As for why that is so important, personally, I always enjoyedstories of that era and the different kind of life that is impossible to live now. In terms of actual merit, and not personal opinion, the story of revenge that plays out in this show is fairly complex with its near seamless plot twists and bomb-drops, yet it's not actually hard to follow. If you enjoyed reading \"The Great Gatsby\" because of the setting, but wished it had some more action to it, then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Unless the art in a show is really bad or insanely beautiful, I'm not much of an art critic. All I'll say here is that the prohibition era scenery, characters, and elements in general are accurately and well portrayed\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Since this show deals with a few crime families, naturally there is going to be an ensemble cast to keep track of. 91 Days does a great job at giving you exactly enough development for each character relative to how much they are really worth caring about considering you will not be sure at any point who will live and who is next to die as the main character enacts his plan for revenge.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Because of the \"who will live and die\" aspect of this show, possibly my greatest factor for enjoyment (that I recommend for any prospective viewers) was watching the episodes with a group of friends that all had their own theories of what plot twist/bomb drop would come next, and who would be the next to die, as well as who we want to live. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Between the setting, story, plot twists, characters, and fond memories with my friends, I absolutely loved this show! My only grievance is with the ending: all I will say about it is that it can be left up to individual interpretation and while I have no problem with shows like that, I just personally wanted more for an ending out of a show I enjoyed this much.",

This is wht I call a normal show. The art didn't suit me that much forsome reason. This shows music we're the best and the charcters were mind blowing.

Angelo was luckily to escape, but years later, he wants revenge.\r\n    So the story has a interesting concept. It's very retro 1900's gangster move ish, like The Godfather. Even the show's logo looks like The Godfather's. The story has a lot of suspense and puts you on edge. I think Shuka did a good job on progressing the story in a way, that sets the mood.\r\n  The art is okay. The dark and monochrome pallet of the show emphasizes the mood and toneof the show.  \\n\r\n    The character development continues as the show progresses. It's kind of predictable of how the characters are going to act. There was nothing too shocking, except the end. \\n\r\n     I really liked this show. Kept me on the edge of my seat with excitement.\\n\r\n     Overall, I recommend giving this show a watch if you like your mystery/gangster animes.",

Tell me why someone would pick the time period in America known for being fun, happy, party, glamorized, etc., and make it a depressing, boring, and dull anime?  That's the first mistake.

I'll say that so far, Anime in general has good sound even if everything else sucks.\r\nThe characters were all horrible, so it getsa 1.  The main character was like an emo guy trying to be cool and tough.  \"I talk in a monotone and deep voice to show how badass I am, and how cool I am.\"  While trying to talk tough, he has yet to get in a serious fight.  Even his so called weaker friend has more guts than him.  The other characters were obnoxious, obsessive, jealous, or weak; sometimes they were a combination of 2 or more.  \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment gets a 2 as well.

            "content": "Prohibition is one of my favorite eras of American History.Everyone was going insane killing each other and what not. I also love Revenge.I'm a very fair minded person.If someone scratches my back, I scratch theirs.If someone loans me money, I'll pay them back.Or in this case, If someone murders my family, i'll kill them too, no matter how long it takes.Both of things made a story that sounded promising but it wasn't what I expected.\r\n91 Days is about Avillo Bruno.When he was a kid,his family was murder by some baddy gangsters and now he plans on murdering them. He is friends with a guy whomakes good alcohol and Avillo somehow finds his way into the Vanetti family.And now we see him enact his revenge...for about 4 or 5 episodes.But after that we have to deal with the whole Vanetti deal\\n\\n\r\nOkay, to be honest, I really wasn't paying attention to the whole Vanetti deal.I just wanted Avillo to put a bullet through Nero Vanetti's head and move along.At first.But he is not his target.He might as well have been though.Avillo and Nero are together for a while,yet the other targets that he is after takes a while for him to shoot.He gets some people here and there but he gets so involved in the whole Vanetti deal that he doesn't really get to the point of killing all of them to the point where other people that he had no intent of killing are killed nonetheless. Thus, he gets wrapped in other things, then his friend gets involved and after that, things get more and more anarchic.When there are people talking about the quarrels with other families, I try to pay attention as much as I can but it's hard.This show is like \"The Hateful Eight\" where there are really great show stopping moments but the rest of the movie is really boring and slow. If people were not getting shot in the testicular region or being poisoned, other things were happening like people playing songs and talking and talking and talking.Same thing goes with 91 days, but this show is actually hours longer than Hateful Eight and it also more great moments than not so great.One thing that is useless but fun is the chemistry that Nero and Avillo gain over the show. There is one whole episode where they are just traveling and despite slowing the plot it was kinda entertaining.Speaking of slowing down, This show is called \"91 Days\" and I can tell you it took me way more than 91 days to finish this show.(I started the show in October and now it's May)for two reasons.1.I'm a very lazy person and 2. I wanted to wait until the show was fully dubbed.Thank goodness for the recap episode that gave me a heads up about what's going on. But this recap shows the problem of the slowness that this show can have. About 4 episodes are completely summed up by the narrator in one sentence.This is mainly dealing with the whole Vanetti thing.On the bright side, when Avillo decides to do something at the very end of the series, the whole Vanetti thing is turned on its head and it was amazing to see.The ending was a bit weird though\\n\\n\r\n SPOILERS\\n\r\n{{{{{Long Story short Avillo completes his goal more or less but he wonders\"well, what do I do now?\"and then Nero comes around and says\"you could just turn into a can of peaches\" and Avillo is like\"wow! that's a good idea!I have nothing else to do.\"(this isn't what actually happens;It just looks like it happened that way}}}}}\\n\\n\r\nI mean the ending was good but, It could have been solved in a better way, probably in the way that the promotional poster shows but hey you can't get everything.\\n\r\nIf there is one show that this show will inevitably be compared to is Baccano.Is this show better than Baccano?Not really.But it isn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation this show is not the best in the world. For the majority of the show, the animation is rather average and there are even times when they cut costs by focusing on frames where things are still and the character is not seen talking or doing anything else. But this does pay off because when things get real.. the animation shoots up so much in quality.The most prominent example being the first episode where the murder of Avillo's family takes place..really intense.The art style of the show is more colorful than Baccano to me.But this is not an understatement.The colors still look more drab and bland and depressing,because America at the time was drab and bland and depressing.There are many parts of America that gets put into detail from the buildings to the people.There are many differentiate facial expressions and hair cuts for the people(one guy has three different hair colors) and the eyebrows were very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWith the sound,this show is still inferior to Baccano but it's not bad.The opening is impactful and moving with orchestral strings and sorrowful guitars. This fits into the vengeance part of the show but this part is not as apparent.The ending is very fitting but it is very forgetful.It is one of those slow songs that could put me to sleep.The soundtrack does a good job of fitting to the setting of the show to a T. But then again I wouldn't want to listen to it in my spare time.Unlike Baccano, this show doesn't have a crazy jazz theme and the soundtrack is more scary and intense than actually action packed.One theme called\"the days\" sounds like it belongs in a horror movie.If there is one thing in the show that lives up to Baccano, it's the dub.The actors did a really good job giving the characters different accents from Italian to Boston and even Canadian and Southern accents.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters...\\n\\n\r\nAvillo is a very apathetic person,I don't really feel close to him because he doesn't express that much emotion,at least in front of people he meets. For a majority of the show, he is very emotionless, but at other times he comes off as insane and when he goes through tough times he shows a huge bit of emotion.His real name is Angelo btw. I don't really think this is very important to contributing to the plot .Nero Vanetti is probably my favorite character because of how chill he is. When problems occur, he finds solutions for them in a effective way.When really bad things happen, you can tell that he doesn't really deserve it because he is such a nice guy defending his family name.I feel really sorry for Avillo's friend, Corteo.He is the guy who makes the moonshine that everyone is DYING for.He gets dragged into the whole shindig in the latter half and he really doesn't deserve it.There are also other people I kinda don't care about featuring a guy with glasses, Nero's younger brother and some other guys.The other character worth mentioning is that crazy guy with the most nonsensical haircut, Fango.He is crazy. He gets caught on fire but somehow survives and his haircut has three different colors in it.He is pretty cool,too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end,I was satisfied with the show,but I expected more.This concept of prohibition is a very clever way to implement this revenge story,but sadly the family gang aspect really foreshadowed the revenge element.There are some great times and the last two episodes are pure chaos.In the historical drama aspect, it achieves but it doesn't excel.This doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it though.\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nI want a can of peaches now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first, 91 Days is pretty amazing. It's basically a mafia version of Game of Thrones in anime format.\r\nStory:\r\nThe show tells a mature and dark mafia story about revenge and boy does it tell it good. We have this quite common revenge plot from the Hollywood movies where the main character goes into the path of revenge because of the murder of his loved ones. \r\nThe interesting aspect comes from its story telling; it is cunning, subtle and everything has a meaning from the conversations to the actions and subtle details that this shows has to offer. Nothing is meaningless. \r\nIt is done welldrama when the characters' relationships will make you want to end up crying in the corner.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and the quality:\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say about the animation department. The close up scenes look amazing, and while there is noticeable quality drop towards the end during three episodes (probably because of the budgeting) it could easily be forgiven for the story's sake. The scenes' importance shows in the animation when it matters even in low budget, so even in those three low budget episodes, when something matters and is really important the quality skyrockets once again.\\n\\n\r\nSub and Dub version:\\n\r\nBoth sub and dub are great but there is a slight difference in characters' personality when comparing the versions. In Japanese version there is blank main character, goofy sidekick, and crazy villain but in English version every character seems more stable and mature, but somehow the relationship aspect's been left a little bit blank.\\n\\n\r\nNotice:\\n\r\nThis show might be best to watch more than once. First time ends up trying to figure out character relations and what impact they have with the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor drama lovers:\\n\r\nIf you're here to watch some exciting action anime that explains you all the time what is happening, this isn't the kind of show for you. But if you're up to some smart story telling and having an emotional rollercoaster this is kind of show to you. This show will rip your heart out from your chest, crushes it violently to the ground, picks it up and gives it a kiss before putting it back to your chest.\\n\\n\r\nTruly a magnificent show and amazing ride. I recommend this wholeheartedly to everyone who wants to see exciting drama about revenge and bonds.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review I've ever made and never thought it would be for this genre, but I needed to. (Also forgive any mistakes since I'm not a native english speaker. Thanks~)\r\nStory ~ 9\r\nMafia themed anime is not rare to find, but still 91 Days outstands. Seems a bit clich\u00e9 the story of a person who search revenge for someone he loved and that's what 91 Days revolves around but, be patient and watch it to the end. It. Worths. It. \r\nThe plot got darker (althought, it's refreshing to see a little humor time to time between dense parts) and it's a lotmore exciting while you reach the last episodes. Is a war between families to gain power through whiskey in the middle of the Prohibition. Everyone is betrayed by everyone, and betraying means death. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~ 6\\n\\n\r\nI feel sorry the studio didn't put more effort on it. In some scenes is notably the lack of detail and fluidity (if you know what I mean). Although I like the character's designs and sceneries and hopefully the action scenes, I believe, were well made at least. Also the colors gave the appropiate mood to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~ 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned with the colors, the BGM fitted good. I loved the OP made by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure, idk, it felt like it was Angelo itself who was singing. The ED also bring a nostalgic mood and space to somehow digest what just happened in the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~ 6\\n\\n\r\nAlthough nearly every character had his own, very defined personality, there were little to nothing character development. Their personalities were mainly static in the whole story, however this wasn't a big problem regarding the situations exposed.\\n\r\nI must highlight some extreme behavior changes like for example with Corteo, but still think this is more like a plotwist than a character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ 9\\n\\n\r\n91 Days is really really enjoyable! The main purpose of an animation production (and others) is to: entertain. Entertainment doesn't mean to be funny at all. It's meant to produce experiences to the viewer, and 91 Days sure it does. The story is really exciting, thrilling and heartbreaking. Yup, the last episodes made me meditate of how these characters felt, how will you do if you were in a situation like this? The loss of a friend, of a member of your family, the fear of losing your own life... and the pain behind this. You really feel an empathy with the characters no matter who's side you are.\\n\\n\r\nGreed, betrayal, forgiveness.... redemption?  Was it all in vain?\\n",

            "content": "(91 days is a typical revenge story)\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story was told in way that will attract you, each episode will end with cliffhanger. Story was a bit predictable specially at the end. Pacing of the anime was perfect, each episode was full of drama and action. The drama and the suspense was the best part in the anime (hated the funny parts it was out of context). The ending was clich\u00e9 (meh...)\r\nArt: 6 \r\nThe style was realistic to fit the story. It was standard art nothing flashy. The character design was ok overall, the only one who was very good is Angleo. The design andthe colors of the cars was all the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the characters was fitting for the story, specially one of the most complex character on the anime ( Fango). The background music was jazzy, not my style I didn\u2019t like it. The opening, ending songs was ok not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nThe character development was very good, each character got his own strength and flaws to overcome. after some episodes, you will see Angleo grow form a boy to a Mafia man. The best characters I thought was amazing Angleo and Fango, each got a story to tell, the only one I dislike was corteo, crybaby all the time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nGuys don\u2019t miss this show its very good and you will enjoy it, maybe not if you are not the type to like mafia story\u2019s. I will not forget this show one of the best specially the characters. If you didn\u2019t watch it yet please go and give it a chance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n",

(maybe i'm just bitter.)\r\nAlso be aware this gets started really slow. However if your a fan of mob movies you'll be used to that kind of thing and probably like this. Actually I think this would be a good anime to show some one your just introducing to the world of anime because it really doesn't have an anime feel to itl It's an animated mob TV series completely with conspiracy, betrayal, prohibition era politics, and of course gun fights.I found the story to be slow and kind of lacking but then I usually feel that way about mafia inspired movies/series so again if you like that genre of western film you'll actually probably like this. I definitely think it was at least worth watching and it was a nice change from the sometimes zany and convoluted world of anime. You should definitely give it a try but be prepared to watch at least through episode 5 before giving up.\\n\r\nThe only other things I've seen that I'd say somewhat compare to this are maybe darker than black (one of my faves) and phantom: requiem for the phantom (an anime i hated.) So take whatever you can from that lol.",

It\u2019s not one I would say was amazing though. I would categorize it as pretty average. The show didn\u2019tdo anything especially good or bad.

            "content": "Story: So the plot and setup of the plot is rather self-explanatory: protagonist lost family to mafia, manages to get away, and plots revenge once the resources became available. There are a few reasons I wasn't fond of the plot, but the main one was rather personal. I think revenge is foolish and impulsive; it requires a lot of effort and you get little to no reward out of it. The main reason I continued was to see if the main protagonist would realize this and change his mind. (SPOILERS AHEAD) and he kinda sorta did in a way. He technically got his revenge, butdidn't even nail the target he specifically went there to get. I felt like he targeted many people vaguely involved or nailed people majorly involved but were dying anyway. He put his only family left through hell and murdered him for the cause, BUT got weak-kneed when he finally earned Nero's trust. So, congrats, he changed his mind eventually, but could he had decided that BEFORE he pulled that s***? Like, what the hell do you think Corteo is thinking?! Some credit it to the dark mood of the anime, but there is a difference between dark and just tragically idiotic. It was like watching the end of Romeo and Juliet (if he just figured that s*** out beforehand, things would've been fine.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Don't have much to say about the art. I liked the design, the clothes, and the grunge look that matched the setting and plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I fell in love with LTS's Signal song. I also thought the sexy jazzy music of the sound track and ending were appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If you read my regards on the plot, you probably know why I already didn't like Angelo. Looking back at it, there were no characters I was too attached to and felt like certain tropes or stereotypes were becoming constant: cocky ringleaders and bounty hunters, mafia grunts who aren't what they seem like at the surface, basic mafia grunts who ARE what you see and are just \"following orders\", 2nd hand men who feared losing respect and/or status. And the occasional irrelevant female character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It took me a while to write this review just because I couldn't remember important aspects and facts about the show. That in itself should tell you about my enjoyment (it was like a boring, forgettable chore for those who're up too late to use all their brain cells. No shame, no shade!! XD)",
