            "content": "What\u2019s worse: a consistently mediocre show, or a mediocre show that looked like it could\u2019ve been a lot better? Whichever you prefer, Shoemaster no Izetta is the second option.\r\nI\u2019m not gonna sit here and pretend that Shuumatsu was, at any point, even a strong contender for anime of the season. I don\u2019t feel particularly burned or let down by this show falling apart, but at the same time I can\u2019t help but feel a little surprised: Two super hot main characters, one of them being a witch or magician, a story with historical context, a metal-based OP, and one of the best soundtracks of theyear come together to form\u2026 a light 4. So, what the fuck happened?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t that anything really happened, it\u2019s just that Shuumatsu put on a nice facade for a bit. That sounds like I\u2019m stating the obvious, but hear me out: This anime was only good on a conceptual level. Beyond writing \"MAGIC + WW2\" down, the writing team had no idea what the fuck to do. There\u2019s no singular element to Shuumatsu that makes it bad, it\u2019s a consistent series of fuck-ups and bad writing that starts to become apparent after the story\u2019s introduction.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the conflict can be blamed on people being complete fucking idiots, and that\u2019s never a good thing. When you have some pretty high stakes such as\u2026 I dunno, a WORLD WAR involved, it\u2019s expected that the people have some sort of responsibility. This involves not discussing the weakness of someone who is single-handedly carrying you in the war, or even discussing this someone period, in broad fucking daylight. God forbid someone hears you and runs back to camp to tell all his friends about it for no reason... ... ... ... ... ...HEY WAIT A MINUTE\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that becomes more apparent as time goes on is the absolute perfect perfectnicityness of the three lead characters: Izetta, Fine with an accent at the end, and Izetta\u2019s Tits, which you better fuckin\u2019 believe are fine with an accent at the end. These are the good guys, so they\u2019re good people. They do absolutely nothing wrong and have no flaws whatsoever. Finemon is noble and brave and lives to defend the country she proudly leads. Everyone that\u2019s not literally Hitler happily supports her. Izetta is the most OP being on the planet, and all she wants to do is use her power for good, which means indiscriminately killing shitloads of Nazis. Her entire character is that she totally wants a piece of dat Fine ass and will do virtually anything for it. She might be a little childish due to literally not having a life for the most part, which doesn\u2019t really count as a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the bad guys are Nazis. They do bad things because they\u2019re the bad guys and that\u2019s basically it. I suppose the real context of the antagonists can be summed up as \u201cread a fucking book\u201d, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting actual historical figures in this anime. This isn\u2019t Drifters. This is an original story with not-very-cleverly renamed things like \u201cGermania\u201d involving original characters. Original characters such as Smug Villain who is a villain that smiles in a smug fashion. He has a low voice and talks clearly but quietly while smiling in a smug fashion. Because he\u2019s the bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nUnyielding good versus unforgivable evil. It\u2019s too obvious who you should root for. Tropes aren\u2019t bad on their own, but too many of them will dumb things down and come off as boring, unless you can fully embrace them and use the best parts to tell a satisfying story. I\u2019m describing \u2018My Hero Academia\u2019 for the record. Not that it\u2019s related. But meanwhile, Shuumatsu is full of one-note, trope-y, flat basic bitches. Well, not Izetta. She\u2019s not flat. She got some pretty big dynamics nahimean?\\n\\n\r\nIn short, despite the serious tone Shuumatsu puts off in its early moments, its story is far from mature. Even when nothing is happening, there\u2019s still something wrong. Like, talking about pie for all eternity, or watching Izetta get molested by some creepy designer lady. I think that\u2019s where they uh\u2026 Cross the Line, eh???? Goddamn that song is good.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I\u2019ve complained a lot about a show that\u2019s based on a hot chick flying around on a gun. So let\u2019s talk about that for a moment. For some reason, people defend bad writing and fanservice with \u201cshe\u2019s riding a gun, it was stupid to begin with!\u201d Just because something\u2019s a little silly doesn\u2019t mean all its faults are suddenly cleared. Like, what? It doesn\u2019t even look or seem that silly. Not only is it cool as shit, but it brilliantly combines both the setting of war and the concept of magic. If anything, wearing a big hat and flying around on a broom would\u2019ve been inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, the battles themselves are actually pretty good. Izetta is OP as shit and just fucking destroys everything in her path. It\u2019s a lot of fun seeing shit like that, and it\u2019s not every day where you see tanks getting thrown around. But, of course, the stakes need to be raised at some point, so the enemy introduces\u2026 more magic. Aww\u2026 It\u2019s kind of a bummer that they couldn\u2019t stick with Magic vs. Military and had to make it Magic vs. Magic instead. Granted, the story\u2019s timeline gives it very limited technology, but it would\u2019ve been really cool to see the Germans--oh, sorry--the GERMANIANS (you know that's just Germany in Romanian, right? That's not a rename at all, those hacks!) develop some sort of weapon or even a clever strategy to level the playing field a bit, instead of just introducing more magic out of nowhere.\\n\r\nThat said, when Izetta has finally met her match, things don\u2019t go downhill. They get crushed, flattened, stomped on, pushed off a cliff, and dropped into the fucking ocean. Shit gets real FAST and that made me appreciate the evil side a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nNothing\u2019s animated too well, though. Izetta flying around looks quite nice, and let me compliment the character designs one more time because they\u2019re outstanding. But, as expected, the larger animations such as large objects getting tossed around or a collection of swords slicing around\u2026 they\u2019re CG. The CG itself isn\u2019t particularly good nor bad, but combined with normal 2D animation, it looks kinda weird and took me out of the experience a little. I don\u2019t remember anything being terrible, though. The general style is very common despite the obscure studio--if you told me this was by A-1 Pissants or J.C. Staff, I wouldn't have questioned it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on the other hand\u2026 now there\u2019s a hidden gem. The mystical, magical music in the back with a rock influence, particularly with Izetta\u2019s fight scenes, holy shit it\u2019s brilliant. It felt a little overdone, though. Exposition could be going on, and the composer\u2019s still going apeshit with dark, jittery, and mysterious music as if the most amazing plot twist\u2019s about to happen. Still, I\u2019m gonna be downloading thi--I mean purchasing this soundtrack in a very legal manner when it releases to the public. And the credits themes were equally outstanding. \u2018Cross the Line\u2019 has one of the most hype-inducing introductions of the entire year, and its piercing metal sound kept me on my toes the whole way through. The epic piano ballad used as the ED is equally mesmerizing despite being basically the exact opposite sound. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Izetta: The Last Witch? Given the interesting premise, I might. After all, an anime with historical context always draws in an audience. 'member Joker Game? Talk about awkward! Anyway, just be warned. You\u2019re not getting a very intricately-written story. It has some good moments for sure, but more often than not you\u2019ll want to rip your hair out. Come in mostly for the fights and the occasional charm. And don\u2019t forget the boobies. Hooray for boobies.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\r\nIzetta - Fine/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4.25/10 (Score range: 3.5-5.0)\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nFavorite character - Izetta\u2019s Ettas\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "Liechtenstein is fighting Hitler with magic. That's all. But if you want a more detailed review...\r\nStory:\r\nIt's World War 2 and the country of Eylstadt (which geographically would be Tirol) is about to be curbstomped by the Nazis. Good thing though that the princesses faithful doggy...I mean, good friend Izetta just woke up from her slumber and does her witch thing. Izetta uses its story within the real life happenings around that time, which is pretty nicely done. However, it doesn't do much with the military setting after the nazi witch shows up, which is a wasted opportunity. The ending was lackluster and I can't helpbut think, that the creators were too scared to leave the safe route for this little fantasy story.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis anime looks very good. From backgrounds to character designs, Izetta is a very eyepleasing show. When it comes to the fighting scenes, they were able to turn it up even more. It also lacks the usual \"oops, we ran outta money\" episodes in the middle. I can't find a flaw in the visuals at all.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song is pretty cool and thrilling, the ending a good, relaxing song. The background music fits very nicely in the whole scenery as well. Voice acting was very good too, even though I found Izetta to sound a little too cutesy at times. Sora Amamiya gives me another reason to praise her and it was nice to hear Kana Hanazawa in a completely different kind of role than what she usually does.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh, Izetta, as cute as you are, you are a very, VERY one-dimensional girl. It's only natural for this anime to focus on the (homoerotic) relationship between Fin\u00e9 and Izetta, but all this little witch thinks about is her \"hime-sama\" and how she can be of any use to her. Fin\u00e9 herself isn't that bad, she can be a good politician every now and then, but once we get back to her worrying about Izetta, it all comes tumbling down. The other witch that turns up later has a motivation for her actions, but...I don't know, I just didn't feel it. In the end she did the same thing Izetta does, despite telling her how idiotic that is. The best characters were the agents of both sides, who did the logical things to do and acted pretty clever.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike most others, I enjoyed the first half more than the second, though I don't think it went completely to shit. While this anime started out interesting and creative, they started playing it safe halfway through, which was quite disappointing. The ending was a lame cop-out for a show that did a lot of things right, but then started heading the wrong way.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

            "content": "What could go wrong with combining a WWII setting with some cute magical girl(s)? Everything I tell you\u2026\r\nIzetta the Last Witch is something I was optimistic for considering it was an alternative take on the second world war which I\u2019m sure many of us have studied at some point before viewing. The Germanian Empire is our like for like replacement for the Nazi Regime which was led by the infamous Adolf Hitler. To summarise, the Germanian Empire has gone on the offensive using arguably one of the best tactics in modern history. The \u2018Blitzkrieg\u2019 was designed to create disorganisation among the Allied forces which wascomposed of countries such as Britannia and Thermidor. The fictional small country of Eylstadt (modern-day Austria) which houses our main two characters Archduchess Ortfine and the last witch in question being Izetta, is on the receiving end taking blows from all the powerful Germania.\\n\\n\r\nThe show fails to deliver on providing interesting characters apart from the main duo of Ortfine and Izetta. Ortfine during the war is saddened by the news that her father has passed away due to an illness. This incident has caused her to take up reigns, whilst being designated as the successor at the coronation ceremony giving her the ultimate task of leading her country. Being the sole monarch for such a tiny nation has exacerbated the fact of her wanting to protect to what is deemed as being vulnerable. That is the defining trait for our young Archduchess who for the most part doesn\u2019t exhibit any other qualities which is what sets apart memorable and forgettable characters. She would be in the latter bracket as there is no major characterisation from her as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta is our heroine for the Eylstadt soldiers, who have been demoralised from the current conflict knowing they had no chance of winning against the stronger army. Izetta being a witch allows her to use magic in the battlefield which is not the magic that I had envisioned at first. There are no spells being made that resemble any sort of sorcery. Izetta\u2019s magic is just having the ability to levitate certain objects such as torpedoes and lances which are just some examples. The magic used does create mayhem among the enemy line as it\u2019s used in an unpredictable fashion. What concerns me though is the instances where she is pegged back by the enemies\u2019 retaliation which is evident in numerous occasions. Despite being called the key to winning the war, she hasn\u2019t shown enough for me to acknowledge her as being exactly that.\\n\\n\r\nAs a witch, she does have her limitations, which is revealed through the information about the ley lines that are spread out through all of Europe. These hotspots as I like to call them are the areas where she can use her magic effectively without deteriorating greatly in magic usage. The best tactic to defeat Izetta was confronting her at a weak magic location but no there is more to that apparently. Izetta like any other superhuman entity will usually have some form of weakness aka their kryptonite equivalent. Funnily enough it does share a similar appearance to that of the kryptonite.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been mentioning her magic but what defines Izetta\u2019s character? She can basically be summed as being a sweet-natured girl of a placid disposition. Her objective in the current war is to protect the Archduchess and the country that she governs. It is known beforehand that Izetta has been given a verbal warning by her late grandmother not to use her magic powers excessively to the point it would get out of hand. She inevitably breaks this promise and proceeds to display her abilities in the chaotic battlefield. Her existence is predicated on the fact she will do all it takes to protect Eylstadt even if it means her dying. She\u2019s come close to kicking the bucket but the God of Death hasn\u2019t exerted his influence that much.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is suffering from other consistencies preventing me from enjoying it and it\u2019s a shame as it looked promising in the beginning. A significant portion of screen time was given to an average infantry soldier named Jonas, who had survived his fair share of blows at times while it being questionable. The poor man dies because of an information leakage which resulted in his death\u2026 what was the point in showing his character for him to be dismissed like that? \\n\\n\r\nAnother occasion where the plot felt loose was during the banquet held in one of the Allied nations. The fact that Berckmann managed to appear out of thin air to confront the Archduchess should be raising alarm bells. What I find baffling is how he managed to get past all the security considering it is being hosted for all sorts of delegates during wartime. This just adds to the plot convenience needed to advance the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also the instance where Berckmann\u2019s assistant managed to sneak into the countryside of Eylstadt for his espionage mission. The man was picked up by the retainers of the Archduchess who never questioned the validity of him abstaining from conscription. A spy has just managed to get a ride with Bianca and co who are viewed as being competent and act as being professional. This group managed to harbour an enemy for the whole time without suspecting him once, just convenient if I must say. The writing is abysmal through proper retrospection.\\n\\n\r\nThere are countless more but I shared the obvious ones that were glaring to me. Another pet peeve of mine is the fact that the Germanian Empire has somehow managed to invent cloning of humans, which may not sound too outlandish at first. The idea of cloning existing in an alternate timeline that can enable for magic isn\u2019t too far-fetched but if you think about it, DNA mapping was never introduced until the 1950s which is after WWII in this case. My case is closed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by studio Ajia-do is probably one of the factors that enticed people into watching as well as the setting involved. The character designs are designed for the moe aesthetics, which is evident in Izetta who just seems cute all around. The designs are reminiscent to what was used in Sword Art Online, this show has an A-1 Pictures feel to it but there is no relation whatsoever. The animation is crisp and fluid when it needs to be in the action sequences but is generally consistent with no substantial drop in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the most part is befitting for a show set in this period. The array of tracks which are mostly heard in the battlefields usually consist of orchestral compositions. The variations of vocal sequences add to the immersion during intense scenes but felt lacklustre with nothing being too exceptional or noteworthy. The opening song used feels more like a J-pop song and does not really match with the themes to be honest. The ending song takes more of a dramatic feel to it and is genuinely feels better to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT-\\n\\n\r\nPositives \u2013\\n\r\nDecent Animation \\n\\n\r\nNegatives \u2013\\n\r\nTerrible directing along with a poor script. The plot convenience is unbearable at times.\\n\r\nBland side characters and no variety.\\n\r\nThe fan service is heavy with this one and feels inappropriate at times. I didn\u2019t mention the moe maid lol\\n",

            "content": "If potential is something that you\u2019re seeking for, Shuumatsu no Izetta (Izetta: The Last Witch) will breathe life into that word. At first glance, anyway. Think about it though. It\u2019s a series that combines elements of military warfare, witchcraft, political conflicts, and other magical shenanigans into a single package. And as an original series, the show isn\u2019t held back by a dedicated fan base or those who lusts for \u201cfaithful adaptation\u201d. However, Shuumatsu no Izetta isn\u2019t exactly perfect or even close as the word potential is dragged down each step of the way.\r\nThe risk of making a historical fiction war drama story can be viewedfrom many angles. While it doesn\u2019t always have to rely on historical accuracy, it should still make sense. In essence, the show attempts its best job at that by adapting the setting into World War II style war story. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s when the Allies fought against the Axis Powers that stretched from Europe all the way to the Pacific theater. However, this series doesn\u2019t fly across the globe even though it has a cute little witch. In fact, it focuses primarily on this tiny Alpine country of Eylstadt as imperialist forces of Germania decides to invade them. \\n\\n\r\nMark my words, the show gets straight to the point pretty fast. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that there\u2019s a war conflict going on. Ortfin\u00e9 \"Fin\u00e9\" Fredericka von Eylstadt (the princess) is pursued by Germanian forces and even gets captured aboard a train. A mysterious witch named Izetta shows up from a capsule and she recuses Fine. Turns out, they actually knew each other before during childhood. While all this is happening, it\u2019s hard to forget about how Izetta saves her. Literally, she flies on a giant gun and is able to use magical powers to influence objects. So basically, she is a witch although where her powers came from is a mysterious origin. What we do know is that Izetta is among the last of her kind and she enters an alliance with Fine to protect their country. So for standards, the series leaves me a good impression as the storytelling can expand quite a bit with the war drama and mystery. A lot of questions will pop into viewers\u2019 minds like \u201cwho really is Izetta?\u201d \u201cWhy does Germania want to invade Eylstadt\u201d? or \u201cWho will win the war?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here though. Perhaps my expectations for the series were a bit too high from the start but the series seems to dwindle down each and every episode. The first few episodes does a fairly well job at launching the series with its premise. However, the pacing drags back the show as transitions between certain episodes just feels stale. Certain episodes such as ones that info dumps about witch magic or Izetta\u2019s daily life style can easily be condensed to further the storytelling. Instead, they are stretched out with slice of life content with little impact. The series also seems to have a fetish for Izetta\u2019s breasts as the girls often makes fun of them, especially Fine and the maids. On the other hand, it is evident that the series remains faithful to the premise. The war is still the main focus and we see how the roles of characters are played out. Izetta is a prominent figure as a witch so her allies uses her in ways to not just directly engage their enemies but also with psychological warfare. In other words, they want to make the best of what she has to offer with her powers, carrying military squadrons to certain positions, and boosting morale. While it\u2019s not realistic, it does make her character intriguing to watch as we can see what a witch can really do. While I did mention how ludicrous the comedy can get sometimes, this show does not joke with death as certain characters really do die. As such, do expect the violence and war drama to take hold to show how tragic warfare can be.\\n\\n\r\nEven though she\u2019s the titular character, the series isn\u2019t just about Izetta. Fine, the princess of Eylstadt, serves as a good mentor and leader for her country. She plays the role of a strategist, idealist, and also a friend for her people. The most important relationship she has is with Izetta as the latter saved her during childhood. However, I am not overly impressed by the character relationships in the series. Beyond Izetta and Fine, there\u2019s hardly any others that are memorable. For instance, there\u2019s Bianca, Princess Fine\u2019s personal bodyguard who only gets a memorable role in the latter half of the series when she kills a Germania spy. There\u2019s hardly any development between that spy and her so most of their storytelling is easily forgettable. The main antagonist of the series is Berkman, a Major of a Germanian Special Unit. And oh boy, he is about as stereotypical as you can get out of a villain. Egoistic, manipulative, and cunning are just a few words to describe this man. The fact that he also has a secret weapon to counter against Izetta shows him as a sinister bastard. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that does surprise me though is the quality of the visual production. Ajia-Do is practically an unknown studio that most are unfamiliar with. Their most recognizable work might as well be this one so it\u2019s interesting to see how they took on this project. On the surface level, the series is beautiful with crisp animation. The landscapes and country-style feel gives a good impression of its setting. Furthermore, character designs is noticeable as it fleshes out Izetta being distinctive with her white dress and scarlet hair. Fine is noticeable for her beauty and classic blonde hair, fitting for a princess of her country. On most parts, the action has solid choreography without much jerky movements. Camera angles often capture the most intense parts of war that makes the show thrilling. Do note that there\u2019s a bit of fan service that seems to have more fun with itself than it should.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Shuumatsu no Izetta, Nagasaki Yukio seemed like a fitting choice for sound director. His most recent work from GATE shows his talent and brings it into this series. The fast pacing of the action combined with the elements of military warfare all seems to work with the instrumental music. The feel of the European style OST also brings credibility for the series\u2019 setting. Finally, character voice acting is well performed for characters such as Fine with haughty personality, Bianca\u2019s toughness, or Berkman\u2019s arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I really sum this up? A massive disappointment or just a show to watch for the pure entertainment? To be fair, this show is probably not suitable for everyone. Fanatics of historical elements and war drama enthusiasts will probably find this series more entertaining than others. However, if you\u2019re seeking for a well-rounded story, then this show will feel like one that dropped the ball. Not literally but just the type that makes you hope there\u2019s so much more. Too bad really.\\n",

            "content": "\"Izetta - the last witch\" - is good anime in alternative history genre. Events of anime happen in alternative Europe of ~1939, where Germania tries to conquer the world, and as \"real\" (from other fiction) nazi they study occultism and magic. And there is what to study - because in this world magic is real. And easy prey for Germania as little alpine country Principality of Elystadt suddenly get support from Izetta - the last witch of this world. Magic vs technic, science and cunning, great setup for nice anime.\r\nAnd there is probably the main problem, anime at the beginning show so great potential, whichis really poorly realized, so many people even drop this anime in the second half of season. But it is not bad at all, just do not expect much, and you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n==Story== (7/10)\\n\r\nStory is decent, it was interesting to follow warfare and politics at that world, despite the fact that politics are shown really childish and primitive. Cool guys from secret police of both countries were shown much better and darker. History of witchcraft was well presented, and some little stories too.\\n\\n\r\nAlso relations between main characters Fine and Izetta - is great and cause you to imagine what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nBut really inappropriate fan-service and some misunderstanding in motivation at the end, where it can be better written, spoils the story.\\n\\n\r\n==Characters== 6.5/10\\n\r\nOne more problematic side of anime. No, mostly characters are good, someone even great, just looks at the agents of secret police Berckmann and Muller, some other supporting characters are great too, germanian pilot for instance. Ortfine despite hers childish and sometimes dumb speeches had some charisma and looks like the proper aristocratic girl. \\n\\n\r\nBut Izetta - oh, she is just one dimensional. It is pure naivety and mindless loyalty, whatever is going on, Izetta reacts just the same way. If at the start of series you did not notice this, in the second half it so unbearable to ignore. Still relation between Fine and Izetta are nice, except for some predictable Izetta moves. \\n\\n\r\nMain villain is pretty generic and can be found at any average anime\\n\\n\r\n==Art and Sound== 10/10\\n\r\nI love it! Alpine landscapes - just beatiful, tech and building - also drawn nicely, and there is no complaints about character. I love this style, whatever it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound is even better, some german alpine motives create great atmosphere. Battles also had music accompaniment, which fit war well. OP - is nice, but nothing specific, ED - calm cool song.\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment== 9/10\\n\r\nThe main problems of this anime are Izetta and the fact that it could be better (maybe, maybe not), but this two facts does not spoil me anime. I got many positive emotions while watching. Decent story, great music, some great characters and emotional chemistry between main characters.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. It is good anime, but hype spoil so much in the eyes of viewers.",

            "content": "The fact that Japan was on Germany's side during WWII along with how we dropped nukes on them during said war really makes things uncomfortable whenever that country decides to dip their hands into alternate WWII fiction. Especially since they can't demonize the actual Germans, so they have to call them names like Germanians or Britanians or Americans (oh wait) whenever they have to portray actual antagonists. Germanians who are pretty damn fluent in Japanese for a country that wants the world to be ruled by the master race, but what do I know about alternate history? Well I may not know much, but Ido know that if you want to show your child a good entry in that genre, Izetta: The Last Witch is better left in that bargain bin where you found it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is centered on a young princess named Fine and her attempts to stop the evil Germanians from taking over her country on the eve of this war that shares the same name as the world-spanning conflict of the 1940s, but otherwise has no relation to it whatsoever. Because in addition to all the usual changes that are made to the history in order to make a WWII story fresh after it's been exploited by the entertainment industry like ten thousand times, we now have magic in this world. And I'm not talking about the cultish Hellboy/Conqueror of Shamballa/Maria the Virgin Witch religious magic, although it wouldn't surprise me if the writers of this show took inspiration from that. This one deals more with basic witchcraft, except witches use anti-tank rifles to fly around rather than brooms and can decimate entire armies in ways that an entire army of Jedi would cry foul at.\\n\\n\r\nSaid witchcraft takes the form of a young red-haired girl named Izetta, a witch-in-hiding who was saved by Princess Fine in the past, and now that they've both grown up, Izetta vows to use her magical powers to help Fine's kingdom win the war and launch a thousand yuri fanfictions in the process. However, the opposing Germanians are aware of the existence of witchcraft and vow to discover Izetta's weaknesses in order to tip the war back in their favor. From there, the show basically spreads itself out way too thin, trying to juggle multiple characters, viewpoints, and genres all at once. In theory, this means something for everyone. In practice, this means absolutely no one is satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nSee, I know Izetta got a lot of attention from anime fans upon initial watch because it dumped a lot of elements that people were intrigued by to the point that they were interested in what it might become over what it actually is. Every time I read an initial positive impression for this show, they never praised anything resembling actual story direction, always concentrating on individual scenes or characters who seem likable and all that stuff that sends out warning lights that the show is going to turn to shit within a few episodes like 99% of all anime out there. Although to be fair, I didn't expect the show to be as tonally inconsistent as it ended up being, dedicating entire episodes to the breast sizes of the females (because that's totally appropriate to talk about during wartime, isn't it?), only to shift to a no-name male soldier who ends up getting an early perish because he knew too much.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a war story, that means we have to sit through the usual boring \"being a soldier is bad\" storytelling with all the pointless deaths, men turning into monsters, and blablabla that I really hate about war fiction. But you know what's worse than a war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches like we haven't heard them before? A war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches, only to shortchange it with elementary anime cliches. I mean can someone explain to me why all the high-ranking soldiers that hang around Fine happen to be cute girls with big racks? Why exactly do I have to watch them trying to give Izetta a shower, and why exactly should I care about them getting their own episode when they have about as much impact on the plot as a malfunctioning cell phone? Didn't exactly help that the episode itself was just plain bad, focusing on them taking care of a male soldier who happened to be on the opposite side, and anyone who didn't see that ending coming has obviously never watched a war story in their life, and you should have picked a better one to start with.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are pretty generic. Fine is a headstrong princess who wants to serve her country and protect the people, and that philosophy isn't challenged at all during the show's runtime, making it hard to sympathize with any of the arbitrary struggles that she faces along the way. Izetta is pretty much defined by her devotion to her. Pretty much every other good guy is characterized the same way only they can't lift tanks. And the bad guys are pretty much characterized by either \"kill the witch\" or \"die soldier die\". Really, Fine is pretty much the only person who's in a position to spearhead the story, but because she doesn't take much action nor does she have her actions challenged, she's about as qualified to guide the viewer as she is to run the country in general. Just about the only thing she really cares about is risking her friends' lives, specifically Izetta's, on the battlefield - and the majority of what qualifies as her arc involves her making sure that her witch friend is safe whilst dealing with a war that outsiders shouldn't be involved in. That sort of relationship couldn't carry a two-hour movie by itself. Why on earth would it be able to carry twelve episodes?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the magic angle, I think Izetta was actively trying its best to make it as bland as possible, because it hits all the usual cliches you'd expect from an anime gimmick thrown into a generally serious situation. It has limits so the good guys don't get completely overpowered. It's used for generic slapstick that no one over the age of eight would find funny. After initial usage, it's never used with the same amount of efficiency again. Oh, and did I mention that the enemy side happens to have someone with similar powers? To which I respond with \"how does that make any horse-fucking sense?\". If they had someone on their side who could use magic, why would either the writers or the characters need to devote so much time to discovering Izetta's weaknesses in the first place when they can just send someone on her level who would definitely know how magic actually works in this world beforehand? And where the fuck did this girl come from anyways? I can't recall her ever being foreshadowed prior to her initial appearance in the last third of this show, so the only possible answer I can come up with was that even with the Germanians discovering her weakness, the writers didn't have an idea how to make a suitable final conflict so they threw Sophie in at the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nOne other way the magic in Izetta is misused is that the show ends up putting so much attention on the gimmick that it loses focus on the actual story that was initially hinted at at the very beginning. The final conflict is pretty much one big magic duel that has nothing to do with WWII and introduces a bunch of out-of-nowhere plot elements leading to a paint-by-numbers ending that makes Luke Cage's finale look like Fullmetal Alchemist's (either anime adaptation). I should point out that Izetta: The Last Witch is made by a newbie studio who I know nothing about, but apparently doesn't have any recognizable veterans amongst their ranks, because the animation in this show is absolute ass. Everything looks way too flat, the magic spells have no personality, and just about anybody could have directed this show. As such, don't expect that final conflict I mentioned to be a suitable payoff for all the mismanaged elements that came before. And if you're watching this show for the yuri, put away those virgin boners, because you're not gonna get much of a resolution out of that either.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't a single thing I can recommend Izetta: The Last Witch for. It only has one not-so-unique idea that's only on-screen like half the time at best, and it failed to make anything interesting happen with it when it bothered to show up. The show is cheap junk food: unfulfilling and you feel kind of weird after experiencing it, but you can't really describe why. My recommendation? Toss it into the same hellfire we threw Corpse Princess and that shitty Romeo x Juliet show and forget everything about its existence, just like we did with those shows.",

            "content": "A bad yet entertaining show can go out in a blaze of glory. A show like this gets put out of its misery like a badly ill dog on the violent streets.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR SHUUMATSU NO IZETTA*\r\nI'm sure we all remember what happened with the spring 2016 anime known as Kabaneri. To recap, the series started off strongly and interestingly before divulging into a convoluted mess that made everyone remember this series as 'the series that fell apart massively before our horrified eyes\" rather than \"the show that impressed us all\". Well, that same thing happened here. This when this series started, it had a fairlydecent reception and many people interested, thinking that this could quite possibly be the dark horse of the season. By that, we mean, this would be the series that won a lot of favor from the community after it was least expected to. Instead, it lost all of its luster, and now, it is up to us to bury this series and say our final goodbyes to this failed soldier. You may ask: \"how did this series flop on us all?\" Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair to this series, the premise is one of the most fascinating of the seaso . A witch gets summoned to fight for one of the many European countries (this one being Elystadt) oppressed by Germania's assault during World War II. Even the first episode managed to feel like it would turn out to be interesting, if not necessarily as grandiose as a war series tends to be. Unfortunately, some of the series's major problems come early, with one of the biggest being how the magic is explained.  There are these things called \"ley ines\" (which no one can see, ever, so how were they recorded?) which are the lines of magic energy that allow witches to use their magic. However, they aren't everywhere, so Izetta has to be careful not to wander into an area in which she cannot use magic.  This becomes a problem due to the fact that we can never truly know where they are and where they stop, meaning that the writers can, on a whim, make Izetta accidentally go off to a bad location without us knowing any better until she suddenly falls down and gets herself injured, which end us happening in episode 9, bit I'll get to that episode is the point in which the series jumped the shark, later.\\n\\n\r\nWhile episode 9 is the shark jumping point, the part that first comes of major concern is episode 4, where they fake Izetta's power via theatrics to fool the world into thinking that she is a very powerful witch while beating the Germanians in another battle. However, this raises the question of \"why didn't she just use her own magic when the world from this point on, will know of her magic anyway?'. Not only that, but it leads into one of the most trite setups that I ever have to see: the whole \"this person I admire is secretly a fake\" cliche\".  It turns out that there was a spy all along, and Jonas, the guy who found out the secret about Izetta, is blackmailed by the spy that he'll kill his family. Then, he gets shot by him before the guy runs away, and then Jonas is shot and \"killed\" by Sieg. This should really affect his family given how much they talked about it. However, we never see his family once. After a few meh episodes, one ship explosion that took one torpedo when they explicitly said it required 4 todo the job, and one ball later, we finally get to episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out, in episode 6, there was a girl who kissed Izetta in order to make her bleed that way said girl could drink her blood (don't as me how this makes sense, or how they manage to pull it off realistically; this show never bothered to make it work). Turns out, she was a copy of the real White Witch: a girl described in legend to be a noble and tragic witch. I won't even get into how many of the false versions of the story there are here, as only the one showed in the middle of the finale is right, which means the series has lied to us extremely often. Let's just say this: now, she is evil. Also, they are mass producing clones of her via magic that they shouldn't understand thanks to how this works. After struggling against her, Izetta loses power, and crashes into land. How? They went out of their way to state that she is still on land where the ley lines are located. Apparently, they didn't care to explain this, as there is no indication that her powers were manually shot down. Then, she starts bleeding despite nothing indicating that she was badly wounded anywhere. You could assume the crash did this to her, but all it was, was her tumbling a lot with nothing harmful going into her. She is then captured. Episode 10 even explicitly states so. So why is she still with the good guys? It turns out, that in that same episode, they retrieved her. Since that's the case, why did the Germaniand bother saying that they got her. Also, why did the SS try to kill Berckmann? They had no reason to not only fire him, but try to excecute him as well.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some generic and flawed writing, we come to the finale, where it all goes to hell. In episode 11, they start moving to the area with Izetta seemingly getting ready after another \"hinty hint hint yuri\" moment, but in the very first 5 second of episode 12, she is already at the fight with Sophie already hovering opposite of her. After about 8 minutes, we get this. Remember when Sieg shot Jonas in the head? Turns out, he's completely fine, with the Germanians, and then he shoots Sieg out of panic. This raises a multitude of questions that damn this series even more into absolute failure. Whatever. The day is saved, Sophie is stopped, the Germanian operation has been foiled, and peace roams the land. Also, despite the last few episodes making it out to be a heroic sacrifice for Izetta to fight, she is perfectly fine, and in a wheelchair. This is just like when Ikoma copped out in the finale as Kabaneri by also living after he was supposed to die. Also, the \"Yuri\" never goes full circle, meaning that all the hinting the series did was for naught. All's well that ends well, I guess. Either way, the script is dead, and I still don't think I've covered all that makes the plot suck. Why did Izetta's grandmother call Sophie a traitor? They explicitly showed that when Ozetta asked if hjer criticism of Sophie (interfering with humans) was the reason, she said no. How did Izetta get captured prior to episode 1? It's the plethora of questions like this that ruin the show, among other problems, and believe me, this series has a ton of holes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a mediocre cast. Izetta, while hot, adorkable, and determined, isn't that strong in terms of character quality. Yet, she's the best character here with a believable backstory. That backstory being:  She was saved by Ortfine when they were young, as the locals were about to kill her. Still, the \"yuri hinting\" was unnecessary. Ortfine is ok. She's just another strong willed leader pushed to her limits. Nothing too much too her. Most of the cast is also pretty forgettable and unexplored, like Bianka, Sieg, Hans, Berckmann, etc. Also, Berckmann's son, Ricelt fits this bill too, getting a mostly useless episode 7 to himself before he and the spy both die. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the villains that are pathetic. Otto is just a lame tyrant interested in witches, and there's nothing else to him. I struggle to find any reason for Elliot to be here given how useless he is. Then we have Sophie. She is a generic baddie introduced just to have an eventual final boss, in the same vain as Biba from Kabaneri (as if there weren't enough comparisons between the two shows already). After being betrayed, she wants revenge. In episode 6, she is presented as this mysterious figure. After that, she's just a vengeful maniac who cackles while doing evil things. That's it. Perfect representation of the series too: started interesting, but became a generic mess.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series looks good, despite the fact that the studio Aija-Do isn't well known. If this show were good, this might've put them on the map. Sure, the citizens of Elystadt have this generic light novel look to them, and many characters have those gaps in their mouths (meant to represent lips) way too big sometimes, but Izetta, and the styles for the Germanian characters look a lot more interesting and varied. The action looks nice too. Shout out to that section in the OP where Izetta is moving from bullet fire; that scene looks damn goodThey even went out of their way to not only get the looks of the weapons and cars right, but they even animated certain moments in the black and white box look reminiscent of that of the actual days of WWII. The CGI isn't that bad either despite being noticeable, and that's probably due to the environment present. Either way, this series is mostly pretty good to look at, magic included.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is done by a woman named Michiru, and this is her first time. All I have to say is: this is an interesting and ambitious way to kick off her career. Many of the vocals are in German, and in certain scenes, they fit perfectly, even if none of the songs are ones I would go out of my way to listen to. Still, its experimental and it works rather well. The OP, \"cross the line\" by AKINO with bless4, is quite a good OP, and a cool way to start off the show, especially the last 10 second of the OP. I'm even more impressed by the ED, \"Hikari Aru Basho e\" by May'n, who, if you don't know, was the voice for the singing done by Sheryl Nome in Macross F. Here, she delivers a powerful, emotional, and slow moving song that makes me wish this show as as gripping as its ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub isn't that bad, despite it being done by mostly new and unknown talent. Still, not all of them do a great job, like the voices for Izetta and Orfine. Not that any of them do bad, but honestly, it isn't a great dub either; it's merely an ok one.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLike many of you, the first half, while worrying at points, left me interested and somewhat intrigued, with the way episode 1 played out and the fact that the action was sorta fun. Still, it was never truly gripping. Then, the second half REALLY dropped the ball, and the viewers of the series collectively groaned as it fell into BS territory, leaving is with a poor second half. As you can imagine, I am one of those people left frustrated by the idiocy of the second half. Still, can't say that I outright hated the series at any point, or that I was all that infuriated. Still, that doesn't mean I wasn't left disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10    RAW SCORE: 4.87/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure we, the people of this community, will cynically remember this in the same way we did with Kabaneri only 6 months before. Only this time, even less of us cared in the first place. In the fires of the show's train wreck path, we can only grieve at what could've been. An interesting first half that lead into a stupid and generic second half that only served to make the first half's flaws more apparent as well as kill the series as a whole. It mostly felt like a love letter to World War II, but that's all this series was good for. In the end, it was all for naught, and I would be generally surprised if this series got a second season to finish the war entirely (albeit, that last bit can't happen since Otto killed himself...for...some reason), and that's not just due to the nature of the already idiotic finale. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

He also wrote the anime adaptation for Dance in the Vampire Bund, which was pretty dreadful. The studio behind it was Ajia-Do, which I remember from Magic Tree House. So, with this staff the series could go either way. Let's find out how it does, shall we? \r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative is set in an alternative world at the beginning of World War II. Princess Fin\u00e9 of Elystadt is going to the allies to plead for help against the Germanian forces. Sheand her guards are being chased by Germanian soldiers when she spots a strange capsule on the train. She tries to open it but the Germanians find her before she can. She and her guards manage to escape, but she's taken prisoner after reaching the Britannian minister. She's taken aboard a plane with the mysterious capsule when it opens, revealing a  young red-haired girl who  Fin\u00e9 knows very well, Izetta. Izetta uses her magic to rescue Fin\u00e9 and their struggle against Germania begins. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some relatively minor story issues. First off, there are some contrivances. For example, there's a character who learns a secret because two higher ups in Elystadt's military are discussing it outside where anyone could overhear them. Surely, they are strategic masterminds. There's another case where a Germanian spy happens to make friends with a couple of supporting characters who he randomly encounters without knowing who they are and he makes friends with them in a very short time just to try and make a confrontation betwixt him and one of them more dramatic. It doesn't really work. The length is also a bit of an issue. There are some really good ideas that really could have used more time to be properly fleshed out. The secret of Elystadt's original White Witch, the death of Fin\u00e9's father very early on, the political gambits that Fin\u00e9 takes to try and save her nation. Frankly, there are enough ideas here that the series could have been twenty six episodes without ever feeling like it was dragging and the pacing wouldn't have had to be so rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, when you factor in the time constraints, the series is really well written. It has strong sources of tension that get explained as well as one could reasonably expect them to be in a twelve episode series. The series is good at touching on all the beats that it needs to, even when there are ones that could have benefited from greater extrapolation. I also appreciate that every plot point comes into play. There's a scene where a certain character dies for the sake of a state secret and it doesn't seem like it's going to be important but then it comes into play for two different plot points later. The way the series brings propaganda into play is superbly handled. It's certainly a series that keeps you engrossed with every episode ending in a way that makes you curious about what comes next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest strength of the series. Most of the supporting characters are well enough fleshed out to have verisimilitude. Which adds gravity to the situations. Sophie is a compelling character, particularly when you learn the truth behind her hatred of Elystadt. The best part of the characters, however, is Izetta & Fin\u00e9's relationship. It is expertly handled with a strong back story to illustrate how they got to the point they're at when we first see them in the series and with a good degree of development over the course of the series. They're both strongly fleshed out characters and having a very powerful dynamic only serves to highlight their best, and in a few cases worst, qualities thanks to the ways they interact with one another. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is largely excellent. The backgrounds are quite lovely and there's clearly a lot of work put into the various military gear, outfits and animation. The one complaint I have with the artwork is that some of the scenes cross the line into crass fan-service. Which can be distracting when they're trying to have a serious scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe entire vocal cast does well. There aren't any weak links in that regard. The strongest performances come from Akaneya Himika & Hayami Saori. The two of them really manage to sell the chemistry between their characters. Amamiya Sora is also really good in this. We can thank Michiru for the music. Which is excellent. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot in this series. This is one of those anime that's technically not shoujo-ai, but might as well have been. There are a lot of scenes where the artwork and atmosphere give the impression that  Fin\u00e9 and Izetta are going to start passionately snogging and then the scene will have to shift before the rating goes all the way up to Rx.  Fin\u00e9 cross dresses at one point, seemingly just so she can dance with Izetta at a party. There are also some indications that Bianca would be interested in turning their relationship into a poly-amorous one and there's a former journalist turned tutor who seems interested in the pair of them as well. There's a maid, Lotte, who seems interested in Izetta. I wonder if these two meet a lot of other women who are interested by coincidence or if Elystadt's royal family just hires a lot of lesbians by design. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta certainly has its narrative flaws. It's got its contrivances, it can be somewhat crass with its fan-service and it really would have benefited from a longer run. That being said, there's a lot to like about it. The tension is strong. The characters are nicely fleshed out. The dynamic between our leads is amazing. The artwork largely looks legitimately lovely.  The acting and music are strong. As a whole, I found it highly endearing and rather enjoyable. If you're interested in seeing a WW II fiction that factors in magical powers and escapes being classified as shoujo-ai by a minor technicality, this one is for you. For myself, I give it a very respectable 8/10. Next week I've actually got a short request to look at, it's going to be Sakamichi no Apollon.",

            "content": "Izetta: The Last Witch is a rather straightforward series, which as far as I can tell was released to a good deal of interest which then petered out. Personally, I am pretty big on historical and alternate historical settings and shows which utilize them, and I like magical girl shows, so throwing them together into a blender is a good way to get me interested in the show, and at twelve episodes, it wasn't a very big commitment.\r\nTaking place in an alternate World War II, Izetta is focused almost entirely on the small fictious country of Eylstadt, which borders the Germanian Empire (...Germany) and theRomulus Federation (Basically Italy), and so they end up getting war declared on them by the Germanians to be able to better move with their allies. Being a small nation, they would normally be pretty boned...were it not for the last known witch in the world, Izetta, who was being secretly smuggled into Germania to study her (and, well, for some more reasons), which throws a whole wrench into things when Princess Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (...We'll go with what everyone else calls her in the show, Fine) is trying to escape Germanian capture and happens upon her, then later is kept with her on the way to Germania...because, you see, Izetta and Fine have a past together, enough to awaken the witch!\\n\\n\r\nThe start of the series is ultimately pretty simple, albeit well enough put together, where Izetta's witchly powers (which, by the way, look really cool) are used to defend the kingdom against overwhelming odds...and also a lot of yuri, of course. While the plot of the series is pretty standard at the start, the Germanians trying to find out Izetta's powers and weaknesses against the main characters trying to work around things like her limited range and some spying plot is enough to carry it well enough. Around the halfway point, the plot begins to get a good deal complex, and I would actuall say the latter half of the series is more of what I was hoping for: More of a look at what happens when a magical girl style of magic meets with a real world war and technology scenario, political plays and spy work and so on.\\n\\n\r\nDipping into characters, the two main characters are the aforementioned Izetta and Fine. Izetta is not a particularly complex character, and while fun enough, she really could have used a bit more depth to her character and I don't think it would have been too hard to give it to her, such as some more reflection on, you know, all the stuff she is doing in WAR for Fine and so on. Fine is the more interesting of the two, a young ruler thrust into a difficult situation and forced to make tough choices, and while it isn't explored to a particularly deep degree, it does allow her some stronger character moments and is at least fairly interesting, being a stronger character driver than Izetta, although the show is a bit...light in this regard, and so I did not feel it was handled as well as it could.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I wish had changed with the show is that the show, rather obviously and something everyone would know who has been paying attention to this show's description on anime sites or promotional material, pretty obviously plays Izetta and Fine as having lesbian moments with each other. As someone who naturally enjoys yuri moments, this is appealing to me, but like many of the shows it doesn't turn into an actual romance, which is pretty disappointing. I felt it was especially disappointing here, as not only does the show play it pretty heavily, but I feel it would better tie together Izetta and Fine's characters, as how they see each other and what they will do for each other is an important part of the show, and frankly it feels totally ripe for a romantic upgrade from friends...in fact, Episode 11 has a perfect moment for this, and while the show may trick you for a moment to think it has happened, it ultimately cops out with an open ending instead of a solid one, and to me it ends up making it feel like this plot line does not resolve in a satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are more interesting to me. Berkman is not an especially memorable antagonist, but he is played in an interesting enough way and his very self-centric viewpoint ends up being in very interesting context and contrast to essentially every other character in the show, making him more standout and unique. Sieg is probably the most interesting character in the show, with earlier moments that might seem a bit confusing at the start end up slotting into place when backstory is revealed, and ultimately makes him feel like a more deep character than most of the others, although the last stuff he does feels kinda out of place. There's also more minor characters who come in and out and I won't go into all of them, but they tend to have some of the more interesting/different moments in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the plot and the characters are a bit basic overall, though, and I wish that the show focused more on the second half's styling, as one thing I wasn't super happy about with this show is that I feel the integration of technology and magic could have been better done. Izetta's gun-broom is AWESOME and I love the idea and I do like how her powers feel both analogous to various real life military units and cleverly tied in. But the politics of it, the fighting aside from Izetta, and so on is rather lacking, and would have been more interesting had the tone of the second half been spread more through it, as the tone is oddly two-faced to it even if it never really goes dark but instead more serious. While I did like the second half, the last episode left me very divided, especially in how it messes with how one might imagine the world, although I did like the villain of the end.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the animation and sound, the animation is actually really pretty, with Izetta popping off as vibrant and managing to make surprisingly realistic styled character designs soft and interesting, which helps make Izetta stand out more among them. Stuff like Izetta's riding of her gun-as-broom looks pretty cool and some of the scenes with the magic are quite lovely. One issue the show sometimes has is in some iffy CGI, most apparently in the last episode but at times seen before. This keeps it as a pretty and high end animation, but far from the best. Sound-wise the opening, Cross the Line, is REALLY standout and something I could listen to all the time. The sound effect of things like the planes and so on are very nice...but while the OP is good, the ED is forgettable, and it has some good music, but nothing which can be compared to the best around, so I leave it as good but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Izetta is not a show that will amaze you, and if you seek a show with a deep exploration of a premise, you'll probably end up ultimately disappointed. If you want something which can give a more minor level of depth, really nice animation, and enough character and plot to keep one interested until the end, you'll probably fine Izetta enjoyable. The second half helped prop it up for me, and there is enough here that I was ultimately left with a positive view of the series...but not a very long lasting one.",

            "content": "\"The fairy tale of the White Witch who appeared in modern times surely left something inside the hearts of people all over the world.\"\r\nI could only wish Izetta. I could only wish.\r\nIzetta at first seemed like a love letter to my anime taste. Beautiful girls flying on guns, flipping tanks and piercing planes with giant swords. What's not to love?\r\nA lot apparently.\r\n*Quick side note: I watched this as it was airing, if that changes anything.*\r\nStory: 4\r\nThis is the biggest downfall of Izetta. The first few episodes were absolutely fantastic for me. They set up the alternative World War II setting well, introduced the main cast,that looked unique at first glance, showcased some kick ass action and more. However, as soon as the battle started to calm down, I felt as if the writers didn't know what to do. The SOL moments were okay, but the \"battle of wits\" between people at the side of Elystadt and Germania was straight up butchered. Each action they took was a bit too predictable. I refuse to believe that Germanians had only one smart person on their side, that could figure Izetta out. I refuse to believe that a secret place hidden under a castle had a secret passage the whole time, that just randomly opened when someone needed to escape. Finally, I absolutely refuse to believe that Elystadt didn't expect to be crushed just because of some wins, even if important from a strategic point of view. This is not how war works. No matter if magic exists or not, there are always a ton of people that have to work on every detail, but here we have only a handful. Another big problem I had, was the introduction of the main threat way too late into the show. I am not a fan of that decision to say the very least. The story does end nicely, but there are still some stories that were not completed. The last few scenes showed that there could be a special episode or something like that coming up.\\n\r\nWith all the bad stuff out of the way, there were some cool ideas in there. There was a lot of creative directing in each action scene, groups of guerrillas attacking from the forest looked believable (for the short time that we saw them), the media propaganda was used nicely, the setting was explored well and the relations between witches and normal humans were really interesting. Unfortunately that can't fix all the problems I had with the rest of the shows story.\\n\r\nLong story short, the writing flopped way too fast, way too hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe most surprising thing about the show is how good it looks. The Ajia-Do studio wasn't well known before making Izetta, so that makes their achievement even more outstanding. This series looks gorgeous. Every character design, while a bit more moe than I expected, fits. Some scenes, especially the more SOL oriented ones, get a bit less care, and you can spot some mistakes, but dear Lord, the action scenes look fantastic. Every scene from each bigger battle is handled in a great way. I don't have many complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nIt's fine. Nothing spectacular, but it fits the specified time period and can get you hyped or put you in a pensive mood when it needs to. Bonus point for the opening, both visually and on the music side. I liked it, but music is of course subjective. The seiyuus do their job well too. Berckmann sounds like an asshole, Izetta sounds like a lost girl, and Fine sounds like a strong princess. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.5\\n\r\nAt a first glance the cast looks unique enough. A witch in a World War II setting? Sounds good. An all female  princess guard? Seems interesting. A smart Germanian to rival the princess? Looks promising.\\n\r\nUnfortunately most of them flopped like a bunch of old pancakes.\\n\r\nIzetta was ineresting to the very end, I thought she would get more development and new motivations other then \"I love you Fine-samaaaa\", but she wasn't a bad MC. Fine on the other hand was. She seemed to be a strong, independant princess, but she ended up only playing a minor role. Everything was done for her, she was mostly there just to represent her country. However, I have to mention that she risked her life on numerous occasions for the good of her country, so there's that. When it comes to the sides, they just... didn't work. They try to contrast characters or have a random romance pushed in, none of that made much sense and their development was rushed. Their actions didn't have important repercussions on themselves or anything else. I have to admit though, while they were all simple characters that were a bit dumb at times, I liked them. I couldn't say that I didn't. They had strong love for their duty and their homeland. They didn't do their job well enough though, thus I consider this score appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nFor the first few weeks, this was my favourite anime of the season. The action scenes were full of hype and the story looked promising. In the end I did like the characters, I was satisfied with the ending and I am glad that I watched it. I will remeber it fondly, because there were a lot of ideas that I personally liked. I haven't watched any World War II anime before, so I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but also incredibly sad by how much it disappointed me later. With all that, I can say that at the very least I cared about the characters and the story. I wanted to see how it will end and  ultimately, the positive feelings outweighed the negative ones, mostly thanks to the awesome action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nA low 6 at that. There were some moments where I wanted to pull my hair out because of how stupid I found some episodes, but there were also moments where I grinned like an idiot after all the awesome fights. This show wasn't good for me, but I still embraced what it gave me. Thank you Shuumatsu no Izetta for teaching me not to get hyped for a show after a few good episodes and showing me some of the most awesome scenes of the year. It was a bumpy ride, but I think I can reccomend this to someone who will think that this looks interesting, but be cautious. It may disappoint you much more then it disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this is purely my opinion, and I reccomend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "The year is 1939 and as always the Germanian Empire is wreaking havoc all over Europe. (What else would you do in 1939, especially if your country is called Germania?) But when they invade the small alpine nation of Liecht \u2012 I mean Eylstadt \u2012 the opposition has a plan: to defeat them with... magic. And by magic, I mean the titular witch Izetta, flying on rifles and destroying tanks by launching swords and so on.\r\nSo let me ask a question here: is anyone actually interested in Nazis as the antagonists? (Oh, I'm sorry, not Nazis. I mean imperial Germans who happen to yell \"SiegReich!\" and put up propaganda posters.) Actually, let me put it a bit differently: is anyone really interested in a black-and-white war story against a generic expansionist militaristic country? Because that's what we're getting here. Oh, don't get me wrong, it could be a lot worse. A few of the Germanian characters seem at least remotely human. But still, what I'm mostly seeing is working for the glory of the fatherland and the emperor (and furthering their own careers in the process, I guess).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is certainly fond of the idea. The protagonists and antagonists alike are full of selfless sacrifice for their respective countries. In a particularly baffling moment, the \"ruthless strategist\" character berates a Germanian defector for betraying his fatherland for his own survival. So let me get this straight. If he had done all the dodgy things he did for the fatherland, it would have been fine then? Really?\\n\\n\r\nOn the protagonists' side we have Fin\u00e9: the paragon of courage, duty, self-sacrifice, national pride and all the other alleged virtues. She is always willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. She never lets power get to her head or abuses it in any way. She holds speeches about how the nation is everything and you must fight to protect it, blah blah blah. And on top of all that she is a princess. Hmm, I sure wonder which side we are supposed to root for in this show: the perfect protagonist or the freakin' Nazis?\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Izetta does whatever she can to help her because she is her... friend? No, I'm sorry; nobody would believe that after the tearful eyes, holding hands, dancing, playing around in underwear and the moonlit flight. The show may not admit it, but Fin\u00e9 is her love interest. Izetta is thoroughly defined by her love and has no ambition or interests beyond it. I'm sure an actual personality would only get in the way of fanservice and fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a side character has a bit more personality, they get approximately five seconds of screentime. Good luck getting attached to these people. After all, we are on the clock here. This show is only 12 episodes long, and we need to set aside some time for maid antics, eating cake and comparing boob sizes. Establishing character motivation? Logical plot progression? World-building? Who needs these?\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, character motivations are a major problem here. For instance, the antagonistic witch has a great motive: a revenge plot where she takes revenge on a bunch of innocent bystanders. How compelling. And then there's this one character who defects after getting backstabbed for no clear reason... offscreen. What happened? Am I supposed to make a blind guess here? The show also ends with a hasty clipshow and various copouts. At that point, they probably thought it was already a trainwreck and couldn't be bothered.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some novelty value in a \"what if\" story where a witch is wrecking tanks and planes, but you should actually do something with the idea. It's not like it would have been hard to have a more engaging plot: what if their good intentions go overboard and their cult of personality goes to their heads? How about showing that the other countries also have their own problems instead of everything being the Germanians' fault? How about some internal conflict between the protagonists? Or make it a parody or something; there is more than enough material here.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, just got to beat those wacky Nazis for the hundredth time. Barely anyone has interesting motivation in this show. We don't even learn about the history behind the war. Why are the Germanians on a rampage? I mean, I get it, they are an expansionist militaristic country, but why did things turn out that way? Wars don't happen in a vacuum. Could we maybe get some historial context here? Some world-building? No? Is the war going on literally only because it's 1939?\\n\\n\r\nThe crowning moment of this show is when a Germanian officer enters into a rant to berate the character who prioritizes his own survival. Just listen:\\n\r\n\"I had brothers-in-arms, too. People who fought and died for what they loved! That \u2012 being able to do that \u2012 is what makes you human! He believed in you! He believed you were fighting for the fatherland!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation in the narrative is clearly on this guy's side. So you're talking about noble causes and the example you give is... waging expansionist war and slaughtering and oppressing countless innocent people for the glory of the fatherland? Whereas the real bad guys are the people defecting from this over-the-top evil empire when their life it at risk?\\n\\n\r\nGreat aesop there. You really nailed it.\\n\r\n*slow clap*",

            "content": "Izetta has succeeded in becoming my biggest disappointment this season, and possibly, even this year. It initially had everything it needed to succeed: an intriguing premise, serviceable animation, and promising characters. An alternate history exploration of WWII, with magical girls, would have been a fascinating twist to the historical war drama. However, it becomes painfully clear that Ajia-Do either had no idea what they were doing, or they simply did not think this whole thing through well enough.\r\nThe animation, while it does have its moments, ranges from relatively average and even sub-par in certain episodes. Some episodes have beautifully animated action sequences, which is somethingI can commend the show for. However, some other episodes will feature poorly done background characters, some even lacking facial features at its worst. The CGI used, mostly for military vehicles and Izetta\u2019s anti-material rifle/broomstick and weapons, is serviceable but nothing truly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is inexcusably sub-par. The whole narrative is built on a mountain of plot conveniences and deus ex machina. Characters and plot devices are shoe-horned into a scene to get things moving, and the plot contrivances are many. The war side of the story is often sidelined in favor of showing Fine and Izetta together. You wanted a show that featured a small country locked in a dance of death and political intrigue with world powers? WELL TOO BAD! You\u2019re either getting episodes of the girls hanging out instead, or episodes of Izetta single-handedly annihilating everything which, in turn, encourages the rest of the good guys to not do much of anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fault in this entire mess are the characters. The female leads, \\n\r\nIzetta and Fine, are two of the biggest Mary Sues I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime, coming close to such characters like Medaka Kurokami of Medaka Box. Izetta is a complete tool with no sense of agency. Fine is somehow a flawless master statesman out of the gate, in which we never see her struggle for most of the time. The villains are laughably cartoonish and two-dimensional. I don\u2019t really need to talk about the rest of the side-cast as they really weren\u2019t characters, and the anime didn\u2019t care about them much either (and don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cRoyal Guard\u201d). \\n\\n\r\nFor the vast majority of the anime, these characters, Fine and Izetta especially, all show far too little character development. They don\u2019t really encounter any plot development to precipitate any sort of meaningful change until the very end, and by then, it\u2019s too late for it to matter. You will have stopped caring about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship (and heavily implied romance) between Fine and Izetta, a major selling point of this series, is a painfully droll affair that just doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs in the anime all together. It really feels like it competes with the rest of the anime for attention, rather than it enhancing the narrative experience. It\u2019s almost as if this show can\u2019t make up its mind as to what it is, and what kind of experience it wants to tell.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most frustrating aspect, is that Ajia-Do forgets that this is an anime that is just as much about WAR as it is about a couple of lesbians. There is so much potential that is wasted to use the unique setting to both shape our protagonists and tell an interesting story. Izetta pretty much murders a small army by shows end, and she never seems affected by the horrific reality of war. You really don\u2019t see Fine really struggle with the reality of running a country at war as a young, new, and inexperienced head of state. Instead, they just keep plodding along as they are. Ajia-Do completely disregarded this psychological element that would have made the story much more compelling. \\n\\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE:  I cannot recommend this anime to anyone. It is a production that is too unfocused and fails to make use of the premise\u2019s incredible potential to tell an interesting story.\\n",

            "content": "I've always personally been a fan of good historical fantasies, so when I first caught wind of Izetta: The Last Witch, the premise and setting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. However, although I was initially quite impressed with this anime, that quickly began to change as the series went on...\r\nSo, for a quick overview of the story (while intentionally leaving the details ambiguous): You have Germania, a large country with vast military might, baring it's fangs at the small country of Elystadt. Just when things are seeming to take a turn for the worst in the conflict between these two countries, awitch (the last surviving one, no less) turns the tide of battle. The witch in question, Izetta, seems unmatched and wins a number of battles against the Germanians. Of course, the happy times must always come to an end, as Izetta meets her rival, the only one capable of matching her strength.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for my criticisms:\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe story is frankly unimaginative and predictable. The events in the story unfolded much as you'd expect from any run of the mill fantasy story. Even the plot twists are fairly anti-climactic and expected, in that, they serve to further the story in the most predictable and convenient way possible. This makes them obvious to foresee, especially since they're spun using pre-existing story elements (they're not just grabbed out of thin air, nor do they introduce anything new to the story besides some tidbits of exposition).\\n\\n\r\nWith that issue aside, what I disliked most about the story is that, the actual world and the vast majority of it's characters are not even expanded upon at all, apart from Izetta and Ortfine. There are plenty of side characters that, at first glance, seem to have a unique personality and their own agendas that you'd believe would contribute to the story in some major way. However, this is not the case. Many of the characters aren't utilized to their fullest, or really, not even any at all. For lack of a better word, they are wasted potential. World building in this anime is also pretty terrible. Essentially, since all the countries are placeholders for modern day countries (France, Germany, the United States), and since the major conflict in this series is basically just a fictional World War I,  I suppose that's supposed to suffice for any sort of explanation about the current state of world events in the time this series takes place, or of the different cultures and societies that dwell within these countries. The world is just very bland and colorless. Why go through the trouble of symbolizing real world countries when your not even going to bother giving these countries any kind of identity to distinguish themselves from one another?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to come right out and say it. The only real characters that receive any development are Ortfine and Izetta. Apart from that, pretty much all of the other characters are stagnant and have very little value or impact on the story. Even then, Ortine and Izetta are far from being complex characters, they're very two dimensional. Izetta is your average shy, subservient, and caring girl that lives only to make her best friend (Ortfine) happy, that might as well be her sole reason for existing. Ortfine is essentially just an embodiment of her own ideals, namely, justice and responsibility. While they do change somewhat throughout they story, the change is fairly subtle.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also multiple sub-plots that were brought up in the story but were never fully expanded upon or explained. For example, in one episode, the writers created what I can only describe as an \"implied romance\" between two characters that had just met. In this episode, these two characters had met for the first time, which is clearly not enough time to develop a romantic relationship, nor enough time to inspire any kind of feelings for said relationship in the audience. However, by the end of the episode, it's implied that they suddenly have deep feelings for one another. I won't spoil the rest, but their relationship ended on the same episode that it began. Pretty poor writing, perhaps? \\n\\n\r\nThere's also instances where it's implied that two characters know each other and may even share a history, yet it's never even touched upon or explained. Once again, I'm not sure why the writers even bothered to make the effort if they were just going to introduce the idea and leave it hanging.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Art, and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nDespite my problems with just about every other aspect of Izetta, I actually found the OST to be fairly enjoyable. It uses a few different orchestral scores which I found pleasurable, as they matched the setting and tone of the story quite well. The opening and endings songs were also done quite well. While I doubt I'd listen to them again, they were good enough for me not to skip through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was...well, it was good for the first handful of episodes, but slowly started to taper off in quality near the end (which can be seen in the abundance of off model shots during the last few episodes). The only parts in the anime where it's animation was better than average was during the few battle scenes, which actually made the fight scenes/battles fairly enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I found the art to be pretty good, for the most part. Some of the landscapes and nature scenes in this anime are quite gorgeous, although not extremely detailed. The character designs are good, although it would've been nice to see some more variation, especially in regard to the different country's representatives (since they all look the same it's difficult to tell their ethnicity).\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of this series only began to wane more and more with every episode that was released. Eventually to the point where watching the last few remaining episodes felt more like a drag than anything else. The only reason I continued to watch this was because, when I seriously questioned whether or not to drop the series, I was only a few episodes away from finishing it and couldn't find a reason to drop it after getting that far in. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I initially had high hopes for this anime, It's poor excuse for a story and lackluster characters completely ruined it for me. Perhaps if I could \"turn my brain off\", I could enjoy it for the mediocre historical fantasy that it is, but alas, I have yet to find that elusive off switch that I've heard so much about. Until then, I give Izetta: The Last Witch a score of 5/10. While I've personally seen much worse, I'd recommend that you skip this one, as botched series like this one are a dime a dozen.",

Maybe some people were expecting it to be complicated enough for them not to understand and then consider this anime a pseudo-cult classic and proceed to give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, it's not perfect but it's definitely in the top 5%.

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In 1940, the world is racked by its Second World War as the powerful military nation of Germania turns its attention towards the small country of Eylstadt. The crown Princess of Eylstadt, Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (Hayami Saori), does what she can to defend her meager country but in doing so falls into the hands into the hands of the Germanians. Through this series of events, Fin\u00e9 is reunited with her childhood friend Izetta (Akaneya Himika), the last remaining descendant of a family of witches. After escaping, Izetta pledges her magic and loyalty to Fin\u00e9 inorder to defend Eylstadt against the encroaching forces of Germania and to realize the ideals of her dear friend.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, Shuumatsu no Izetta revolves around the pair of Fin\u00e9 and Izetta with a light interest aimed at the show\u2019s fairly extensive supporting cast. Their friendship makes a lot of sense within the story. Fin\u00e9 came to Izetta\u2019s rescue as a child and showed her kindness when nobody else would. Though Izetta saw her magic as something that made her an outcast, Fin\u00e9 was enamored and enchanted by it and these things gave Izetta a great deal of admiration for her. To Fin\u00e9, Izetta represented somebody who saw her for who she was \u2013 someone who appreciated her outside of the context of her royalty. Within this give and take between the two characters, the groundwork for their personalities and their relationship is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nFin\u00e9 herself is strong-willed, idealistic, and fully embodies the kind of self-sacrifice and poise of a just ruler. She puts others first at every turn and most of her dialogue is spent agonizing over the fact that because she herself doesn\u2019t have the power to protect her country, that she must risk the well-being of her friend Izetta. Her conviction and care for her people is endearing but at the same time she presents such a paragon of idealism and devotion that she often comes off as kind of bland and cliche. Her unflinching loyalty to the people of Eylstadt consumes her to the point that the only significant characterization that remains is that she is a \u2018good person\u2019 and that she cares for Izetta. Though she has these issues, watching Fin\u00e9 struggle to come to terms with what needs to be done is a compelling part of her character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Fin\u00e9 can at times be a little uninteresting, Izetta, the titular witch of the show, features this quality to a more extensive degree. She adores Fin\u00e9, her personality is kind and innocent, and that\u2019s about it. Almost all of her time is spent staring starry-eyed at Fin\u00e9 and wanting to do her best and pay back the kindness she once received as a young girl. Izetta herself is somewhat symbolic of Fin\u00e9\u2019s penchant for sacrifice and how she empowers herself. In the same way that Fin\u00e9 laments having to send her soldiers off to fight the war, she must send Izetta out onto the battlefield if she wants to have any chance at victory. This conflict of interests is what drives their relationship but whereas Fin\u00e9 becomes more interesting because of it, Izetta remains the same, earnest character she always was. She becomes wrapped up in the characterization of a more interesting person and between her overwrought simplicity and total lack of development fails to become an engaging character in her own right.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the two central characters have their ups and downs, the rest of the cast is woefully uninteresting and impressively forgettable. Despite hosting a relatively large cast of characters, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find one that couldn\u2019t be entirely summarized by a one-word description. There\u2019s a maid, a pilot, a spy, a reporter, a captain of the imperial guard \u2013 the list goes on. They just have no depth or personality to them whatsoever and so when the focus of the show turns to them to be interesting or meaningful, their scenes fall utterly flat. The Germanians are about as typical of a depiction as you can render of Nazi-Germany and the motives of the antagonists present in the story either don\u2019t make much sense or don\u2019t matter in respect to the story at large.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta boasted a visual style that at times wavered in quality but was for the most part fairly consistent. There were lots of pastoral backgrounds, villages, and castles and so the setting itself looked pretty decent. The show as a whole often came off as major WWII fan-service in its depiction of trenches, tanks, infantry, and dogfights. If you came to the show seeking European wartime imagery than Shuumatsu no Izetta delivers. The explosions look fantastic and the general combat looks pretty good as well. There are a number of action scenes and battles throughout the show but they are far too infrequent in their appearance to carry it through some of its more mind-numbing friendship-building scenes. For what it\u2019s worth, Izetta flies around on an anti-tank rifle which is probably the most compelling image in the entire show and the most representative of the show\u2019s duel subject matter.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fan-service, Shuumatsu no Izetta features a surprising amount of it in the form of suggestive camera angles and unnecessary nudity scenes. While it doesn\u2019t appear too frequently, the early mid-section of the show becomes rather bogged down with this extraordinarily out of place content. Izetta just doesn\u2019t bill itself as the kind of show where this kind of sexualization feels necessary or meaningful. The first episode establishes political intrigue, war-centric imagery, magic, and drama. What follows is awkward and very tonally disruptive, going as far as to sexualize Izetta during combat scenes when she should be most appealing and engaging.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nThe central narrative of Shuumatsu no Izetta is pretty straightforward. The Germanian empire seeks to invade the land of Eylstadt and Fin\u00e9 does everything she can to stop them and save her country. With the appearance of Izetta and the powerful magic she wields, the rules of combat are fundamentally changed. Suddenly, this small, nearly insignificant country which lay at the mercy of its attackers stands a fighting chance as it rallies behind Fin\u00e9 and Izetta who strongly resembles a famous witch from the county\u2019s folklore. It\u2019s a promising start but the show ultimately fails to capitalize on what made its story initially appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe failing of Shuumatsu no Izetta\u2019s story is twofold. What starts out as a promising blend between WWII European wartime and magical fantasy quickly becomes dull and uneventful as the focus of the show turns away from politics and warfare and towards the antics of Izetta, Fin\u00e9, and the supporting cast. The scenes of battlefields, tanks, and planes are quickly forgotten in place of scenes about bathing, eating pie, and incessantly going on and on for episodes at a time about whether or not Izetta should fight on behalf of Eylstadt. In this respect, Shuumatsu no Izetta should have quite literally stuck to its guns. What made the show interesting was its take on warfare, magic, and the historical intrigue of its depiction.\\n\\n\r\nThis subject matter doesn\u2019t run the length of the entire show but it really bogs down the early episodes when it would be most important to be developing something meaningful. Moreover, hardly anything happens for long stretches of time. The battles are highly infrequent and the developments between Eylstadt and Germania happen very intermittently. One bit of praise I will give the show is its use of propaganda and information warfare which is only spotlighted upon for a brief time but which captures a bit of Shuumatsu no Izetta\u2019s earlier magic.\\n\\n\r\nThough the show eventually arrives at its ultimate conflict somewhere in its later episodes, the other thing that really hamstrings the story is just how many plot contrivances it has. Too frequently are characters sent out of their way simply for the sake of manifesting some crude development down the line. It feels unnatural and often involves the show busing itself with its supporting cast which leaves each of those respective scenes completely drained of meaning and personality. Simply put, the bulk of the show is spent investigating the relationship between Izetta and Fin\u00e9 and at other times attempting to spin some sort of story out of the show\u2019s other far less interesting characters. The story is predictable to a truly unfortunate degree and never really shakes its propensity for behaving in the most obvious of ways even as it winds down.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Shuumatsu no Izetta is actually quite an interesting one. Some of the tracks fit better than others but for the most part they attempt to distill the show\u2019s sense of magic and war through various orchestral styles, occult singing, and occasional rock influence. The music gives Shuumatsu no Izetta a kind of unique sound which works to its benefit however some tracks don\u2019t fit into the scenes as well as others which can leave them feeling out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]:\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to write-off Shuumatsu no Izetta as a case of wasted potential and it\u2019s certainly true that the show doesn\u2019t take its image of a rifle-riding, magical witch in World War II quite far enough but for the most part I feel the show hit upon most of what it could have done. Themes of helping yourself through others and self-sacrifice give the two central characters some thematic significance but also contribute to the show\u2019s more stereotypical elements.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 3\\n\\n\r\nI gave Shuumatsu no Izetta a 3 because it was uneventful, poorly written, and its cast was exceedingly under-characterized. Though its premise sported some potential\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf the premise of a witch flying around in a WWII setting, dodging gunfire and upending tanks sounds appealing then, despite its faults, Shuumatsu no Izetta will probably still deliver. Its depiction of war is a pretty entertaining one though it hardly apologizes for the show\u2019s other many faults. Outside of its specific premise appeal, the show doesn\u2019t have much going for it and probably isn\u2019t worth watching unless you\u2019re in love with the idea itself.",

            "content": "This anime was good, despite the negative reviews on the series. These critics ramble on about realistic settings and how it becomes unbelievable when they are talking anime in a setting where magic exists.\r\nThe anime was made to entertain people, and I would say it does a great job and is more then capable of doing that. It is not a historical documentary so all these \"otaku\" cough* hating elitists, should take their dissection to history class and stop trying to rip apart an anime that is worth watching.\r\nSome people won't understand my ratings, since I rate 6+ passing, 5- failing anime. The mal, ratingsdon't make sense, especially the tags that go along with them, since mediocre is actually worse then decent. Think of it as school grades, 6+ / D+ - 5- / F-\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7-8: Depends on preference but, has a good drawing opening scene as soon as you start it, and is worth watching to the end. As an anime it is good or even very good. The anime is completed unlike 90% of the anime out there, and even has a good ending, that won't make all the watchers search (title) season 2 on google.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, compared to some of the anime this seaso- year, this is far better then a lot of them.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8: The setting takes place in a time and place similar to world war 2 where Germania is trying to conquer the world, it also makes it clear that magic does exist, and gradually introduces the necessary information. Story does a good job of placing moving forwards without overusing certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: Good, pretty much like every anime out there, Character art was pretty outstanding but background art, especially in certain scenes were very bland, and the bullets / scenes used to show projectiles were highlighted green which did make it somewhat odd. Discluding the background art, it would be  8.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Soundtracks are good, use of choir / vocals with ost rather then a bland music-only background. The sounds fit the time period and the magical elements of the anime fairly well. The op was alright, and the sounds complimented the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: Except a lack of background / past information on all the characters, they do have depth to them. Except the antagonists who are not not shown as much, so any information / motives they have are lost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Personally I enjoyed the anime, it is unique and does a good job of flowing. Unlike half the anime I've seen this year, which I've struggled to get past the first episode, then gradually begun to enjoy, the opening scene is quite memorable and draws you in. I would say this anime is entertaining to me personally, and I can see a lot of people enjoying this anime.",

            "content": "World War 2 themed anime is always entertaining to watch. Shuumatsu no Izetta however brings some unique addition to the whole war historical war theme; by adding elements of magic. It is actually rather cool to see a witch riding a huge tank-busting rifle instead of your typical broom into battle. This anime deliver good, enjoyable story till the end, but there are so many wasted potential that prevented it from being a true masterpiece.\r\nThe plot of Shuumatsu no Izetta is a linear one. A princess befriended a powerful witch that could help defend her home country in the midst of war. While everything seemsto be fine, there are bound to be obstacles and conflicts that makes it more interesting. Death and sacrifice is a concurrent theme, and the anime doesn't shy itself for letting several key characters dies. The anime ended in a rather strong and satisfying end, albeit rushed. My biggest complain about the anime is how its should split into 2 cours instead. Character development focused heavily on the two main characters and seems to ignore the other. This is a huge flaw since some of the side characters had a some important roles yet the viewers understanding of their past and motivation is almost null. It had so much potential alas, everything had to be crammed inside a single cour.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters that mostly took the spotlight are Princess Fine and Izetta. Princess Fine is your ideal image of a ruler, loved by the people and have a strong sense of responsibility to rule and defend the country well. Izetta meanwhile is a rather powerful witch that complement with Fine is a sense that she also want to make sure she become a great ruler, giving Fine her unyielding trust and power. There are no obvious romance that could be elaborated, but the friendship between those two is definitely stepping the boundary of Yuri; not that it is a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are decent for the most part. The action scene were executed really fluid and well. The portrayal of alternate europe during the World War 2 era is also very detailed; from uniform, to weapons and vehicles. Tanks, airplanes and ship are modelled using CGI, which is really common nowadays. There are little animation issues; while not the best this season to offer it is still a job well done from the studio. Sound is also decent enough. The OP gets the viewer pumped up while the ED leaves a melancholic feel as each episode end.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta is one of my top anime this season; which is saying something since this season overall is rather mediocre. It is good and enjoyable to watch, yet it had so much potential that could be exploited if the anime was mad longer instead. While not perfect, it does it job alright.",

            "content": "Ok, so this anime set in an alternate world war 2 scenario, is over, thought the Alternate History, war, military and historical did played their part here, I just can't make myself to like the Izetta X  Ortfin\u00e9 \"Fin\u00e9\" Fredericka von Eylstadt , cu'z  for the most part this anime has that lesbian love theme added into it, but nevertheless, this anime is ok, so here are my ratings:\r\nStroywise, it was set in an alternate world war 2 scene, where Germany becomes Germania, and France is Eylstadt, the UK is given it's Latin name \"Britannia\" , while Russia is......I don't know, while theUS is the United States of Atlantica. Of course the situation is suppose to be a World War 2, but some settings put it in a kind of battle to invade rather than a battle of nationalism. Good as it is, it was rather more on the relationship between the witch and the princess who serves as this damsel in distress that has to be saved by the latter where the entire story relies a lot on. So a good 7 is in order for this category.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise , I'd probably put it in a Decent 4, since there is only one fanservice around here and it's with Fine in her shower scene and some Sophie naked scene, most of it....well, don't expect to see panty flashes nor any of the quintessential Zettai Ryoki and some uncensored boob flash, trsust me even in Fine and Sophie's few minutes of their naked glory you won't see any. But anything else is all normal.\\n\\n\r\nSound, well since I have no comment about any of the seiyuu's who did who , nor do I give anything about the opening and closing theme, I just rate it a mediocre 5 and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, just seeing the yuri thing that involves with Izetta and Fine , really makes me wanna hate them, to the point, that I'd wish that Izetta loses to Sophie and Eylstadt, got owned by Germania, so , really, I have no hesitations of rating this category a pathetic 1. Also, seeing that Basler did a halfass of killing Berkman was also an added irritation for me, so another nail in the coffin for this category.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I'm giving it a good 7 for some of the war accuracy despite that it was set in an alternate world, also the battle scene were good to watch, in fact it was the battle scene and the confrontation between Rickret and Bianca also added to the enjoyability of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut, overall, I can't only rate this anime as a Decent 4, cu's the plot is all over the place, and it's reliance on the yuri of Fine and Izetta was just too cheesy and not seeing Izeeta  and Beckman dead was a disappointment in such way, Still, the anime is ok to be watched, and that's that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nsch\u00f6ne Ferien\\n\\n\\n\r\nlyckliga ferier och gott nytt \u00e5r\\n\\n",

            "content": "What\u2019s worse: a consistently mediocre show, or a mediocre show that looked like it could\u2019ve been a lot better? Whichever you prefer, Shoemaster no Izetta is the second option.\r\nI\u2019m not gonna sit here and pretend that Shuumatsu was, at any point, even a strong contender for anime of the season. I don\u2019t feel particularly burned or let down by this show falling apart, but at the same time I can\u2019t help but feel a little surprised: Two super hot main characters, one of them being a witch or magician, a story with historical context, a metal-based OP, and one of the best soundtracks of theyear come together to form\u2026 a light 4. So, what the fuck happened?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t that anything really happened, it\u2019s just that Shuumatsu put on a nice facade for a bit. That sounds like I\u2019m stating the obvious, but hear me out: This anime was only good on a conceptual level. Beyond writing \"MAGIC + WW2\" down, the writing team had no idea what the fuck to do. There\u2019s no singular element to Shuumatsu that makes it bad, it\u2019s a consistent series of fuck-ups and bad writing that starts to become apparent after the story\u2019s introduction.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the conflict can be blamed on people being complete fucking idiots, and that\u2019s never a good thing. When you have some pretty high stakes such as\u2026 I dunno, a WORLD WAR involved, it\u2019s expected that the people have some sort of responsibility. This involves not discussing the weakness of someone who is single-handedly carrying you in the war, or even discussing this someone period, in broad fucking daylight. God forbid someone hears you and runs back to camp to tell all his friends about it for no reason... ... ... ... ... ...HEY WAIT A MINUTE\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that becomes more apparent as time goes on is the absolute perfect perfectnicityness of the three lead characters: Izetta, Fine with an accent at the end, and Izetta\u2019s Tits, which you better fuckin\u2019 believe are fine with an accent at the end. These are the good guys, so they\u2019re good people. They do absolutely nothing wrong and have no flaws whatsoever. Finemon is noble and brave and lives to defend the country she proudly leads. Everyone that\u2019s not literally Hitler happily supports her. Izetta is the most OP being on the planet, and all she wants to do is use her power for good, which means indiscriminately killing shitloads of Nazis. Her entire character is that she totally wants a piece of dat Fine ass and will do virtually anything for it. She might be a little childish due to literally not having a life for the most part, which doesn\u2019t really count as a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the bad guys are Nazis. They do bad things because they\u2019re the bad guys and that\u2019s basically it. I suppose the real context of the antagonists can be summed up as \u201cread a fucking book\u201d, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting actual historical figures in this anime. This isn\u2019t Drifters. This is an original story with not-very-cleverly renamed things like \u201cGermania\u201d involving original characters. Original characters such as Smug Villain who is a villain that smiles in a smug fashion. He has a low voice and talks clearly but quietly while smiling in a smug fashion. Because he\u2019s the bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nUnyielding good versus unforgivable evil. It\u2019s too obvious who you should root for. Tropes aren\u2019t bad on their own, but too many of them will dumb things down and come off as boring, unless you can fully embrace them and use the best parts to tell a satisfying story. I\u2019m describing \u2018My Hero Academia\u2019 for the record. Not that it\u2019s related. But meanwhile, Shuumatsu is full of one-note, trope-y, flat basic bitches. Well, not Izetta. She\u2019s not flat. She got some pretty big dynamics nahimean?\\n\\n\r\nIn short, despite the serious tone Shuumatsu puts off in its early moments, its story is far from mature. Even when nothing is happening, there\u2019s still something wrong. Like, talking about pie for all eternity, or watching Izetta get molested by some creepy designer lady. I think that\u2019s where they uh\u2026 Cross the Line, eh???? Goddamn that song is good.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I\u2019ve complained a lot about a show that\u2019s based on a hot chick flying around on a gun. So let\u2019s talk about that for a moment. For some reason, people defend bad writing and fanservice with \u201cshe\u2019s riding a gun, it was stupid to begin with!\u201d Just because something\u2019s a little silly doesn\u2019t mean all its faults are suddenly cleared. Like, what? It doesn\u2019t even look or seem that silly. Not only is it cool as shit, but it brilliantly combines both the setting of war and the concept of magic. If anything, wearing a big hat and flying around on a broom would\u2019ve been inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, the battles themselves are actually pretty good. Izetta is OP as shit and just fucking destroys everything in her path. It\u2019s a lot of fun seeing shit like that, and it\u2019s not every day where you see tanks getting thrown around. But, of course, the stakes need to be raised at some point, so the enemy introduces\u2026 more magic. Aww\u2026 It\u2019s kind of a bummer that they couldn\u2019t stick with Magic vs. Military and had to make it Magic vs. Magic instead. Granted, the story\u2019s timeline gives it very limited technology, but it would\u2019ve been really cool to see the Germans--oh, sorry--the GERMANIANS (you know that's just Germany in Romanian, right? That's not a rename at all, those hacks!) develop some sort of weapon or even a clever strategy to level the playing field a bit, instead of just introducing more magic out of nowhere.\\n\r\nThat said, when Izetta has finally met her match, things don\u2019t go downhill. They get crushed, flattened, stomped on, pushed off a cliff, and dropped into the fucking ocean. Shit gets real FAST and that made me appreciate the evil side a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nNothing\u2019s animated too well, though. Izetta flying around looks quite nice, and let me compliment the character designs one more time because they\u2019re outstanding. But, as expected, the larger animations such as large objects getting tossed around or a collection of swords slicing around\u2026 they\u2019re CG. The CG itself isn\u2019t particularly good nor bad, but combined with normal 2D animation, it looks kinda weird and took me out of the experience a little. I don\u2019t remember anything being terrible, though. The general style is very common despite the obscure studio--if you told me this was by A-1 Pissants or J.C. Staff, I wouldn't have questioned it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on the other hand\u2026 now there\u2019s a hidden gem. The mystical, magical music in the back with a rock influence, particularly with Izetta\u2019s fight scenes, holy shit it\u2019s brilliant. It felt a little overdone, though. Exposition could be going on, and the composer\u2019s still going apeshit with dark, jittery, and mysterious music as if the most amazing plot twist\u2019s about to happen. Still, I\u2019m gonna be downloading thi--I mean purchasing this soundtrack in a very legal manner when it releases to the public. And the credits themes were equally outstanding. \u2018Cross the Line\u2019 has one of the most hype-inducing introductions of the entire year, and its piercing metal sound kept me on my toes the whole way through. The epic piano ballad used as the ED is equally mesmerizing despite being basically the exact opposite sound. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Izetta: The Last Witch? Given the interesting premise, I might. After all, an anime with historical context always draws in an audience. 'member Joker Game? Talk about awkward! Anyway, just be warned. You\u2019re not getting a very intricately-written story. It has some good moments for sure, but more often than not you\u2019ll want to rip your hair out. Come in mostly for the fights and the occasional charm. And don\u2019t forget the boobies. Hooray for boobies.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\r\nIzetta - Fine/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4.25/10 (Score range: 3.5-5.0)\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nFavorite character - Izetta\u2019s Ettas\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

Good thing though that the princesses faithful doggy...I mean, good friend Izetta just woke up from her slumber and does her witch thing. Izetta uses its story within the real life happenings around that time, which is pretty nicely done. However, it doesn't do much with the military setting after the nazi witch shows up, which is a wasted opportunity.

The background music fits very nicely in the whole scenery as well. Voice acting was very good too, even though I found Izetta to sound a little too cutesy at times. Sora Amamiya gives me another reason to praise her and it was nice to hear Kana Hanazawa in a completely different kind of role than what she usually does.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh, Izetta, as cute as you are, you are a very, VERY one-dimensional girl. It's only natural for this anime to focus on the (homoerotic) relationship between Fin\u00e9 and Izetta, but all this little witch thinks about is her \"hime-sama\" and how she can be of any use to her. Fin\u00e9 herself isn't that bad, she can be a good politician every now and then, but once we get back to her worrying about Izetta, it all comes tumbling down. The other witch that turns up later has a motivation for her actions, but...I don't know, I just didn't feel it. In the end she did the same thing Izetta does, despite telling her how idiotic that is. The best characters were the agents of both sides, who did the logical things to do and acted pretty clever.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike most others, I enjoyed the first half more than the second, though I don't think it went completely to shit. While this anime started out interesting and creative, they started playing it safe halfway through, which was quite disappointing. The ending was a lame cop-out for a show that did a lot of things right, but then started heading the wrong way.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

            "content": "What could go wrong with combining a WWII setting with some cute magical girl(s)? Everything I tell you\u2026\r\nIzetta the Last Witch is something I was optimistic for considering it was an alternative take on the second world war which I\u2019m sure many of us have studied at some point before viewing. The Germanian Empire is our like for like replacement for the Nazi Regime which was led by the infamous Adolf Hitler. To summarise, the Germanian Empire has gone on the offensive using arguably one of the best tactics in modern history. The \u2018Blitzkrieg\u2019 was designed to create disorganisation among the Allied forces which wascomposed of countries such as Britannia and Thermidor. The fictional small country of Eylstadt (modern-day Austria) which houses our main two characters Archduchess Ortfine and the last witch in question being Izetta, is on the receiving end taking blows from all the powerful Germania.\\n\\n\r\nThe show fails to deliver on providing interesting characters apart from the main duo of Ortfine and Izetta. Ortfine during the war is saddened by the news that her father has passed away due to an illness. This incident has caused her to take up reigns, whilst being designated as the successor at the coronation ceremony giving her the ultimate task of leading her country. Being the sole monarch for such a tiny nation has exacerbated the fact of her wanting to protect to what is deemed as being vulnerable. That is the defining trait for our young Archduchess who for the most part doesn\u2019t exhibit any other qualities which is what sets apart memorable and forgettable characters. She would be in the latter bracket as there is no major characterisation from her as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta is our heroine for the Eylstadt soldiers, who have been demoralised from the current conflict knowing they had no chance of winning against the stronger army. Izetta being a witch allows her to use magic in the battlefield which is not the magic that I had envisioned at first. There are no spells being made that resemble any sort of sorcery. Izetta\u2019s magic is just having the ability to levitate certain objects such as torpedoes and lances which are just some examples. The magic used does create mayhem among the enemy line as it\u2019s used in an unpredictable fashion. What concerns me though is the instances where she is pegged back by the enemies\u2019 retaliation which is evident in numerous occasions. Despite being called the key to winning the war, she hasn\u2019t shown enough for me to acknowledge her as being exactly that.\\n\\n\r\nAs a witch, she does have her limitations, which is revealed through the information about the ley lines that are spread out through all of Europe. These hotspots as I like to call them are the areas where she can use her magic effectively without deteriorating greatly in magic usage. The best tactic to defeat Izetta was confronting her at a weak magic location but no there is more to that apparently. Izetta like any other superhuman entity will usually have some form of weakness aka their kryptonite equivalent. Funnily enough it does share a similar appearance to that of the kryptonite.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been mentioning her magic but what defines Izetta\u2019s character? She can basically be summed as being a sweet-natured girl of a placid disposition. Her objective in the current war is to protect the Archduchess and the country that she governs. It is known beforehand that Izetta has been given a verbal warning by her late grandmother not to use her magic powers excessively to the point it would get out of hand. She inevitably breaks this promise and proceeds to display her abilities in the chaotic battlefield. Her existence is predicated on the fact she will do all it takes to protect Eylstadt even if it means her dying. She\u2019s come close to kicking the bucket but the God of Death hasn\u2019t exerted his influence that much.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is suffering from other consistencies preventing me from enjoying it and it\u2019s a shame as it looked promising in the beginning. A significant portion of screen time was given to an average infantry soldier named Jonas, who had survived his fair share of blows at times while it being questionable. The poor man dies because of an information leakage which resulted in his death\u2026 what was the point in showing his character for him to be dismissed like that? \\n\\n\r\nAnother occasion where the plot felt loose was during the banquet held in one of the Allied nations. The fact that Berckmann managed to appear out of thin air to confront the Archduchess should be raising alarm bells. What I find baffling is how he managed to get past all the security considering it is being hosted for all sorts of delegates during wartime. This just adds to the plot convenience needed to advance the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also the instance where Berckmann\u2019s assistant managed to sneak into the countryside of Eylstadt for his espionage mission. The man was picked up by the retainers of the Archduchess who never questioned the validity of him abstaining from conscription. A spy has just managed to get a ride with Bianca and co who are viewed as being competent and act as being professional. This group managed to harbour an enemy for the whole time without suspecting him once, just convenient if I must say. The writing is abysmal through proper retrospection.\\n\\n\r\nThere are countless more but I shared the obvious ones that were glaring to me. Another pet peeve of mine is the fact that the Germanian Empire has somehow managed to invent cloning of humans, which may not sound too outlandish at first. The idea of cloning existing in an alternate timeline that can enable for magic isn\u2019t too far-fetched but if you think about it, DNA mapping was never introduced until the 1950s which is after WWII in this case. My case is closed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by studio Ajia-do is probably one of the factors that enticed people into watching as well as the setting involved. The character designs are designed for the moe aesthetics, which is evident in Izetta who just seems cute all around. The designs are reminiscent to what was used in Sword Art Online, this show has an A-1 Pictures feel to it but there is no relation whatsoever. The animation is crisp and fluid when it needs to be in the action sequences but is generally consistent with no substantial drop in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the most part is befitting for a show set in this period. The array of tracks which are mostly heard in the battlefields usually consist of orchestral compositions. The variations of vocal sequences add to the immersion during intense scenes but felt lacklustre with nothing being too exceptional or noteworthy. The opening song used feels more like a J-pop song and does not really match with the themes to be honest. The ending song takes more of a dramatic feel to it and is genuinely feels better to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT-\\n\\n\r\nPositives \u2013\\n\r\nDecent Animation \\n\\n\r\nNegatives \u2013\\n\r\nTerrible directing along with a poor script. The plot convenience is unbearable at times.\\n\r\nBland side characters and no variety.\\n\r\nThe fan service is heavy with this one and feels inappropriate at times. I didn\u2019t mention the moe maid lol\\n",

            "content": "If potential is something that you\u2019re seeking for, Shuumatsu no Izetta (Izetta: The Last Witch) will breathe life into that word. At first glance, anyway. Think about it though. It\u2019s a series that combines elements of military warfare, witchcraft, political conflicts, and other magical shenanigans into a single package. And as an original series, the show isn\u2019t held back by a dedicated fan base or those who lusts for \u201cfaithful adaptation\u201d. However, Shuumatsu no Izetta isn\u2019t exactly perfect or even close as the word potential is dragged down each step of the way.\r\nThe risk of making a historical fiction war drama story can be viewedfrom many angles. While it doesn\u2019t always have to rely on historical accuracy, it should still make sense. In essence, the show attempts its best job at that by adapting the setting into World War II style war story. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s when the Allies fought against the Axis Powers that stretched from Europe all the way to the Pacific theater. However, this series doesn\u2019t fly across the globe even though it has a cute little witch. In fact, it focuses primarily on this tiny Alpine country of Eylstadt as imperialist forces of Germania decides to invade them. \\n\\n\r\nMark my words, the show gets straight to the point pretty fast. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that there\u2019s a war conflict going on. Ortfin\u00e9 \"Fin\u00e9\" Fredericka von Eylstadt (the princess) is pursued by Germanian forces and even gets captured aboard a train. A mysterious witch named Izetta shows up from a capsule and she recuses Fine. Turns out, they actually knew each other before during childhood. While all this is happening, it\u2019s hard to forget about how Izetta saves her. Literally, she flies on a giant gun and is able to use magical powers to influence objects. So basically, she is a witch although where her powers came from is a mysterious origin. What we do know is that Izetta is among the last of her kind and she enters an alliance with Fine to protect their country. So for standards, the series leaves me a good impression as the storytelling can expand quite a bit with the war drama and mystery. A lot of questions will pop into viewers\u2019 minds like \u201cwho really is Izetta?\u201d \u201cWhy does Germania want to invade Eylstadt\u201d? or \u201cWho will win the war?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here though. Perhaps my expectations for the series were a bit too high from the start but the series seems to dwindle down each and every episode. The first few episodes does a fairly well job at launching the series with its premise. However, the pacing drags back the show as transitions between certain episodes just feels stale. Certain episodes such as ones that info dumps about witch magic or Izetta\u2019s daily life style can easily be condensed to further the storytelling. Instead, they are stretched out with slice of life content with little impact. The series also seems to have a fetish for Izetta\u2019s breasts as the girls often makes fun of them, especially Fine and the maids. On the other hand, it is evident that the series remains faithful to the premise. The war is still the main focus and we see how the roles of characters are played out. Izetta is a prominent figure as a witch so her allies uses her in ways to not just directly engage their enemies but also with psychological warfare. In other words, they want to make the best of what she has to offer with her powers, carrying military squadrons to certain positions, and boosting morale. While it\u2019s not realistic, it does make her character intriguing to watch as we can see what a witch can really do. While I did mention how ludicrous the comedy can get sometimes, this show does not joke with death as certain characters really do die. As such, do expect the violence and war drama to take hold to show how tragic warfare can be.\\n\\n\r\nEven though she\u2019s the titular character, the series isn\u2019t just about Izetta. Fine, the princess of Eylstadt, serves as a good mentor and leader for her country. She plays the role of a strategist, idealist, and also a friend for her people. The most important relationship she has is with Izetta as the latter saved her during childhood. However, I am not overly impressed by the character relationships in the series. Beyond Izetta and Fine, there\u2019s hardly any others that are memorable. For instance, there\u2019s Bianca, Princess Fine\u2019s personal bodyguard who only gets a memorable role in the latter half of the series when she kills a Germania spy. There\u2019s hardly any development between that spy and her so most of their storytelling is easily forgettable. The main antagonist of the series is Berkman, a Major of a Germanian Special Unit. And oh boy, he is about as stereotypical as you can get out of a villain. Egoistic, manipulative, and cunning are just a few words to describe this man. The fact that he also has a secret weapon to counter against Izetta shows him as a sinister bastard. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that does surprise me though is the quality of the visual production. Ajia-Do is practically an unknown studio that most are unfamiliar with. Their most recognizable work might as well be this one so it\u2019s interesting to see how they took on this project. On the surface level, the series is beautiful with crisp animation. The landscapes and country-style feel gives a good impression of its setting. Furthermore, character designs is noticeable as it fleshes out Izetta being distinctive with her white dress and scarlet hair. Fine is noticeable for her beauty and classic blonde hair, fitting for a princess of her country. On most parts, the action has solid choreography without much jerky movements. Camera angles often capture the most intense parts of war that makes the show thrilling. Do note that there\u2019s a bit of fan service that seems to have more fun with itself than it should.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Shuumatsu no Izetta, Nagasaki Yukio seemed like a fitting choice for sound director. His most recent work from GATE shows his talent and brings it into this series. The fast pacing of the action combined with the elements of military warfare all seems to work with the instrumental music. The feel of the European style OST also brings credibility for the series\u2019 setting. Finally, character voice acting is well performed for characters such as Fine with haughty personality, Bianca\u2019s toughness, or Berkman\u2019s arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I really sum this up? A massive disappointment or just a show to watch for the pure entertainment? To be fair, this show is probably not suitable for everyone. Fanatics of historical elements and war drama enthusiasts will probably find this series more entertaining than others. However, if you\u2019re seeking for a well-rounded story, then this show will feel like one that dropped the ball. Not literally but just the type that makes you hope there\u2019s so much more. Too bad really.\\n",

            "content": "\"Izetta - the last witch\" - is good anime in alternative history genre. Events of anime happen in alternative Europe of ~1939, where Germania tries to conquer the world, and as \"real\" (from other fiction) nazi they study occultism and magic. And there is what to study - because in this world magic is real. And easy prey for Germania as little alpine country Principality of Elystadt suddenly get support from Izetta - the last witch of this world. Magic vs technic, science and cunning, great setup for nice anime.\r\nAnd there is probably the main problem, anime at the beginning show so great potential, whichis really poorly realized, so many people even drop this anime in the second half of season. But it is not bad at all, just do not expect much, and you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n==Story== (7/10)\\n\r\nStory is decent, it was interesting to follow warfare and politics at that world, despite the fact that politics are shown really childish and primitive. Cool guys from secret police of both countries were shown much better and darker. History of witchcraft was well presented, and some little stories too.\\n\\n\r\nAlso relations between main characters Fine and Izetta - is great and cause you to imagine what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nBut really inappropriate fan-service and some misunderstanding in motivation at the end, where it can be better written, spoils the story.\\n\\n\r\n==Characters== 6.5/10\\n\r\nOne more problematic side of anime. No, mostly characters are good, someone even great, just looks at the agents of secret police Berckmann and Muller, some other supporting characters are great too, germanian pilot for instance. Ortfine despite hers childish and sometimes dumb speeches had some charisma and looks like the proper aristocratic girl. \\n\\n\r\nBut Izetta - oh, she is just one dimensional. It is pure naivety and mindless loyalty, whatever is going on, Izetta reacts just the same way. If at the start of series you did not notice this, in the second half it so unbearable to ignore. Still relation between Fine and Izetta are nice, except for some predictable Izetta moves. \\n\\n\r\nMain villain is pretty generic and can be found at any average anime\\n\\n\r\n==Art and Sound== 10/10\\n\r\nI love it! Alpine landscapes - just beatiful, tech and building - also drawn nicely, and there is no complaints about character. I love this style, whatever it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound is even better, some german alpine motives create great atmosphere. Battles also had music accompaniment, which fit war well. OP - is nice, but nothing specific, ED - calm cool song.\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment== 9/10\\n\r\nThe main problems of this anime are Izetta and the fact that it could be better (maybe, maybe not), but this two facts does not spoil me anime. I got many positive emotions while watching. Decent story, great music, some great characters and emotional chemistry between main characters.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. It is good anime, but hype spoil so much in the eyes of viewers.",

            "content": "The fact that Japan was on Germany's side during WWII along with how we dropped nukes on them during said war really makes things uncomfortable whenever that country decides to dip their hands into alternate WWII fiction. Especially since they can't demonize the actual Germans, so they have to call them names like Germanians or Britanians or Americans (oh wait) whenever they have to portray actual antagonists. Germanians who are pretty damn fluent in Japanese for a country that wants the world to be ruled by the master race, but what do I know about alternate history? Well I may not know much, but Ido know that if you want to show your child a good entry in that genre, Izetta: The Last Witch is better left in that bargain bin where you found it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is centered on a young princess named Fine and her attempts to stop the evil Germanians from taking over her country on the eve of this war that shares the same name as the world-spanning conflict of the 1940s, but otherwise has no relation to it whatsoever. Because in addition to all the usual changes that are made to the history in order to make a WWII story fresh after it's been exploited by the entertainment industry like ten thousand times, we now have magic in this world. And I'm not talking about the cultish Hellboy/Conqueror of Shamballa/Maria the Virgin Witch religious magic, although it wouldn't surprise me if the writers of this show took inspiration from that. This one deals more with basic witchcraft, except witches use anti-tank rifles to fly around rather than brooms and can decimate entire armies in ways that an entire army of Jedi would cry foul at.\\n\\n\r\nSaid witchcraft takes the form of a young red-haired girl named Izetta, a witch-in-hiding who was saved by Princess Fine in the past, and now that they've both grown up, Izetta vows to use her magical powers to help Fine's kingdom win the war and launch a thousand yuri fanfictions in the process. However, the opposing Germanians are aware of the existence of witchcraft and vow to discover Izetta's weaknesses in order to tip the war back in their favor. From there, the show basically spreads itself out way too thin, trying to juggle multiple characters, viewpoints, and genres all at once. In theory, this means something for everyone. In practice, this means absolutely no one is satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nSee, I know Izetta got a lot of attention from anime fans upon initial watch because it dumped a lot of elements that people were intrigued by to the point that they were interested in what it might become over what it actually is. Every time I read an initial positive impression for this show, they never praised anything resembling actual story direction, always concentrating on individual scenes or characters who seem likable and all that stuff that sends out warning lights that the show is going to turn to shit within a few episodes like 99% of all anime out there. Although to be fair, I didn't expect the show to be as tonally inconsistent as it ended up being, dedicating entire episodes to the breast sizes of the females (because that's totally appropriate to talk about during wartime, isn't it?), only to shift to a no-name male soldier who ends up getting an early perish because he knew too much.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a war story, that means we have to sit through the usual boring \"being a soldier is bad\" storytelling with all the pointless deaths, men turning into monsters, and blablabla that I really hate about war fiction. But you know what's worse than a war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches like we haven't heard them before? A war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches, only to shortchange it with elementary anime cliches. I mean can someone explain to me why all the high-ranking soldiers that hang around Fine happen to be cute girls with big racks? Why exactly do I have to watch them trying to give Izetta a shower, and why exactly should I care about them getting their own episode when they have about as much impact on the plot as a malfunctioning cell phone? Didn't exactly help that the episode itself was just plain bad, focusing on them taking care of a male soldier who happened to be on the opposite side, and anyone who didn't see that ending coming has obviously never watched a war story in their life, and you should have picked a better one to start with.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are pretty generic. Fine is a headstrong princess who wants to serve her country and protect the people, and that philosophy isn't challenged at all during the show's runtime, making it hard to sympathize with any of the arbitrary struggles that she faces along the way. Izetta is pretty much defined by her devotion to her. Pretty much every other good guy is characterized the same way only they can't lift tanks. And the bad guys are pretty much characterized by either \"kill the witch\" or \"die soldier die\". Really, Fine is pretty much the only person who's in a position to spearhead the story, but because she doesn't take much action nor does she have her actions challenged, she's about as qualified to guide the viewer as she is to run the country in general. Just about the only thing she really cares about is risking her friends' lives, specifically Izetta's, on the battlefield - and the majority of what qualifies as her arc involves her making sure that her witch friend is safe whilst dealing with a war that outsiders shouldn't be involved in. That sort of relationship couldn't carry a two-hour movie by itself. Why on earth would it be able to carry twelve episodes?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the magic angle, I think Izetta was actively trying its best to make it as bland as possible, because it hits all the usual cliches you'd expect from an anime gimmick thrown into a generally serious situation. It has limits so the good guys don't get completely overpowered. It's used for generic slapstick that no one over the age of eight would find funny. After initial usage, it's never used with the same amount of efficiency again. Oh, and did I mention that the enemy side happens to have someone with similar powers? To which I respond with \"how does that make any horse-fucking sense?\". If they had someone on their side who could use magic, why would either the writers or the characters need to devote so much time to discovering Izetta's weaknesses in the first place when they can just send someone on her level who would definitely know how magic actually works in this world beforehand? And where the fuck did this girl come from anyways? I can't recall her ever being foreshadowed prior to her initial appearance in the last third of this show, so the only possible answer I can come up with was that even with the Germanians discovering her weakness, the writers didn't have an idea how to make a suitable final conflict so they threw Sophie in at the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nOne other way the magic in Izetta is misused is that the show ends up putting so much attention on the gimmick that it loses focus on the actual story that was initially hinted at at the very beginning. The final conflict is pretty much one big magic duel that has nothing to do with WWII and introduces a bunch of out-of-nowhere plot elements leading to a paint-by-numbers ending that makes Luke Cage's finale look like Fullmetal Alchemist's (either anime adaptation). I should point out that Izetta: The Last Witch is made by a newbie studio who I know nothing about, but apparently doesn't have any recognizable veterans amongst their ranks, because the animation in this show is absolute ass. Everything looks way too flat, the magic spells have no personality, and just about anybody could have directed this show. As such, don't expect that final conflict I mentioned to be a suitable payoff for all the mismanaged elements that came before. And if you're watching this show for the yuri, put away those virgin boners, because you're not gonna get much of a resolution out of that either.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't a single thing I can recommend Izetta: The Last Witch for. It only has one not-so-unique idea that's only on-screen like half the time at best, and it failed to make anything interesting happen with it when it bothered to show up. The show is cheap junk food: unfulfilling and you feel kind of weird after experiencing it, but you can't really describe why. My recommendation? Toss it into the same hellfire we threw Corpse Princess and that shitty Romeo x Juliet show and forget everything about its existence, just like we did with those shows.",

            "content": "A bad yet entertaining show can go out in a blaze of glory. A show like this gets put out of its misery like a badly ill dog on the violent streets.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR SHUUMATSU NO IZETTA*\r\nI'm sure we all remember what happened with the spring 2016 anime known as Kabaneri. To recap, the series started off strongly and interestingly before divulging into a convoluted mess that made everyone remember this series as 'the series that fell apart massively before our horrified eyes\" rather than \"the show that impressed us all\". Well, that same thing happened here. This when this series started, it had a fairlydecent reception and many people interested, thinking that this could quite possibly be the dark horse of the season. By that, we mean, this would be the series that won a lot of favor from the community after it was least expected to. Instead, it lost all of its luster, and now, it is up to us to bury this series and say our final goodbyes to this failed soldier. You may ask: \"how did this series flop on us all?\" Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair to this series, the premise is one of the most fascinating of the seaso . A witch gets summoned to fight for one of the many European countries (this one being Elystadt) oppressed by Germania's assault during World War II. Even the first episode managed to feel like it would turn out to be interesting, if not necessarily as grandiose as a war series tends to be. Unfortunately, some of the series's major problems come early, with one of the biggest being how the magic is explained.  There are these things called \"ley ines\" (which no one can see, ever, so how were they recorded?) which are the lines of magic energy that allow witches to use their magic. However, they aren't everywhere, so Izetta has to be careful not to wander into an area in which she cannot use magic.  This becomes a problem due to the fact that we can never truly know where they are and where they stop, meaning that the writers can, on a whim, make Izetta accidentally go off to a bad location without us knowing any better until she suddenly falls down and gets herself injured, which end us happening in episode 9, bit I'll get to that episode is the point in which the series jumped the shark, later.\\n\\n\r\nWhile episode 9 is the shark jumping point, the part that first comes of major concern is episode 4, where they fake Izetta's power via theatrics to fool the world into thinking that she is a very powerful witch while beating the Germanians in another battle. However, this raises the question of \"why didn't she just use her own magic when the world from this point on, will know of her magic anyway?'. Not only that, but it leads into one of the most trite setups that I ever have to see: the whole \"this person I admire is secretly a fake\" cliche\".  It turns out that there was a spy all along, and Jonas, the guy who found out the secret about Izetta, is blackmailed by the spy that he'll kill his family. Then, he gets shot by him before the guy runs away, and then Jonas is shot and \"killed\" by Sieg. This should really affect his family given how much they talked about it. However, we never see his family once. After a few meh episodes, one ship explosion that took one torpedo when they explicitly said it required 4 todo the job, and one ball later, we finally get to episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out, in episode 6, there was a girl who kissed Izetta in order to make her bleed that way said girl could drink her blood (don't as me how this makes sense, or how they manage to pull it off realistically; this show never bothered to make it work). Turns out, she was a copy of the real White Witch: a girl described in legend to be a noble and tragic witch. I won't even get into how many of the false versions of the story there are here, as only the one showed in the middle of the finale is right, which means the series has lied to us extremely often. Let's just say this: now, she is evil. Also, they are mass producing clones of her via magic that they shouldn't understand thanks to how this works. After struggling against her, Izetta loses power, and crashes into land. How? They went out of their way to state that she is still on land where the ley lines are located. Apparently, they didn't care to explain this, as there is no indication that her powers were manually shot down. Then, she starts bleeding despite nothing indicating that she was badly wounded anywhere. You could assume the crash did this to her, but all it was, was her tumbling a lot with nothing harmful going into her. She is then captured. Episode 10 even explicitly states so. So why is she still with the good guys? It turns out, that in that same episode, they retrieved her. Since that's the case, why did the Germaniand bother saying that they got her. Also, why did the SS try to kill Berckmann? They had no reason to not only fire him, but try to excecute him as well.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some generic and flawed writing, we come to the finale, where it all goes to hell. In episode 11, they start moving to the area with Izetta seemingly getting ready after another \"hinty hint hint yuri\" moment, but in the very first 5 second of episode 12, she is already at the fight with Sophie already hovering opposite of her. After about 8 minutes, we get this. Remember when Sieg shot Jonas in the head? Turns out, he's completely fine, with the Germanians, and then he shoots Sieg out of panic. This raises a multitude of questions that damn this series even more into absolute failure. Whatever. The day is saved, Sophie is stopped, the Germanian operation has been foiled, and peace roams the land. Also, despite the last few episodes making it out to be a heroic sacrifice for Izetta to fight, she is perfectly fine, and in a wheelchair. This is just like when Ikoma copped out in the finale as Kabaneri by also living after he was supposed to die. Also, the \"Yuri\" never goes full circle, meaning that all the hinting the series did was for naught. All's well that ends well, I guess. Either way, the script is dead, and I still don't think I've covered all that makes the plot suck. Why did Izetta's grandmother call Sophie a traitor? They explicitly showed that when Ozetta asked if hjer criticism of Sophie (interfering with humans) was the reason, she said no. How did Izetta get captured prior to episode 1? It's the plethora of questions like this that ruin the show, among other problems, and believe me, this series has a ton of holes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a mediocre cast. Izetta, while hot, adorkable, and determined, isn't that strong in terms of character quality. Yet, she's the best character here with a believable backstory. That backstory being:  She was saved by Ortfine when they were young, as the locals were about to kill her. Still, the \"yuri hinting\" was unnecessary. Ortfine is ok. She's just another strong willed leader pushed to her limits. Nothing too much too her. Most of the cast is also pretty forgettable and unexplored, like Bianka, Sieg, Hans, Berckmann, etc. Also, Berckmann's son, Ricelt fits this bill too, getting a mostly useless episode 7 to himself before he and the spy both die. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the villains that are pathetic. Otto is just a lame tyrant interested in witches, and there's nothing else to him. I struggle to find any reason for Elliot to be here given how useless he is. Then we have Sophie. She is a generic baddie introduced just to have an eventual final boss, in the same vain as Biba from Kabaneri (as if there weren't enough comparisons between the two shows already). After being betrayed, she wants revenge. In episode 6, she is presented as this mysterious figure. After that, she's just a vengeful maniac who cackles while doing evil things. That's it. Perfect representation of the series too: started interesting, but became a generic mess.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series looks good, despite the fact that the studio Aija-Do isn't well known. If this show were good, this might've put them on the map. Sure, the citizens of Elystadt have this generic light novel look to them, and many characters have those gaps in their mouths (meant to represent lips) way too big sometimes, but Izetta, and the styles for the Germanian characters look a lot more interesting and varied. The action looks nice too. Shout out to that section in the OP where Izetta is moving from bullet fire; that scene looks damn goodThey even went out of their way to not only get the looks of the weapons and cars right, but they even animated certain moments in the black and white box look reminiscent of that of the actual days of WWII. The CGI isn't that bad either despite being noticeable, and that's probably due to the environment present. Either way, this series is mostly pretty good to look at, magic included.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is done by a woman named Michiru, and this is her first time. All I have to say is: this is an interesting and ambitious way to kick off her career. Many of the vocals are in German, and in certain scenes, they fit perfectly, even if none of the songs are ones I would go out of my way to listen to. Still, its experimental and it works rather well. The OP, \"cross the line\" by AKINO with bless4, is quite a good OP, and a cool way to start off the show, especially the last 10 second of the OP. I'm even more impressed by the ED, \"Hikari Aru Basho e\" by May'n, who, if you don't know, was the voice for the singing done by Sheryl Nome in Macross F. Here, she delivers a powerful, emotional, and slow moving song that makes me wish this show as as gripping as its ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub isn't that bad, despite it being done by mostly new and unknown talent. Still, not all of them do a great job, like the voices for Izetta and Orfine. Not that any of them do bad, but honestly, it isn't a great dub either; it's merely an ok one.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLike many of you, the first half, while worrying at points, left me interested and somewhat intrigued, with the way episode 1 played out and the fact that the action was sorta fun. Still, it was never truly gripping. Then, the second half REALLY dropped the ball, and the viewers of the series collectively groaned as it fell into BS territory, leaving is with a poor second half. As you can imagine, I am one of those people left frustrated by the idiocy of the second half. Still, can't say that I outright hated the series at any point, or that I was all that infuriated. Still, that doesn't mean I wasn't left disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10    RAW SCORE: 4.87/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure we, the people of this community, will cynically remember this in the same way we did with Kabaneri only 6 months before. Only this time, even less of us cared in the first place. In the fires of the show's train wreck path, we can only grieve at what could've been. An interesting first half that lead into a stupid and generic second half that only served to make the first half's flaws more apparent as well as kill the series as a whole. It mostly felt like a love letter to World War II, but that's all this series was good for. In the end, it was all for naught, and I would be generally surprised if this series got a second season to finish the war entirely (albeit, that last bit can't happen since Otto killed himself...for...some reason), and that's not just due to the nature of the already idiotic finale. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Shuumatsu no Izetta is an anime from late last year. It was written by Yoshino Hiroyuki who did some work for Code Geass & Kuroshitsuji. He also wrote the anime adaptation for Dance in the Vampire Bund, which was pretty dreadful. The studio behind it was Ajia-Do, which I remember from Magic Tree House. So, with this staff the series could go either way. Let's find out how it does, shall we? \r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative is set in an alternative world at the beginning of World War II. Princess Fin\u00e9 of Elystadt is going to the allies to plead for help against the Germanian forces. Sheand her guards are being chased by Germanian soldiers when she spots a strange capsule on the train. She tries to open it but the Germanians find her before she can. She and her guards manage to escape, but she's taken prisoner after reaching the Britannian minister. She's taken aboard a plane with the mysterious capsule when it opens, revealing a  young red-haired girl who  Fin\u00e9 knows very well, Izetta. Izetta uses her magic to rescue Fin\u00e9 and their struggle against Germania begins. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some relatively minor story issues. First off, there are some contrivances. For example, there's a character who learns a secret because two higher ups in Elystadt's military are discussing it outside where anyone could overhear them. Surely, they are strategic masterminds. There's another case where a Germanian spy happens to make friends with a couple of supporting characters who he randomly encounters without knowing who they are and he makes friends with them in a very short time just to try and make a confrontation betwixt him and one of them more dramatic. It doesn't really work. The length is also a bit of an issue. There are some really good ideas that really could have used more time to be properly fleshed out. The secret of Elystadt's original White Witch, the death of Fin\u00e9's father very early on, the political gambits that Fin\u00e9 takes to try and save her nation. Frankly, there are enough ideas here that the series could have been twenty six episodes without ever feeling like it was dragging and the pacing wouldn't have had to be so rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, when you factor in the time constraints, the series is really well written. It has strong sources of tension that get explained as well as one could reasonably expect them to be in a twelve episode series. The series is good at touching on all the beats that it needs to, even when there are ones that could have benefited from greater extrapolation. I also appreciate that every plot point comes into play. There's a scene where a certain character dies for the sake of a state secret and it doesn't seem like it's going to be important but then it comes into play for two different plot points later. The way the series brings propaganda into play is superbly handled. It's certainly a series that keeps you engrossed with every episode ending in a way that makes you curious about what comes next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest strength of the series. Most of the supporting characters are well enough fleshed out to have verisimilitude. Which adds gravity to the situations. Sophie is a compelling character, particularly when you learn the truth behind her hatred of Elystadt. The best part of the characters, however, is Izetta & Fin\u00e9's relationship. It is expertly handled with a strong back story to illustrate how they got to the point they're at when we first see them in the series and with a good degree of development over the course of the series. They're both strongly fleshed out characters and having a very powerful dynamic only serves to highlight their best, and in a few cases worst, qualities thanks to the ways they interact with one another. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is largely excellent. The backgrounds are quite lovely and there's clearly a lot of work put into the various military gear, outfits and animation. The one complaint I have with the artwork is that some of the scenes cross the line into crass fan-service. Which can be distracting when they're trying to have a serious scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe entire vocal cast does well. There aren't any weak links in that regard. The strongest performances come from Akaneya Himika & Hayami Saori. The two of them really manage to sell the chemistry between their characters. Amamiya Sora is also really good in this. We can thank Michiru for the music. Which is excellent. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot in this series. This is one of those anime that's technically not shoujo-ai, but might as well have been. There are a lot of scenes where the artwork and atmosphere give the impression that  Fin\u00e9 and Izetta are going to start passionately snogging and then the scene will have to shift before the rating goes all the way up to Rx.  Fin\u00e9 cross dresses at one point, seemingly just so she can dance with Izetta at a party. There are also some indications that Bianca would be interested in turning their relationship into a poly-amorous one and there's a former journalist turned tutor who seems interested in the pair of them as well. There's a maid, Lotte, who seems interested in Izetta. I wonder if these two meet a lot of other women who are interested by coincidence or if Elystadt's royal family just hires a lot of lesbians by design. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta certainly has its narrative flaws. It's got its contrivances, it can be somewhat crass with its fan-service and it really would have benefited from a longer run. That being said, there's a lot to like about it. The tension is strong. The characters are nicely fleshed out. The dynamic between our leads is amazing. The artwork largely looks legitimately lovely.  The acting and music are strong. As a whole, I found it highly endearing and rather enjoyable. If you're interested in seeing a WW II fiction that factors in magical powers and escapes being classified as shoujo-ai by a minor technicality, this one is for you. For myself, I give it a very respectable 8/10. Next week I've actually got a short request to look at, it's going to be Sakamichi no Apollon.",

            "content": "Izetta: The Last Witch is a rather straightforward series, which as far as I can tell was released to a good deal of interest which then petered out. Personally, I am pretty big on historical and alternate historical settings and shows which utilize them, and I like magical girl shows, so throwing them together into a blender is a good way to get me interested in the show, and at twelve episodes, it wasn't a very big commitment.\r\nTaking place in an alternate World War II, Izetta is focused almost entirely on the small fictious country of Eylstadt, which borders the Germanian Empire (...Germany) and theRomulus Federation (Basically Italy), and so they end up getting war declared on them by the Germanians to be able to better move with their allies. Being a small nation, they would normally be pretty boned...were it not for the last known witch in the world, Izetta, who was being secretly smuggled into Germania to study her (and, well, for some more reasons), which throws a whole wrench into things when Princess Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (...We'll go with what everyone else calls her in the show, Fine) is trying to escape Germanian capture and happens upon her, then later is kept with her on the way to Germania...because, you see, Izetta and Fine have a past together, enough to awaken the witch!\\n\\n\r\nThe start of the series is ultimately pretty simple, albeit well enough put together, where Izetta's witchly powers (which, by the way, look really cool) are used to defend the kingdom against overwhelming odds...and also a lot of yuri, of course. While the plot of the series is pretty standard at the start, the Germanians trying to find out Izetta's powers and weaknesses against the main characters trying to work around things like her limited range and some spying plot is enough to carry it well enough. Around the halfway point, the plot begins to get a good deal complex, and I would actuall say the latter half of the series is more of what I was hoping for: More of a look at what happens when a magical girl style of magic meets with a real world war and technology scenario, political plays and spy work and so on.\\n\\n\r\nDipping into characters, the two main characters are the aforementioned Izetta and Fine. Izetta is not a particularly complex character, and while fun enough, she really could have used a bit more depth to her character and I don't think it would have been too hard to give it to her, such as some more reflection on, you know, all the stuff she is doing in WAR for Fine and so on. Fine is the more interesting of the two, a young ruler thrust into a difficult situation and forced to make tough choices, and while it isn't explored to a particularly deep degree, it does allow her some stronger character moments and is at least fairly interesting, being a stronger character driver than Izetta, although the show is a bit...light in this regard, and so I did not feel it was handled as well as it could.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I wish had changed with the show is that the show, rather obviously and something everyone would know who has been paying attention to this show's description on anime sites or promotional material, pretty obviously plays Izetta and Fine as having lesbian moments with each other. As someone who naturally enjoys yuri moments, this is appealing to me, but like many of the shows it doesn't turn into an actual romance, which is pretty disappointing. I felt it was especially disappointing here, as not only does the show play it pretty heavily, but I feel it would better tie together Izetta and Fine's characters, as how they see each other and what they will do for each other is an important part of the show, and frankly it feels totally ripe for a romantic upgrade from friends...in fact, Episode 11 has a perfect moment for this, and while the show may trick you for a moment to think it has happened, it ultimately cops out with an open ending instead of a solid one, and to me it ends up making it feel like this plot line does not resolve in a satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are more interesting to me. Berkman is not an especially memorable antagonist, but he is played in an interesting enough way and his very self-centric viewpoint ends up being in very interesting context and contrast to essentially every other character in the show, making him more standout and unique. Sieg is probably the most interesting character in the show, with earlier moments that might seem a bit confusing at the start end up slotting into place when backstory is revealed, and ultimately makes him feel like a more deep character than most of the others, although the last stuff he does feels kinda out of place. There's also more minor characters who come in and out and I won't go into all of them, but they tend to have some of the more interesting/different moments in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the plot and the characters are a bit basic overall, though, and I wish that the show focused more on the second half's styling, as one thing I wasn't super happy about with this show is that I feel the integration of technology and magic could have been better done. Izetta's gun-broom is AWESOME and I love the idea and I do like how her powers feel both analogous to various real life military units and cleverly tied in. But the politics of it, the fighting aside from Izetta, and so on is rather lacking, and would have been more interesting had the tone of the second half been spread more through it, as the tone is oddly two-faced to it even if it never really goes dark but instead more serious. While I did like the second half, the last episode left me very divided, especially in how it messes with how one might imagine the world, although I did like the villain of the end.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the animation and sound, the animation is actually really pretty, with Izetta popping off as vibrant and managing to make surprisingly realistic styled character designs soft and interesting, which helps make Izetta stand out more among them. Stuff like Izetta's riding of her gun-as-broom looks pretty cool and some of the scenes with the magic are quite lovely. One issue the show sometimes has is in some iffy CGI, most apparently in the last episode but at times seen before. This keeps it as a pretty and high end animation, but far from the best. Sound-wise the opening, Cross the Line, is REALLY standout and something I could listen to all the time. The sound effect of things like the planes and so on are very nice...but while the OP is good, the ED is forgettable, and it has some good music, but nothing which can be compared to the best around, so I leave it as good but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Izetta is not a show that will amaze you, and if you seek a show with a deep exploration of a premise, you'll probably end up ultimately disappointed. If you want something which can give a more minor level of depth, really nice animation, and enough character and plot to keep one interested until the end, you'll probably fine Izetta enjoyable. The second half helped prop it up for me, and there is enough here that I was ultimately left with a positive view of the series...but not a very long lasting one.",

            "content": "\"The fairy tale of the White Witch who appeared in modern times surely left something inside the hearts of people all over the world.\"\r\nI could only wish Izetta. I could only wish.\r\nIzetta at first seemed like a love letter to my anime taste. Beautiful girls flying on guns, flipping tanks and piercing planes with giant swords. What's not to love?\r\nA lot apparently.\r\n*Quick side note: I watched this as it was airing, if that changes anything.*\r\nStory: 4\r\nThis is the biggest downfall of Izetta. The first few episodes were absolutely fantastic for me. They set up the alternative World War II setting well, introduced the main cast,that looked unique at first glance, showcased some kick ass action and more. However, as soon as the battle started to calm down, I felt as if the writers didn't know what to do. The SOL moments were okay, but the \"battle of wits\" between people at the side of Elystadt and Germania was straight up butchered. Each action they took was a bit too predictable. I refuse to believe that Germanians had only one smart person on their side, that could figure Izetta out. I refuse to believe that a secret place hidden under a castle had a secret passage the whole time, that just randomly opened when someone needed to escape. Finally, I absolutely refuse to believe that Elystadt didn't expect to be crushed just because of some wins, even if important from a strategic point of view. This is not how war works. No matter if magic exists or not, there are always a ton of people that have to work on every detail, but here we have only a handful. Another big problem I had, was the introduction of the main threat way too late into the show. I am not a fan of that decision to say the very least. The story does end nicely, but there are still some stories that were not completed. The last few scenes showed that there could be a special episode or something like that coming up.\\n\r\nWith all the bad stuff out of the way, there were some cool ideas in there. There was a lot of creative directing in each action scene, groups of guerrillas attacking from the forest looked believable (for the short time that we saw them), the media propaganda was used nicely, the setting was explored well and the relations between witches and normal humans were really interesting. Unfortunately that can't fix all the problems I had with the rest of the shows story.\\n\r\nLong story short, the writing flopped way too fast, way too hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe most surprising thing about the show is how good it looks. The Ajia-Do studio wasn't well known before making Izetta, so that makes their achievement even more outstanding. This series looks gorgeous. Every character design, while a bit more moe than I expected, fits. Some scenes, especially the more SOL oriented ones, get a bit less care, and you can spot some mistakes, but dear Lord, the action scenes look fantastic. Every scene from each bigger battle is handled in a great way. I don't have many complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nIt's fine. Nothing spectacular, but it fits the specified time period and can get you hyped or put you in a pensive mood when it needs to. Bonus point for the opening, both visually and on the music side. I liked it, but music is of course subjective. The seiyuus do their job well too. Berckmann sounds like an asshole, Izetta sounds like a lost girl, and Fine sounds like a strong princess. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.5\\n\r\nAt a first glance the cast looks unique enough. A witch in a World War II setting? Sounds good. An all female  princess guard? Seems interesting. A smart Germanian to rival the princess? Looks promising.\\n\r\nUnfortunately most of them flopped like a bunch of old pancakes.\\n\r\nIzetta was ineresting to the very end, I thought she would get more development and new motivations other then \"I love you Fine-samaaaa\", but she wasn't a bad MC. Fine on the other hand was. She seemed to be a strong, independant princess, but she ended up only playing a minor role. Everything was done for her, she was mostly there just to represent her country. However, I have to mention that she risked her life on numerous occasions for the good of her country, so there's that. When it comes to the sides, they just... didn't work. They try to contrast characters or have a random romance pushed in, none of that made much sense and their development was rushed. Their actions didn't have important repercussions on themselves or anything else. I have to admit though, while they were all simple characters that were a bit dumb at times, I liked them. I couldn't say that I didn't. They had strong love for their duty and their homeland. They didn't do their job well enough though, thus I consider this score appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nFor the first few weeks, this was my favourite anime of the season. The action scenes were full of hype and the story looked promising. In the end I did like the characters, I was satisfied with the ending and I am glad that I watched it. I will remeber it fondly, because there were a lot of ideas that I personally liked. I haven't watched any World War II anime before, so I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but also incredibly sad by how much it disappointed me later. With all that, I can say that at the very least I cared about the characters and the story. I wanted to see how it will end and  ultimately, the positive feelings outweighed the negative ones, mostly thanks to the awesome action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nA low 6 at that. There were some moments where I wanted to pull my hair out because of how stupid I found some episodes, but there were also moments where I grinned like an idiot after all the awesome fights. This show wasn't good for me, but I still embraced what it gave me. Thank you Shuumatsu no Izetta for teaching me not to get hyped for a show after a few good episodes and showing me some of the most awesome scenes of the year. It was a bumpy ride, but I think I can reccomend this to someone who will think that this looks interesting, but be cautious. It may disappoint you much more then it disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this is purely my opinion, and I reccomend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "The year is 1939 and as always the Germanian Empire is wreaking havoc all over Europe. (What else would you do in 1939, especially if your country is called Germania?) But when they invade the small alpine nation of Liecht \u2012 I mean Eylstadt \u2012 the opposition has a plan: to defeat them with... magic. And by magic, I mean the titular witch Izetta, flying on rifles and destroying tanks by launching swords and so on.\r\nSo let me ask a question here: is anyone actually interested in Nazis as the antagonists? (Oh, I'm sorry, not Nazis. I mean imperial Germans who happen to yell \"SiegReich!\" and put up propaganda posters.) Actually, let me put it a bit differently: is anyone really interested in a black-and-white war story against a generic expansionist militaristic country? Because that's what we're getting here. Oh, don't get me wrong, it could be a lot worse. A few of the Germanian characters seem at least remotely human. But still, what I'm mostly seeing is working for the glory of the fatherland and the emperor (and furthering their own careers in the process, I guess).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is certainly fond of the idea. The protagonists and antagonists alike are full of selfless sacrifice for their respective countries. In a particularly baffling moment, the \"ruthless strategist\" character berates a Germanian defector for betraying his fatherland for his own survival. So let me get this straight. If he had done all the dodgy things he did for the fatherland, it would have been fine then? Really?\\n\\n\r\nOn the protagonists' side we have Fin\u00e9: the paragon of courage, duty, self-sacrifice, national pride and all the other alleged virtues. She is always willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. She never lets power get to her head or abuses it in any way. She holds speeches about how the nation is everything and you must fight to protect it, blah blah blah. And on top of all that she is a princess. Hmm, I sure wonder which side we are supposed to root for in this show: the perfect protagonist or the freakin' Nazis?\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Izetta does whatever she can to help her because she is her... friend? No, I'm sorry; nobody would believe that after the tearful eyes, holding hands, dancing, playing around in underwear and the moonlit flight. The show may not admit it, but Fin\u00e9 is her love interest. Izetta is thoroughly defined by her love and has no ambition or interests beyond it. I'm sure an actual personality would only get in the way of fanservice and fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a side character has a bit more personality, they get approximately five seconds of screentime. Good luck getting attached to these people. After all, we are on the clock here. This show is only 12 episodes long, and we need to set aside some time for maid antics, eating cake and comparing boob sizes. Establishing character motivation? Logical plot progression? World-building? Who needs these?\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, character motivations are a major problem here. For instance, the antagonistic witch has a great motive: a revenge plot where she takes revenge on a bunch of innocent bystanders. How compelling. And then there's this one character who defects after getting backstabbed for no clear reason... offscreen. What happened? Am I supposed to make a blind guess here? The show also ends with a hasty clipshow and various copouts. At that point, they probably thought it was already a trainwreck and couldn't be bothered.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some novelty value in a \"what if\" story where a witch is wrecking tanks and planes, but you should actually do something with the idea. It's not like it would have been hard to have a more engaging plot: what if their good intentions go overboard and their cult of personality goes to their heads? How about showing that the other countries also have their own problems instead of everything being the Germanians' fault? How about some internal conflict between the protagonists? Or make it a parody or something; there is more than enough material here.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, just got to beat those wacky Nazis for the hundredth time. Barely anyone has interesting motivation in this show. We don't even learn about the history behind the war. Why are the Germanians on a rampage? I mean, I get it, they are an expansionist militaristic country, but why did things turn out that way? Wars don't happen in a vacuum. Could we maybe get some historial context here? Some world-building? No? Is the war going on literally only because it's 1939?\\n\\n\r\nThe crowning moment of this show is when a Germanian officer enters into a rant to berate the character who prioritizes his own survival. Just listen:\\n\r\n\"I had brothers-in-arms, too. People who fought and died for what they loved! That \u2012 being able to do that \u2012 is what makes you human! He believed in you! He believed you were fighting for the fatherland!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation in the narrative is clearly on this guy's side. So you're talking about noble causes and the example you give is... waging expansionist war and slaughtering and oppressing countless innocent people for the glory of the fatherland? Whereas the real bad guys are the people defecting from this over-the-top evil empire when their life it at risk?\\n\\n\r\nGreat aesop there. You really nailed it.\\n\r\n*slow clap*",

            "content": "Izetta has succeeded in becoming my biggest disappointment this season, and possibly, even this year. It initially had everything it needed to succeed: an intriguing premise, serviceable animation, and promising characters. An alternate history exploration of WWII, with magical girls, would have been a fascinating twist to the historical war drama. However, it becomes painfully clear that Ajia-Do either had no idea what they were doing, or they simply did not think this whole thing through well enough.\r\nThe animation, while it does have its moments, ranges from relatively average and even sub-par in certain episodes. Some episodes have beautifully animated action sequences, which is somethingI can commend the show for. However, some other episodes will feature poorly done background characters, some even lacking facial features at its worst. The CGI used, mostly for military vehicles and Izetta\u2019s anti-material rifle/broomstick and weapons, is serviceable but nothing truly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is inexcusably sub-par. The whole narrative is built on a mountain of plot conveniences and deus ex machina. Characters and plot devices are shoe-horned into a scene to get things moving, and the plot contrivances are many. The war side of the story is often sidelined in favor of showing Fine and Izetta together. You wanted a show that featured a small country locked in a dance of death and political intrigue with world powers? WELL TOO BAD! You\u2019re either getting episodes of the girls hanging out instead, or episodes of Izetta single-handedly annihilating everything which, in turn, encourages the rest of the good guys to not do much of anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fault in this entire mess are the characters. The female leads, \\n\r\nIzetta and Fine, are two of the biggest Mary Sues I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime, coming close to such characters like Medaka Kurokami of Medaka Box. Izetta is a complete tool with no sense of agency. Fine is somehow a flawless master statesman out of the gate, in which we never see her struggle for most of the time. The villains are laughably cartoonish and two-dimensional. I don\u2019t really need to talk about the rest of the side-cast as they really weren\u2019t characters, and the anime didn\u2019t care about them much either (and don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cRoyal Guard\u201d). \\n\\n\r\nFor the vast majority of the anime, these characters, Fine and Izetta especially, all show far too little character development. They don\u2019t really encounter any plot development to precipitate any sort of meaningful change until the very end, and by then, it\u2019s too late for it to matter. You will have stopped caring about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship (and heavily implied romance) between Fine and Izetta, a major selling point of this series, is a painfully droll affair that just doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs in the anime all together. It really feels like it competes with the rest of the anime for attention, rather than it enhancing the narrative experience. It\u2019s almost as if this show can\u2019t make up its mind as to what it is, and what kind of experience it wants to tell.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most frustrating aspect, is that Ajia-Do forgets that this is an anime that is just as much about WAR as it is about a couple of lesbians. There is so much potential that is wasted to use the unique setting to both shape our protagonists and tell an interesting story. Izetta pretty much murders a small army by shows end, and she never seems affected by the horrific reality of war. You really don\u2019t see Fine really struggle with the reality of running a country at war as a young, new, and inexperienced head of state. Instead, they just keep plodding along as they are. Ajia-Do completely disregarded this psychological element that would have made the story much more compelling. \\n\\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE:  I cannot recommend this anime to anyone. It is a production that is too unfocused and fails to make use of the premise\u2019s incredible potential to tell an interesting story.\\n",

            "content": "I've always personally been a fan of good historical fantasies, so when I first caught wind of Izetta: The Last Witch, the premise and setting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. However, although I was initially quite impressed with this anime, that quickly began to change as the series went on...\r\nSo, for a quick overview of the story (while intentionally leaving the details ambiguous): You have Germania, a large country with vast military might, baring it's fangs at the small country of Elystadt. Just when things are seeming to take a turn for the worst in the conflict between these two countries, awitch (the last surviving one, no less) turns the tide of battle. The witch in question, Izetta, seems unmatched and wins a number of battles against the Germanians. Of course, the happy times must always come to an end, as Izetta meets her rival, the only one capable of matching her strength.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for my criticisms:\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe story is frankly unimaginative and predictable. The events in the story unfolded much as you'd expect from any run of the mill fantasy story. Even the plot twists are fairly anti-climactic and expected, in that, they serve to further the story in the most predictable and convenient way possible. This makes them obvious to foresee, especially since they're spun using pre-existing story elements (they're not just grabbed out of thin air, nor do they introduce anything new to the story besides some tidbits of exposition).\\n\\n\r\nWith that issue aside, what I disliked most about the story is that, the actual world and the vast majority of it's characters are not even expanded upon at all, apart from Izetta and Ortfine. There are plenty of side characters that, at first glance, seem to have a unique personality and their own agendas that you'd believe would contribute to the story in some major way. However, this is not the case. Many of the characters aren't utilized to their fullest, or really, not even any at all. For lack of a better word, they are wasted potential. World building in this anime is also pretty terrible. Essentially, since all the countries are placeholders for modern day countries (France, Germany, the United States), and since the major conflict in this series is basically just a fictional World War I,  I suppose that's supposed to suffice for any sort of explanation about the current state of world events in the time this series takes place, or of the different cultures and societies that dwell within these countries. The world is just very bland and colorless. Why go through the trouble of symbolizing real world countries when your not even going to bother giving these countries any kind of identity to distinguish themselves from one another?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to come right out and say it. The only real characters that receive any development are Ortfine and Izetta. Apart from that, pretty much all of the other characters are stagnant and have very little value or impact on the story. Even then, Ortine and Izetta are far from being complex characters, they're very two dimensional. Izetta is your average shy, subservient, and caring girl that lives only to make her best friend (Ortfine) happy, that might as well be her sole reason for existing. Ortfine is essentially just an embodiment of her own ideals, namely, justice and responsibility. While they do change somewhat throughout they story, the change is fairly subtle.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also multiple sub-plots that were brought up in the story but were never fully expanded upon or explained. For example, in one episode, the writers created what I can only describe as an \"implied romance\" between two characters that had just met. In this episode, these two characters had met for the first time, which is clearly not enough time to develop a romantic relationship, nor enough time to inspire any kind of feelings for said relationship in the audience. However, by the end of the episode, it's implied that they suddenly have deep feelings for one another. I won't spoil the rest, but their relationship ended on the same episode that it began. Pretty poor writing, perhaps? \\n\\n\r\nThere's also instances where it's implied that two characters know each other and may even share a history, yet it's never even touched upon or explained. Once again, I'm not sure why the writers even bothered to make the effort if they were just going to introduce the idea and leave it hanging.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Art, and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nDespite my problems with just about every other aspect of Izetta, I actually found the OST to be fairly enjoyable. It uses a few different orchestral scores which I found pleasurable, as they matched the setting and tone of the story quite well. The opening and endings songs were also done quite well. While I doubt I'd listen to them again, they were good enough for me not to skip through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was...well, it was good for the first handful of episodes, but slowly started to taper off in quality near the end (which can be seen in the abundance of off model shots during the last few episodes). The only parts in the anime where it's animation was better than average was during the few battle scenes, which actually made the fight scenes/battles fairly enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I found the art to be pretty good, for the most part. Some of the landscapes and nature scenes in this anime are quite gorgeous, although not extremely detailed. The character designs are good, although it would've been nice to see some more variation, especially in regard to the different country's representatives (since they all look the same it's difficult to tell their ethnicity).\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of this series only began to wane more and more with every episode that was released. Eventually to the point where watching the last few remaining episodes felt more like a drag than anything else. The only reason I continued to watch this was because, when I seriously questioned whether or not to drop the series, I was only a few episodes away from finishing it and couldn't find a reason to drop it after getting that far in. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I initially had high hopes for this anime, It's poor excuse for a story and lackluster characters completely ruined it for me. Perhaps if I could \"turn my brain off\", I could enjoy it for the mediocre historical fantasy that it is, but alas, I have yet to find that elusive off switch that I've heard so much about. Until then, I give Izetta: The Last Witch a score of 5/10. While I've personally seen much worse, I'd recommend that you skip this one, as botched series like this one are a dime a dozen.",

The art very very well in my eyes. Sure, there a bit obvious slumps here and there, but the fact that they had a different animator just for the tank mechanics goes to show how through they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe OP was decent, and the soundtrack itself was simply astounding.

Maybe some people were expecting it to be complicated enough for them not to understand and then consider this anime a pseudo-cult classic and proceed to give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, it's not perfect but it's definitely in the top 5%. Character art is consistent during 99% of the show, which is incredible. Some scenes definitely deserve a 10 though. Even the 3DCGI used is good and make some really good shots sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is spectacular, both the ending and the opening are also top tier. After the art, the sound was first thing that caught my attention already in the first few minutes of the pilot.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the pilot, it's one of the best pilots I've ever seen in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nIt was very enjoyable from the beginning to the end.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In 1940, the world is racked by its Second World War as the powerful military nation of Germania turns its attention towards the small country of Eylstadt. The crown Princess of Eylstadt, Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (Hayami Saori), does what she can to defend her meager country but in doing so falls into the hands into the hands of the Germanians. Through this series of events, Fin\u00e9 is reunited with her childhood friend Izetta (Akaneya Himika), the last remaining descendant of a family of witches. After escaping, Izetta pledges her magic and loyalty to Fin\u00e9 inorder to defend Eylstadt against the encroaching forces of Germania and to realize the ideals of her dear friend.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, Shuumatsu no Izetta revolves around the pair of Fin\u00e9 and Izetta with a light interest aimed at the show\u2019s fairly extensive supporting cast. Their friendship makes a lot of sense within the story. Fin\u00e9 came to Izetta\u2019s rescue as a child and showed her kindness when nobody else would. Though Izetta saw her magic as something that made her an outcast, Fin\u00e9 was enamored and enchanted by it and these things gave Izetta a great deal of admiration for her. To Fin\u00e9, Izetta represented somebody who saw her for who she was \u2013 someone who appreciated her outside of the context of her royalty. Within this give and take between the two characters, the groundwork for their personalities and their relationship is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nFin\u00e9 herself is strong-willed, idealistic, and fully embodies the kind of self-sacrifice and poise of a just ruler. She puts others first at every turn and most of her dialogue is spent agonizing over the fact that because she herself doesn\u2019t have the power to protect her country, that she must risk the well-being of her friend Izetta. Her conviction and care for her people is endearing but at the same time she presents such a paragon of idealism and devotion that she often comes off as kind of bland and cliche. Her unflinching loyalty to the people of Eylstadt consumes her to the point that the only significant characterization that remains is that she is a \u2018good person\u2019 and that she cares for Izetta. Though she has these issues, watching Fin\u00e9 struggle to come to terms with what needs to be done is a compelling part of her character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Fin\u00e9 can at times be a little uninteresting, Izetta, the titular witch of the show, features this quality to a more extensive degree. She adores Fin\u00e9, her personality is kind and innocent, and that\u2019s about it. Almost all of her time is spent staring starry-eyed at Fin\u00e9 and wanting to do her best and pay back the kindness she once received as a young girl. Izetta herself is somewhat symbolic of Fin\u00e9\u2019s penchant for sacrifice and how she empowers herself. In the same way that Fin\u00e9 laments having to send her soldiers off to fight the war, she must send Izetta out onto the battlefield if she wants to have any chance at victory. This conflict of interests is what drives their relationship but whereas Fin\u00e9 becomes more interesting because of it, Izetta remains the same, earnest character she always was. She becomes wrapped up in the characterization of a more interesting person and between her overwrought simplicity and total lack of development fails to become an engaging character in her own right.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the two central characters have their ups and downs, the rest of the cast is woefully uninteresting and impressively forgettable. Despite hosting a relatively large cast of characters, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find one that couldn\u2019t be entirely summarized by a one-word description. There\u2019s a maid, a pilot, a spy, a reporter, a captain of the imperial guard \u2013 the list goes on. They just have no depth or personality to them whatsoever and so when the focus of the show turns to them to be interesting or meaningful, their scenes fall utterly flat. The Germanians are about as typical of a depiction as you can render of Nazi-Germany and the motives of the antagonists present in the story either don\u2019t make much sense or don\u2019t matter in respect to the story at large.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta boasted a visual style that at times wavered in quality but was for the most part fairly consistent. There were lots of pastoral backgrounds, villages, and castles and so the setting itself looked pretty decent. The show as a whole often came off as major WWII fan-service in its depiction of trenches, tanks, infantry, and dogfights. If you came to the show seeking European wartime imagery than Shuumatsu no Izetta delivers. The explosions look fantastic and the general combat looks pretty good as well. There are a number of action scenes and battles throughout the show but they are far too infrequent in their appearance to carry it through some of its more mind-numbing friendship-building scenes. For what it\u2019s worth, Izetta flies around on an anti-tank rifle which is probably the most compelling image in the entire show and the most representative of the show\u2019s duel subject matter.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fan-service, Shuumatsu no Izetta features a surprising amount of it in the form of suggestive camera angles and unnecessary nudity scenes. While it doesn\u2019t appear too frequently, the early mid-section of the show becomes rather bogged down with this extraordinarily out of place content. Izetta just doesn\u2019t bill itself as the kind of show where this kind of sexualization feels necessary or meaningful. The first episode establishes political intrigue, war-centric imagery, magic, and drama. What follows is awkward and very tonally disruptive, going as far as to sexualize Izetta during combat scenes when she should be most appealing and engaging.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nThe central narrative of Shuumatsu no Izetta is pretty straightforward. The Germanian empire seeks to invade the land of Eylstadt and Fin\u00e9 does everything she can to stop them and save her country. With the appearance of Izetta and the powerful magic she wields, the rules of combat are fundamentally changed. Suddenly, this small, nearly insignificant country which lay at the mercy of its attackers stands a fighting chance as it rallies behind Fin\u00e9 and Izetta who strongly resembles a famous witch from the county\u2019s folklore. It\u2019s a promising start but the show ultimately fails to capitalize on what made its story initially appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe failing of Shuumatsu no Izetta\u2019s story is twofold. What starts out as a promising blend between WWII European wartime and magical fantasy quickly becomes dull and uneventful as the focus of the show turns away from politics and warfare and towards the antics of Izetta, Fin\u00e9, and the supporting cast. The scenes of battlefields, tanks, and planes are quickly forgotten in place of scenes about bathing, eating pie, and incessantly going on and on for episodes at a time about whether or not Izetta should fight on behalf of Eylstadt. In this respect, Shuumatsu no Izetta should have quite literally stuck to its guns. What made the show interesting was its take on warfare, magic, and the historical intrigue of its depiction.\\n\\n\r\nThis subject matter doesn\u2019t run the length of the entire show but it really bogs down the early episodes when it would be most important to be developing something meaningful. Moreover, hardly anything happens for long stretches of time. The battles are highly infrequent and the developments between Eylstadt and Germania happen very intermittently. One bit of praise I will give the show is its use of propaganda and information warfare which is only spotlighted upon for a brief time but which captures a bit of Shuumatsu no Izetta\u2019s earlier magic.\\n\\n\r\nThough the show eventually arrives at its ultimate conflict somewhere in its later episodes, the other thing that really hamstrings the story is just how many plot contrivances it has. Too frequently are characters sent out of their way simply for the sake of manifesting some crude development down the line. It feels unnatural and often involves the show busing itself with its supporting cast which leaves each of those respective scenes completely drained of meaning and personality. Simply put, the bulk of the show is spent investigating the relationship between Izetta and Fin\u00e9 and at other times attempting to spin some sort of story out of the show\u2019s other far less interesting characters. The story is predictable to a truly unfortunate degree and never really shakes its propensity for behaving in the most obvious of ways even as it winds down.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Shuumatsu no Izetta is actually quite an interesting one. Some of the tracks fit better than others but for the most part they attempt to distill the show\u2019s sense of magic and war through various orchestral styles, occult singing, and occasional rock influence. The music gives Shuumatsu no Izetta a kind of unique sound which works to its benefit however some tracks don\u2019t fit into the scenes as well as others which can leave them feeling out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]:\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to write-off Shuumatsu no Izetta as a case of wasted potential and it\u2019s certainly true that the show doesn\u2019t take its image of a rifle-riding, magical witch in World War II quite far enough but for the most part I feel the show hit upon most of what it could have done. Themes of helping yourself through others and self-sacrifice give the two central characters some thematic significance but also contribute to the show\u2019s more stereotypical elements.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 3\\n\\n\r\nI gave Shuumatsu no Izetta a 3 because it was uneventful, poorly written, and its cast was exceedingly under-characterized. Though its premise sported some potential\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf the premise of a witch flying around in a WWII setting, dodging gunfire and upending tanks sounds appealing then, despite its faults, Shuumatsu no Izetta will probably still deliver. Its depiction of war is a pretty entertaining one though it hardly apologizes for the show\u2019s other many faults. Outside of its specific premise appeal, the show doesn\u2019t have much going for it and probably isn\u2019t worth watching unless you\u2019re in love with the idea itself.",

These critics ramble on about realistic settings and how it becomes unbelievable when they are talking anime in a setting where magic exists.\r\nThe anime was made to entertain people, and I would say it does a great job and is more then capable of doing that. It is not a historical documentary so all these \"otaku\" cough* hating elitists, should take their dissection to history class and stop trying to rip apart an anime that is worth watching.\r\nSome people won't understand my ratings, since I rate 6+ passing, 5- failing anime. The mal, ratingsdon't make sense, especially the tags that go along with them, since mediocre is actually worse then decent. Think of it as school grades, 6+ / D+ - 5- / F-\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7-8: Depends on preference but, has a good drawing opening scene as soon as you start it, and is worth watching to the end. As an anime it is good or even very good. The anime is completed unlike 90% of the anime out there, and even has a good ending, that won't make all the watchers search (title) season 2 on google.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, compared to some of the anime this seaso- year, this is far better then a lot of them.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8: The setting takes place in a time and place similar to world war 2 where Germania is trying to conquer the world, it also makes it clear that magic does exist, and gradually introduces the necessary information. Story does a good job of placing moving forwards without overusing certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: Good, pretty much like every anime out there, Character art was pretty outstanding but background art, especially in certain scenes were very bland, and the bullets / scenes used to show projectiles were highlighted green which did make it somewhat odd. Discluding the background art, it would be  8.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Soundtracks are good, use of choir / vocals with ost rather then a bland music-only background. The sounds fit the time period and the magical elements of the anime fairly well. The op was alright, and the sounds complimented the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: Except a lack of background / past information on all the characters, they do have depth to them. Except the antagonists who are not not shown as much, so any information / motives they have are lost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Personally I enjoyed the anime, it is unique and does a good job of flowing. Unlike half the anime I've seen this year, which I've struggled to get past the first episode, then gradually begun to enjoy, the opening scene is quite memorable and draws you in. I would say this anime is entertaining to me personally, and I can see a lot of people enjoying this anime.",

            "content": "World War 2 themed anime is always entertaining to watch. Shuumatsu no Izetta however brings some unique addition to the whole war historical war theme; by adding elements of magic. It is actually rather cool to see a witch riding a huge tank-busting rifle instead of your typical broom into battle. This anime deliver good, enjoyable story till the end, but there are so many wasted potential that prevented it from being a true masterpiece.\r\nThe plot of Shuumatsu no Izetta is a linear one. A princess befriended a powerful witch that could help defend her home country in the midst of war. While everything seemsto be fine, there are bound to be obstacles and conflicts that makes it more interesting. Death and sacrifice is a concurrent theme, and the anime doesn't shy itself for letting several key characters dies. The anime ended in a rather strong and satisfying end, albeit rushed. My biggest complain about the anime is how its should split into 2 cours instead. Character development focused heavily on the two main characters and seems to ignore the other. This is a huge flaw since some of the side characters had a some important roles yet the viewers understanding of their past and motivation is almost null. It had so much potential alas, everything had to be crammed inside a single cour.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters that mostly took the spotlight are Princess Fine and Izetta. Princess Fine is your ideal image of a ruler, loved by the people and have a strong sense of responsibility to rule and defend the country well. Izetta meanwhile is a rather powerful witch that complement with Fine is a sense that she also want to make sure she become a great ruler, giving Fine her unyielding trust and power. There are no obvious romance that could be elaborated, but the friendship between those two is definitely stepping the boundary of Yuri; not that it is a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are decent for the most part. The action scene were executed really fluid and well. The portrayal of alternate europe during the World War 2 era is also very detailed; from uniform, to weapons and vehicles. Tanks, airplanes and ship are modelled using CGI, which is really common nowadays. There are little animation issues; while not the best this season to offer it is still a job well done from the studio. Sound is also decent enough. The OP gets the viewer pumped up while the ED leaves a melancholic feel as each episode end.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta is one of my top anime this season; which is saying something since this season overall is rather mediocre. It is good and enjoyable to watch, yet it had so much potential that could be exploited if the anime was mad longer instead. While not perfect, it does it job alright.",

            "content": "Ok, so this anime set in an alternate world war 2 scenario, is over, thought the Alternate History, war, military and historical did played their part here, I just can't make myself to like the Izetta X  Ortfin\u00e9 \"Fin\u00e9\" Fredericka von Eylstadt , cu'z  for the most part this anime has that lesbian love theme added into it, but nevertheless, this anime is ok, so here are my ratings:\r\nStroywise, it was set in an alternate world war 2 scene, where Germany becomes Germania, and France is Eylstadt, the UK is given it's Latin name \"Britannia\" , while Russia is......I don't know, while theUS is the United States of Atlantica. Of course the situation is suppose to be a World War 2, but some settings put it in a kind of battle to invade rather than a battle of nationalism. Good as it is, it was rather more on the relationship between the witch and the princess who serves as this damsel in distress that has to be saved by the latter where the entire story relies a lot on. So a good 7 is in order for this category.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise , I'd probably put it in a Decent 4, since there is only one fanservice around here and it's with Fine in her shower scene and some Sophie naked scene, most of it....well, don't expect to see panty flashes nor any of the quintessential Zettai Ryoki and some uncensored boob flash, trsust me even in Fine and Sophie's few minutes of their naked glory you won't see any. But anything else is all normal.\\n\\n\r\nSound, well since I have no comment about any of the seiyuu's who did who , nor do I give anything about the opening and closing theme, I just rate it a mediocre 5 and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, just seeing the yuri thing that involves with Izetta and Fine , really makes me wanna hate them, to the point, that I'd wish that Izetta loses to Sophie and Eylstadt, got owned by Germania, so , really, I have no hesitations of rating this category a pathetic 1. Also, seeing that Basler did a halfass of killing Berkman was also an added irritation for me, so another nail in the coffin for this category.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I'm giving it a good 7 for some of the war accuracy despite that it was set in an alternate world, also the battle scene were good to watch, in fact it was the battle scene and the confrontation between Rickret and Bianca also added to the enjoyability of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut, overall, I can't only rate this anime as a Decent 4, cu's the plot is all over the place, and it's reliance on the yuri of Fine and Izetta was just too cheesy and not seeing Izeeta  and Beckman dead was a disappointment in such way, Still, the anime is ok to be watched, and that's that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nsch\u00f6ne Ferien\\n\\n\\n\r\nlyckliga ferier och gott nytt \u00e5r\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shuumatsu no Izetta was a forcing of drama from beginning to end. It was as if the anime was playing with error and accuracy, with countless attempts. Those that either went very well, or went very wrong. I came across many times wondering why I continued to follow the anime, and I could never get a concrete answer. Maybe it was because I had a little curiosity to know if the relationship of both heroines was so \"non-superficial\" to the point of having so many cute and pseudo-romantic scenes, or if it was because I simply had a huge doubt of how anime Would endup leaving so many doubts and events to be clarified and developed in the penultimate and final episode.\\n\r\nI was very impressed by the fact that since episode 3, the anime made it so predictable and explicit that one of the heroines could die, entitled to an emphasis just before this possible scene, and simply to have left the logic and coherence aside To leave that same heroine alive for no reason at all.\\n\r\nSo the anime was interesting and dynamic only in the first three episodes only, then it was a huge adjection of apathetic and mild episodes, which suddenly happened something random to give an impaction to it so as not to let those who watched sleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was well formulated, but failed to give a dynamism to it, which unrolled all other negative factors to it. It was as if they wanted it to be resolved in the end, with no other development in the previous episodes, that could bring the end of everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is above average, is fluid and the movements of the characters are \"stable\", this until episode 3, 4, because from them the quality of the same I was constantly falling. But after 10, everything went back to normal. Not completely, but a good part stayed as it was in the beginning.\\n\r\nThe anime is visually pleasing. The graph of it was very beautiful and the scenarios were pleasant to see. The colors were vibrant and added a touch to the action scenes, which made everything even more beautiful. The action scenes that had plenty of it, but few of them were really good and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is very good. In fact, maybe the most relevant plus point of the entire anime is just that. What really made the action scenes of the entire anime at the very least fit to watch, was just the OST. It was very well elaborated and is easily noticeable in whatever the situation or event.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not charismatic, they are not loving and they are not hateful. It is very difficult to describe them, because they do not give you any feeling. There is no character you can think of as great or as lousy. They are a mixture of superficialism and neutrality, basically.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Izetta was simply something that makes you excited, but that can make you fade that same animation suddenly with the slowness and fortuitous that the anime presents after all that was really worth watching.",

            "content": "What a ride. \r\nI'll get right to answering the question \"is this worth my time?\" to which the conclusion is probably no. If you're picky about dodging animu cliches, CGDCT, magic interjected into WW2, or bumpy rides full of melodramatic potholes you're in for a huge disappointment. If you're one who lives for alternate European settings, beautiful scenery, and a majestic score that's epic beyond belief then this is the show for you.\r\nI absolutely love fantastical takes on real history, so I was overjoyed by Izetta's first few episodes; likewise, I adore David vs. Goliath narratives where a small, well-defended nation is pitted against asuperpower with little chance of success (Valkyria Chronicles anyone?). Here, the opening episodes gave me everything I wanted and more. Battle scenes are animated gloriously, tactics and strategies are realistic, and even the technology of IRL WW2-era Germany is presented with razor precision. There were even several closeups of Jericho trumpets on JU 87s! \\n\\n\r\nBy the midpoint though, my \"anime pitfall\" senses were on high alert. It's like I could sense that something was going to trash Izetta and make me force myself through some bullshit or other just for more battle scenes. It came about two-thirds of the way through and I completely lost interest. But then I thought, \"well, I might as well read the wiki synopsis to see if the ending is going to suck balls.\" I'm glad I did, for certain. Episodes 9-11 were a total drag to get through, but I can confirm that the ending is satisfactory and happy. It didn't disappoint me, although it should have been better.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I'd just admit defeat and abandon ship, but the great setting and meticulous worldbuilding drew me back in. Still, there's absolutely melodrama, and it's even worse because it was unneeded. I just finished watching Youjo Senki, and that's a series which consistently dodged any setbacks and told a straightforward tale from beginning to end; Izetta would have benefited greatly from a linear progression. It didn't *need* to rock back and forth, and it would have been far superior just to go from A to B without stopping by \"fuck\" and \"off.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this is a sensationally-produced anime. Above all, the music and visual artistry are divine and make it well worth trudging through the trenches just to bear witness to all it has to offer. Yes, it should have been better. Yes, it's not worth watching unless you're 100% onboard with the setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet still, it's a compelling journey.",

            "content": "Izetta the Last Witch: An Exercise in Disappointment\r\nIzetta started off as one of the most promising shows of the season. Unfortunately, it suffered a gradual downward spiral that left it the biggest disappointments of the season. \r\nThe plot takes a look at a fictionalized version of WWII, with not!Germany planning to invade not!Liechtenstein. However, the Princes of not!Liechtenstein finds Izetta, her childhood friend and the witch mentioned in the title, and convinces her to use her magic to help defend not!Liechtenstein, despite being forbidden as a witch to use her powers to meddle in human affairs. Izetta agrees, and starts kicking not!German butt, but complicationsarise, because of course they do. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a pretty standard-issue \"underdog country vs. evil expansionistic empire\" and \"magical girl genre deconstruction\" fare. The finale initially carries some satisfaction and poetry, but the epilogue's final moments rob the moment of any poignancy, almost like the creators were scared to let the story conclude on too sad a note. Also, the ship-teasing between Fin\u00e9 and Izetta got pretty aggravating, especially after Yuri!!! On Ice had the balls to carry through with it. Add in an out-of-nowhere late season twist and a clumsy \"magic equals nukes\" through line, and you get an ultimately \"meh\" plot. The military aspect of the show was, I think, unfortunately left to the wayside after the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite lovely, even bordering on Ghibli quality at times, especially in the action scenes, and character design was quite good. No real complaints here. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects were quite good, there was something very satisfying about the sound of medieval swords pounding not!panzers. Music was quite lovely also, kudos to the composer. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were also \"meh.\" Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional, with only a couple showing shades of moral ambiguity or emotional nuance. Izetta herself was a bore, being a personification of the \"senpai noticed me!\" meme. Fin\u00e9 showed some depth, especially in her voice acting, but as a whole, the characters were one-note: the heroes are mostly all goody-goods, the villains are mostly mustache-twirling, and there's precious little grey between all the black and white. \\n\\n\r\nNow that said, the show picks up when you get to the action scenes, were are all uniformly creative and exciting. Seeing a teenaged girl fly around on an anti-tank rifle (and fire it!) and toss tanks into the air with magic is not to be missed. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Izetta made promises it ultimately didn't keep, but it's not a total waste. One just can't help but wish things could have turned out better.",

            "content": "Shuumatsu no Izetta is a pretty anime with an even prettier main character. Izetta is the last witch in a tiny little kingdom during an alternate WWII, helping her princess fight the invading Germanian forces.\r\nThe episodes are rather fast paced, and there isn't much explanations, especially in the first 2-3 episodes. However the character development is quite good and gives even the background characters some backstory and you want to root for them, tragic as it may be. (I'm looking at you, Jonas.) There is a-lot of light-hearted moments during the anime that are for a nice lap, and the character of the Archduchess Fineis cute in her mannerisms, despite how 'stately' she has to be. Episodes often end in cliff-hanger moments which make me want to goto the next episode almost immediately. So I considered that as a huge plus. However towards the ending the timeframe of the war gets skewed alot and could be a bit better and there is a bit of a Deus Ex Machina, although it was well planned/made to fit into the story itself.  \\n\\n\r\nI did throughly enjoy the concept of magic and how it's made/played out. However a latter element does seem to have an overpowered enemy, but the final battle should've been played out a decent bit more. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very loveable, especially the Archduchess and Izetta (my favorite.) They're also rather well endowed, or most of them, anyways. However my favourite part of the cast is one of the background characters who I was constantly rooting for. The enemy's side had a lot of confusing and contradicting stories at first, but were mostly explained later. There are/were still some unresolved/confusing elements at the end of the anime I had questions about on the technicality of it. I like the dialogue at times too and the concept of the truth behind fairy tails was a nice way of advancing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was good, and well made, especially the intro and I loved it. Ending credits could use some better music however. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I found that the anime was very enjoyable and had a good mix of magic and realism, and if you ignore the glaring issues with plot and episode/time frame speed, it was a very nice watch with a cute end. Overall the ending could use more work, but was still nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 anime, and I might rewatch it sometime, or at least some episodes from it.",

            "content": "This anime is an underrated gem that I hope will receive better ratings as time goes on. This has been an anime I can really enjoy.\r\n///\r\nStory Score \u2013 8\r\nThe story is relatively straightforward. Fin\u00e9 is the only daughter to the Archduke of Elystadt and Izetta is the titular last witch known to walk the earth. Izetta and Fin\u00e9 are childhood friends who after a series of events reencounter each other after being separated for so long. Izetta wishes to do what she can to protect Fin\u00e9\u2019s country of Elystadt from the Germanian invasion while Fin\u00e9 does what she can to help Izetta anyway she can,so Izetta can survive. The chemistry and bond these two share are a driving force of this show, and it is definitely one of the strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, we also get to see some of the behind the scenes things in wars, such as the political, military strategy, and propaganda side. As in the real world, politics in this story can make things quite difficult. I also appreciated that they utilize actual strategy in this story rather than simply have Izetta fight the enemy head on every time. In regards to the propaganda side, it sort of reminded me of \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger,\u201d except Izetta actually showed off her powers against the real enemy rather than trying to sell bonds.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime makes pretty good use of foreshadowing, specifically visual foreshadowing. A little more than I think some people might give it credit for. These are just some instances, so I\u2019m sure there are plenty more.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first episode, we see what appears to be magical energy flowing towards Izetta during the flashback scene and when she is awakening. In episodes two and three, it establishes that there appear to not only be limits to Izetta\u2019s powers but fluctuations to it as well. Those signs firmly foreshadow the revelation Izetta\u2019s power doesn\u2019t come from within but from the magical energy in ley lines outside. As Izetta explains in the fourth episode, she can only tap into her magical abilities if there are ley lines, but if there aren\u2019t any, she is more or less a normal human.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen some people complain about the use of spies in this story, but I think some people don\u2019t realize that the spies were foreshadowed from the very first sequence. In the first episode, the Germanains were aware of Fin\u00e9 being on the train. That alone foreshadows there were most likely spies in Elystadt. Additionally, one of the smug Germanain officers who holds a gun to Fin\u00e9\u2019s head in the first episode, brags about the Germanian spy network. He obviously wasn\u2019t lying about it. Since Germania was planning on invading multiple nations, I would be surprised if Germania sent out spies into every country as sleeper agents. It would explain why they were effective in taking care of some of them. Not to mention, making use of spies has been a valid tactic that countries have used for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nOne type of foreshadowing that might go into spoiler territory would be one that foreshadows a certain character\u2019s fate. During battle, one character sees one of his fellow soldiers die in some manner and he eventually suffers the same fate. It is due to that sneak foreshadowing that I think certain other characters fates for the end of the series have been foreshadowed as well, and we might look back on certain scenes with a \u2018harsher in hindsight\u2019 look.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a very noticeable foreshadowing regarding the ending of Izetta.  I won't go into details about it, but I think in hindsight, it visually gave us a pretty decent explanation for why certain things ended the way it did.  It is one of those endings when you look back on it, it seems much better than you initially thought.  Izetta really does a much better job with visual foreshadowing than some people give the series credit for.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few instances where there is some fanservice that seem a little out of place. While I don\u2019t really have an issue with it, I can understand why some people do. However, the fanservice scenes are usually pretty tame or relatively short. At worse they are a minor annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, due to this being a twelve episode series, I feel like it prevented Izetta from being able to fully explore its potential.  At the end of Episode 8, it set things up for at least two major plotlines that would have been awesome to explore.  While one of those plotlines were utilized and the other was regulated to the side, I think it would have been far better for the series to have had the episodes to fully utilize both those plotlines.  Additionally, I think we could have had more episodes of Izetta fighting various Germanian units if we had more time.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I think this is an unfortunate case of the current climate of the anime industry.  It is likely the anime company wouldn't have been able to get more episodes than 12, and they had to decide from the start to end it with just one cour.  They did a great job with what they had, but it would have been even better if they could have gotten more.\\n\\n\r\n///\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Score \u2013 8\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of this anime are Izetta and Fin\u00e9. These two prove in the first two episodes alone that they are capable, likable, and strong female protagonists that you want to root for. They maintain that likability throughout the series. The chemistry between the two is wonderful.  The two characters consistently carry the series throughout the twelve episode run.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, Fin\u00e9 takes the center stage, and she establishes herself as being pretty intelligent. During the train sequence, she doesn\u2019t solely focus on her bodyguards to protect her nor is she one of those whiny royal brats who says she doesn\u2019t need help. Instead, she works with her bodyguards, and she ultimately figures out how they initially escape. Fin\u00e9 also proves to be quite political and understands her place as a princess. She is ready and willing to put everything on the table to protect her people, including offering herself for a political marriage.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta proves herself to be a wonderful protagonist to root for as well. Her loyalty towards Fin\u00e9 is understandable considering what Fin\u00e9 did for Izetta as a child. Izetta\u2019s powers as mentioned before are great, but she is not invincible. What I like is that while Izetta is loyal to Fin\u00e9 and Fin\u00e9 clearly has the stronger personality of the two, Izetta isn\u2019t completely dependent on her either. Izetta is capable of making her own decisions.\\n\\n\r\nDecisions that Fin\u00e9 and Izetta make during the series have been perfectly inline for their characters. For example, when Fin\u00e9 originally doesn\u2019t want Izetta to help her fight Germania, I realized this was fitting for the characterization the first episode established. Fin\u00e9 proved to have a political mind and tries to think in the long term, such as making sure there were possible heirs for the throne before offering herself up for a political marriage. She understood that if Izetta used her power it would expose her existence to the world and not just Germania and Elystadt. Getting involved could very well put a target on the back of Izetta\u2019s head both during and after the war. After Izetta makes her decision, Fin\u00e9 respects the decision and does her best to help Izetta anyway she can.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta actually does go through some character development in the series. It is subtle, but it is there. Izetta has major self-worth issues at the beginning of the series, but they seem to lessen a little as it goes on. She also proves to be quite assertive at time as well. Although, I\u2019m sure it is mostly due to her feeling useful. Izetta was also somewhat nervous when talking to people or being introduced to new people. However, she does seem slightly more comfortable around people, and she is less nervous talking to new people as shown in Episode Seven.  She also has a major moment in Episode Eleven that is very satisfying, but I won't go into details about because it'd be too spoilery.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I love the bond between Izetta and Fin\u00e9. I consider it a highlight of the series. Personally, with all the moments they share, I hope they become romantically involved. It seems like they should, and it feels like it too. They have so much chemistry that I've been a shipper for these two from the very start.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to supporting characters, certain criticisms about the supporting characters lacking development does have some merit. We are introduced to a decent number of supporting characters in the first few episodes. Their personalities do receive some characterization, but we don\u2019t learn too much about them. They seem likable, but they lack the development or characterization that makes me want to care about them like I care about Izetta or Fin\u00e9. While I do wish they developed the supporting cast more, I suppose having strong main characters that don\u2019t aren\u2019t overshadowed by others is fine with me. However, there are still some standouts for the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes, I found Seig to be the most interesting supporting character because of his character development, his logical thinking, and his willingness to engage in morally questionable activity. While he did do a major slip up in Episode 5, I believe he did make up for it rather quickly. Additionally, the fact he showed some regret for his morally questionable activity does show some dimension to the character.  The later episodes develop his character further, and we can really see the similarities and contrasts between him and Berkman.\\n\\n\r\nOf the antagonists, Berkman does prove to be relatively interesting. Rather than having people say he is intelligent, he proves to be intelligent. Through logic and noticing clues, he is capable of piecing together a fair number of things, namely as a potential weakness in Izetta\u2019s power. I do appreciate having an antagonist who is intelligent, and there are valid reasons for him to come to his conclusions. Similar to Seig, he does extremely morally questionable things, but unlike Seig, he seems to enjoy them a little.  We also learn that while Seig and him are very similar, there are more than a few differences between them due to who they truly are in the inside.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes Seven and Eight do seem to partly address the issues regarding a lack of development in the supporting cast. During the seventh episode, we get introduced to a new supporting character Gromon, who quickly establishes himself as a character that fans can like. The fact he seems like a shipper for Izetta and Fin\u00e9 helps. Despite being a one episode wonder, he proves to be far more useful to Izetta than a majority of the other characters have been over the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode Seven, there is a scene with Bassler and Rickert playing poker with other Germanian soldiers. Personally, I like that we got a scene with characters on the antagonist side doing something other than planning and preparing for war related activities. It shows some humanization on the Germanians similar to how we\u2019ve seen characters on the protagonist side having downtime. It also further establishes the Germanians aren\u2019t simply evil. They can have similarities to the protagonists, but they happen to be on opposite sides.\\n\\n\r\nThe eighth episode provides us with a day in the limelight for a few supporting characters as well with them taking more of the center stage while Izetta and Fin\u00e9 are more on the side. I liked how the plot can progress without their direct involvement or in some cases the plot progressed because of their earlier actions. Anyway, I found that episode enjoyable because it felt like things that have been building up are paying off.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the concluding episodes of the series, we get to see a few other characters make major contributions to the plot as well and/or interact more with the main characters. I'm glad we got to see some more development and fleshing out for the supporting characters toward the end.  However, I think it would have been done much better if we had more episodes to allow them to be fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\n///\\n\\n\r\nArt Score \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found the art style to be very appealing back from the promotional artwork and the previews. The series proper doesn\u2019t disappoint. The opening and ending themes have great artwork. The characters generally are well designed and appealing. They do a fine job animating the environment and the action sequences.  The final battle was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there have been some potential weaknesses in the artwork, I do believe that will be taken care of in the Blu-ray. That seems to be the general practice to improve the artwork in the Blu-ray release of anime.\\n\\n\r\n///\\n\\n\r\nSound Score \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the opening, ending, and OST are great. They are very fitting for the scenes and atmosphere of the series. The voice acting for the original Japanese cast along with the English dub produced by Funimation have been fitting for their voices. While the Japanese version seems to have better voice acting, I think the English voice actors do a stellar job. Additionally, I\u2019ve noticed some slight script alterations between the Japanese version and the English dub, and I actually think the localization team did a good job changing certain things to make them sound better.\\n\\n\r\n///\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Score \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nDuring the series run, I\u2019ve watched every episode in both English sub and English dub format shortly after it has become available.  I remember how I would always look forward to the next episode every Saturday.  I was saddened when the show came to an end, but I'm glad it had a relatively conclusive ending.  I hope others will enjoy it as well. As I stated, I think this series is underrated, and I hope there will be some vindication overtime.",

It's a mix of \"medieval\" sounding tones with clavicenbalus and strings and more rock tones for the action sequences all glued together by the everpresent and epic sounding choir; you can even hear some electronic vibes in the last episode.\\n\r\nSound design is spot on and even the magic chime (which had the highest chance of becoming annoying) was managed really good.\\n\r\nAs for VAs there isn't anything to really complain about even if Fine's voice, while it fit the character, didn't really perform well in private emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are really well done, you can feel the speed and the impacts even whith something as silly as a girl riding a cannon. Even if most of the vehicles and \"massive\" objects are cg you can feel the weight of a tank being hurled at the sky, which is a feat in of itself.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I enjoyed Izetta, her massive boobs didn't disrupted the flow of the story as much as I thought they would and while it didn't turn out to be the strictly politics/military show I thought it would be, I realized that story is not about the war or the magic, but it's about Fine and Izetta and their struggles between being lovers and having the fate of a country in their hands.\\n\\n\r\nQuote of the show:\\n\r\n\"If my life could grant Fine's wish, then I think I would go to the stake with a smile\".\\n\\n",

First of all if you are a person that loves history and fantasy this is a great anime for you. The anime follows an original plot inspired by WW-WW2. The plot is really interesting and also it's really hard to guess what it will follow. \r\nAs about the characters they were all unique kept on their roles until the very end, the voice actors and the director did a really good job in the anime in general. \r\nThe art was impressiveas well, the background were fitted exactly as the time of reference of the anime (which it was around to 1930-1945), the effects were really nice!\\n\\n\r\nPretty much i enjoyed watching this anime, from the first episodes it teared me up a little bit and also motivated me to hold on until the very end, i didn't got bored at all since the type of it fits to my standards. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime to people who dislike history and politics. You aint like this stuff but i would introduce it to my close friends so i can hear their opinion! \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! I tried to make it as short as possible, my overall rating of this anime is 9 and no i wouldn't rewatch it but i'll remember it with all my heart!\\n\\n\r\nIzetta you rock baby <3\\n",

It is hard to tell which characters are on which sides.\r\n\u2022 Character arcs: Friendship and magic are the main themes of the anime (sounds like My Little Pony).\r\n\u2022 Relationships: This anime shows the origins behind the Archduchess and Izetta's friendship and how they met\r\n\u2022 Design (setting): This takes place in Europe during World War II. There is some historical accuracy references involved in the storyline.  This includes Axis vs. Allies.  In the anime, there is English, Japanese and European translation of the names of the anime and the episodes. Itis possible (and seen in the anime) that there are some undercover/double agents in enemy territories. Plus, there is more behind the magic and legend of the White Witch. There are some places in the world where her magic is unavailable for use (kind of like cell phone service and the subways).  Romance between the White Witch and the Prince of Elystadt. There are also cool fighting scenes when Izetta teams up with the Elystadt's army and magic comes to life when magic is being implemented.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n\u2022 Izetta: She is the last White Witch. She has red hair and uses a machine gun as her broom. Her ancestor was persecuted and killed due to her status. Centuries later, she is seen as a kind witch that is protecting the allies from Germania's tyranny. She has a strong bond with the Archduchess and is very caring and protective of her and her kingdom.\\n\r\n\u2022 Fine: Archduchess (Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt). She is a kind, strong woman who cares about the people of her Kingdom. She became the ruler after her father's death. Fine is hesitant to send Izetta out to battle due to safety concerns. Plus, she loves going to her local bakery to get her favourites. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n\u2022 Pros: One of my favourite animes to watch. Seeing a legendary witch flying on an weapon instead of a broom is pretty cool. The cliff hangers keep you up on your feet. Plus, seeing the action of war and military teaming up with magic and mystery is pretty cool. It explains the legend of the White Witch centuries ago.\\n\r\n\u2022 Theme song: Instrumental is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nAnime comparisons: Another similar show to this is Brave Witches (Which I will be reviewing it soon).  Currently praying for a crossover.",

            "content": "Izetta the Last Witch is set in an alternate World War II timeline where the princess of Eylstadt, Fine, finds herself having to rely on the magical powers of close friend and witch, Izetta, against the imperialistic nation of Germania.\r\nThere is quite a bit of this series that is a bit of a mixed bag, but I'll tackle what issues the show has later as I will instead concentrate on the positives to the series. The show's strongest strength is that it does a great job at establishing the bond between Fine and Izetta. The series storyline explores our two heroines having a past relationshipwith one another shown through several flashbacks throughout the series and this bond also gets explored often throughout the series as Izetta feels obligated to protect Fine and her kingdom from the princess accepting her despite her origins as a witch, while Fine shows hesitance at points of exploiting her friend's powers to protect her home country.\\n\\n\r\nAlso for the most part, the series does a solid job with exploring the rules of magic and witches in the world of Izetta. While Izetta's magic allows her to dominate over enemy armies, there are limitations and conditions in which she can apply her powers which prevents her from being too insurmountable a threat. As a result, there are points in the series where Fine and the Eylstadt armies have to be creative in exploiting Izetta's reputation as a witch to drive off Germania threats and even have to silence Germanian spies that attempt to learn Izetta's weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of magic makes for one of the animated highlights of the series as Izetta makes use of a heavy assault rifle to fly in the air and can levitate various objects like tanks, missiles, and lances for both attacking and to fend off enemy attacks. Action scenes have fluid movement on regular display throughout the series. Settings are animated faithfully to depict World War II era Europe with the fictional nations of the series being based off actual nations and governments who were in power during the period, and character designs are nice on the eyes despite not being as detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside praises, Izetta's quality does take a hit in its second half and a good chunk of this has to do with the series attempting to cram in too much for its 12-episode run. The series makes efforts to expand its story to introduce additional elements such as a story concerning Izetta's predecessor to her title of the White Witch, trying to flesh out some among the Germanian Empire, and weaving in a third side in the form of Izetta's equivalent of the USA. Unfortunately, the series lacks the time to be able to properly flesh out or integrate these additional story elements into the series which leads to said elements being greatly simplified in their storytelling purpose or getting little relevance within the series as a whole. The attempts at storyline expansion don't hurt the series too significantly as Izetta's storyline does escalate in the second half when the Germanians learn how to counteract Izetta's powers, leading to some effective escalation of drama. But it still cripples the anime's storytelling and prevents it from being one of the year's best quality titles that it showed glimmers of in its first half, and the rather anticlimactic ending does not help matters either.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not too sore from Izetta's second half taking a hit in quality, its attempts to try being bigger than what it could be in only 12 episodes crippled a good deal of the storytelling potential that the first half of it demonstrated. The use of magic in the series and the bond between Fine and Izetta contribute to the show's greatest strengths. But it could have been one of 2016's best anime titles if it learned to scale back a bit on the scope of its story.",

            "content": "Izetta the last witch suffers from the dreaded 6/10 overall rating that puts off a lot of viewers from giving certain anime a try. It's, of course, unfair to take a glance at this rating and assume everyone thinks the same about it and in fact, if you take the time to look through Izetta's statistics you'll find a very different tale. Statistics, I find, are a much better fit to gauge if something will be worth pursuing or not. An equal amount of people gave this story an 8 as others gave it a 6, and most people gave it a 7. That meansthis story still has merit and is worth it as the likelihood of enjoying it just went up. \\n\\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I'll begin to convince you why you should try this anime out, even with the hundreds of other anime to dive into.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta is a story of war. It is based heavily on world war 2 with the added bonus of magic involved. All places within the story are replaced with fictional versions, but it's not hard to make comparisons considering the war takes place in the same time as world war 2. A small country is about to be invaded by the superpower in this war and that's where our story starts. It is up to two characters, a princess and a witch, to help win this war and bring the land into peace, but the existence of witches being revealed to the world complicates this quickly. It becomes a question if a witch in a human war is even a good thing, especially when provided to the /wrong/ humans...\\n\\n\r\nEven though this story is about this conflict, it is also very much about the two main characters and their deep love for each other. Izetta will do anything for Fin\u00e9, including taking on a whole fleet on her own, while Fin\u00e9 wishes she could prevent Izetta from fighting and make this world to be what Izetta hopes it could one day be. Their motivations are for the country and each other. This relationship is heavy enough to be considered by anyone who wishes to be romantic in nature. \\n\\n\r\nEven though Izetta has the advantage of being the only witch in this fight, she isn't op. There are limits to her powers that get explained a few episodes into the show that make the fights more impactful. Sometimes she's lucky and these limits won't bother her, but other times they can be a problem. A big plot point is our side trying to find ways to hide this limitation from the outside world while the enemy side does what it can to find her weakness. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the side characters are, in my opinion at least, likeable. I say this on both sides of the war. A few of them even die, which at least makes this war feel like a war, but I'll admit that at the end they do pull a reveal that two characters thought to be dead are actually still alive. It can be forgiven though; it's clear they wanted a more hopeful ending. The war also gets sped up in the end, but we all know how world war 2 ended without the magic, so it's not too bad. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more technical side, I really liked the voice for the princess, Fin\u00e9. She's voiced by Saori Hayami, a well-liked and used voice actress, so it's not too surprising to feel this way. If you like her voice, that's another point in watching the show. Izetta's voice was appropriately cute also.\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly wrong with the art or music. Everything looked and sounded decent to me. This story has a lot of action scenes and they looked good, especially when Izetta's throwing whole tanks and bombs with her magic. The softer/romantic scenes were really nice to look at too. Overall, I found nothing to complain about. YMMV.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good show, definitely deserves a little more love and a chance at grabbing you. Personally, it certainly grabbed me, enough to make this review to convince others to give it a try. If you like war stories, magic, lesbians or just want to enjoy a quick little tale about love and sacrifice, I say give it a go.",

They made a large effort into accuracy for the most part. German tanks, uniforms, aircraft were all accurate for the time. They even implemented the Graf Spee!\r\nThats where the enjoyment ends for me... Character was terrible to say the least. It seemed like a overwhelming amount of plot armor and an overpowered main character kept the protagonists aliveagainst the overwhelming firepower of the Third Reich.\\n\\n\r\nArt and accuracy good.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMost anime have an English-translated title. Makes it easier for an American like me to better understand an anime and what it will potentially be about from the get-go.\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta\u2019s English title is Izetta: The Last Witch. More than likely, this review will be the last time I ever think about \u2013 let alone write about \u2013 this show.\r\nSTORY\r\nAs the Germanian Empire threatens to encroach its neighboring lands, Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (or Fin\u00e9 as she will be called from here on out), a princess of the peaceful kingdom of Eylstadt, seeks to stoptheir terrible onslaught. In her charge, she is abducted. But, fortunately for her, her childhood friend Izetta, who also happens to be a magic-using witch, saves her from her predicament. From there, Izetta (the anime) starts its climb.Izetta, Die Letzte Hexe\\n\\n\r\nAnd its early climbing is promising thanks to a solid start. The prospect of feuding countries and the politics therein. Mixing the magical elements with realistic warfare. A caring relationship between witch and princess. It was all ready, constructed as a tower that the anime scaled, reached the top, and stood upon. Leaping forth to reach some metaphorical strong footing.\\n\\n\r\nBut it never made it, falling far and hard and without grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s grand level of incompetent writing beyond the first four episodes causes it to slip multiple times during its running start. For whatever reason, the anime sees fit to include an alarming number of contrived events that prevent the narrative from maintaining sound structure. A secret conversation held out in the open. Murdering a soldier in a forest. An old man working for Germania. The second half of the red stone plot device conveniently appears.\\n\\n\r\nOften, these scenes occur with an odd amount of isolation. Almost as if the anime formed its plot without care and was practically forced to make certain events happen in such nonsensical ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe best, most bizarre example is at the ballroom dance. Izetta and Fin\u00e9 separate themselves from the festivities, only to have Berckmann bring the doll-like corpse of the evil witch Sophie with him so that she could steal some of Izetta\u2019s blood with a forceful kiss. It\u2019s unnecessarily contrived and random, and it doesn\u2019t help that the others don\u2019t seem to make a fuss afterwards about what was clearly an insane happening.\\n\\n\r\nThat scene also demonstrates one of the other extreme shortcomings of Izetta: sexual content. The anime constantlyseems to think that it needs an ecchi scene here or there to help parachute its story. In reality, these scenes puncture the seriousness the setting and situation strive for, making it easier for the anime to reach terminal velocity.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, some examples work better than others. For instance, in episode six, the ladies of the estate try to fit Izetta into one of Fin\u00e9\u2019s gowns (and one can probably already guess where this scene is going). Izetta doesn\u2019t fit into it because of her large breasts, so Fin\u00e9, fraught with envy, looks around at the huge chests of the other women. And she speaks the following line: \u201cIs there really a way for a small, poor country to win against the overwhelming size of an empire?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right. She uses her boobs to make a metaphor about the literal war they are currently fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more scenes, too. Elvira fondles Izetta\u2019s breasts to \u201cunderstand\u201d her measurements. Ricelt barges in on a naked Bianca in the tiring I-heard-you-screaming-so-I\u2019ll-open-this-door-without-knocking-or-asking-first clich\u00e9. Sophie\u2019s chains wrap around Izetta, constricting her body in such a way that makes her capture nothing short of an amateur BDSM skit.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding even the contrivances and this ecchiness, Izetta continues falling. Later episodes in the season feature major time skips that compound the aimlessness of events. Months fly by, the anime glossing over large parts of the war and different aftermaths. Even its delivery, done through narration by Fin\u00e9\u2019s maid Lotte, fails at being a natural progression. Her words are less an explanation of what has happened during these skips and more like the creators giving a lame excuse as to why entire sections of the show were skipped.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a few attempts at side plots that ultimately miss their emotional cues.\\n\\n\r\nBianca shoots Ricelt, but the scene doesn\u2019t have the weight it should since they only knew one another for a couple of days at best.\\n\\n\r\nBasler, the only pilot to survive Izetta\u2019s attacks while she escaped with Fin\u00e9 at the beginning of the season, gets brought onto the investigation into Izetta by Berckmann. Basler is even put onto the secret sector of the Germanian Empire with a shiny new plane to boot. But he loses again during the defense of their carrier ship, he fails to kill Berckmann, and he presumably perishes in anticlimactic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSophie emerges as a real threat to Izetta and the world at large. Unfortunately, her backstory is delivered almost always as a set of still frames that do not convey much information. As such, she and others are forced to go on long, ranting expositions that impede whatever emotions are shown.\\n\\n\r\nTo give Izetta some credit here, it at least avoids the common betray-the-helper trap. When the kingdom of Eylstadt starts to lose, they don\u2019t blame Izetta for introducing magic. Rather, they risk their lives to save the woman who has already saved them previously.\\n\\n\r\nSieghart\u2019s death also demonstrates some awareness on the show\u2019s part. He hesitates to kill an enemy soldier when said soldier reminds him of the young man he permanently silenced in the woods with a gunshot to the head. His hesitancy earns him an equally fatal demise.\\n\\n\r\nIts history-based narrative helps, too. Some of the factions. The importance placed on propaganda. Summits involving the reveal of nuclear warfare. The elimination of magic from the world through Izetta\u2019s final act. Much of this content blends well enough with the otherworldly elements of the anime, preventing future unfairness and aligning itself further with its semi-historical context.\\n\\n\r\nYet these updrafts quickly turn into doldrums when the audience realizes that that \u201cfinal\u201d act wasn\u2019t final. For, as is shown, the anime doesn\u2019t even have the guts to kill off Izetta when she clearly died. The show even pretended to allude to her passing in the epilogue. Which, by the way, also has a time skip right near the end just to make Izetta\u2019s recovery more plausible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, no amount of full-circle narrative creation with Fin\u00e9 walking through the woods to meet Izetta, just as she did as a kid, can save whatever this mess ultimately became when it finally hit the ground.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIzetta doesn\u2019t have too much to harp on or too much to praise when it comes to its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nMost of Izetta\u2019s (the witch\u2019s) sequences are filled with a lot of movement. Flying on her makeshift \u201cbroom,\u201d controlling her lances, and using her magics demonstrate as such. She zips about the battlefield, flipping over entire tanks and literally throwing half of the (broken) Eiffel Tower.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries at times for more cinematic flair, like when Izetta and Fin\u00e9\u2019s images reflect off a lantern or when the lights of heaven shine down behind Izetta as she summons forth the \u201cgnomes\u201d of the mountain. But an odd shot composition during Izetta and Fin\u00e9\u2019s last flight together as well as a horribly drawn hand of Fin\u00e9\u2019s in episode six that somehow got past production offset its flair.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are slightly better off. Fin\u00e9\u2019s slender figure, golden hair, and purple eyes give her a regal look with ease. And Izetta\u2019s ample assets, red hair, and just-as-red eyes draw the attention of everyone in their world just as much as her magics do.\\n\\n\r\nLooking further into Izetta\u2019s penchant for red, her color choices complement Fin\u00e9\u2019s quite well, coinciding with the strong bond they share. Fin\u00e9 often wears green, Izetta obviously red, and, on more than one occasion, they both choose white. Together, it almost gives off a Christmas-y vibe. A sense of merriment and good tidings that matches the words and love they constantly gift each other.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the gear the Eylstadt soldiers wear is shockingly bland thanks to a dominating light-blue color choice. But some of the other designs have their place. Berckmann\u2019s shaggy hair, round spectacles, and dark-purple overcoat turn him into one shady investigator. And Bianca\u2019s decorated attire and short, black hair give an attractive, studious look.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Izetta doesn\u2019t have the most enthralling set pieces, and it relies a bit too much on the CG route during a few of its battles. Again, nothing ever stands out as gross or problematic. Double again, nothing ever stands out as interesting or involved either. Altogether, the visuals are what they need to be for the anime and not much else.\\n\\n\r\n(As one final side note, the anime cannot even stop itself from including sexual content in the visuals for its OP. Therein, a twirling, naked Izetta fills the screen roughly halfway through when it was simply not needed.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Izetta\u2019s character focus centers on Izetta, Fin\u00e9, and the close connection they share.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta and Fin\u00e9 have known each other since childhood. Fin\u00e9 once walked upon Izetta using her magic in a wooded area, and, from then on, they remained fast friends. But it wasn\u2019t before long that nearby villagers grew wary Izetta\u2019s nomad status. To the point that they attacked her \u2013 possibly with the intent to kill.\\n\\n\r\nFin\u00e9 would have none of that, though. She protected Izetta, throwing herself between the angry mob and the scared, docile witch. Fin\u00e9 earned a scar that day, a symbol of the love she holds for her dearest friend in the world. And, from that moment on, Izetta dedicated herself to the future queen, vowing to fight for and help her in all that she does.\\n\\n\r\nThey don\u2019t stay together during their early teenage years. Izetta traveled with her grandmother to train her magics, and Fin\u00e9 headed home to mature into the country\u2019s next leader. But, when they reunite on their escape from Germanian aviation, Izetta begins to repay Fin\u00e9, saving her and her men from early deaths on more than one occasion.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is not based on where they come from but rather who they are as people. Izetta doesn\u2019t care about Fin\u00e9\u2019s rank. Instead, Izetta only sees her as the kind, caring girl who was there for her when nobody else was. In similar fashion, Fin\u00e9 doesn\u2019t care that Izetta is a witch. Instead, Fin\u00e9 only sees her as the thoughtful, wonderful girl who holds tremendously special powers.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the season, both Izetta and Fin\u00e9 demonstrate resolve but in different forms. Izetta puts everything on the line, breaking her sacred taboo (of not using her powers) and risking her life (to help Fin\u00e9). In turn, Fin\u00e9 relies on Izetta, acting as the ruler she must be by putting her country and her people before her best friend.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they do not face any conflict between each other (e.g., a falling out, sparring ideologies), they do encounter personal strife. Izetta at one point fails, forcing her to use the power stone that, unlike everything else thus far, will definitely kill her. And Fin\u00e9, having pushed Izetta to the brink, sees error in her judgement as well as her own inability to do much in her position except run during danger.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, Izetta and Fin\u00e9 support one another as best they can. Not in a political or warring sense but rather in an understanding sense. Multiple times throughout the season, the two share conversations and moments, sometimes of an intimate nature, that reinforce the relationship they hold together. Izetta looks after Fin\u00e9 as she recovers from their daring escape. They talk within the secret witch\u2019s cavern about what Izetta wants Fin\u00e9 to do. Their final talk as they fly beneath a starry nighttime sky and through a tranquil forest.\\n\\n\r\nIzetta and Fin\u00e9 are by no means stellar characters, but, given how the plot plays out and simply comparing them to the rest of the cast, they are one of the stronger parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the other characters, they are on the lower end of the execution line.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst among them are the so-called villains from the Germanian Empire. Chief of that country and chief of the worst, Otto does almost nothing besides wear a fancy outfit, sit on his throne, and stand outside for a bit. He has a blind advisor that provides small snippets of wisdom, and he has a keen interest in the occult. But, given how he has no significant scenes and thus zero impact, it\u2019s tough to call him a relevant character let alone a prominent antagonist. Made even tougher by his lame, off-camera death.\\n\\n\r\nBerckmann is marginally better but still unimpressive. He acts as an investigator, following leads and organizing information for the Germanian Empire. While he evidently does a lot more than Otto, he still carries an air of worthlessness about him. He shows up where he needs to, and he knows how to play the game, but his involvement for the first three-fourths of the season doesn\u2019t extend beyond being the guy who is smart and can get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nHis defection does add a twist to the path he had taken up to that point, but his explanation that he only looks out for himself does not stick all that well when his switched loyalty comes off more like an easy out to get Fin\u00e9 and crew inside enemy territory.\\n\\n\r\nSophie is the last of the true villains in Izetta, and, arguably, she\u2019s the best of the three if only because she has a stronger motive and because she actually does something tangible. Alive once more thanks to scientific advancements within the Germanian Empire, Sophie seeks nothing less than revenge against Eylstadt, the kingdom that betrayed her unfairly and unjustly, leading to her unfortunate death.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, like the other villains, her character has a problem. Namely, she arrives far too late into the season (officially appearing in episode nine). While Germania\u2019s secret laboratories and otherworldly work were hinted at, as was the legend of the original White Witch, Sophie doesn\u2019t have enough time to stand as anything else besides the only \u201crealistic\u201d obstacle that could thwart Izetta.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly (and perhaps surprisingly), these villains, alongside Izetta and Fin\u00e9, manage to explore a relevant theme to the anime. A theme on benefitting one\u2019s self or the goal at large.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example comes from the parallel held between Sophie and Izetta. It\u2019s hastily put together, meaning it\u2019s not the smoothest connection possible, but Sophie\u2019s relationship with her king mirrors that of Izetta and Fin\u00e9\u2019s. In both cases, they would do or are doing everything for the other, but, in the end, the one of royal descent must suffer through sacrificing their beloved witch for the greater good.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s something Fin\u00e9 struggles with constantly. Whether it\u2019s right to put her best friend through torment and pain to save her country. For, while it\u2019s easy from an outside perspective to choose to help the many over the few \u2013 and in this case just one \u2013 making that decision when someone more than dear is on the line is almost impossible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where Izetta and Sophie differ. Where Izetta greets death (but not really) with a smile because she believed in Fin\u00e9 and the greater good, Sophie devolved into nothing but a big ball of hatred who cared neither about herself nor anybody else. Granted, she was betrayed by her partner, and she was subsequently burned alive, so it does make sense why she would be so mad. But her inability to understand what her king suffered through highlights her stance well enough.\\n\\n\r\nEven Otto and Berckmann, for all their troubles as antagonists, follow this theme in their own way. Berckmann cares not for the many; he cares only for himself. Ricelt\u2019s death doesn\u2019t faze him, betraying his country didn\u2019t concern him, and contacting the CIA was a no-brainer. As for Otto, he is similarly selfish, but he still fights for his own empire\u2019s greater good. He does so evilly, but it still counts.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, many of the other characters do not receive much attention. Elvira, the fashion lady, is mostly there for ecchi purposes. Jonas, the soldier that Sieghart murders, just has his family photo. Elliot, Otto\u2019s blind advisor, has wisdom to share, but he just stands around the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, considering that this tale is that of Izetta and Fin\u00e9\u2019s, giving these women the attention over the side characters is a smart move. One of the only ones in the whole anime at that.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIzetta backs itself with a surprisingly strong original soundtrack that mixes the magical with the orchestral. Female choirs chant, preceding the falling, rising violins and whimsical harp playing, to achieve fantasy. Blaring trumpets and fierce, heavy drums signal threats and danger on the horizon. The OST even throws in a circus-like tune that accompanies the rarer lighthearted moments. A fitting piece given some of the unbelievable happenings that go on during the show\u2019s era.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track for the anime perhaps leans too much on the rock front, providing something very loud and very fierce. Almost to the point that it doesn\u2019t quite fit the tone of the show itself. Still, the vocal harmonies, the hard guitar riff with drum fills in the middle, and the dropped music in the beginning and the unknowing flourish at the end give the OP a noticeable amount of flair.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, the ending track goes the complete opposite direction tonally (which sometimes happens with OP-ED pairs). Strangely enough, it also goes too hard tonally. That is, Izetta was never the dramatic doomsday show that the piece seems to argue. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a rather solid track. The slow, deliberate piano. A couple of English lyrics. Thundering drums. The ED is beyond gloomy in all the right ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, it sees no notable performances save for Himika Akaneya as Izetta. While the kindhearted witch didn\u2019t deliver emotion or dialogue to any grand level, this role marks one of her first major ones in the business, and so she deserves at least some recognition.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile action-oriented anime are not my go-to choices, a few of the battles were still interesting to me. Izetta\u2019s escape with Fin\u00e9 showed off some blood magic, and her first official fight at Coenenberg had her controlling swords, flipping tanks, and shooting her rifle. It\u2019s a shame, then, that her magic didn\u2019t evolve much (if at all) the further along the season progressed. The scenarios certainly did \u2013 taking down a carrier ship, squaring off against another witch \u2013 but it was essentially more of the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019m all for ecchi content \u2013 so long as it has a time and a place. But a quick shot of Izetta\u2019s butt or her getting stripped naked for a bath doesn\u2019t really need to be in this show where seriousness, magic, and historical influences reign.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Izetta and Fin\u00e9 themselves, they were cute and fun when the situation allowed it. But they weren\u2019t anyone special to me. It didn\u2019t help that their relationship wasn\u2019t as quirky as I would have liked it. But they at least had some implied yuri feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my two favorite parts from the show, they would be a non-character and a couple of words. First, Fin\u00e9\u2019s puppy named Doroth\u00e9e. Her jumping in the water and sneezing made me smile. Second, the fact that they called the U.S.A. the \u201cUnited States of Atlanta.\u201d An unintentionally hilarious name that bumps up the show ever-so-slightly in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta fails to take advantage of its solid start, causing it to fall and hit the ground in a not-so-pretty manner. Its story devolves into a mess, its villains are unimpressive, and its content simply lacks entertainment. Its English translation should really be Izetta: Doesn\u2019t Last.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, while the initial episodes establish a tower for the narrative to properly leap from, contrived events, unnecessary sexual content, time skips, poorly handled subplots, and a lame ending prevent it from reaching strong footing and instead plummet it towards something unacceptable\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, while the visuals are neither strong nor weak, Izetta\u2019s battles showcase a lot of movement, and her and Fin\u00e9\u2019s designs are nicely complementary\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Izetta and Fin\u00e9 share a close bond, a theme on selfishness versus the greater good exists, but the villains are horrendous\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, good OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, \u201cThe United States of Atlanta\u201d was the best part\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Shuumatsu no Izetta,\r\nWithout looking into the potential hidden meanings behind the plot of WWII and the countries involved, seeing the majority of reviews for this being bad and the anime leaving people unimpressed, I was more than curious to see why.\r\nThe war feel is done well. It feels old and the characters look the way they should to fit into that era. \r\nFin\u00e9 is fighting to try and save her country, while doing so she comes across someone familiar, Izetta.\r\nThey're both ecstatic to find each other again and Izetta wants nothing more than to help and protect her Princess, with whatever it may be. \r\nShemay be the only one that can save Elystadt, using her incredibly strong magic, deep care for the Princess and what she believes in.\\n\\n\r\nThe potential for this was great, it could have been fantastic with the mix of genres. War and magic. It moves slowly though, which is one of the bad things. Slowly suits some things, war.. not so much.\\n\r\nThough it is slow it does feel like it's building up to something, whether it be resolve or something to carry into another season. The ending is worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Izetta and Fin\u00e9 is sweet, it's business orientated but also Fin\u00e9 obviously cares for her a lot, as does Izetta in return. When she's feeling like she doesn't belong Fin\u00e9 does her best to comfort her and care for her, knowing if it were the other way around she would be treated the same. The way the friendship between them is portrayed even with their situation and it being war does make it feel more like it's not just war, there's relationships and love which shows what they're fighting for.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it feels a little disconnected through the episodes, going in and out of actually focusing on the war and time just seeming to pass, it was enjoyable to watch. The story is interesting and could have excelled beyond what it is, but even so, what it achieved was still good. I was hopeful for possible ladylove between Fin\u00e9 and Izetta.\\n\r\nIn the end I liked watching it, but I can understand the misgivings others didn't enjoy about it.",

It felt like a cop out to be honest and left less of an impact on me. \r\nThe art was nice and different from what I've seen with some very beautiful backgrounds, the sound and music was pretty nice but with the exception of a couple melodies it was pretty forgettable. \r\nThe characters and story were the weakest points for me. Not only does the story seem to degrade by the end, the characters range from likable to unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nI would say it's a nice show if you want to watch something short with pretty backgrounds and little plot as it literally copies the second world war for just about everything once you get rid of the magic parts.",

            "content": "Out of all the Mahou Shoujo or Magical Girl shows coming out this season, this is probably the worst show out of all of them. Now sure, this is about the legend of the white witch but a magical girl show nonetheless.\r\nThe show centres around in an alternate reality WW2 setting in a fictional Duchy of Elystadt (which occupies Northern Tyrol, Austria)  which is being invaded by the fictional Nation of Germania (not Nazi Germany but Germania, *hint* *hint*) in which a girl named Izetta, the last remaining witch comes to save the day and magically defends the country just in the legends. Basicgist of it really.\\n\\n\r\nThe First 3 episodes were by far the greatest. The story and plotline slowly unravelled leading the viewer into great enjoyment. What really bothered me is how it went to crap from there. I can't but help scream GENERIC when i see it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality in  some of the action scene is terrible . There was one  scene where Izetta is flying around on a ridiculous 50mm sniper rifle  against some airplanes. The sound effects of the rifle and the shooting of the airplane certainly did not match their historical counterparts. You could have at-least gotten a correct firing sound of a bf109 Messerschmidt\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason alone I will be rating this anime Fine/10. Fine, after the main character Fin\u00e9",

            "content": "Izetta the last witch makes use of a rather special setting with regards to anime in that it takes place in a alternate world setting where a war reminiscent of WW2 is taking place. In this world the Germanian empire which is a country that is based on Nazi Germany of the 1940's is launching a war of world conquest and so far has been hugely successful. Opposing them is a coalition of allied countries that include Britannia which is the anime's version of the United Kingdom and the United states of Atlanta which is the anime's version of the US. One other country thatopposes the Germanian empire is the small country of Eylstadt which within the anime is a fictional country that is located in Western Austria. \\n\\n\r\nThe main story focuses on Eylstadt's struggle to protect their country and stop the Germanians from taking the world. \\n\\n\r\nAs settings and stories go an alternate Earth is a interesting setting to use for an anime as it gives the chance for the characters to be featured in a time period that was both interesting and brutal and at the same time allow us to see what could have happened if magic and witches really did exist at that time. Would a small country half the size of the UK be able to stand up to the military might of the Germanian empire. \\n\\n\r\nIzetta is the titular character of the show and one of the two main characters of the anime. Izetta played by Himika Akaneya a relatively new seiyuu is the last surviving witch of a clan of witches that were descendants of the famous white witch that was important to the country of Eylstadt and its founding. Prior to meeting the start of the series Izetta and Fine actually met when she saved her from being lynched by a mob of villagers after they suspected her of being a witch. This laid the foundation of their friendship and bond. Before the war Izetta did all she could to hide her heritage due to the prejudices that people had toward them but once the war started and her power awakened Izetta realized that her powers can be used to help both her beloved friend and later leader Fine and her country by protecting them from the invaders. \\n\\n\r\nAs a witch Izetta is able to animate various inanimate objects such as lances and bombs and use them against the enemy by throwing them with magic. Instead of a traditional broomstick she rides a anti tank rifle which she can also use as well. Her magic though powerful depends on the planets ley lines which really means areas that have magic in them. \\n\\n\r\nIzetta is a nice person by nature and is kind and nice to everyone she meets with her most prominent traits being her determination to protect Fine, her friends and her home, bravery, loyalty and diligence \\n\\n\r\nI felt that Izetta was a great character as despite being a witch that was viewed by others with disdain and fear Izetta still stepped up and use her powers to protect Elystadt and its people even though they done nothing for her. Her bond with Fine is one of the highlights of the show and the friendship that they forge was great to watch as they both care deeply about each other with each willing to sacrifice themselves if they can save the other. Himika Akaneya despite being a relatively new seiyuu really did a great job here and her portrayal of Izetta will surely propel her more into the spotlight. \\n\\n\r\nFine whose full name is Ortfine Fine Fredericka Eylstadt is the crown princess and later Archduchess of Elystadt and one of the two main characters of the show. Fine played by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami who's also my fourth favorite seiyuu is the leader of the country of Eylstadt after the death of her father. Fine is a brave and determined young woman who despite her age is well versed in political intrigue and maneuvering. Fine is very loyal to her country and always tries to do whats best for its people and as such is very popular with its people. Fine cares a great deal about her people and staff including her best friend and her countries most powerful weapon Izetta and hates putting them in danger despite the needs for doing so. This aspect of her i actually admire as i believe that a good leader should always care about their subjects and people. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier Fine and Izetta actually met when they were little and have have forged a bond that is very strong. Her friendship with Izetta is one of the highlights of the show. Another aspect of Fine is her strong orator skills as she is able to give speeches that are both grand and convincing and arguably this is due to the hard work done by her seiyuu Saori Hayami. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that Fine was a great character as while Izetta was the spear and sword of Eylstadt Fine was the shield that manages the countries various alliances while also caring about her subjects and friends. The work of a ruler is never easy but Fine exemplifies the image of a calm and caring leader that cares about her people and always does what's good for the country and its people. I been a fan of Saori Hayami since 2012 and arguably her performance as Fine is nothing less than exemplary and her best performance to date. \\n\\n\r\nMuller \\n\r\nMuller that i call Sieg is one of Fine's counselor's and closest advisers and is also Fine's spymaster. Quiet for the most part Sieg prefers to operate behind the scenes and does what is needed to secure the country. Though not as positive as Elvira or Lotte Muller understands that his work while certainly untactful is necessary for the country in this time of war and takes his duties seriously. His most prominent trait is perhaps his loyalty both to the country and to Fine. \\n\\n\r\nElvira played by veteran seiyuu Kana Hanazawa and my 2nd favorite Seiyuu is Fine's personal tutor and later PR adviser. A former reporter that has worked in newspapers and radio Elvira is intelligent and understands very well how news works and how it can influence a country and its people. As a personal tutor Elvira teaches Fine and later Izetta how to behave and the etiquette's that they should follow and her attempts at doing so are rather funny. Her most prominent trait is perhaps craftiness. \\n\\n\r\nBerkmann is the head of the Germanian special unit that acts as  the intelligence agency of the Germanian empire. Intelligent, quick thinking and a shrewd and cunning person Berkman pursue's his objectives relentlessly. However one surprising trait about him is that he is loyal to no one but himself which is best demonstrated near the end of the anime. This is a complete contrast to his opposite number Sieg whose prominent trait is his loyalty. I think that this was the most unexpected thing about him that surprised me and no doubt his protege and his allies. \\n\\n\r\nAs the head of the Germanian special unit Berkmann acted as the main villain until the second arc of the series where he was replaced by Sophie and i have to say that his character who was played by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe really did a great job of portraying the cunning and calculating intel chief. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSophie voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya and my third favorite seiyuu is a clone of the original white witch that the Germanians were able to create by using a sample of the original witch. Despite being a clone Sophie has all the memories of the white witch and as such as a intense hatred towards Eylstadt due to what its previous king did to her. As such she cares little about the wishes of the Germanians and only wishes for the destruction of the country that wronged her this being Eylstadt. Starting from the second arc Sophie becomes the primary villain of the series replacing Berkmann and i have to say Sophie was a great villain that was portrayed brilliantly by Sora and arguably her most villainous role to date. Sophie's most prominent trait is her cruelty and her quest for revenge which means that she will stop at nothing to attain that. In a way Sophie is a dark mirror of what Izetta would become if the people that she cared about turned and betrayed her however unlikely that sounds. \\n\\n\r\nRickert was Berkmann's protege and though a member of a well do family chose to join the military instead. Calm, collected and loyal Rickert was the complete opposite of Berkmann and though inexperienced he makes up for it by his kindness something that looks out of place lol. Indeed Rickert was able to infiltrate Eylstadt thanks to this trait. Indeed Rickert was able to catch Bianca's attention during the mission which while unintended was quite funny. Though sadly events did not go as planned for both of them. The almost romance between them was sweet and sad at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nOtto \\n\r\nThe germanian emperor that was based on a combination of Hitler and Wilhelm II had a mostly support role within the story. Unlike others within his country Otto believed in the existence of witches and magic and advocated for their location and extraction similar to what Hitler did in real life. Aside from giving orders to Berkmann and Sophie Otto did not have much of role in the series but when he did it was usually funny due to his manner of speech. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLotte \\n\r\nLotte portrayed by veteran seiyuu Nao Toyama is a maid that serves as Fine and Izetta's personal retainers. Lotte is a positive and caring person that has a rather go lucky personality that believes in both Fine and in Izetta's powers. Lotte i felt was a great support character as even when things are dire she can still be positive which can be infectious. Her most comical trait is perhaps the fact that she has a foot stool strapped to her back. Lotte also serves as the narrator for some parts of the anime which i felt was a good move as her seiyuu Nao Toyama is well suited for this due to her voice range. \\n\\n\r\nBianca \\n\\n\r\nBianca voiced by veteran seiyuu Aya Uchida of Trinity seven fame is the commander of Fine's personal bodyguard unit the Royal guard. Though initially distrustful of Izetta and somewhat skeptical of her abilities Bianca later become one of Izetta's closest allies and firmest believers. Bianca is actually quite different when outside of her duties as she behaves like a normal woman that is both innocent and pure and blushes quite easily. Her one and ever chance of romance with Rickert though was sweet as she did like him but ultimately had a sad ending. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\r\nThe art style that was used for the anime i felt was amazing as the scenery of the countries was beautifully designed and had some great colors in them. The variation of the various countries and terrain types was also well done. Character designs i felt was also pretty well done and both Fine and Izetta looked gorgeous. The animation for the anime was one of the best i seen in some time with the fight scenes being particularly impressive. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nMusic i felt was great throughout the anime and the opening and ending themes was well done. The ending theme sung by veteran singer May'n was hauntingly beautiful. \\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\r\nVoice acting as a whole i felt was really well done with the whole cast doing a fantastic job portraying their characters. Particular praise i feel should go to Saori Hayami who did a fantastic job portraying Fine and Himika Akaneya who played Izetta as i felt these two seiyuu's really did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nOverall i felt that Izetta's story was a strong one that focused on the struggle between a small country like Eylstadt and an empire like the Germanians and its determination to not only stop the invasion but also rally the world to stand against the Germanians. Key to that is of course Izetta and the bond between her and Fine which makes them both stronger and more determined to stop the germanians and protect their country. Watching Izetta lead strikes against the tyrannical Germanians with her powers while Fine rallies the various countries is like watching to halves of a person as both seek to protect the one thing that they care about the most which is each other. The one weak thing that i felt could have been executed better was the cloning of the white witch to create Sophie. While it made sense that they were able to get samples of DNA of the white witch to be able to create a clone from that should be beyond even the Germanians but the result of Sophie and Sora's first true Villain role was kinda worth it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all i really enjoyed Izetta as it had a great story, great characters and setting and a talented cast of seiyuu's boasting three of my favorite seiyuus in it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Izetta The Last Witch is set in an alternate WWII where the ruler of Eylstadt, Archduchess Ortfin\u00e9 Fredericka von Eylstadt (Fin\u00e9) seeks to defend her small country against a Germanian invasion, together with the witch Izetta, who owes her a debt of gratitude owing to Fin\u00e9 helping her in the past.\r\nThe alternate world naming schema of the show is a bit strange, as the countries are readily recognisable for their real-world counterparts, Germania for Germany, Britannia for Britain and so on. I realise that war is a sensitive subject, especially for Japan, but as it\u2019s a fantasy world, there\u2019s no reason why they couldn\u2019t havenamed the countries something totally different (or even just gone for the \u2018fake eastern European\u2019 names which were popular in fiction written in the early 1900s). However, there\u2019s been some thought into building up the late 30s/early setting, with the commoners wearing clothing similar to that which was popular at the time, and the weapons mostly being based on existing WWII weapons or plans for them. There\u2019s also some great use of \u2018news footage\u2019, with black and white imagery and the flickering effect that is common in real news footage of the time. There were a few things which I spotted as being a little anachronistic or implausible outside of the obviously fantasy/magic elements, but overall there was an engrossing feeling of place and time created by the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs characters, Fin\u00e9 is a young and inexperienced ruler who seeks to do what is best for her country. She\u2019s a little idealistic, but she has people around her who help advise her and channel her idealism into more practical outlets. Izetta is shown as having a huge debt of gratitude to Fin\u00e9 for saving her several years ago, to the point where she\u2019ll do almost anything to help. She doesn\u2019t feel confident in her own abilities, but she wants to do all she can for Fin\u00e9 and by extension for the country in spite of being told that witches shouldn\u2019t interfere in the affairs of others. I found the protagonists both pretty likeable, although they definitely both seemed a bit starry-eyed and out of touch with the situation at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this show was beautiful! There\u2019s a mixture of orchestral music and some haunting choral pieces. The music works to enhance the feeling of the different moments in the show, and I especially loved the track which I\u2019d associate with Izetta using magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were quite competent, with a lot of love being put into the battle scenes and Izetta flying. The dog fights seemed to be choreographed in a way that was engaging and fun to watch! I mentioned earlier how I liked the period-appropriate fashions and vehicles. There were also some sharp military uniforms. While I think that during real WWII, soldiers wore khaki on the whole to blend into the surroundings, the Eylstadt troops wore a charming blue uniform with red trim. This is nice to look at and I think that these sorts of flashy uniforms help to create a sense of solidarity amongst the soldiers and also make them stand out more, which is good visually for us as the viewer, although perhaps poor in a real war situation. I would say that Izetta\u2019s costume design (quite scanty clothing) felt rather immersion-breaking, as it seemed improbable that such clothing would have existed in the late 30s and it goes rather against the fashions of the times. There was no particular story reason given for why she had to wear this clothing instead of just wearing existing clothing which could have been found in the castle. It felt like the only reason for this sort of costume design was to sell possible figures, which was a shame in an otherwise carefully crafted world.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem I had with this show was the story. While the concept of a witch defending not-Austria from not-Germany in WWII was very interesting, and the various elements were well crafted, the show seemed to struggle to use the elements to create a compelling tale. There were slow-paced, almost slice-of-life moments in this show which portrayed itself as being a tale of the underdog standing up against the odds, and they felt very out of place. The struggle of war and the tragedy of war seemed to be absent from this tale which was ostensibly about overcoming difficulties and self-sacrifice. There were also a lot of characters who felt like they didn\u2019t get used to their full potential, and some who seemed to really have no purpose in telling the story at all (Elvira Freidman the stylist comes to mind). At some points in the story, the struggles of the Germanians to find information and beat Izetta felt more intriguing than the activities of the main characters, and while the show did portray some likeable and idealistic characters on both sides of the war, I don\u2019t think that it was their intention to make the Germanians more sympathetic than the protagonists. Whilst there were some excellent moments in the series, I don\u2019t think that the story was very good as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel like Izetta is a show which had some excellent elements; a great concept, pleasant visuals, an outstanding soundtrack, but owing to its poor storytelling fell short of what it could have been. I think if you\u2019re less story-oriented than myself, that you may find it to be an enjoyable, albeit flawed watch, but I didn't find it to be a pleasing watch personally.",

            "content": "A Witch flying using a F-*-ing heavy rifle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta is an anime that had high expectations with it's great start and under a fictional alternate Europe of 1939 only made the impression this anime would be one of the standouts for Fall 2016, but nonetheless...sometimes predictions and LA's own score is hard thing to pin down.\r\nThe plot for what a great start it had with establishing the mood of a historical war between Eylstadt and Germania giving parallels similar to Austria's occupation to Germany and along with supernatural elements of magical leylines and witches was one of it's focal and central strengths to theanime however it quite early on had times when it petered away and became a slice of life at our main characters  of Izetta the titular character and witch voiced by Himika Akaneya and Fine voiced by Saori Hayami the princess of Eylstadt and this mostly occurred during the early half and most of the middle meat of the anime and LA gets it that some anime can't go full steam ahead ALL the way and LA gets it, but for what an interesting premise it gave it at least didn't lose it's main purpose it had.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the anime's pacing slowing down quite quickly with Izetta as a witch gaining traction and winning the war against Germania forces, the slice of life and \"development of Izetta and Fine's relationship\" gave rise to Germania to fight back against Izetta during the background while Izetta and Fine was \"faffing around\", but yes, it could be looked as character relational development for Izetta and Fine as well as world building of Eylstadt and the White Witch of Eylstadt, but the for the good chuck of the middle of the anime, they were really faffing about and the background plotlines getting the serious attention. It's not until the last 2 episodes, where Shuumatsu no Izetta really starts getting back on track and ignoring the obvious counterattacking Germania is plotting.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, due to the focus of the anime going to Izetta and Fine, they get the majority of the focus, though some of the background characters get some decent character development as due to the nature of the anime being \"anyone can die\" it might lead to wasted character potential or \"you've played your part..now die\" for the minor characters which is rather odd as the minor characters round the meat of the anime started to move the plot forward instead of Fine and Izetta, the ones affected by this easily going to Ricelt voiced by Natsuki Hanae and Jonas Gallea voiced by Hiroyuki Endou. But considering how Shuumatsu no Izetta is structured as a more plot-heavy anime concerning it's backstories and \"fairy tales\", LA can see why besides Izetta and Fine, that it's not exactly character-driven. As for LA's favourite characters, Fine was LA's favourite character and with the majority of the anime dedicated to Fine, it was to be expected...ohh and Saori Hayami of course.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Ajia-Do, a first time LA even heard of this anime studio, but nonetheless LA will say that the animation quality was pretty consistent and really crisp all from it's character designs to the warfare mixed with it's magical battles it had, but nonetheless with it's high quality and consistency the anime had throughout was great.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, it was decent for the most part, and quite honestly there isn't much to talk about with the voice acting segment cept who was LA's favourite as the entire cast did decently enough but just not enough to grab LA's attention except for LA's favourite voice actor in Shuumatsu no Izetta being Saori Hayami. LA did actually have to say that LA found that Nao Touyama being typecasted as a loli maid or maids in general as a nod to her typecasting but other than that, decent voice cast all round for Shuumatsu no Izetta.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists at best were predictable which is slightly sad what with it's fictional propaganda on the war was probably the best thing to latch onto plot twists and again the slowed down pacing and constant hinting that Germania's spies were gonna counterattack Eylstadt made some of the plot twists rather predictable, though the ending slightly changed it due to the finality of it all especially considering Izetta herself. On speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending gave finality to Germania's newer threat and really Shuumatsu no Izetta really lives up to it's name to how the ending went, yes for LA it was rather rushed but even the plan Eylstadt and by extension Izetta herself had the \"rushed pacing\" was both on the plot's slow pacing during the meat of the anime and \"too be expected they'd rush it\", but even with this state and pacing the ending gave, LA still saw it as a satisfying ending as it tied up all loose ends and a sorta epilogue to all surviving characters.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta had in itself a GREAT premise and for what it could have turned out to be a great look into a fictional alternate Europe during a war, add in supernatural elements and focus on it, but with it's meat having a slow pacing for what is legitimately needed character development and world building had the anime stalling for Eylstadt and by extension Fine to slip up, it however did get by the ending and with it's satisfying ending got to LA re-aligning LA's own expectations for Shuumatsu no Izetta. But just because Shuumatsu no Izetta slipped up and made some flaws and compromises in between during the meat of the anime, what could have an amazing anime, nonetheless, LA won't be as harsh to an anime to say that ONE mistake means the anime is outright horrible, just it had a plot-narrative problem but it still landed even with it's flaws and the satisfying ending really showed it could still salvage itself after so many faffing about with Izetta and Fine.\\n\\n\r\nLA thinks what LA got out of Shuumatsu no Izetta is to NOT bring high expectations into an anime in which it itself wasn't \"designed to have in mind\". Either way, Shuumatsu no Izetta, you may have been a great anime, but being a decent anime in LA's eyes isn't bad either.",

            "content": "Mal doesn't have a good summary, so here's this\r\nSummary-Set in an alternate Earth on the eve of the Second World War, the story follows Izetta, the last surviving member of a clan of witches that possesses the ability to magically manipulate any object that they touch. Izetta pledges to help protect Princess Fin\u00e9 and the tiny Alpine country of Eylstadt from invasion by the imperialistic forces of Germania\r\nAnimation- the animation to the show is good(kind of). the character designs looked OK, sometimes i liked them, and other times i didn't. the background art also looked nice from the European city to the forests. the flightanimation looked great, especially during the air combat scenes. there was a lot of CG used for a lot of the war machines and debris that made the battles look odd. also for some reason they used star wars laser beams for the weapons which made everything look weird. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nsound- the voice acting was very good nothing felt out of place and each voice fit the characters very well.  the sound track was okay most were forgettable,but some stood out more than others however it is only a few. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nstory-  as said in the summary the story focuses on Izzeta helping defend Fine and her country from the Germenian empire in an alternate WW2. the two girls have some of back story about being friend despite one being a witch and because of this Izzeta is willing to risk life and limb to defend this small country.that's what most of the show consisted of, a loosing country who gains an upper hand against the Germania empire because of a witch. there's also some politics in play such as the country getting help from the allied nations and propaganda of the witch to rally the country which is all will and good, but never really felt that important. there were also slice of life moments that seemed like a bore and didn't add much to the story and characters. near the end of the show an important character is introduced, but by that time i didn't really care. the heroes win, magic is gone, the last few minutes is pretty much WW2 in a nut shell and i felt like my time was wasted but in a okay-ish way\\n\r\n2/10\\n\r\nCharacthers- all the character felt bland, boring or both. you have Fine the princess of the country who is willing to do anything to protect her country. Izzeta the witch of the story with an strong attachment to Fine, and is willing to do any thing for her. there are other side characters such as the maids, soldiers , and staff but they're mostly all one-note, and not worth mentioning. the antagonist of the shows are the Germania empire specifically spies who try to obtain the witches power, there's not much to them other than that. smaller characters are the politicians and leaders of the other countries but pretty much serve as a surrogate of the idea of what each country was during the WW2. even the main big bad the emperor of Germania was a surrogate of who Hitler was, and if you know your history and who Hitler was that's pretty much him. there's also little to no character development i can note of so what you get in the beginning is pretty much the same you get at the end. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- i did enjoy the first few episodes, but before the halfway point it did start to get uninteresting. at that point it felt like a drag to watch, but not bad enough to hate the show and stop watching 4/10\\n\\n\r\nconclusion- good art and animation, story that had potential(kind of), but failed, boring characters, a drag to watch 4/10\\n\\n\r\nnote- i don't really do recommendations, but i would recommend Maria the virgin witch as a better show. not much better, but better nonetheless",

            "content": "In September of 1939, a war broke out in Europe. The continent seemed doomed, crushed beneath the might of an evil Central European power bent on world domination. This sounds familiar, no? If you think I'm talking about the Second World War, I'm not. This is how \"Izetta: The Last Witch\" begins. \r\nComing from Ajia-Do, a company most famous for \"Vampire Hunter D\", this 12-episode series gives us a look at a similar scenario to that of World War II, but only loosely so. The names of the countries have been changed. Germany is now Germania, England now Brittania (Code Geass not affiliated), America isAtlanta (?)... you get the idea. The weapons and technology of time are about the same. Germania has a bunch of tanks and planes and the rest of the continent is stuck 20 years in the past, but this is where history takes a turn- the country of Elystadt (imagine if the skinny part of Austria to the West was it's own country) gets invaded but luckily, the leader of the nation (basically a Princess) has a BFF who is a witch. This witch takes flight on an anti-tank rifle instead of a broom and proceeds to defend her country against the invading Nazi- I mean, \"Germanian\" hordes. Oh, yeah- this is the meat of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the battle scenes in this show. The artwork is good from top-to-bottom, and the horrors of war are treated with a good amount of realism, but watching panzers get flipped over like turtles from the magic of a witch is fantastic. Magic-guided blunt instruments of yesteryear getting put through planes never gets old. But, these are the high points of a show that had a lot of potential and was cut far too short. Like an athlete cut down in their prime, we see a glimmer of what could have been, and then <POOF> it's over.\\n\\n\r\nThe show did a fine job of not only giving me entertaining battles and 'splosion porn, but creating some mythos that caught my curiosity, all while creating many characters that were developed well to start off with, but just as the show hits it's stride it abruptly ends! This show should have been easily twice the length it is and honestly left me frustrated. Maybe if it had the backing of a bigger studio it would have been longer, but I digress. The quick finale ruined the show for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sub vs. Dub battle goes to the Sub for me, but frankly given the setting of the show, I feel I would have most enjoyed a German dub, much like I had hoped for with \"Attack on Titan\" and I eventually got. This show really got my hopes up. This was not from a light novel, manga, or video game, this was an original piece... sort of. It took place in a genre I love, created a story with characters I could get behind, and then it was over... quicker than Fruit Stripe gum. But, putting aside my feelings on the rushed ending, I enjoyed enough of the show to recommend a watch for anyone looking for an interesting spin on magical girls or World War II. 6/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "What would it be like if witches existed in the real world? Or, more specifically during world war II? If finding the answer interests you at all I recommend giving this series a try. (also, if you enjoy yuri undertones, you're in for a treat!)\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe animation was top notch and though I wouldn't consider it Ghibli film level, it reminded me alot of the animation in Ancient Magus Bride. The colors are vibrant and the scenery is beautiful.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story isn't very original. It's a copy of World war II set in an alternate world where witches exist. However the way it is portrayedin my opinion was rather realistic. There is betrayal, espionage and of course the want to monopolize magic to rule the world. If magic did exist we can be certain the natzis would've wanted to use it to their advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThough it may not have been the best writing, it still kept me invested and wanting to watch more. Without giving away spoilers or going into too much depth on the interactions between characters; the ones that die and the reasons they do, made perfect sense to me. War is unforgiving and in real life people are still just people who make mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't amazing but it fit well with the series and didn't have any points where I felt the music wasn't matching the scenes. There were even a few scenes toward the end where the music really brought the show to life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not dislikable and as I stated previously in the story portion, alot of their actions and reasons for doing certain things resonated with me. Why I wasn't able to give the characters an 8 or higher is because I feel there could've been more depth than there was. However, I really enjoyed Seig's character and would've like more of him in the anime. I also enjoyed Bianca and Izetta herself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI had fun watching this series. Every episode had my attention. And in my opinion it even had a good ending, which is a plus for any series I'm watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5...but since I can't do decimals I gave it an 8\\n\\n\r\nI just liked it! It was fun to watch and had nice art. Plain and simple.\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s a really freaking weird concept. Izetta is a retelling of World War 2, a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario involving a witch who is destined to save the Kingdom of Elystadt from imminent destruction from the evil forces of the Germanian Empire. No, Hitler isn\u2019t involved in this one. What we do have is a gaudy, handsome villain who has hair that would make Jennifer Garner jealous. (He uses Garnier, duh). Izetta\u2019s plot isn\u2019t a \u201cgrand\u201d retelling of world war II; if you know anything about history, you\u2019ll know what happens in the end, nor is it really even about magic itself. What it really isis a love story, one involving the chivalrous princess Fine who cares deeply for her kingdom, and Izetta, a witch girl who uses her powers to assist Fine in her struggle of life and death. I don\u2019t want to go to heavy into spoilers for those of you haven\u2019t seen the show, so I\u2019ll just say that my impressions upon finishing the show were mixed. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the heavy themes that the show revolves around is self-sacrifice, sacrifice that is for a greater purpose than oneself. We see this through the relationship between Izetta and Fine. Not every fairytale has a happy ending, and what better setting to depict this theme than one of the greatest wars that history has known, a war where millions upon millions of citizens and soldiers met an unfortunate demise? I think the show does a good job of presenting this idea, yet there a few problems that prevent this show from being truly memorable. \\n\\n\r\nOne of these revolves around the characters. I understand that, in a 12-episode series, not every character will have the same amount of time to adequately developed. Yet, some of the characters are terribly one-dimensional, the villains in particular. Otto, the german Kaiser, is undeniably a megalomaniac, yet we have no introduction to his character, other than that he must be the villain because he has incredibly good-looking hair and talks in a deep, threatening voice. But I think a lot of this one-dimensionality applies to the main cast, as well.  Fine and Izetta, while likeable characters, don\u2019t really evolve from the standard archetypes that they are based from. For example, Izetta willingly ignores her grandma\u2019s purpose for what she believes is a greater purpose than herself. But we don\u2019t really delve into what she thinks about it morally. I mean, she\u2019s routing entire battalions of troops on her own, meaning she\u2019s killed hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers. And she doesn\u2019t give a second glance. War\u2019s a bloody business, and the show, in quite a few episodes, does a great job of presenting this, particularly through Jonas. And Izetta doesn\u2019t really seem to give it a second thought.\\n\\n\r\nNow I realize that this may sound silly to a lot of people. So why am I bringing this up? It\u2019s because Izetta and Fine don\u2019t really undergo any sort of major progressions as characters throughout the series. We get an insightful look at the love that blossoms between them, sure, but the lack of change in their characters leads to a one-dimensionality that takes away deeply from any interested that I may have personally invested in them. It\u2019s unfortunate, because I really do think that Izetta: The Last Witch has an has an interesting concept, and the relationship between Izetta and Fine that is the primary focus of the series is quite charming, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this series had a bit more latent potential.",

            "content": "In 4 words: Great concept; poor execution.\r\nStory - 5\r\nIzetta's writing was done by Hiroyuki Yoshino, the guy who also wrote Guilty Crown. The concept of bringing a witch into a ww2 setting and making her curbstomp Nazis was satisfying for the first few episodes. And then we watch complacency set in as the good guys make blunder after blunder,(sometimes with fanservice, sometimes without) episode after episode, while the Nazis get closer and closer to finding a final solution for eliminating the witch.\r\nCharacters - 1\r\nThe good guys have the witch, and she's wiping out Nazis just as easily as moving her fingers. How does the showbalance the power scale? Simple, give her a supporting cast who blunder their way through the whole thing, like discussing her sole weakness out in an open forest. That's not all. They also give the Nazis an ultimate genius who manages to decipher the weakness just by watching her fight for 5 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nThere's an Oberstein-lite helping out the good guys, but he's the only guy smart enough to cover all his bases, and even his most valiant efforts are hampered by incompetent subordinates and colleagues. Other than Oberstein-lite, the 2 characters I liked best are two lovers who only met each other 24 hours ago. The main characters are that meh.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 9\\n\\n\r\nPretty. Really pretty. The final fight scene is one of the best I've seen. It's so good it's the only thing preventing me from giving the show a 3 or 4. A shame really. Izetta has many faults, but the art is not one of them. Same goes for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nIzetta starts out really strong and interesting. But with an overpowered witch, the whole show couldn't balance it well enough to maintain any tension until the last few episodes. It feels like a game where the developer's solution to unbalanced powers is to badly nerf one side and power up the other side, only to find out that it got even more unbalanced the other way, and they had to power up the losing side now.",

Done deal! The last part, that could be the game-changing...change, simply took a subparrole for our cute girls to tell the story.\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nThe art could get two ratings: the battles should get an 8, as they are really well drawn (or CG'ed, sometimes), but not outstanding. The static scenes, where characters simply stand and talk, should be a 4. Sometimes their dialogues was done with their mouths shut, which is an accomplishment by itself, but not yet acceptable in our current animations. Everything else but these two are pretty fair, thus the 6.\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe anime sounds are good. We are talking about full-scale war with magic. Swords swinging around, explosions, cries and shouts, machiney working, tanks, boats, fighters, everything is well done. It felt to me that the timing between animation and sound was a bit unstable, but I don't know who to blame. A memorable commendation for VA Hayami Saori, who did a really good job as Fin\u00e9. Her speeches were really well done.\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nIt is nice to see Izetta and Fin\u00e9 relationship throughout the show. They really grow as characters, and their friendship is really beautiful. Everyone else is simply weird, their motivations are unclear, and they lack development over the show. Besides, we see in this anime another horrid example of \"victor's story\": I simply don't know why they make Germanians ruthless monsters that eats children (well...they didin't eat them this time), while the Allied Forces are Hope and Peace saviors. I'll live through the day when normal people will stand at both sides of the war.\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nSometimes I wondered why I kept watching this show. I had to make a big effort to go forward and look for the next episode. Maybe because I love fantasy, but I can't recommend this to anyone but those I dislike.\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nBad fantasy. Clich\u00e9ed story, unbalanced art, bad character development and alas, clich\u00e9ed characters everywhere. But the protagonists were fine and the sound was enjoyable. I would say stay away from it, especially if you like the fantasy genre.",

The big bad enemy nation always knows everything; They always have a spy conveniently placed exactly where they need him to be and they always have the upper hand. They have the ability to find witches without no one else even realizing such a thing exists in the world and if that wasn't convenient enough they can also clone witches and even have the technology to use the witches'smagic as fuel for their machines and bombs.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all pointless though, because even with such an advantage over the rest of the world they decide to get into a dumb feud with some small country just to prove some silly point and end up being defeated and ridiculed because the plot wouldn't have it any other way. They're basically Team Rocket.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, i'm a big fan of good guys winning in the end but it just doesn't make sense in this one. The whole thing feels artificial and convenient. The bad guys have the upper hand during the whole thing and then the plot just decides that it's time to wrap it up so they magically and miraculously have the good guys win and to make things even worse, apparently they thought that by having a \"sad\" ending people wouldn't notice how poor the whole thing was. Yeah, nice try guys.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, looks great, sounds good, characters are alright, plot is terrible.",

            "content": "I came into the series with what could best be described as \"mild enthusiasm\". I'm a huge WW2 buff, and this seemed like a unique setting, with an interesting take on the war. And as I was watching the early episodes, the setting, and the concept certainly was holding my attention. Unfortunately, as the series progressed, the weight of this series' tropes began to set in, and it ultimately caused it to buckle.  So let's deconstruct it some.\r\nLet's start with one of the good things: the animation.  This is top notch animation, particularly in the color department, and during the action scenes, theanimation is really allowed to shine.  Speaking of which, the action is thoroughly original, and they take every advantage they can with it.  The first scene where we see Izetta go all out is easily one of the best in the series, with her usage of medieval weapons to take down tanks and planes.  It actually might be some of the most creative action I've seen in a while in any anime.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThat all said, the series is still held back back by a story that's thoroughly predictable, and rather one-dimensional leads. Now I'm often the first person to defend cliches in a series, if the series is willing to have fun with the cliches, or makes up for it with an entertaining tone. I honestly can barely remember any of the characters; the only trait I can remember about the Archduchess is that she's the royal idealist, whose idealism is the only spark of light in this cruel world, asking why we can't all just get along (not to mention I can barely even remember her name). The only trait I can really remember from Izetta is that she loves the princess, and the country, and that's it; sometimes she can even straddle the Mary Sue line ever so slightly.  The rest of the good guys can be cleanly sorted into the roles, like the young, optimistic maid, the stern, young bodyguard, the grizzled old general, the pragmatic agent guy, the eccentric foreign woman, the evil foreign scientist, and the evil emperor.  Really, I remember very little from any of them.\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first I really liked the setting, but the story ultimately failed to take advantage of any of this. The good country is the completely good country, and the bad country is the Always Chaotic Evil country, with MAYBE a Token Good Teammate or two, who you can kill and watch be killed without guilt.  It seemed like there were attempts, or at least desires, to try and show the complexity of both sides, but whenever they're brought up, they are promptly put to the side for the love plot between the Archduchess and Izetta.  While I suppose its not bad, per se, it more or less amounts to Izetta flying our heroine around on her magic gun (a phrase I never thought I'd ever type), and the two sitting in the moonlight together, talking about peace and war.  I wouldn't mind, but its time that could've been spent on developing some of the other characters, including the villains, who are often sidelined.  I try fault this more to the series' length, but I have seen anime with similar lengths get as much done.\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, if you don't mind the heavy, and thoroughly predictable tropes, then you might enjoy this series enough. Personally, the story was too predictable, and the characters too one dimensional. \\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

            "content": "You better prepare for an extremely disappointed WWII and Fantasy fanboy's review in this show filled to the brim with potential, but was eventually spilled on the floor thanks to a magic flying gun.\r\nShuumatsu no Izetta a WarXFantasy Crossover show of the Fall 2016 Anime Season. Oh boy.\r\nLet me give you the short review of this show if you don't want to waste your time reading a review about a show that was also a waste of time:\r\nIf you came here hoping for a unique twist on World War 2 Storylines with an interesting twist of Fantasy and magic. Then just throw this in thetrash. No amount of Cool Animation, Soundtrack or Lesbian-undertoned Fanservice can save such a gigantic blob of wasted potential like this one.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me dissect each aspect of this show that contributed into this massive mess.\\n\\n\r\nStory-3/10\\n\r\nWe've had enough Movies, Games, Manga and Anime that had a World War 2 Aspect to it, and had the Nazis. I mean Germanians, being bad guys, killing people ruthlessly because...they're Germanians. I expected that, someone who invests themselves in WWII themed media knows the drill. But they had a potential saving grace, and that was the risk of having FANTASY mixed into the batter. This could've potentially saved this show's bland original concept, with enough Originality and seeing the Characters grow as people, this show could've been good. But it didn't, it provided extremely bland uninteresting and predictable\"plot-twists\", I gave Zero cares about the characters, except Jonas. Because he was the single character that, although seen in almost every type of WWII story, was executed well to drive the plot and make it have any resemblance of emotional interaction with the audience.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7/10\\n\r\nThe animation, background, art and Character design were all really good. But there were so many times, to the point of being uncountable in where the still shots, dialogue shots and hell even the ACTION shots being extremely sloppy in the second half of the show. If the WWII-Fantasy crossover Aesthetic was one of the few things that could've saved this show, then it failed. If it did one thing well, then that's having really pretty girls and Yuri content for me to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7/10\\n\r\nIt was epic if it needed to be, and all in all it was really nice, the Chorale used sends shivers to my spine whenever I hear it. The OP and ED are just usual Edgy songs fitting this show's overall theme. One of the things done better in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5/10\\n\r\nThis show just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The constant nagging of \"THIS COULD'VE BEEN DONE SO MUCH BETTER\" in the back of my head was enough to make me just utterly hate this show, with that was paired how it was absolutely boring at around Episode 5 onward, this just made the show absolutely unbearable. I'm currently just watching it to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-4/10\\n\r\nYou're doing yourself a disservice if you watch this, it's an utter waste of time, that looked good at first. If you think it could be one of the better shows of this season, then you're lying to yourself. I enjoyed Sword Art Online more than this blob of trash, a consistently mediocre show is better than a show brimming with potential that took a turn for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nPP.",
