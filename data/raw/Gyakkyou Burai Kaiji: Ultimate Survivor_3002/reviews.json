            "content": "Kaiji is the devil child [insert Slayer- Hell Awaits soundtrack] among the 2007 Autumn season lineup, an outcast, the underdog just like the character himself &ndash; people take one look at those long noses and run for the hills &ndash; A TENGU IS COMING!! AAARGHH!! \r\nIt also just happens to not only be the best anime of the season; it ranks up among some of the best anime of all time. If there were to be a list of the current best five anime for the 2007 season it would be: 1. Kaiji, 2. Daylight, 3. Daylight, 4. Daylight, 5. Maybe Ghost Hound &ndash; nah,there is still a little more daylight between Kaiji and that show&hellip; Put simply, Kaiji is the type of anime that the gods sitting atop Mt. Olympus watch when they take a break from throwing down lightning bolts, swinging tridents, ruling the underworld or doing whatever gods sitting atop Mt. Olympus do. My reasons are explained below&hellip;    \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, a bit of background. Kaiji is based on Nobuyuki Fukumoto's award winning manga of the same name. More specifically, the anime is based on the first series of the manga containing the first 13 volumes of the story called &lsquo;Kaiji &ndash; Tobaku Mokushikuroku', or, &lsquo;Kaiji &ndash; The Gambling Apocalypse'. As no real English translations of the manga exist, the story is relatively unknown in the West. On the other hand, the manga, which first started being serialized back in 1996, went on to become extremely popular in Japan and Korea, producing two sequel series of manga which are also a superb read and are highly recommended. At the time of writing 38 volumes of the manga have been produced, featuring Kaiji putting it all on the line time and time again. The anime has followed this trend of popularity in the East, Kaiji the anime regular doubles the ratings for shows apparently popular according to this site, such as Minami-ke.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\\n\r\nI am going to be blunt, the character design, like Akagi before it, is &lsquo;bad&rsquo; in the traditional sense &ndash; but in all seriousness this is a very, very good thing. Let me explain by posing a rhetorical question: &ldquo;Have you ever seen a good &lsquo;bad&rsquo; film?&rdquo; For example the film Evil Dead looks as though it has been produced on a 15 dollar budget but god damn it&rsquo;s an awesome film! Titanic on the other hand was made on a bajillion dollar budget, won a whole heap of awards and raked in millions of dollars in profit but let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; IT SUCKED. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji works in a similar way &ndash; the artwork is &lsquo;bad&rsquo; in the same way Evil Dead is, and that&rsquo;s what makes it awesome. Kaiji is not exactly a mainstream anime so it is never going to suit everyone&rsquo;s tastes, but, as with Akagi, Fukumoto&rsquo;s art style really does suit this kind of story &ndash; In pure Rocky fashion, here we see a gritty battler, the underdog in a fight, grappling with underground mobsters to get out of debt, to reach out and grasp the future within his hands &ndash; It&rsquo;s never going to be a pretty picture&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the character designs are a variety of original touches, most notably Fukumoto&rsquo;s trademark, &lsquo;Zawa Zawa&rsquo; sound effect, which is derived from the Japanese word Zawameku, &lsquo;\u3056\u308f\u3081\u304f&rsquo; &ndash; signifying a tense state of agitation. To put it in layman's terms, it is kind of like the feeling you get when you take a dump only to realize that you are out of toilet paper &ndash; ZAWAAA!!! (Apologies for crudeness). In general the voice acting is superb, in particular the standouts being Kaiji&rsquo;s V.O. Masato Hagiwara and the narrator himself, voiced by none other than Fumihiko Tachiki, the dude who is the narrator in PRIDE! Hideki Taneuchi picks up where he left off in Akagi providing an amazing score for Kaiji. Music is used in Kaiji to a perfect degree, and really helps build the ever-present underlying tension as Kaiji gambles with his life. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s face it, an anime with an art style as flipped out as it is, Kaiji (the anime) is never really going to get anywhere without a decent story. Well, it is in this area that the anime really shines. Thoroughly engrossing, this is one of the few animes around that makes it seem like a painfully long wait for the next episode to come out. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the basic plot shows Kaiji&rsquo;s struggle to get out of debt, to survive, the thematically driven story is as deep as an abyss &ndash; Fukumoto&rsquo;s world view portrayed throughout Kaiji is at times deeply profound, at other times it simply rocks the core of your soul. Yes, the plot simply revolves around a series of gambles, but the world of gambling that Kaiji (the character) is drawn into is merely used as an analogy about the struggle to survive in the real world, offering existential notions on the human race itself, where we as individuals stand in the &lsquo;rat race&rsquo;. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the statements that this anime makes are despairingly stark; sombre realities that really hit home. You will want to disagree with the scornful remarks made by mobsters like Tonegawa and Co. about how the debtors have lived their lives up to this point, but you can&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t because they simply state the harsh realities of life; realities that we choose to turn our heads away from in everyday life. While mobsters like Tonegawa appearing in this anime may be considered &lsquo;bad guys&rsquo; in the traditional sense because they are wrong morally, they have a far greater perception about the realities of life and, dare I say it, simply act as they do to survive themselves in a dog eat dog world&hellip;? \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kaiji on the surface, features and draws out just about every possible emotion on the spectrum &ndash; the thrill of victory, the despair of defeat, the grief of seeing comrades fall, the anger of betrayal, the fear of looking death in the eye&hellip; While this makes for a gut-wrenchingly intense enough experience as it is, the thematic psychological commentary into the human condition that makes up the core that is Kaiji the anime is even more provocative and carries a lot more weight than the gambling action itself. Simply put, this really pulls &lsquo;Kaiji&rsquo; above the realm of a simple anime and onto a higher plane. If you watch this show and find that it doesn&rsquo;t really have an effect on you, try watching the show again once you&rsquo;ve entered the work force &ndash; that is when things will really hit home...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\\n\r\nFukumoto&rsquo;s world is world filled with men &ndash; the sole female survivor of the Gambling Apocalypse appears for about a minute at most. Hey, it&rsquo;s one whole female character more than Akagi, a 100% increase!! Ahem.. Sorry guys &ndash; put away those tissues you had readied, if you look at anime for the fan-service, then you&rsquo;re going to be one sorry fan. Look on the bright side though; brain-dead harem comedies are in plentiful supply&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nYes it truly is a man&rsquo;s world in Kaiji, men gambling on the edge of despair. I won&rsquo;t bother laying out each and every character for you, mainly because finding out about the personalities, traits and motivations of the characters that inhibit Kaiji&rsquo;s world for yourself is a large part of the experience. I will give brief mention however to the lead, Kaiji himself because Kaiji&rsquo;s character development is another one of this anime&rsquo;s great points. As the plot summary suggests, Kaiji starts out the show a loser on his way out. A character simply floating through life, someone who chooses to not chase down &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;, living in the medical sense that he has a beating heart and working lungs, but really &lsquo;living&rsquo; to the fullest sense of the word. Not a real inspiring guy right? No, he isn&rsquo;t, not to begin with. But as his dawdling way of life, where he cannot really see things as they &lsquo;really&rsquo; are, places him into his predicament (i.e. a mountain of unpaid debts), his predicament is also what saves him, for it is only when Kaiji confronts the fear of death does he realize the value of his very existence, in a sense he &lsquo;awakens&rsquo; from a deep sleep. With his back against the wall, he grows to become an absolute god of gambling in one sense, but in another way his development as a strong human being (both mentally and emotionally) is really what makes him an engaging character, one of the best leads I have ever seen in an anime. Personally I love the character of Kaiji and feel a lot more in touch with his struggle than I ever did with Akagi&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\\n\r\nGod this is a long review&hellip; And I still feel as though I have only just scraped the surface of what makes Kaiji so great&hellip; Ah well, you can figure the rest out if you watch the show. I&rsquo;m not going to guarantee that everyone is going to like it &ndash; hey, everyone has different opinions, tastes, personalities&hellip; But if I can convince someone who had no interest in Kaiji to at least try it, then I feel my job here is done. Excellent anime. Top marks.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "This review was originally written after the first arc, and has since been revised to cover my opinions of the entire show, with minimal spoilers.\r\nStory: Itoh Kaiji, a bum with 3 million yen worth of debt gets into a gambling cruise to pay off his debts.  The game played on the cruise is Gentei Janken (Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors), where the players get four cards of each type and battle it out.  What's the catch?  Several things; each card can only be used once, cards can be bought off of other players, con men abound, and losing forces one into the vaguely established buthorrible &quot;other room&quot;. Also, one must not only break even in the actual matches, but also earn enough through the buying and selling of &quot;stars&quot; (3 of which equate a trip off the ship) to pay off their debts.  A simple premise which gets expounded on to a cleverly intense degree.  That, mind you, is the first arc.  The later arcs follow up with themes on society, and it gets philosophical in a gritty sort of way.  But, unfortunately, the&quot;ending&quot; is not anything of the sort, devoid of climax.  The last 4 episode arc feels a bit tacked on, and leaves season 2 wide open.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I looked at the promo picture, and I thought one thing: Elves.  These noses are big, and the faces look pretty weird at first.  However, once one gets past the first five minutes, it really becomes apparent just how expressive these faces can be, as the characters go through one emotional crisis after another.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nice intro, nice ending.  Where the sound really shines, though, is the intense scenes.  It's well integrated into the rest of the show's experience - so much so that I didn't notice it except after watching a second or third time.  However, once I did look into the more dramatic half of the soundtrack, I found it a fairly nice score.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, soundtrack isn't the best part of this show's auditory arsenal either.  That honor goes to the best voice acting I've ever heard.  It may sound silly, but I have never heard anyone cry as effectively as Yanaka Hiroshi's character.  Ever. The voice acting really captures the gritty, dreamless atmosphere which the show exhudes.  Also, an extremely dramatic narration often helps the story along, and helps the viewer make sense of sometimes subtle mindgames.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sheeit- there's just too much to say.  Men (absolutely no women in this show) betting their lives can make for pretty deep plots, and this is perhaps one of the very best.  Kaiji himself is a normally hopeless person whose survival instincts lead him to fight off the system intended to break him down, and he takes himself down a number of pegs to help people who have nothing to give him (and occasionally stab him in the back).  The rest of the cast of characters is a bit less scrupulous, and Kaiji suffers three major betrayals by con men and friends alike in the first nine episodes.  In the antecedent arcs 2-4, shit hits the fan for our hero, though he is never betrayed after arc 1. Plenty of manly tears make the whole process very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nA major part of Kaiji that I feel I shoud mention is it's haves vs. have-nots dynamic.  Rich &quot;haves&quot; are constantly responsible for the suffering of impoverished &quot;have-nots&quot;, and situation which naturally causes tearful frustration for the have-nots.  At times the narrator's observations of both sides sound like Hobbesian logic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A couple of major highlights: fistfights, naked wrestling behind a one-way mirror, and a fat guy being kicked in the corpulence.  The presentation is terrific, dramatic, and bold. Just be aware that, when the chips are down and everything is at stake, there's a very real possibility that Kaiji will lose...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kaiji=Pwn+Max Drama-A Decent Ending.  If you don't want to be dissappointed, stop watching at episode 22 and wait for season 2 before watching episodes 23-26.  There's no reason to skip the first 22, though.  If you have any free time, what are you doing still reading this review?  Watch it now!",

            "content": "---The review contains spoilers---\r\n3/10. Explanation:\r\nStarts off strange to say the least. A young man is deep in debt and is being given a chance to repay it by boarding a cruise ship to do the 'gambling' (?). At this point I was already a bit wary, because why would  a loan company give an opportunity to repay the debt and get rich on top of that to somebody who owns them money? Surely that's not a profitable thing to do. Why not collect the money from them or make them repay somehow, idk. On the ship though, this series becomes amazing, and I meantop-tier material, the plot is well thought out, the mechanics of exploiting the faults of the restricted rock-paper-scissors are very well done, there's betrayal involved, competition is dynamic with worthy opponents, kaiji's brain is being turned inside out from all the stimulation and he really becomes a much much better gambler after that, who is able to think outside the box and quickly adapt to various difficulties he faces on later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever after that this anime completely destroys itself. The so called 'gambling' is no longer gambling but rather a selection of sadistic game for pleasure of the wealthy. By the way I hate this trope, the rich that make poor  risk their lives to do crazy stupid things for money, which involves gore and death that supposedly gives them great pleasure somehow. This is completely unnatural, this goes against human common sense of what is pleasurable and what is merely disgusting, and eventhough such twisted people might indeed exist, there would be nothing of such scale of cruelty that is portrayed in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with the show is not the fact that 2nd half of it is pure garbage from the logical point of view, or that the 'gambling' games are unoriginal and not intellectual in any way, but rather the pacing. It's so fucking slow it's unreal, the 'card-game' arc with Tonegawa lasts forever for no apparent reason, the narrator repeats everything at least THREE times that is obvious to absolutely anybody watching who has at least 1/4 of the mean IQ value. The series was dragged out for so long that I genuinely started to lose the feeling of tension and suspense that you develop when engaged with the series. About 5 episodes before completion I was so annoyed that i wanted to drop the show despite being so close to the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me was how the outside people were brought into the plot. There were a bunch of crippled men (after the disgusting sadistic 'gambling' competition) who were cheering Kaiji on and helping him moraly and providing first-aid. WHY????????????? All those delinquents hated each others guts, treated each other like trash during the 'cruise ship' arc, and then they suddenly developed friendly feelings for kaiji when he won the 20million from Tonegawa. Were they just after the money? Perhaps, but then they had plenty of opportunities to steal the money whilst kaiji was busy, but they didnt. But even if they weren't after the money why was kaiji so willing to trust them after being betrayed so many times in the first part of the series?\\n\\n\r\nThe show is simply put illogical, everybody acts irrationally, completely against what real-life humans would do in most of the situations. I can't stress that enough. This is a show about gambling after all, psychological interactions needed to be thought out properly, but instead we get this. It rendered the show completely useless.",

            "content": "Edit: added more stuff and reworded some things\r\nWhat drew me to Kaiji was the interesting premise, gambling. Considering the manga had over 30+ volumes, there had to be something to this. However, the question pops in my mind &ldquo;how is one able to make an anime about gambling?&rdquo; In the end, I found that a more important question is &ldquo;how can one make a good anime about gambling?&rdquo; and Kaiji isn&rsquo;t a very good example. \r\nItoh Kaiji owes 3 million yen to the yakuza and is forced to go into a special cruise ship to gamble his way out of debt.  The gamble isbased on rock, paper, scissor, while simple at first there is quite a bit flexibility to mess with the system in your favor. This is what makes the first arc so interesting. My roommate and I discussed the many possibilities after each episode and eagerly waited to see what Kaiji was gonna do next.  Near the end of this arc the story really started to drag on, but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad as I though the story would end on episode 13.  If I were to rate Kaiji based purely on the first arc it would have gotten a high 7 or low 8. However, Kaiji didn&rsquo;t end on the first arc&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nThe next arc consisted of 3 major gambles, human derby, e-card, and umm&hellip; &ldquo;awesome box.&rdquo; Here Kaiji loses what made the first arc so interesting, the open nature of the gambles.  The human derby arc wasn&rsquo;t really a gamble per say, instead it was a task to complete for money and entertainment of very rich guest.  Here Kaiji tires to create human drama and really delve into the minds of the characters.  Well there&rsquo;s only one problem with this, Kaiji never had strong characters.  The people participating in the human derby were newly introduced and we don&rsquo;t know anything about them, they are effectively faceless.  So why should the viewer care what happens to them?  People die everyday so why don&rsquo;t we weep for them too?  Yes, I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s quite tragic and on some level I do feel sad for the characters.  Even for the title character, Kaiji, I felt very little, this is because the first arc only really focuses on the gambles and very little on the Kaiji himself.  So there is no big pay off, so to speak when things get dramatic (ie My Hime).  Instead it&rsquo;s more like watching the 10pm news.       \\n\\n\r\nIn this arc they also really delve into philosophy and psychology. The philosophical aspects were too in your face, reminding me of the extremely blatant Ghost in the Shell movies, especially Innocence.   This is because of the delivery, long winded speeches from supposed sage.  This wise old man steps on to the podium and lectures not only Kaiji but the viewer as well.  There is nothing subtle about this nor was it very grey, this is how the world is because he said so.  As for the psychological aspects, visuals were often used to convey the inner struggles, its just that they really over did it and kept repeating the same damn thing.  This leads to my major complaint overall with Kaiji.  \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made Kaiji lose the most point is the fact that they dragged things for way too long, far longer than the first arc.  The omnipresent narrator didn&rsquo;t help either; I was ready to scream at the screen &ldquo;shut up, we get the idea already!&rdquo; As for the other 2 gambles, they faired a bit better&hellip;only a little bit. They were actual gambles, but featured the same things that made the human derby arc bad, too dragged out, shallow drama, and overt philosophical ramblings.  However, in the E-card arc it did give me back a little of the &ldquo;how&rsquo;s Kaiji gonna get out of this mess&rdquo; feeling.  Although, the nature of the gamble is very closed, thus I remain a passive viewer.  Finally the way those gambles ended was way too contrived for my tastes, suffering from the &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo; syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nLet me add that Kaiji is extremely overt with the way it handles itself, from the emotions to the thoughts of the characters themselves.  In some ways it feels a bit caricature but I guess that&rsquo;s mainly the art that gives that impression.  Visual metaphors are used to ram their ideas into the viewers head as well as the omnipresent narrator constantly tells the viewer exactly what is going on.   It doesn&rsquo;t help that the narrator is using an overly dramatic voice, reminiscent of movie guy.    \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was excellent; it was very smooth as well as extremely consistent, as expected by Madhouse. For a very dialogue based story they made use of many visual metaphors, once again it gets old fast. It would have been better if they simply used more dramatic angles and shots as in Death Note. Art is well&hellip;ugly, very ugly, which makes me wonder why Fukumoto (the mangaka) was allowed to keep drawing manga.  He should have someone else draw and he&rsquo;ll work on the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is easily the best part of Kaiji, I loved the instrumental pieces and was surprised at how good the music was when I listened to the ost.  Not only that the music was especially fitting considering the gritty tone of Kaiji.  I just wished they used it more often.  Most of the time there isn&rsquo;t music, instead the narrator sets the tone and the trademark &ldquo;zawazawa.&rdquo; \\n\\n\r\nOh let us not forget about the ending&hellip; Kaiji ended on an extremely open note, so open that I wondered where the next episode was gonna air.  While open endings can work, they only work for character based stories and Kaiji didn&rsquo;t have the story structure to support such an ending.  I&rsquo;m not going to be that critical on the ending as I&rsquo;m sure they plan on animating the rest of the Kaiji story.  What I am gonna be critical on is the fact that Kaiji seemed to have grown dumber in the end.  Ok let me rephrase that he&rsquo;s grown smarter as a gambler but dumber as a person.    There is a sense of irony when Kaiji, minus 4 fingers, an ear, and even more in debt, was talking about how he&rsquo;s stronger now and will defeat the chairman next time.  There is no evidence showing that he stronger as a person, only as a gambler.  Even during the interlude between the first and second arc he is shown unable to live in normal society.  Now I feel he is even more unable to adapt and live under normal circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nI was an active viewer during the first arc and that was what made things interesting and fun.  However, when they took that aspect away I was made into a passive viewer.  Here, the flaws with the narrative, pacing and characters became apparent.  The pacing was horribly dragged out and extremely slow.  Perhaps I would rate Kaiji higher if I didn&rsquo;t watch it weekly and marathoned it, but what&rsquo;s done is done.  In addition, they suffer from the &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo; syndrome too much in the 2nd half.   Now that think about it I didn&rsquo;t really mention the characters in my review yet. Well that&rsquo;s because all the characters are flat.  As for Kaiji himself, he is someone with no past and based on the ending, he also has no future.",

            "content": "Kaiji, maybe is one of the genius anime that would be rarely be consumed these days. Many reasons for it, like people these days are just loooking for anime which have cute girls (or we can said seeking for MOE). Cant blame on it since anime industry now are using cute girls for their sales and of course for seeking profit.  Anyway, there is no cute girls in Kaiji so please step out if you\u2019re looking for it. But honestly you would miss a show that would make hold your breath from the beginning to the end.\r\nKaiji itself have a simple story, Its abouta man named Kaiji who is a thief  but then his life changed when  he is being visited by a debt collector. The debt collector said Kaiji has an unpaid loan which Kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate. But his work-mate had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji. Hopelessly to find a money to pay the loan. Then he find there is one way to solve his loan and that was playing a gamble.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so many things that makes Kaiji is so attractive, one of them is the gamble or we can said a \u201cgame\u201d that Kaiji must play for paying his loan. What they\u2019re playing is just a simple game like Jankenpon but simply its not just a simple Jankenpon, Fukumoto (Kaiji\u2019s creator) makes it into a serious and psychological game that you\u2019ve ever seen.  The game is clever and usually depends on  psychological to win the game.  And if you\u2019re thinking the game is hard to understand then dont worry, since they\u2019re really explained it well and moreover, its just a simple game (like Jankenpon or anything like that) that been modified  a bit by Nobuyuki to make the game more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnother fun part about Kaiji is guessing. This series is really know how to keep you on your toes and as you keep guessing as the stakes get higher and the games become more absurd,Like any mystery and detective show, we\u2019re usually trying to guess on whats gonna happen next or probably trying to solve whats the trick between it. Well, Kaiji is not mystery or detective show but at least thats what i felt when i watch this show. The way how Kaiji solving each game is really remarkable and unexpected. And another great things about it was how logical Kaiji solution was. Well, sometimes another series use some illogical and unrealistic tricks but not in Kaiji, They\u2019re all making sense and that part what makes Kaiji is so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspects that really prominent is the art. Kaiji\u2019s art is superbly good, not in the term of realistic nor catchy color but its in term of the compatibility within the story.  Sometimes some anime missing the point on what art should be, like an example the themes of an anime is thriller but the art looks so colorful makes the thriller atmosphere being wasted. And Good things Kaiji isnt like that. Their art is probably the most unique one, they using thick lines for the characters to make it like a comical style and the character design is unique, probably you cant find it in anywhere. The originality style that Fukumoto (Creator of Kaij) bring probably hard to watch for someone who\u2019re not used watching something extraordinary like this but the comical style that Kaiji use is bring out the advantage for themselves. Like it can increasing the expressive of each characters  so we can feel the emotion within them. Its truly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other way to make Kaiji more epic than the sound.  The background song or the soundtrack within every scenes is really remarkable, they\u2019re fitting well for every scenes that occurs. Like when  Kaiji is being despair, there is a sound that you would notice along the series, \u201cZAWAAA\u201d or it can be translated as agitation. The sound like the one i notice before increasing the despair atmosphere and thrilling the audience. Its like the song forced us to feel the same way as the kaiji does. Well, its not astonishing since the music composer is Hideki Tanuichi, the one who responsible for Aoi Bungaku and Death note music. He did briliantly again in this anime. The opening song in this anime is also amazing, \u201cMirai wa Bokura no Te no Naka\u201d that being played by Hakuryu is really fits with the anime. This 45 seconds opening song is quite wacky and random but somehow this is quite addicting. After talking about the song, lets talking about the seiyuu voice. There is two name that i should mention for this. Hagiwara Masato  and Fumihiko Tachiki, They are the one who responsible for  making Kaiji become so epic. Masato voice is really fits with Kaiji, his voice that heavy is really suitable with kaiji that a middle aged man. He succesfully makes Kaiji like himself but in anime version. In other words, Masato is bring the life for Kaiji. For Fumihiko, his roles in this anime is narrator. But dont take this lightly, because  his energetic and passionate voice in every narrating the story would stun you up.  \\n\\n\r\nIf there was something that makes me so addicting with this series,it was  Kaiji and the other characters. Kaiji is one of the best main characters out there, but he can also the most lamest main characters. There is too many way to describe kaiji, he can be a hero but also a loser. Loser in this term is how Kaiji sometimes following his desires for gambling and ended up to have much of debt but in the other way, when he was in pinch, he could turned into a heroic character. Last,  his personality that clever and tricky make this story become more interesting to follow.  Not just kaiji, The other characters also one of the aspects what makes Kaiji is so amazing. Every characters that appears in this anime isnt just for a side show,they playing some important roles too  andThe other characters acts like what in real life do, like when you are in the pinch with your friends and you have a chance for escape for yourselves, what would you do? I believe if we are in that positions, we are choosing  for escape by ourselves and abandon our friends. That question is for describing what the characters in kaiji is. They would do anything for saving themselves, betraying is one of the way that they would do. The realistic things that every characters do make this anime become more interesting to see. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, after all mumbling that i said before i can safely said Kaiji is one the anime that you should watch. Despite its lackness in moe and cute girls on it, Kaiji would bring you an amazing thriller story with just some simple game.  From that simple game, prepare for feeling some intense scenes that would make you hold the breath from beginning to the end.\\n",

            "content": "I can see everyone staring at the straight 10s on the board and either think im being biased, or that I grade too easy.  According to the ratings here, I grade more than a point lower on average than everyone else.  Well, in any case, I will explain why every category deserved a 10.\r\nStory: While not being too complex, it exists.  The main character has worked himself down to having a massive debt that would take him countless years to pay back honestly.  Everybody Kaiji gambles with are people who once were hopeless gamblers that are given a chance to winit all back.  Although the story doesnt sound to be the too intense, this anime focuses on the strategic part of the gambles rather than on what is going on.  Some might think I should then have given the story an 8 or a 7, but I think that any more story would take away from the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Why such low values on the art everyone?  This art is unique, and its hilarious.  Whenever I see Kaiji from a side shot, I almost start crying with tears of laughter.  They capture emotion in the drawings of the characters, so I feel as though the akward designs of each character fit their personality extremely well.  And there is enough of a background to keep you interested, nothing very groundbreakig going on there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Im not a big sound man, but the seiyuus (spelling?) seemed to portray plenty of emotion, and the bad guys talked like you wanted to punch them in the face.  Effective voice acting.  While the music isnt very memorable or anything, its the perfect music for sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  For an anime that focuses on situational suspense, this is the music you should use.  Something catchy will take you away from the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Excellent villains portrayed to be absolute jerskoffs.  I absolutely love to hate them.  You got the pompous gamblers who think they are all that, and then you got Kaiji.  Kaiji seems to have a feer of dedication.  In the beginning he didnt do much of anything.  After being faced with the gambling trials, Kaiji is starting to learn how to think up ways of getting out of certain situations, and is willing to take sensible risk.  The anime is nowhere near over, so I have yet to see his full character development, but he is definitely a different person in episode 14 than he was in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  As you can see, I watched the first 12 or 13 episodes in one night.  I was glued to the screen the entire time in absolute awe.  Whats gonna happen!!!!!  Havent gotten a feeling like this since I first started watching anime, which is quite a feat in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Great characters, great development, seems to be executed well, and is on its way to becoming a masterpiece.  Although the slightly non-cutting edge animation might be what deters people from this anime, and what make it fall short of masterpiece status.  Its an 07/08 anime and looks like it could have been animation in like 01/02.  Doesnt bother me all too much, I dont need Hayate the Combat Butler resolution 24/7.",

            "content": "What happens when you take the \"No one win's but I\" attitude and you place it into the hands of a bunch of desperate, shameless losers?  Why, you get Kaiji of course!\r\nArt - 7\r\nI understand that the art style was supposed to echo the tone and content of the story.  Many will say that the character design is supposed to depict &ldquo;real-life, gritty&rdquo; characters.  I would disagree.  I think that Kaiji is a very stylized, over-exaggeration of &ldquo;gritty, real-life.&rdquo;  If this is supposed to indeed be a more realistic art style, I just don&rsquo;t think everyone has pointy chins, noses,and eyes, even if you are Asian.  What especially throws everything over into the hyper stylized corner is the very harsh, thick, black lines and angular nature of character designs. It just wasn't my cup of tea.  However, I will give it credit for being consistent within the show, and throughout various body types.  That is a difficult style to maintain across characters, shows that strive for such quality in execution, such as Bleach, should take note.  I also have a problem with the bad integration of CG in this show, some of it was needless, like fountains and light fixtures, and it was a distraction in a show that was otherwise well directed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nHonestly, I don&rsquo;t remember, good or bad, anything about the music in Kaiji.  What I will say regarding voice acting is that it matches the exaggerated tone and style of the show, so that is a plus.  The degree of &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of a character is mimicked in the &ldquo;evilness&rdquo; of his voice.  This goes double for the wimpy voices of the &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nThe title character of the show, Kaiji Itou is a bit of an anomaly.  Utterly unlikable, he is a character crafted for the viewer to pour copious amounts of sympathy onto, thereby making the viewer feel much better about himself.  The execution of characterizing Kaiji is a job well done.  After a couple of episodes, the viewer clearly understands his motives and can predict his reactions.  The problem however, is that he is so predictable and starkly characterized that he quickly becomes a parody of himself with his over-emotional reactions by about halfway through the series due to a lack in growth.  Kaiji himself is a horribly progressed character who fails to learn from any of his mistakes. Even if the point of the show were to paint the portrait of a deluded loser, I don't think that writing for Kaiji supported his journey at all.  Unfortunately, because ultimately, this show is about Kaiji, the supporting characters are quite bland, forgettable, and one-dimensional.  Everyone is sharply one personality type, with no nuance or depth to differentiate themselves from one another.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nInitially, the show does a great job of setting up Kaiji and the overall tone of the show.  There is a natural sense of humor that mixes well with the more adrenaline inducing gambling scenes.  After the first round of gambling is over, however, thing go at a slower pace, and proceed much more predictably.  Too much time is spent explaining the rules of the each game, and because a proper job is never done, the rules regarding strategies have to be reiterated.  There&rsquo;s always a twist, and Kaiji always manages to find someway to claw himself out of total defeat.  Kaiji continuously attempts at forcing the viewer to empathize with the bevy of &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; characters by making someone cry in virtually every episode.  This is a problem because none of the characters are well developed enough, besides, perhaps Kaiji, to fully empathize with.  There are a wide array of emotions at the writers&rsquo; disposal to add depth and meaning to the cast, so with the varying backgrounds and personalities of the characters, I felt it was hopelessly shallow of the show to only display frustration or despair through crying and bitching for every character in the same way.  Everything seemed to suffer under the gimmickry that is the gambling set up.  However, byy far the biggest problem that I had with Kaiji though was the terrible visualizations of metaphors. They aren't any axioms or sayings that one hasn&rsquo;t learned by freshman year in high school.  As a viewer, I'm not so stupid that when I hear the narrator say that &quot;Death was breathing onto the napes of each competitors' neck&quot; that I need to see it play out on screen, that is the point of figurative language. The narration was quite useless, and 9 times out of ten insulted my intelligence by regurgitating what is very clear on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this show at the beginning.  It had a great mix of familiarity and unabashed ness (very much like it&rsquo;s main character) that worked very well.  Though I did enjoy seeing a lot of losers plummet to their doom, unfortunately, it couldn&rsquo;t sufficiently maintain any of the momentum it had accumulated in the first few episodes, and suffered under the weight of its flatness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nAt the very end, yes, Kaiji is a bold and courageous attempt at an anime.  This show was very disappointing for me because of what I saw as promising early on. I think that the creators at almost every step second-guessed that what they were doing would actually read across clearly on the screen, leading to much of the redundancy in imagery and writing, and in attempts to herd the viewers to a certain &ldquo;emotional space.&rdquo;  Kaiji just tries so hard to be different that it suffers in style over substance.",

            "content": "Kaiji Ultimate Survivor explores human vices, the temptation of evil & the shattering of hope all through the usage of gambling. Kaiji is a psychological thriller building much tension as Kaiji's thoughts on society & goodwill are put into question.\r\nThe story of Kaiji begins when he takes a massive debt from this friend forcing him to resort to gambling on a secluded cruise called Espoir. (French for Hope) From this point onwards, Kaiji enters the gambling world where games cost millions of money & where a person's life matter less than money. Throughout the series, there's many challenges that emphasizes hope being nothing than adream; that human beings will backstab each other for the sake of their survival. Half of the anime follows this grim realistic concept as Kaiji learns society's vices through the most hellish experience.\\n\\n\r\nI wish not to explain any further of the content found in Kaiji as it will lead to some spoilers. All I can say is be prepared to marathon the anime in the following sittings.\\n\r\n1-9      Espoir\\n\r\n10-15 Starside Hotel\\n\r\n16-22 Slave & Emperor\\n\r\n23-26 Tissue Box Lottery \\n\\n\r\nThe music of Kaiji is performed by Taniuchi Hideki whose done music for series such as Death Note & Aoi Bungaku Series giving a suspenseful & ominous tone in the Kaiji anime. Animation is done by Madhouse but due to being a gambling series revolved around dialogue, the animation constantly looks good & being dramatic when it needs to be. I should note that the mangaka's artstyle is very angular with characters having thick outlines & pointy chins or curvy faces. The anime for Kaiji is also accompanied by a narrator that can be over the top at times possibly to relive the viewers' tension. Narrator is voiced by Tachiki Fumiko (Madao, Zaraki, Akainu, Youpi,). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the Kaiji series can be very depressing as it constantly breaks human will leaving them to die full of despair. Its 2nd season however, offers the light at the end of the tunnel but is a bit dragged in its final arc. In this anime, Kaiji is pushed to the limit where he utilizes as of his intelligence to achieve survival at the cost of others lives. Lastly, expect a lot of crying in this anime that may make its viewers feel the same anguish as the characters in the series. Kaiji Ulitimate Survivor challenges morality due to the influence of human greed & this series possess the most despicable anime villains that I ever encountered. While the characters have no super powers and are placed in a realistic world makes the concepts of Kaiji all the more disturbing & relatable to anyone.",

The art is the first thing you will notice, but don't let the cover fool you; this anime is pretty well-drawn.  The style fits, and you won't even notice anything unusual after 5-10 minutes of watching.  The music and ambient sounds are some of the best I've come across, as well as most (but definitely not all) of the voice acting. This comes across to give the series a very creepy and believable atmosphere.\r\nThe story isbasically what you would expect.  It's probably the reason you want to watch Kaiji, if you're a fan of Battle Royale or Shadow Star Narutaru-type tragidrama.  It also has many elements of a mystery or puzzle-solving anime that were rather enjoyable to unravel.  As for shock value, there are a few disturbing moments, but it's not nearly as shocking as I had hoped, so I was let down in that department.  Still, I found it very enjoyable for its premise, and I was not disappointed by the gambles or the characters and the way they handle their adversity.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the cons.  The BIG cons.  First, every arc is way too long.  The reason for this is mostly the narrator, who will start to annoy you right around the second episode.  Rather than allow you, the viewer, to grasp Kaiji's situations with your own eyes, heart, and common sense, he will explain everything for you in the most obvious and melodramatic way possible, using similes and metaphors that will remind you of bad 40's radio programs.  Oh, and each of these bad metaphors is displayed onscreen as a literal interpretation (Kaiji leaping across an imaginary crevice to overcome his fears, for example), to make you feel even more condescended.  Subtlety is something that was mastered by series like Evangelion and Higurashi, and it is most certainly not present here.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the crying.  There is way too much crying.  I don't mind the dialogue, but it just always happens to be accompanied by crying, even when the situation doesn't call for tears.  There's even happy crying!  This may seem minor, but combined with the cheesy narrator and long anticlimactic story arcs, it's very distracting and only serves to lessen my interest in what happens.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there you have it.  I love gambling, tragedy, and dialogue, so of course I enjoyed this series.  In certain moments I was feeling true fear out of sympathy for the characters, and excitement for what was to come.  Unfortunately, the number of times I had to look away or do something else because I was bored/annoyed took some points away from what really could have been one of my favorite animes.  I don't see how anyone can give this a 10, since the narrator alone drags it down to 8 for me.  I think most \"normal\" anime fans should probably avoid it, and go try Monster or Higurashi instead.",

            "content": "With the various 10\u2019s all dominating the top reviews for Kaiji on MAL, I found it even more necessary to get a review written of my own for this series.  Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is an anime focusing on suspense and intense twists and turns along the way of its storytelling.  This series had me on the edge of my seat at times, but I became bored with it at others due to certain segments being drawn out longer than necessary.  Let\u2019s break down each section individually.\r\nNOTE- This review contains spoilers.\r\nThe unique style of storytelling in Kaiji is what really makesit suspenseful and gripping.  Kaiji is a malingerer in his twenties who finds himself behind in massive debt due to some poor choices made during gambling and co-signing a loan for a less-than-reliable friend.  He is therefore approached by some sort of loan shark with an opportunity to erase his large debt and start fresh.  Of course, there is a catch.  What unfolds is a series of intense life-or-death gambles that will put you on the edge of your seat.  One important thing to note in Kaiji is that this is not an uplifting story of redemption\u2026 not at all.  Expect few victories when you watch this anime, as it constantly seems that Kaiji ends up on the foul end of things.  This helped make Kaiji even more unique with the community becoming saturated with overpowered harem animes.  \\n\\n\r\nI was impressed with the sheer intensity of the \u201cgames\u201d that Kaiji and the others play in attempt to wash away their debts.  The initial \u201crock, paper scissors\u201d gamble seems purely luck based on the surface, but it becomes much more intricate as Kaiji starts to become betrayed and formulates his own internal strategies.  It also showcases the true nature of the human persona with the deceit unfolding at the end when he needed his friends to save him the most.  I can agree with the multiple comparisons Kaiji has to Deathnote in the complex mapping out of plans and ideas\u2026 even though the route they end up taking may be completely different.  I wanted to cheer for Kaiji when he thought of a genius strategy, and cry with him when his morale was at its lowest.  It\u2019s hard for me to become that emotionally attached to a character I don\u2019t particularly like, but the storytelling was just that good.  The ledge crossing game quickly became my favorite due to the common fear I have of heights.  I could imagine myself in Kaiji and the other\u2019s shoes and actually ended up feeling somewhat nauseous due to the intensity of the situation.        \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, this score was prevented from being a 10 due to the annoyance I had with the narrator and some of the drug out sequences.  I felt the need for a narrator in this series was entirely pointless, and only detracted from the anime.  Whenever he talked, I was like \u201cOkay, yeah I got that part thanks.\u201d  With the narrator to confirm our estimations of what would happen next at every turn, the hypothesizing from the viewer was ultimately ruined.  Also, some of the scenes near the end of the series (particularly with E Card) were paced too slow and felt extremely drawn out.  Sometimes this added to the empathy you would feel for Kaiji in his losses, but other times I found myself wanted to yell, \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it already!\u201d  The series concluded on a melancholy note, but left room for interpreting an eventual sequel.  Kaiji was a cut above the rest when it came to unique storytelling elements, and it became a breath of fresh air with an anticipation factor resonating within me throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Kaiji really only has three characters that really receive any sort of development.  Our main protagonist is one you can really feel for.  He\u2019s young, behind the eight ball but has a thirst for success and vengeance which assured me that he\u2019d never back down to a challenge issued to him.  Having this personality also allowed the series to progress in the manner that it did, and Kaiji\u2019s patience and mental fortitude was constantly tested by the gambles he encountered.  That being said, there wasn\u2019t much character development to be had other than what was incorporated in Kaiji\u2019s scheming and plots during gambles.  You wanted to root for him regardless, but I found myself wondering how he got into the life of gambling in the first place, and some of the decisions he made near the end of the series (i.e. the choice to challenge the director) felt a tad uncharacteristic of someone in his shoes.  The director of the irregular gambling organization, Kazutaka Hyoudou was a straight devil.  He was creepily aroused by the sight of individuals suffering, even when it came down to his own right hand man.  I enjoyed the interactions and mind games he and Kaiji shared in the final moments of the lottery game where he chalked his countless victories up to predetermined luck, based on his own social standing.  I also liked Tonegawa\u2019s character and how Kaiji grew to feel a sense of respect for him as the series went on.  The scene with him bowing before Kazutaka on the hot plate was one of the most uncomfortable scenes I can recall from an anime.  The rest of the characters felt more like filler and neither added or detracted from the overall series.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, Kaiji can turn a lot of people off to it purely based on its atypical style of art.  I personally didn\u2019t like it, but I was given a disclaimer prior to even starting the series that I have to learn to get past the art style if I want to truly enjoy the show.  After all, Kaiji is not about flashy artwork or cutesy character models.  Hell, I\u2019m quite certain there\u2019s only one female in the entire anime to look at.  The environments and backgrounds are drawn nicely, and I never felt as if the artists were being lazy during dialogue scenes... which there are a LOT of.  The sound is actually very refreshing and impressive in Kaiji.  The OP is a punk rock anthem focused on nonconformity and punches you right in the face with sheer intensity.  It\u2019s short, which I loved as well.  Too many a time, animes suffer from having intros extending too long and detract from the viewer\u2019s anticipation level.  The ED reminds me of something out of a Tarrantino movie, I loved it.  The rest of the soundtrack is decent, but I couldn\u2019t help but become confused by the \u201cZawa zawa, ZAWA\u201d sound effects randomly snuck in.  After further investigation, I now know that this is a staple in the creator Fukumoto\u2019s animes and is the Japanese word for an intense or agitating moment.  I understand it now, but it still feels unnecessary.  Voice acting was also pretty good, I loved Hagiwara Masato\u2019s role as Kaiji and thought he did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some minor flaws it had, I really enjoyed Kaiji overall.  It was definitely a breath of fresh air in the anime community and one that many people might overlook based on its unusual artwork.  I urge you to give it a chance, and you\u2019ll quickly see how this series is praised highly on MAL.  Though I can\u2019t give it a ten based on the issues I had with the show, a solid 8 is in order for this anime.  Thank you all for reading this review and have a great day!",

            "content": "Kaiji is an anime you would probably avoid at first glance. To be honest, I did too when I first saw it. It stayed in the back of my mind for a few months until a friend told me it was great and I found out that the artist and creator was Korean. So, with a bit of reluctance, I started viewing Kaiji and I was blown away. The artstyle quickly became very enjoyable and I didn't mind the pointy noses or weird eyes after the first episode. If you are avoiding this anime due to the odd artstyle, do yourself a favor and stopbeing so picky. The art is only a small portion of an anime and it can be easily overlooked if an anime has a great cast and a good plot. Please read the following review and try to muster up the enthusiasm to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nThe cast of Kaiji is relatively small because the story revolves around the main characters thoughts and emotions. My favorite character is definitely Itou Kaiji because he is such an ordinary guy. If you have seen animes like Akagi and Deathnote, you will realized how unrealistic the intelligence level of some characters can be. Kaiji is just an average guy with a dead-end job and only becomes quick-witted and devious through the games he is forced to play. His tricks and lies are never over the top with every possible variable falling into the right place. Kaiji screws up like everyone else but he has determination beyond any average person. I found myself cheering for Kaiji and wishing the best for him throughout the series. This, in my opinion, is the way you can tell if a character is very well developed and likable.\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle-\\n\r\nThere's not that much to say about the art in Kaiji. It is very unusual compared to most animes and it looks much more \"cartoonish\". Each person and object is darkly bolded with a black outline and the characters are a solid color with no realistic shading or hues. This is not a con however. The simple and unique artstyle makes it visually appealing after a first few minutes. Do not be turned off by the artstyle because you will eventually forget about it or love it altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Kaiji is not stellar or amazing, but it does set the right mood of the series. Most of the music is very suspenseful and thrilling and there are some relaxing and happy BGM as well. Don't watch Kaiji just for the soundtrack because you will be dissapointed in that sense. This isn't Bebop or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nI can't reveal too much of the story but I can say ALOT more events happen than what is written in the synopsis. After the night on the ship, Kaiji goes through a couple more dangerous gambles. The story is nothing that hasn't be done before, but it still has very entertaining twists and turns. This series had me hooked from episode one and I was so dissapointed when it ended after only 26 episodes. It could have gone a little bit longer, but I am not complaining. Kaiji, in my opinion, has one of the most enthralling and interesting storylines in anime. I regretted no part of finishing this series and the last episode left a very deep impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nKaiji is a series for those who have a lengthy attention span and have a hard-on for thrillers and suspense.It's an anime that makes you think a little bit, but that makes the series much more enjoyable. Don't watch Kaiji expecting brutal violence and adrenaline pupming action. It does have a few violent scenes here and there but Kaiji is only enjoyable if you watch it from an intelligent perspective. I hope this review convinced you to start this series. Thanks for reading folks.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji- 9/10",

            "content": "Kaiji is another gambling series done by the same people who made Akagi. If you happened to read my review on Akagi, you will notice how disappointed I was. But the same cannot be said about Kaiji. This time the producers realized their mistakes and fixed it. Now, this is a gambling series done right. Thumbs up.\r\nSTORY... The plot revolves around a man named Kaiji, who is in his early twenties and is debt-ridden. It doesn't seem he will ever be able to pay off his debts, but as if sent from the heavens or hell, a messenger comes to him with an \"once ina lifetime\" opportunity to pay off his debts... There are 3 story arcs and that's basically how each arc starts. But what keeps things certainly interesting and fresh is how with each arc, there is a new means of gambling for Kaiji, meaning he's not going to play the same game every time. Watch it for yourself to find out, I hate being a spoiler. To add to the unique gambling propositions is that within each arc, there is a heavy load of SHOCK VALUE.  It will leave you with your eyes wide open and your jaw touching the ground, constantly making you say, \"No way!? That seriously did not just happen! I can't believe it!\" There is however, still an amount of internal dialogue, but the producers have cut down on it, so the pacing of the story moves moderately. But still, near the end, the internal dialogue got a little overwhelming. There is a lot of tension build-up that you will keep you on the edge of your seat. What else is great about the plot is that it will keep you guessing from start to finish. All in all, the producers have absolutely managed to make a good story. It even provides insight on the smallest actions of the gamblers in the series, thus, giving you tips on how to become a better gambler. How can you not like that?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION... It was the same people who made the character designs for Akagi, so you're pretty much getting the same thing. It takes some getting use to, but you'll realize that there's no problem with it. The character designs fit the dark gambling atmosphere appropriately and the movements of characters are fluid, bringing life to the characters. You can also see sweat, tears, and veins. There's even some blood involved.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND... The soundtrack of Kaiji is likeable and fits the theme of the series very well. The opening theme is an up-beat rock song that you can jam to and the ending theme has a depressed, but there's still hope theme to it. It fits perfectly for gamblers who lose big and still believe that they can change. The background music is okay too. The producers didn't go wrong in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS... Kaiji is the only character that you need to know, and he is by far one of the most characters that people can relate to. Not by what he is, but by what he goes through and his qualities as a person. Kaiji is a low-life bum who resorts to not so conventional means to make a living for himself. He struggles everyday, and at times he even cries about his problems, but then suddenly realizes that crying ain't gonna do him any good. Also, how many of you have been betrayed by people whom you thought were your friends? How many times were your morals tested to the limit?  Wouldn't you say that's very human? This is just one of the many sentiments Kaiji undergoes through the series. Kaiji's morals are constantly pushed to the limit throughout the series and it is inspiring to watch him desperately hold on to his dignity as a good human being. But where Kaiji really shines is during the gambles. He has this \"keep struggling to pull the come from behind victory\" attitude and expresses his emotions loudly. These are just a few of the many things in Kaiji. He is such a great main character. You will like him for the character development he undergoes. Now, there are some side characters, but they don't stay very long, they are somewhat insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 7/10= Good\\n\\n\r\nSTRENGTHS\\n\r\n+ Great main character in Kaiji.\\n\r\n+ Has loads of twists and SHOCK VALUE, not predictable.\\n\r\n+ Even provides insight/tips on how to become a better gambler.\\n\r\n+ Has one of the most shocking endings in Anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\\n\r\n- The internal dialogue can drag the series to a boring halt sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nNote: If you're looking for a gambling series, this is it.",

            "content": "Kaiji isn\u2019t a mainstream series like Naruto or Bleach. If your high school has an anime club and that is where you hear about the series you watch, then you probably haven\u2019t heard of Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. However, if you spend time on MAL and read through suggestions, you have probably at least heard of Kaiji as a sophisticated and highly lauded work. I will be examining this 2007 anime that is already widely viewed as a timeless classic. Instead of my usual format, I will be breaking the review into pros and cons because Kaiji is a special series, so I figure it deservesa special review!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tKaiji is INSANELY addicting. This is one of the best paced and tense anime I have ever seen! You will quickly start binge watching this series and not stop until it is finished. Every episode ends on an intense cliffhanger and you simply NEED to watch another episode to find out what happens to poor Kaiji! Just the fact that this series has the ability to grab the viewer so effectively and make us care so much about Kaiji is a strong point in favor of its merit as a truly great story. \\n\\n\r\n2.\tThe character of Kaiji. We have seen many types of anime protagonists, but Kaiji for the most part feels truly unique. He is a flawed hero that is capable of being selfish, greedy, and above all fatalistic. However, he will regularly put himself at risk to help others and is capable of great kindness. Kaiji also possesses a strong sense of justice and fairness. Unfortunately, he allows other people to influence his life and tends to leave things up to fate. In other words, Kaiji\u2019s largest character flaw is his external locus of control. Kaiji\u2019s other flaw is that he is WAY too trusting and as a result is constantly getting backstabbed and betrayed. This is usually a trait reserved for a \u201cHoly Fool\u201d type character that is tragically too goodhearted and idealistic for the cruel and uncaring world in which they inhabit. It is extremely unusual for a degenerate gambler anti-hero like Kaiji. That would be like a Pokemon with the duel type Ghost/Fighting. It doesn\u2019t freaking happen! Since Kaiji feels like something unique and not an archetype that we have seen countless times, it makes him genuinely interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n3.\tThe plot actually feels fresh and interesting. In every arc, Kaiji will find himself in some kind of massive debt and must undertake an insane gamble in order to try get himself out. Very few anime actually revolve around gambling! Kaiji not only dives into the shady side of gambling and owing debt to the mob, but talks about actual superstitions and beliefs that gamblers tend to have. Much like Spice and Wolf, I got to give Kaiji some credit just for tackling a topic that I\u2019ve never seen done before in an anime.\\n\\n\r\n4.\tKaiji actually delivers some profound messages and delivers them with excellent poignancy. Instead of simply condemning gambling as purely a vice, Kaiji explains that we all need to take gambles in order to succeed. If we simply eat and breathe instead of ever going out on a limb, we will die without ever having truly lived. Kaiji also delivers the moral that people should be responsible for their own choices and have an internal locus of control, not leave everything up to others be it other human beings, God, or fate itself.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tI personally wasn\u2019t happy with the art. Firstly, I must commend the anime with taking a risk and keeping the mangaka\u2019s unique art style. It would have been far easier for the studio to follow the pack and draw Kaiji in the moe style that tends to sell best in Japan. That took some balls and I give them credit. However, Kaiji just doesn\u2019t look aesthetically appealing. You have an odd clash of character designs that mostly seems to draw inspiration from the 1970s like Lupin the 3rd and Cyborg 009, but you also have  random characters with 90s Nickelodeon lips from Ahh  Real Monsters or Wild Thornberries. The result can best be summed up with \u201cBURN IT WITH FIRE!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n2.\tThe main villain. Before I even talk about my problems with the character\u2019s personality and motivation, just open up a new tab and fucking look up a picture of Kazutaka Hyoudou! This is the character design they went with for a villain that they spend 15 episodes building up! He looks like the fucking 4chan Happy Merchant! Was Pepe the Frog not available?! Does this guy attend a council of evil image macros and occupy a table next to Scumbag Steve, Pedo Bear, and the janitor dog that works for free!? Now let\u2019s talk about what a shitty character he is. While Kaiji feels unique and interesting, this guy is the classic evil rich dude that laughs maniacally while his nefarious schemes kill the less fortunate. He is as clich\u00e9 and melodramatic as possible in a series that takes itself dead seriously. This guy should be palling around with Snively Whiplash, not occupying a series attempting to achieve artistic merit and dignity! Other characters in Kaiji feel generally realistic and fleshed out, but this guy has the depth of a kiddy pool and ruins literally every scene he\u2019s in. It suddenly shatters the series\u2019 feeling of believability and the viewer can\u2019t be moved when supposedly powerful drama happens because you\u2019re too busy laughing at Kazutaka to possibly take the scene seriously!\\n\\n\r\n3.\tCharacters are driven by the demands of the plot instead of the plot being driven by the characters. Kaiji is based on a VERY long running manga. In order to repeat the same formula in every arc, Kaiji must not win enough money to get out of debt, but must do well enough to survive the challenge. Here is why this becomes a problem. Kaiji will end up pulling a bullshit victory out his ass that contradicts all that we\u2019ve learned about Kaiji and derails his entire character, solely because the plot demands it! Kaiji will all of a sudden become a master of reading human emotion and manipulate his opponent like a marionette after repeatedly getting tricked by characters that have evil stamped on their foreheads! Kaiji ultimately ends up a tragedy and in a tragedy where you have a very flawed hero that repeatedly makes infuriating mistakes, it is only acceptable if the character is a truly great and consistent character. When we read The Idiot, we KNOW that things are going to go poorly for Myshkin, but we love Myshkin as a character and we know and accept that whenever he makes a mistake, it is the choice that we feel his character WOULD make in that situation. Now imagine if the hopelessly na\u00efve and Christ like Myshkin had to outwit a cunning adversary solely because the plot demanded it and suddenly for 1 chapter became the extremely cunning and devious financial criminal Ostap Bender from the novel 12 Chairs? It would not only be fucking stupid, but it would ruin the tragic decisions because the reader will say, \u201cwhere the fuck is the cleverness he had in that one chapter?! WTF is this bullshit!\u201d If I\u2019m going to watch a tragedy that gives me an emotional gut punch it better be damn good and it sure as HELL should have consistent characters. Kaiji is 26 hours and over 10 hours long! I will spend 10 hours of my life for a well written and character consistent tragedy like The Idiot, but I would rather hang myself than watch a 10 hour version of Spike Lee\u2019s Bamboozled!\\n\\n\r\n4.\tThe narrator cuts in every 5 seconds and explains what we already know as if we\u2019re complete idiots!\\n\\n\r\n5.\tThe melodrama reaction close ups whenever anyone reveals a game changing card or move. It was silly when Yugioh did it and Yugioh wasn\u2019t attempting to be taken seriously by mature adults.\\n\\n\r\n6.\tKaiji cries in EVERY EPISODE to try make the viewer empathize with him and feel sad. There is such a thing as diminished returns. Having a character cry when they experience a tragic loss or have reached their breaking point can be a very powerful dramatic tool and make the audience truly feel for that character and put themselves in that character\u2019s shoes. However, when you use this technique too much, it stops being effective and seems needlessly exploitive. It doesn\u2019t even feel realistic after a certain point! Imagine you were a slave or child soldier. Every day of your life is a horrible day and unspeakably terrible things happen to you. The only way that humans can survive is to basically shut off our emotion and diminish our ability to feel pain, loss, joy, humiliation, etc. During your 3rd year of hell, you would either have a strong emotional barrier or you would be dead. You would NOT still be crying every day multiple times like Kaiji in his hellhole of a life!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is an ambitious series, a unique series, an addicting series, but an incredibly frustrating series. It does enough things well to be worthy of the praise it receives, but you may put your fist through your laptop or TV screen on multiple occasions. I would still say it is worth watching, but you\u2019ve also been warned!\\n",

            "content": "This series does not get alot of love. If you don't enjoy enjoy thinking alot about your anime, you will not like this.\r\n However if you can think about it alot, you will enjoy this alittle or very much.\r\nFirst of all the story deserves it's credit. Gambling is not interesting unless it is presented in a interesting way. The original author of the manga  (Noboyuki Fukumoto) has created series based on gambling, finances, detective work, and basic struggle of surviving. And he does his work with perfection in psychological description.\r\nKaiji is a character you see grow. By the end of the series you willsee this. \\n\r\nKaiji himself gives this series 10/10 in character. \\n\\n\r\nHuman nature is a very core part of the story, and it is described through the use of a narrator. Without the narrator the story would lack something. A sound to fill the gaps of the moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something I like alot. From 2006 I have noticed animation getting sharper. Kaiji's animation uses hard-solid lines to emphasize the characters facials expressions. There are also visual props for when a character is describing something and I find this aspect intriguing and cool.\\n\r\nThe animation is nice. Especially when emphasizing the dramatic moments of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound. The music of the series is made by Hideki Taniuchi. And I love all the tracks of Kaiji. Much the tracks are used to enlarge the suspicious atmosphere of the series. The sounds effects are top notch nothing much else to say. Voice work is fine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. I give Kaiji it's 10/10 because it was able to do something great. Create a dramatic portrayal of a person's hardships.",

            "content": "First off, the reason that I am writing this review is that I feel this series is too overrated, the two current reviews here are both exemplary of that.\r\nSummarized review: \r\nStory had the potential to be great 9-10/10, however, after a while it gets really old, and all the cleverness is taken away, leaving a big sob show.\r\nArt - I am a big fan of this style of art, the huge noses, 2D characters, angular character design etc. \r\nSound - Nothing memorable, nothing to complain about.\r\nSame goes for characters and enjoyment, will get into more detail in full review.\r\nOverall : 6, vastly overrated due topeople saying it deals with the evils of humans in such great depth, and is shocking realistic, etc.\\n\r\nHowever, I feel that the majority of a viewing audience will realism that the real world is no utopia, and Kaiji does not realize this, it takes it audience to be the sorts of people that have no concept of the harsher side of life.\\n\\n\r\nFull review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: The initial concept is quite good, i.e. it has the potential to work itself up to a great storyline, however, after the first Jan Ken Pon arc I felt that it really started to fall flat on its face, there being no more mindgames, techniques, devious characters, just grown men crying. \\n\r\nHowever, it does manage to redeem itself slightly in the e-card battle, which I felt was quite well done, however, the tissue box lottery was ridiculous, more screentime was devoted to the actual planning of it that the actual execution. Additionally, the spontaneity and randomness of Kaiji's actions in this case do not seem to fit in with the rest of the show. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: As previously mentioned, I am a fan of this style, it is exactly the same as Akagi's and I feel it does not spoil the show in any way. The art style is basically, very flat and 2D, very large noses, extremely angular faces. However, the backgrounds, props, etc. are all drawn very well and in a normal fashion. \\n\r\nThe art may not be for everyone, in fact most people dislike it, yet I feel that this is actually the strongest point of the show.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing memorable, there was probably some BGM playing during the sad scenes, of which there are innumerable amounts. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED are suitable, but not amazing, and I give the director credit for not taking any old Japanese pop idol with an amazingly high voice and having her do some poppy song that would be completely inappropriate for this sort of show.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The protaganist Kaiji, I personally disliked him, not immensely, but the dislike was there nonetheless. \\n\r\nThe reasoning? Basically, he has been living as a bum for an unmentioned amount of years, but I assume since he graduated/left highschool. You think this would harden the man up, make him be aware of the evils that are present in the majority of people. However, he seems to think that all people are good, he unwittingly trusts them, in other words he is a bloody fool.\\n\r\nYet in other cases, e.g. the game of E-Card he shows that he is amazingly resourceful, can think of great strategies, and can smooth talk to deceive any man. It is just very unusual and flawed in a sense.\\n\r\nOther characters worth mentioning are Tongegawa, my personal favourite character from this show, Kaiji put it quite well saying that Tonegawa is a 'Snake'. Like a snake, he is tricky, apathetic, and devours the 'have-nots'.\\n\r\nThis is another failure on the show's part, usually one would empathize with the protagonist, yet here I find myself actually liking the antagonist more.\\n\r\nThere aren't any other big characters beside these, there are the two people who initially help out Kaiji on the ship, but they are very linear and behave in the fashion one would expect them to.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAlthough I did find myself initially enjoying the show, especially the first arc. After that the enjoyment level quickly dropped, I found myself hating Kaiji in ever-increasing amounts. His stupidity, his predictable actions, all attributed to this hatred. Then came in E-Card, if it had ended on that I would have probably given this show a 7/10 instead of a 6, as that was quite magnificently done and well thought out. However, instead of that the director chose to put in some crappy badly thought out ending whereby it just becomes even more obvious what an idiot Kaiji is.\\n\r\nThat being said the ending was fairly open, leaving the possibility of a season 2.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI found that Akagi was vastly superior to Kaiji, however, if you are a fan of Hagiwara, Masato (I definitely am, most badass voice actor around), and the style of art, and several mindgames that are logically thought out (few and far between in this show, I'm afraid, although they are still there), give Kaiji a go.",

            "content": "Murphy's Law, whatever can go wrong WILL go wrong. This is the basic premise surrounding almost any anime related to games. As you watch a show like Kaiji, you already know that over the course of whatever game they are playing, things will go badly. The key to these shows it to surprise you anyway, to be caught off guard by the things that go wrong, and to be impressed when the good guys overcome the odds. \r\nKaiji (mostly) accomplishes this. The main character, Kaiji, plays several different games in which he risks his life/body parts, etc. Some of the games he plays are extraordinarilyclever. The first arc especially, has one twist after another, and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the show is more off and on. A few of the games don't have any clever aspects and strategy like the first arc, which was disappointing, but I do give them credit for at least being pretty intense. These games just aren't at the level of the first arc though. One other game Kaiji plays comes close, but it isn't quite there. Basically, the first 10 episodes of Kaiji are absolutely amazing, and from there the show is a bit more off and on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key to games anime is generally to have some great characters. No matter how clever the writing is for the game, if you aren't compelled to cheer for the good guys, these games lose a lot of their intensity. Kaiji is a bit different from other shows in this regard. I honestly never liked any of the \"good guys\" in Kaiji. I found the main character to be \"OK\" but nothing more. I have to give them loads of credit for the bad guys they create though. I absolutely hated the bad guys, and was cheering for Kaiji just to see them lose. Thanks to this, I was able to stay into the show, but it is a shame that the \"good guys\" weren't that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty unique. The most noteworthy aspect being the large noses. I got used to the art, but I never really liked it. All the characters are pretty ugly thanks to the art style. Also, I felt like they overused computer animation a bit. It's not necessarily bad, but I never liked it. The sound on the other hand, is pretty bad. I hated the opening theme, and I never even noticed the music during the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main flaw with Kaiji is probably the last 4 episodes. They were pretty lame and predictable, and not nearly at the level of other episodes. I was completely uninterested most of the time, despite some crazy moments. The ending was also pretty lame, and pretty much solely to set up a new season.\\n\\n\r\nAnother slightly annoying aspect, is how the show constantly tries to give social commentary based on the games they are playing. I frankly did not care at all, and I felt like it was a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kaiji tries to be both intense and clever, it can truly be an amazing show, perhaps even at masterpiece level. However, Kaiji tries too hard sometimes to just be intense, without the added cleverness, and this is where the show falters. If you are into Hikaru No Go, or Akagi, you will surely enjoy Kaiji. If games anime aren't quite your thing, my reccomendation becomes a bit more shaky. I would suggest that anyone, even if you don't generally like games anime, should give the first 10 episodes a try, as they are easily the best of the show, and from there, decide if you want to keep watching.",

The only thing I can think of that won't cost money to build or maintain is yourself. So what do you do when you desperately need money, fast? Kaiji's answer to this question is to gamble for it. And damn, there's a hell of a lot of gambles in this anime.\r\nBasically, the story revolves around Itou Kaiji, who's broke and also in debt for about 3 million yen. Some black suits come and talks him into gambling ona ship to pay off his debt. There's a catch, however. Fail, and he will be forced to do manual labor on an island for 1-2 years. Getting 3 wins (stars) allows him to get off the ship. However, a star will be taken away for each loss. And this is only the first arc. The second arc pits Kaiji on a bridge, the third on a bridge that's electrocuted, another settling with a card game(and a very interesting one at that), and another a lottery. All of these arcs are very interesting, in their own way. Morals, Luck, Right or Wrong, Cheating, and Greed are only some of the things it discusses over the series. Mind that the story is also dark and very psychological.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has it's own distinct style. I admit I was turned off by it at first, but then I grew to like it. The animation is very smooth and flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty good. The right BGM at the right moments, and the theme songs kind of fits Kaiji's tone. The voices were perfect for each character (except for Furuhata, didnt like his voice)\\n\\n\r\nEach main and supporting character is very different in their own special way, mostly guys.  Kaiji is really a character that I can relate to. He will be betrayed, lose limbs, sees the deaths of his comrades, and thrown into impossible gambles and still Kaiji survives it, mostly through mixed emotions and strategic planning. The rest of the cast is memorable, except the lackeys in which Kaiji usually tells them to do stuff (you'll see what I mean)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot. More than I expected to enjoy it. Kaiji's character, the daredevil gambles, the strategic planning, everything! Well, almost everything. Some of the plans will make you think \"why the hell would you do that\" and the bad ending might be a turn-off to some people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. Trust me, you'll have a good time with this series.\\n\\n\r\nBTW this is my first review, please give me feedback on this!!! Thanks!",

            "content": "This is my first review so please bear with me :P\r\nI am also aiming at keeping this extremely spoiler-free, only explaining my viewpoint and impressions.\r\nTL;DR:\r\nThe story was very very unpredictable and excruciatingly tense, well paced and v well plot centered. I personally enjoyed the art style which kept its strong consistency throughout. The voice acting was superb, as well as the restless soundtracks. Each character - no matter the role - felt real and distinctive. Very addicting.\r\nStory- 10/10: \r\nCutting straight down to the chase - I loved the story. The story started off with a very amusing and somewhat relatable mc. The story dived straightinto the plot which was a great plus. The theme of gambling and risk was very prominent throughout the whole anime which is exactly what I came for. I gave this anime a 10/10 because of how unpredicatable and amazing the plot twists are - honestly, the tables can turn in a matter of split seconds, and I was left in awe and excitment every time. The story arcs were a suitable length and I never felt that an episode was too long. It is true that at some point, one 20 minute episode only captured 10 minutes of real time. However, time felt completely unrelevant due to the extreme tension the episode created and I did not feel any loss of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10: \\n\r\nThe art is very different to say the least, it somewhat reminds me of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu with the black inking/bordering around characters. Needless to say, I am a fan of unique art styles in anime and do place art as the least significant factor in rating anime. In my opinion, the art was pleasing to see yet it was nothing spectacular. The art style was very consistent with barely any mistakes (I only noticed 1). At the beginning, it felt like characters were designed by literally mixing and matching premade facial strucures and shapes, which didn't really affect my liking for the art - it made it seem that everyone is similar in a way. However, the art always kept a high standard and I didn't feel any awkward animations - every seemed to flow very smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in the anime were very good - they created a tense and engulfing atmosphere at very crucial times. I absolutely loved the ZAWA ZAWA~ throughout the entire anime. Voice acting was great - the casting, the emotions, everything. It really felt like the character voice's matched them. I really enjoyed the opening and ending songs, doesn't get stuck to mind that much but nevertheless, very fun xD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10:\\n\r\nThe massive variety of personalities was awesome. Kaiji (the main mc) was so loveable although all his bad qualities. You pity him at so many points of the anime, feeling his pain and anguish. However, he has such amazing moments of inspiration and motivation, that you sit in bewilderment. He is a great guy, with very terrible luck and fate. His enemies differ a lot - most characters differ quite a bit. Some are extremely hateable yet others are to be feared or avoided, which I think is a great mix. Even the sideline characters have very clear personalities, which are portrayed and developed very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\r\nNot much to say about this - its very subjective.\\n\r\nEach episode hooked me onto the next, I was flying through them more than ever. I loved the tension, the uncertainty, the risks.",

            "content": "Kaiji is the devil child [insert Slayer- Hell Awaits soundtrack] among the 2007 Autumn season lineup, an outcast, the underdog just like the character himself &ndash; people take one look at those long noses and run for the hills &ndash; A TENGU IS COMING!! AAARGHH!! \r\nIt also just happens to not only be the best anime of the season; it ranks up among some of the best anime of all time. If there were to be a list of the current best five anime for the 2007 season it would be: 1. Kaiji, 2. Daylight, 3. Daylight, 4. Daylight, 5. Maybe Ghost Hound &ndash; nah,there is still a little more daylight between Kaiji and that show&hellip; Put simply, Kaiji is the type of anime that the gods sitting atop Mt. Olympus watch when they take a break from throwing down lightning bolts, swinging tridents, ruling the underworld or doing whatever gods sitting atop Mt. Olympus do. My reasons are explained below&hellip;    \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, a bit of background. Kaiji is based on Nobuyuki Fukumoto's award winning manga of the same name. More specifically, the anime is based on the first series of the manga containing the first 13 volumes of the story called &lsquo;Kaiji &ndash; Tobaku Mokushikuroku', or, &lsquo;Kaiji &ndash; The Gambling Apocalypse'. As no real English translations of the manga exist, the story is relatively unknown in the West. On the other hand, the manga, which first started being serialized back in 1996, went on to become extremely popular in Japan and Korea, producing two sequel series of manga which are also a superb read and are highly recommended. At the time of writing 38 volumes of the manga have been produced, featuring Kaiji putting it all on the line time and time again. The anime has followed this trend of popularity in the East, Kaiji the anime regular doubles the ratings for shows apparently popular according to this site, such as Minami-ke.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\\n\r\nI am going to be blunt, the character design, like Akagi before it, is &lsquo;bad&rsquo; in the traditional sense &ndash; but in all seriousness this is a very, very good thing. Let me explain by posing a rhetorical question: &ldquo;Have you ever seen a good &lsquo;bad&rsquo; film?&rdquo; For example the film Evil Dead looks as though it has been produced on a 15 dollar budget but god damn it&rsquo;s an awesome film! Titanic on the other hand was made on a bajillion dollar budget, won a whole heap of awards and raked in millions of dollars in profit but let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; IT SUCKED. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji works in a similar way &ndash; the artwork is &lsquo;bad&rsquo; in the same way Evil Dead is, and that&rsquo;s what makes it awesome. Kaiji is not exactly a mainstream anime so it is never going to suit everyone&rsquo;s tastes, but, as with Akagi, Fukumoto&rsquo;s art style really does suit this kind of story &ndash; In pure Rocky fashion, here we see a gritty battler, the underdog in a fight, grappling with underground mobsters to get out of debt, to reach out and grasp the future within his hands &ndash; It&rsquo;s never going to be a pretty picture&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the character designs are a variety of original touches, most notably Fukumoto&rsquo;s trademark, &lsquo;Zawa Zawa&rsquo; sound effect, which is derived from the Japanese word Zawameku, &lsquo;\u3056\u308f\u3081\u304f&rsquo; &ndash; signifying a tense state of agitation. To put it in layman's terms, it is kind of like the feeling you get when you take a dump only to realize that you are out of toilet paper &ndash; ZAWAAA!!! (Apologies for crudeness). In general the voice acting is superb, in particular the standouts being Kaiji&rsquo;s V.O. Masato Hagiwara and the narrator himself, voiced by none other than Fumihiko Tachiki, the dude who is the narrator in PRIDE! Hideki Taneuchi picks up where he left off in Akagi providing an amazing score for Kaiji. Music is used in Kaiji to a perfect degree, and really helps build the ever-present underlying tension as Kaiji gambles with his life. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s face it, an anime with an art style as flipped out as it is, Kaiji (the anime) is never really going to get anywhere without a decent story. Well, it is in this area that the anime really shines. Thoroughly engrossing, this is one of the few animes around that makes it seem like a painfully long wait for the next episode to come out. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the basic plot shows Kaiji&rsquo;s struggle to get out of debt, to survive, the thematically driven story is as deep as an abyss &ndash; Fukumoto&rsquo;s world view portrayed throughout Kaiji is at times deeply profound, at other times it simply rocks the core of your soul. Yes, the plot simply revolves around a series of gambles, but the world of gambling that Kaiji (the character) is drawn into is merely used as an analogy about the struggle to survive in the real world, offering existential notions on the human race itself, where we as individuals stand in the &lsquo;rat race&rsquo;. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the statements that this anime makes are despairingly stark; sombre realities that really hit home. You will want to disagree with the scornful remarks made by mobsters like Tonegawa and Co. about how the debtors have lived their lives up to this point, but you can&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t because they simply state the harsh realities of life; realities that we choose to turn our heads away from in everyday life. While mobsters like Tonegawa appearing in this anime may be considered &lsquo;bad guys&rsquo; in the traditional sense because they are wrong morally, they have a far greater perception about the realities of life and, dare I say it, simply act as they do to survive themselves in a dog eat dog world&hellip;? \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kaiji on the surface, features and draws out just about every possible emotion on the spectrum &ndash; the thrill of victory, the despair of defeat, the grief of seeing comrades fall, the anger of betrayal, the fear of looking death in the eye&hellip; While this makes for a gut-wrenchingly intense enough experience as it is, the thematic psychological commentary into the human condition that makes up the core that is Kaiji the anime is even more provocative and carries a lot more weight than the gambling action itself. Simply put, this really pulls &lsquo;Kaiji&rsquo; above the realm of a simple anime and onto a higher plane. If you watch this show and find that it doesn&rsquo;t really have an effect on you, try watching the show again once you&rsquo;ve entered the work force &ndash; that is when things will really hit home...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\\n\r\nFukumoto&rsquo;s world is world filled with men &ndash; the sole female survivor of the Gambling Apocalypse appears for about a minute at most. Hey, it&rsquo;s one whole female character more than Akagi, a 100% increase!! Ahem.. Sorry guys &ndash; put away those tissues you had readied, if you look at anime for the fan-service, then you&rsquo;re going to be one sorry fan. Look on the bright side though; brain-dead harem comedies are in plentiful supply&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nYes it truly is a man&rsquo;s world in Kaiji, men gambling on the edge of despair. I won&rsquo;t bother laying out each and every character for you, mainly because finding out about the personalities, traits and motivations of the characters that inhibit Kaiji&rsquo;s world for yourself is a large part of the experience. I will give brief mention however to the lead, Kaiji himself because Kaiji&rsquo;s character development is another one of this anime&rsquo;s great points. As the plot summary suggests, Kaiji starts out the show a loser on his way out. A character simply floating through life, someone who chooses to not chase down &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;, living in the medical sense that he has a beating heart and working lungs, but really &lsquo;living&rsquo; to the fullest sense of the word. Not a real inspiring guy right? No, he isn&rsquo;t, not to begin with. But as his dawdling way of life, where he cannot really see things as they &lsquo;really&rsquo; are, places him into his predicament (i.e. a mountain of unpaid debts), his predicament is also what saves him, for it is only when Kaiji confronts the fear of death does he realize the value of his very existence, in a sense he &lsquo;awakens&rsquo; from a deep sleep. With his back against the wall, he grows to become an absolute god of gambling in one sense, but in another way his development as a strong human being (both mentally and emotionally) is really what makes him an engaging character, one of the best leads I have ever seen in an anime. Personally I love the character of Kaiji and feel a lot more in touch with his struggle than I ever did with Akagi&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\\n\r\nGod this is a long review&hellip; And I still feel as though I have only just scraped the surface of what makes Kaiji so great&hellip; Ah well, you can figure the rest out if you watch the show. I&rsquo;m not going to guarantee that everyone is going to like it &ndash; hey, everyone has different opinions, tastes, personalities&hellip; But if I can convince someone who had no interest in Kaiji to at least try it, then I feel my job here is done. Excellent anime. Top marks.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "This review was originally written after the first arc, and has since been revised to cover my opinions of the entire show, with minimal spoilers.\r\nStory: Itoh Kaiji, a bum with 3 million yen worth of debt gets into a gambling cruise to pay off his debts.  The game played on the cruise is Gentei Janken (Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors), where the players get four cards of each type and battle it out.  What's the catch?  Several things; each card can only be used once, cards can be bought off of other players, con men abound, and losing forces one into the vaguely established buthorrible &quot;other room&quot;. Also, one must not only break even in the actual matches, but also earn enough through the buying and selling of &quot;stars&quot; (3 of which equate a trip off the ship) to pay off their debts.  A simple premise which gets expounded on to a cleverly intense degree.  That, mind you, is the first arc.  The later arcs follow up with themes on society, and it gets philosophical in a gritty sort of way.  But, unfortunately, the&quot;ending&quot; is not anything of the sort, devoid of climax.  The last 4 episode arc feels a bit tacked on, and leaves season 2 wide open.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I looked at the promo picture, and I thought one thing: Elves.  These noses are big, and the faces look pretty weird at first.  However, once one gets past the first five minutes, it really becomes apparent just how expressive these faces can be, as the characters go through one emotional crisis after another.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nice intro, nice ending.  Where the sound really shines, though, is the intense scenes.  It's well integrated into the rest of the show's experience - so much so that I didn't notice it except after watching a second or third time.  However, once I did look into the more dramatic half of the soundtrack, I found it a fairly nice score.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, soundtrack isn't the best part of this show's auditory arsenal either.  That honor goes to the best voice acting I've ever heard.  It may sound silly, but I have never heard anyone cry as effectively as Yanaka Hiroshi's character.  Ever. The voice acting really captures the gritty, dreamless atmosphere which the show exhudes.  Also, an extremely dramatic narration often helps the story along, and helps the viewer make sense of sometimes subtle mindgames.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sheeit- there's just too much to say.  Men (absolutely no women in this show) betting their lives can make for pretty deep plots, and this is perhaps one of the very best.  Kaiji himself is a normally hopeless person whose survival instincts lead him to fight off the system intended to break him down, and he takes himself down a number of pegs to help people who have nothing to give him (and occasionally stab him in the back).  The rest of the cast of characters is a bit less scrupulous, and Kaiji suffers three major betrayals by con men and friends alike in the first nine episodes.  In the antecedent arcs 2-4, shit hits the fan for our hero, though he is never betrayed after arc 1. Plenty of manly tears make the whole process very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nA major part of Kaiji that I feel I shoud mention is it's haves vs. have-nots dynamic.  Rich &quot;haves&quot; are constantly responsible for the suffering of impoverished &quot;have-nots&quot;, and situation which naturally causes tearful frustration for the have-nots.  At times the narrator's observations of both sides sound like Hobbesian logic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A couple of major highlights: fistfights, naked wrestling behind a one-way mirror, and a fat guy being kicked in the corpulence.  The presentation is terrific, dramatic, and bold. Just be aware that, when the chips are down and everything is at stake, there's a very real possibility that Kaiji will lose...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kaiji=Pwn+Max Drama-A Decent Ending.  If you don't want to be dissappointed, stop watching at episode 22 and wait for season 2 before watching episodes 23-26.  There's no reason to skip the first 22, though.  If you have any free time, what are you doing still reading this review?  Watch it now!",

            "content": "---The review contains spoilers---\r\n3/10. Explanation:\r\nStarts off strange to say the least. A young man is deep in debt and is being given a chance to repay it by boarding a cruise ship to do the 'gambling' (?). At this point I was already a bit wary, because why would  a loan company give an opportunity to repay the debt and get rich on top of that to somebody who owns them money? Surely that's not a profitable thing to do. Why not collect the money from them or make them repay somehow, idk. On the ship though, this series becomes amazing, and I meantop-tier material, the plot is well thought out, the mechanics of exploiting the faults of the restricted rock-paper-scissors are very well done, there's betrayal involved, competition is dynamic with worthy opponents, kaiji's brain is being turned inside out from all the stimulation and he really becomes a much much better gambler after that, who is able to think outside the box and quickly adapt to various difficulties he faces on later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever after that this anime completely destroys itself. The so called 'gambling' is no longer gambling but rather a selection of sadistic game for pleasure of the wealthy. By the way I hate this trope, the rich that make poor  risk their lives to do crazy stupid things for money, which involves gore and death that supposedly gives them great pleasure somehow. This is completely unnatural, this goes against human common sense of what is pleasurable and what is merely disgusting, and eventhough such twisted people might indeed exist, there would be nothing of such scale of cruelty that is portrayed in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with the show is not the fact that 2nd half of it is pure garbage from the logical point of view, or that the 'gambling' games are unoriginal and not intellectual in any way, but rather the pacing. It's so fucking slow it's unreal, the 'card-game' arc with Tonegawa lasts forever for no apparent reason, the narrator repeats everything at least THREE times that is obvious to absolutely anybody watching who has at least 1/4 of the mean IQ value. The series was dragged out for so long that I genuinely started to lose the feeling of tension and suspense that you develop when engaged with the series. About 5 episodes before completion I was so annoyed that i wanted to drop the show despite being so close to the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me was how the outside people were brought into the plot. There were a bunch of crippled men (after the disgusting sadistic 'gambling' competition) who were cheering Kaiji on and helping him moraly and providing first-aid. WHY????????????? All those delinquents hated each others guts, treated each other like trash during the 'cruise ship' arc, and then they suddenly developed friendly feelings for kaiji when he won the 20million from Tonegawa. Were they just after the money? Perhaps, but then they had plenty of opportunities to steal the money whilst kaiji was busy, but they didnt. But even if they weren't after the money why was kaiji so willing to trust them after being betrayed so many times in the first part of the series?\\n\\n\r\nThe show is simply put illogical, everybody acts irrationally, completely against what real-life humans would do in most of the situations. I can't stress that enough. This is a show about gambling after all, psychological interactions needed to be thought out properly, but instead we get this. It rendered the show completely useless.",

            "content": "Edit: added more stuff and reworded some things\r\nWhat drew me to Kaiji was the interesting premise, gambling. Considering the manga had over 30+ volumes, there had to be something to this. However, the question pops in my mind &ldquo;how is one able to make an anime about gambling?&rdquo; In the end, I found that a more important question is &ldquo;how can one make a good anime about gambling?&rdquo; and Kaiji isn&rsquo;t a very good example. \r\nItoh Kaiji owes 3 million yen to the yakuza and is forced to go into a special cruise ship to gamble his way out of debt.  The gamble isbased on rock, paper, scissor, while simple at first there is quite a bit flexibility to mess with the system in your favor. This is what makes the first arc so interesting. My roommate and I discussed the many possibilities after each episode and eagerly waited to see what Kaiji was gonna do next.  Near the end of this arc the story really started to drag on, but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad as I though the story would end on episode 13.  If I were to rate Kaiji based purely on the first arc it would have gotten a high 7 or low 8. However, Kaiji didn&rsquo;t end on the first arc&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nThe next arc consisted of 3 major gambles, human derby, e-card, and umm&hellip; &ldquo;awesome box.&rdquo; Here Kaiji loses what made the first arc so interesting, the open nature of the gambles.  The human derby arc wasn&rsquo;t really a gamble per say, instead it was a task to complete for money and entertainment of very rich guest.  Here Kaiji tires to create human drama and really delve into the minds of the characters.  Well there&rsquo;s only one problem with this, Kaiji never had strong characters.  The people participating in the human derby were newly introduced and we don&rsquo;t know anything about them, they are effectively faceless.  So why should the viewer care what happens to them?  People die everyday so why don&rsquo;t we weep for them too?  Yes, I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s quite tragic and on some level I do feel sad for the characters.  Even for the title character, Kaiji, I felt very little, this is because the first arc only really focuses on the gambles and very little on the Kaiji himself.  So there is no big pay off, so to speak when things get dramatic (ie My Hime).  Instead it&rsquo;s more like watching the 10pm news.       \\n\\n\r\nIn this arc they also really delve into philosophy and psychology. The philosophical aspects were too in your face, reminding me of the extremely blatant Ghost in the Shell movies, especially Innocence.   This is because of the delivery, long winded speeches from supposed sage.  This wise old man steps on to the podium and lectures not only Kaiji but the viewer as well.  There is nothing subtle about this nor was it very grey, this is how the world is because he said so.  As for the psychological aspects, visuals were often used to convey the inner struggles, its just that they really over did it and kept repeating the same damn thing.  This leads to my major complaint overall with Kaiji.  \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made Kaiji lose the most point is the fact that they dragged things for way too long, far longer than the first arc.  The omnipresent narrator didn&rsquo;t help either; I was ready to scream at the screen &ldquo;shut up, we get the idea already!&rdquo; As for the other 2 gambles, they faired a bit better&hellip;only a little bit. They were actual gambles, but featured the same things that made the human derby arc bad, too dragged out, shallow drama, and overt philosophical ramblings.  However, in the E-card arc it did give me back a little of the &ldquo;how&rsquo;s Kaiji gonna get out of this mess&rdquo; feeling.  Although, the nature of the gamble is very closed, thus I remain a passive viewer.  Finally the way those gambles ended was way too contrived for my tastes, suffering from the &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo; syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nLet me add that Kaiji is extremely overt with the way it handles itself, from the emotions to the thoughts of the characters themselves.  In some ways it feels a bit caricature but I guess that&rsquo;s mainly the art that gives that impression.  Visual metaphors are used to ram their ideas into the viewers head as well as the omnipresent narrator constantly tells the viewer exactly what is going on.   It doesn&rsquo;t help that the narrator is using an overly dramatic voice, reminiscent of movie guy.    \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was excellent; it was very smooth as well as extremely consistent, as expected by Madhouse. For a very dialogue based story they made use of many visual metaphors, once again it gets old fast. It would have been better if they simply used more dramatic angles and shots as in Death Note. Art is well&hellip;ugly, very ugly, which makes me wonder why Fukumoto (the mangaka) was allowed to keep drawing manga.  He should have someone else draw and he&rsquo;ll work on the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is easily the best part of Kaiji, I loved the instrumental pieces and was surprised at how good the music was when I listened to the ost.  Not only that the music was especially fitting considering the gritty tone of Kaiji.  I just wished they used it more often.  Most of the time there isn&rsquo;t music, instead the narrator sets the tone and the trademark &ldquo;zawazawa.&rdquo; \\n\\n\r\nOh let us not forget about the ending&hellip; Kaiji ended on an extremely open note, so open that I wondered where the next episode was gonna air.  While open endings can work, they only work for character based stories and Kaiji didn&rsquo;t have the story structure to support such an ending.  I&rsquo;m not going to be that critical on the ending as I&rsquo;m sure they plan on animating the rest of the Kaiji story.  What I am gonna be critical on is the fact that Kaiji seemed to have grown dumber in the end.  Ok let me rephrase that he&rsquo;s grown smarter as a gambler but dumber as a person.    There is a sense of irony when Kaiji, minus 4 fingers, an ear, and even more in debt, was talking about how he&rsquo;s stronger now and will defeat the chairman next time.  There is no evidence showing that he stronger as a person, only as a gambler.  Even during the interlude between the first and second arc he is shown unable to live in normal society.  Now I feel he is even more unable to adapt and live under normal circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nI was an active viewer during the first arc and that was what made things interesting and fun.  However, when they took that aspect away I was made into a passive viewer.  Here, the flaws with the narrative, pacing and characters became apparent.  The pacing was horribly dragged out and extremely slow.  Perhaps I would rate Kaiji higher if I didn&rsquo;t watch it weekly and marathoned it, but what&rsquo;s done is done.  In addition, they suffer from the &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo; syndrome too much in the 2nd half.   Now that think about it I didn&rsquo;t really mention the characters in my review yet. Well that&rsquo;s because all the characters are flat.  As for Kaiji himself, he is someone with no past and based on the ending, he also has no future.",

            "content": "Kaiji, maybe is one of the genius anime that would be rarely be consumed these days. Many reasons for it, like people these days are just loooking for anime which have cute girls (or we can said seeking for MOE). Cant blame on it since anime industry now are using cute girls for their sales and of course for seeking profit.  Anyway, there is no cute girls in Kaiji so please step out if you\u2019re looking for it. But honestly you would miss a show that would make hold your breath from the beginning to the end.\r\nKaiji itself have a simple story, Its abouta man named Kaiji who is a thief  but then his life changed when  he is being visited by a debt collector. The debt collector said Kaiji has an unpaid loan which Kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate. But his work-mate had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji. Hopelessly to find a money to pay the loan. Then he find there is one way to solve his loan and that was playing a gamble.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so many things that makes Kaiji is so attractive, one of them is the gamble or we can said a \u201cgame\u201d that Kaiji must play for paying his loan. What they\u2019re playing is just a simple game like Jankenpon but simply its not just a simple Jankenpon, Fukumoto (Kaiji\u2019s creator) makes it into a serious and psychological game that you\u2019ve ever seen.  The game is clever and usually depends on  psychological to win the game.  And if you\u2019re thinking the game is hard to understand then dont worry, since they\u2019re really explained it well and moreover, its just a simple game (like Jankenpon or anything like that) that been modified  a bit by Nobuyuki to make the game more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnother fun part about Kaiji is guessing. This series is really know how to keep you on your toes and as you keep guessing as the stakes get higher and the games become more absurd,Like any mystery and detective show, we\u2019re usually trying to guess on whats gonna happen next or probably trying to solve whats the trick between it. Well, Kaiji is not mystery or detective show but at least thats what i felt when i watch this show. The way how Kaiji solving each game is really remarkable and unexpected. And another great things about it was how logical Kaiji solution was. Well, sometimes another series use some illogical and unrealistic tricks but not in Kaiji, They\u2019re all making sense and that part what makes Kaiji is so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspects that really prominent is the art. Kaiji\u2019s art is superbly good, not in the term of realistic nor catchy color but its in term of the compatibility within the story.  Sometimes some anime missing the point on what art should be, like an example the themes of an anime is thriller but the art looks so colorful makes the thriller atmosphere being wasted. And Good things Kaiji isnt like that. Their art is probably the most unique one, they using thick lines for the characters to make it like a comical style and the character design is unique, probably you cant find it in anywhere. The originality style that Fukumoto (Creator of Kaij) bring probably hard to watch for someone who\u2019re not used watching something extraordinary like this but the comical style that Kaiji use is bring out the advantage for themselves. Like it can increasing the expressive of each characters  so we can feel the emotion within them. Its truly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other way to make Kaiji more epic than the sound.  The background song or the soundtrack within every scenes is really remarkable, they\u2019re fitting well for every scenes that occurs. Like when  Kaiji is being despair, there is a sound that you would notice along the series, \u201cZAWAAA\u201d or it can be translated as agitation. The sound like the one i notice before increasing the despair atmosphere and thrilling the audience. Its like the song forced us to feel the same way as the kaiji does. Well, its not astonishing since the music composer is Hideki Tanuichi, the one who responsible for Aoi Bungaku and Death note music. He did briliantly again in this anime. The opening song in this anime is also amazing, \u201cMirai wa Bokura no Te no Naka\u201d that being played by Hakuryu is really fits with the anime. This 45 seconds opening song is quite wacky and random but somehow this is quite addicting. After talking about the song, lets talking about the seiyuu voice. There is two name that i should mention for this. Hagiwara Masato  and Fumihiko Tachiki, They are the one who responsible for  making Kaiji become so epic. Masato voice is really fits with Kaiji, his voice that heavy is really suitable with kaiji that a middle aged man. He succesfully makes Kaiji like himself but in anime version. In other words, Masato is bring the life for Kaiji. For Fumihiko, his roles in this anime is narrator. But dont take this lightly, because  his energetic and passionate voice in every narrating the story would stun you up.  \\n\\n\r\nIf there was something that makes me so addicting with this series,it was  Kaiji and the other characters. Kaiji is one of the best main characters out there, but he can also the most lamest main characters. There is too many way to describe kaiji, he can be a hero but also a loser. Loser in this term is how Kaiji sometimes following his desires for gambling and ended up to have much of debt but in the other way, when he was in pinch, he could turned into a heroic character. Last,  his personality that clever and tricky make this story become more interesting to follow.  Not just kaiji, The other characters also one of the aspects what makes Kaiji is so amazing. Every characters that appears in this anime isnt just for a side show,they playing some important roles too  andThe other characters acts like what in real life do, like when you are in the pinch with your friends and you have a chance for escape for yourselves, what would you do? I believe if we are in that positions, we are choosing  for escape by ourselves and abandon our friends. That question is for describing what the characters in kaiji is. They would do anything for saving themselves, betraying is one of the way that they would do. The realistic things that every characters do make this anime become more interesting to see. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, after all mumbling that i said before i can safely said Kaiji is one the anime that you should watch. Despite its lackness in moe and cute girls on it, Kaiji would bring you an amazing thriller story with just some simple game.  From that simple game, prepare for feeling some intense scenes that would make you hold the breath from beginning to the end.\\n",

            "content": "I can see everyone staring at the straight 10s on the board and either think im being biased, or that I grade too easy.  According to the ratings here, I grade more than a point lower on average than everyone else.  Well, in any case, I will explain why every category deserved a 10.\r\nStory: While not being too complex, it exists.  The main character has worked himself down to having a massive debt that would take him countless years to pay back honestly.  Everybody Kaiji gambles with are people who once were hopeless gamblers that are given a chance to winit all back.  Although the story doesnt sound to be the too intense, this anime focuses on the strategic part of the gambles rather than on what is going on.  Some might think I should then have given the story an 8 or a 7, but I think that any more story would take away from the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Why such low values on the art everyone?  This art is unique, and its hilarious.  Whenever I see Kaiji from a side shot, I almost start crying with tears of laughter.  They capture emotion in the drawings of the characters, so I feel as though the akward designs of each character fit their personality extremely well.  And there is enough of a background to keep you interested, nothing very groundbreakig going on there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Im not a big sound man, but the seiyuus (spelling?) seemed to portray plenty of emotion, and the bad guys talked like you wanted to punch them in the face.  Effective voice acting.  While the music isnt very memorable or anything, its the perfect music for sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  For an anime that focuses on situational suspense, this is the music you should use.  Something catchy will take you away from the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Excellent villains portrayed to be absolute jerskoffs.  I absolutely love to hate them.  You got the pompous gamblers who think they are all that, and then you got Kaiji.  Kaiji seems to have a feer of dedication.  In the beginning he didnt do much of anything.  After being faced with the gambling trials, Kaiji is starting to learn how to think up ways of getting out of certain situations, and is willing to take sensible risk.  The anime is nowhere near over, so I have yet to see his full character development, but he is definitely a different person in episode 14 than he was in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  As you can see, I watched the first 12 or 13 episodes in one night.  I was glued to the screen the entire time in absolute awe.  Whats gonna happen!!!!!  Havent gotten a feeling like this since I first started watching anime, which is quite a feat in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Great characters, great development, seems to be executed well, and is on its way to becoming a masterpiece.  Although the slightly non-cutting edge animation might be what deters people from this anime, and what make it fall short of masterpiece status.  Its an 07/08 anime and looks like it could have been animation in like 01/02.  Doesnt bother me all too much, I dont need Hayate the Combat Butler resolution 24/7.",

            "content": "What happens when you take the \"No one win's but I\" attitude and you place it into the hands of a bunch of desperate, shameless losers?  Why, you get Kaiji of course!\r\nArt - 7\r\nI understand that the art style was supposed to echo the tone and content of the story.  Many will say that the character design is supposed to depict &ldquo;real-life, gritty&rdquo; characters.  I would disagree.  I think that Kaiji is a very stylized, over-exaggeration of &ldquo;gritty, real-life.&rdquo;  If this is supposed to indeed be a more realistic art style, I just don&rsquo;t think everyone has pointy chins, noses,and eyes, even if you are Asian.  What especially throws everything over into the hyper stylized corner is the very harsh, thick, black lines and angular nature of character designs. It just wasn't my cup of tea.  However, I will give it credit for being consistent within the show, and throughout various body types.  That is a difficult style to maintain across characters, shows that strive for such quality in execution, such as Bleach, should take note.  I also have a problem with the bad integration of CG in this show, some of it was needless, like fountains and light fixtures, and it was a distraction in a show that was otherwise well directed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nHonestly, I don&rsquo;t remember, good or bad, anything about the music in Kaiji.  What I will say regarding voice acting is that it matches the exaggerated tone and style of the show, so that is a plus.  The degree of &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of a character is mimicked in the &ldquo;evilness&rdquo; of his voice.  This goes double for the wimpy voices of the &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nThe title character of the show, Kaiji Itou is a bit of an anomaly.  Utterly unlikable, he is a character crafted for the viewer to pour copious amounts of sympathy onto, thereby making the viewer feel much better about himself.  The execution of characterizing Kaiji is a job well done.  After a couple of episodes, the viewer clearly understands his motives and can predict his reactions.  The problem however, is that he is so predictable and starkly characterized that he quickly becomes a parody of himself with his over-emotional reactions by about halfway through the series due to a lack in growth.  Kaiji himself is a horribly progressed character who fails to learn from any of his mistakes. Even if the point of the show were to paint the portrait of a deluded loser, I don't think that writing for Kaiji supported his journey at all.  Unfortunately, because ultimately, this show is about Kaiji, the supporting characters are quite bland, forgettable, and one-dimensional.  Everyone is sharply one personality type, with no nuance or depth to differentiate themselves from one another.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nInitially, the show does a great job of setting up Kaiji and the overall tone of the show.  There is a natural sense of humor that mixes well with the more adrenaline inducing gambling scenes.  After the first round of gambling is over, however, thing go at a slower pace, and proceed much more predictably.  Too much time is spent explaining the rules of the each game, and because a proper job is never done, the rules regarding strategies have to be reiterated.  There&rsquo;s always a twist, and Kaiji always manages to find someway to claw himself out of total defeat.  Kaiji continuously attempts at forcing the viewer to empathize with the bevy of &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; characters by making someone cry in virtually every episode.  This is a problem because none of the characters are well developed enough, besides, perhaps Kaiji, to fully empathize with.  There are a wide array of emotions at the writers&rsquo; disposal to add depth and meaning to the cast, so with the varying backgrounds and personalities of the characters, I felt it was hopelessly shallow of the show to only display frustration or despair through crying and bitching for every character in the same way.  Everything seemed to suffer under the gimmickry that is the gambling set up.  However, byy far the biggest problem that I had with Kaiji though was the terrible visualizations of metaphors. They aren't any axioms or sayings that one hasn&rsquo;t learned by freshman year in high school.  As a viewer, I'm not so stupid that when I hear the narrator say that &quot;Death was breathing onto the napes of each competitors' neck&quot; that I need to see it play out on screen, that is the point of figurative language. The narration was quite useless, and 9 times out of ten insulted my intelligence by regurgitating what is very clear on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this show at the beginning.  It had a great mix of familiarity and unabashed ness (very much like it&rsquo;s main character) that worked very well.  Though I did enjoy seeing a lot of losers plummet to their doom, unfortunately, it couldn&rsquo;t sufficiently maintain any of the momentum it had accumulated in the first few episodes, and suffered under the weight of its flatness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nAt the very end, yes, Kaiji is a bold and courageous attempt at an anime.  This show was very disappointing for me because of what I saw as promising early on. I think that the creators at almost every step second-guessed that what they were doing would actually read across clearly on the screen, leading to much of the redundancy in imagery and writing, and in attempts to herd the viewers to a certain &ldquo;emotional space.&rdquo;  Kaiji just tries so hard to be different that it suffers in style over substance.",

            "content": "Kaiji Ultimate Survivor explores human vices, the temptation of evil & the shattering of hope all through the usage of gambling. Kaiji is a psychological thriller building much tension as Kaiji's thoughts on society & goodwill are put into question.\r\nThe story of Kaiji begins when he takes a massive debt from this friend forcing him to resort to gambling on a secluded cruise called Espoir. (French for Hope) From this point onwards, Kaiji enters the gambling world where games cost millions of money & where a person's life matter less than money. Throughout the series, there's many challenges that emphasizes hope being nothing than adream; that human beings will backstab each other for the sake of their survival. Half of the anime follows this grim realistic concept as Kaiji learns society's vices through the most hellish experience.\\n\\n\r\nI wish not to explain any further of the content found in Kaiji as it will lead to some spoilers. All I can say is be prepared to marathon the anime in the following sittings.\\n\r\n1-9      Espoir\\n\r\n10-15 Starside Hotel\\n\r\n16-22 Slave & Emperor\\n\r\n23-26 Tissue Box Lottery \\n\\n\r\nThe music of Kaiji is performed by Taniuchi Hideki whose done music for series such as Death Note & Aoi Bungaku Series giving a suspenseful & ominous tone in the Kaiji anime. Animation is done by Madhouse but due to being a gambling series revolved around dialogue, the animation constantly looks good & being dramatic when it needs to be. I should note that the mangaka's artstyle is very angular with characters having thick outlines & pointy chins or curvy faces. The anime for Kaiji is also accompanied by a narrator that can be over the top at times possibly to relive the viewers' tension. Narrator is voiced by Tachiki Fumiko (Madao, Zaraki, Akainu, Youpi,). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the Kaiji series can be very depressing as it constantly breaks human will leaving them to die full of despair. Its 2nd season however, offers the light at the end of the tunnel but is a bit dragged in its final arc. In this anime, Kaiji is pushed to the limit where he utilizes as of his intelligence to achieve survival at the cost of others lives. Lastly, expect a lot of crying in this anime that may make its viewers feel the same anguish as the characters in the series. Kaiji Ulitimate Survivor challenges morality due to the influence of human greed & this series possess the most despicable anime villains that I ever encountered. While the characters have no super powers and are placed in a realistic world makes the concepts of Kaiji all the more disturbing & relatable to anyone.",

            "content": "Kaiji was a very interesting series for me, in that I found it to be so incredibly hit-or-miss, it's difficult to review.\r\nFirst, there are many pros.  The art is the first thing you will notice, but don't let the cover fool you; this anime is pretty well-drawn.  The style fits, and you won't even notice anything unusual after 5-10 minutes of watching.  The music and ambient sounds are some of the best I've come across, as well as most (but definitely not all) of the voice acting. This comes across to give the series a very creepy and believable atmosphere.\r\nThe story isbasically what you would expect.  It's probably the reason you want to watch Kaiji, if you're a fan of Battle Royale or Shadow Star Narutaru-type tragidrama.  It also has many elements of a mystery or puzzle-solving anime that were rather enjoyable to unravel.  As for shock value, there are a few disturbing moments, but it's not nearly as shocking as I had hoped, so I was let down in that department.  Still, I found it very enjoyable for its premise, and I was not disappointed by the gambles or the characters and the way they handle their adversity.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the cons.  The BIG cons.  First, every arc is way too long.  The reason for this is mostly the narrator, who will start to annoy you right around the second episode.  Rather than allow you, the viewer, to grasp Kaiji's situations with your own eyes, heart, and common sense, he will explain everything for you in the most obvious and melodramatic way possible, using similes and metaphors that will remind you of bad 40's radio programs.  Oh, and each of these bad metaphors is displayed onscreen as a literal interpretation (Kaiji leaping across an imaginary crevice to overcome his fears, for example), to make you feel even more condescended.  Subtlety is something that was mastered by series like Evangelion and Higurashi, and it is most certainly not present here.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the crying.  There is way too much crying.  I don't mind the dialogue, but it just always happens to be accompanied by crying, even when the situation doesn't call for tears.  There's even happy crying!  This may seem minor, but combined with the cheesy narrator and long anticlimactic story arcs, it's very distracting and only serves to lessen my interest in what happens.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there you have it.  I love gambling, tragedy, and dialogue, so of course I enjoyed this series.  In certain moments I was feeling true fear out of sympathy for the characters, and excitement for what was to come.  Unfortunately, the number of times I had to look away or do something else because I was bored/annoyed took some points away from what really could have been one of my favorite animes.  I don't see how anyone can give this a 10, since the narrator alone drags it down to 8 for me.  I think most \"normal\" anime fans should probably avoid it, and go try Monster or Higurashi instead.",

            "content": "With the various 10\u2019s all dominating the top reviews for Kaiji on MAL, I found it even more necessary to get a review written of my own for this series.  Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is an anime focusing on suspense and intense twists and turns along the way of its storytelling.  This series had me on the edge of my seat at times, but I became bored with it at others due to certain segments being drawn out longer than necessary.  Let\u2019s break down each section individually.\r\nNOTE- This review contains spoilers.\r\nThe unique style of storytelling in Kaiji is what really makesit suspenseful and gripping.  Kaiji is a malingerer in his twenties who finds himself behind in massive debt due to some poor choices made during gambling and co-signing a loan for a less-than-reliable friend.  He is therefore approached by some sort of loan shark with an opportunity to erase his large debt and start fresh.  Of course, there is a catch.  What unfolds is a series of intense life-or-death gambles that will put you on the edge of your seat.  One important thing to note in Kaiji is that this is not an uplifting story of redemption\u2026 not at all.  Expect few victories when you watch this anime, as it constantly seems that Kaiji ends up on the foul end of things.  This helped make Kaiji even more unique with the community becoming saturated with overpowered harem animes.  \\n\\n\r\nI was impressed with the sheer intensity of the \u201cgames\u201d that Kaiji and the others play in attempt to wash away their debts.  The initial \u201crock, paper scissors\u201d gamble seems purely luck based on the surface, but it becomes much more intricate as Kaiji starts to become betrayed and formulates his own internal strategies.  It also showcases the true nature of the human persona with the deceit unfolding at the end when he needed his friends to save him the most.  I can agree with the multiple comparisons Kaiji has to Deathnote in the complex mapping out of plans and ideas\u2026 even though the route they end up taking may be completely different.  I wanted to cheer for Kaiji when he thought of a genius strategy, and cry with him when his morale was at its lowest.  It\u2019s hard for me to become that emotionally attached to a character I don\u2019t particularly like, but the storytelling was just that good.  The ledge crossing game quickly became my favorite due to the common fear I have of heights.  I could imagine myself in Kaiji and the other\u2019s shoes and actually ended up feeling somewhat nauseous due to the intensity of the situation.        \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, this score was prevented from being a 10 due to the annoyance I had with the narrator and some of the drug out sequences.  I felt the need for a narrator in this series was entirely pointless, and only detracted from the anime.  Whenever he talked, I was like \u201cOkay, yeah I got that part thanks.\u201d  With the narrator to confirm our estimations of what would happen next at every turn, the hypothesizing from the viewer was ultimately ruined.  Also, some of the scenes near the end of the series (particularly with E Card) were paced too slow and felt extremely drawn out.  Sometimes this added to the empathy you would feel for Kaiji in his losses, but other times I found myself wanted to yell, \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it already!\u201d  The series concluded on a melancholy note, but left room for interpreting an eventual sequel.  Kaiji was a cut above the rest when it came to unique storytelling elements, and it became a breath of fresh air with an anticipation factor resonating within me throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Kaiji really only has three characters that really receive any sort of development.  Our main protagonist is one you can really feel for.  He\u2019s young, behind the eight ball but has a thirst for success and vengeance which assured me that he\u2019d never back down to a challenge issued to him.  Having this personality also allowed the series to progress in the manner that it did, and Kaiji\u2019s patience and mental fortitude was constantly tested by the gambles he encountered.  That being said, there wasn\u2019t much character development to be had other than what was incorporated in Kaiji\u2019s scheming and plots during gambles.  You wanted to root for him regardless, but I found myself wondering how he got into the life of gambling in the first place, and some of the decisions he made near the end of the series (i.e. the choice to challenge the director) felt a tad uncharacteristic of someone in his shoes.  The director of the irregular gambling organization, Kazutaka Hyoudou was a straight devil.  He was creepily aroused by the sight of individuals suffering, even when it came down to his own right hand man.  I enjoyed the interactions and mind games he and Kaiji shared in the final moments of the lottery game where he chalked his countless victories up to predetermined luck, based on his own social standing.  I also liked Tonegawa\u2019s character and how Kaiji grew to feel a sense of respect for him as the series went on.  The scene with him bowing before Kazutaka on the hot plate was one of the most uncomfortable scenes I can recall from an anime.  The rest of the characters felt more like filler and neither added or detracted from the overall series.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, Kaiji can turn a lot of people off to it purely based on its atypical style of art.  I personally didn\u2019t like it, but I was given a disclaimer prior to even starting the series that I have to learn to get past the art style if I want to truly enjoy the show.  After all, Kaiji is not about flashy artwork or cutesy character models.  Hell, I\u2019m quite certain there\u2019s only one female in the entire anime to look at.  The environments and backgrounds are drawn nicely, and I never felt as if the artists were being lazy during dialogue scenes... which there are a LOT of.  The sound is actually very refreshing and impressive in Kaiji.  The OP is a punk rock anthem focused on nonconformity and punches you right in the face with sheer intensity.  It\u2019s short, which I loved as well.  Too many a time, animes suffer from having intros extending too long and detract from the viewer\u2019s anticipation level.  The ED reminds me of something out of a Tarrantino movie, I loved it.  The rest of the soundtrack is decent, but I couldn\u2019t help but become confused by the \u201cZawa zawa, ZAWA\u201d sound effects randomly snuck in.  After further investigation, I now know that this is a staple in the creator Fukumoto\u2019s animes and is the Japanese word for an intense or agitating moment.  I understand it now, but it still feels unnecessary.  Voice acting was also pretty good, I loved Hagiwara Masato\u2019s role as Kaiji and thought he did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some minor flaws it had, I really enjoyed Kaiji overall.  It was definitely a breath of fresh air in the anime community and one that many people might overlook based on its unusual artwork.  I urge you to give it a chance, and you\u2019ll quickly see how this series is praised highly on MAL.  Though I can\u2019t give it a ten based on the issues I had with the show, a solid 8 is in order for this anime.  Thank you all for reading this review and have a great day!",

            "content": "Kaiji is an anime you would probably avoid at first glance. To be honest, I did too when I first saw it. It stayed in the back of my mind for a few months until a friend told me it was great and I found out that the artist and creator was Korean. So, with a bit of reluctance, I started viewing Kaiji and I was blown away. The artstyle quickly became very enjoyable and I didn't mind the pointy noses or weird eyes after the first episode. If you are avoiding this anime due to the odd artstyle, do yourself a favor and stopbeing so picky. The art is only a small portion of an anime and it can be easily overlooked if an anime has a great cast and a good plot. Please read the following review and try to muster up the enthusiasm to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nThe cast of Kaiji is relatively small because the story revolves around the main characters thoughts and emotions. My favorite character is definitely Itou Kaiji because he is such an ordinary guy. If you have seen animes like Akagi and Deathnote, you will realized how unrealistic the intelligence level of some characters can be. Kaiji is just an average guy with a dead-end job and only becomes quick-witted and devious through the games he is forced to play. His tricks and lies are never over the top with every possible variable falling into the right place. Kaiji screws up like everyone else but he has determination beyond any average person. I found myself cheering for Kaiji and wishing the best for him throughout the series. This, in my opinion, is the way you can tell if a character is very well developed and likable.\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle-\\n\r\nThere's not that much to say about the art in Kaiji. It is very unusual compared to most animes and it looks much more \"cartoonish\". Each person and object is darkly bolded with a black outline and the characters are a solid color with no realistic shading or hues. This is not a con however. The simple and unique artstyle makes it visually appealing after a first few minutes. Do not be turned off by the artstyle because you will eventually forget about it or love it altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Kaiji is not stellar or amazing, but it does set the right mood of the series. Most of the music is very suspenseful and thrilling and there are some relaxing and happy BGM as well. Don't watch Kaiji just for the soundtrack because you will be dissapointed in that sense. This isn't Bebop or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nI can't reveal too much of the story but I can say ALOT more events happen than what is written in the synopsis. After the night on the ship, Kaiji goes through a couple more dangerous gambles. The story is nothing that hasn't be done before, but it still has very entertaining twists and turns. This series had me hooked from episode one and I was so dissapointed when it ended after only 26 episodes. It could have gone a little bit longer, but I am not complaining. Kaiji, in my opinion, has one of the most enthralling and interesting storylines in anime. I regretted no part of finishing this series and the last episode left a very deep impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nKaiji is a series for those who have a lengthy attention span and have a hard-on for thrillers and suspense.It's an anime that makes you think a little bit, but that makes the series much more enjoyable. Don't watch Kaiji expecting brutal violence and adrenaline pupming action. It does have a few violent scenes here and there but Kaiji is only enjoyable if you watch it from an intelligent perspective. I hope this review convinced you to start this series. Thanks for reading folks.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji- 9/10",

            "content": "Kaiji is another gambling series done by the same people who made Akagi. If you happened to read my review on Akagi, you will notice how disappointed I was. But the same cannot be said about Kaiji. This time the producers realized their mistakes and fixed it. Now, this is a gambling series done right. Thumbs up.\r\nSTORY... The plot revolves around a man named Kaiji, who is in his early twenties and is debt-ridden. It doesn't seem he will ever be able to pay off his debts, but as if sent from the heavens or hell, a messenger comes to him with an \"once ina lifetime\" opportunity to pay off his debts... There are 3 story arcs and that's basically how each arc starts. But what keeps things certainly interesting and fresh is how with each arc, there is a new means of gambling for Kaiji, meaning he's not going to play the same game every time. Watch it for yourself to find out, I hate being a spoiler. To add to the unique gambling propositions is that within each arc, there is a heavy load of SHOCK VALUE.  It will leave you with your eyes wide open and your jaw touching the ground, constantly making you say, \"No way!? That seriously did not just happen! I can't believe it!\" There is however, still an amount of internal dialogue, but the producers have cut down on it, so the pacing of the story moves moderately. But still, near the end, the internal dialogue got a little overwhelming. There is a lot of tension build-up that you will keep you on the edge of your seat. What else is great about the plot is that it will keep you guessing from start to finish. All in all, the producers have absolutely managed to make a good story. It even provides insight on the smallest actions of the gamblers in the series, thus, giving you tips on how to become a better gambler. How can you not like that?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION... It was the same people who made the character designs for Akagi, so you're pretty much getting the same thing. It takes some getting use to, but you'll realize that there's no problem with it. The character designs fit the dark gambling atmosphere appropriately and the movements of characters are fluid, bringing life to the characters. You can also see sweat, tears, and veins. There's even some blood involved.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND... The soundtrack of Kaiji is likeable and fits the theme of the series very well. The opening theme is an up-beat rock song that you can jam to and the ending theme has a depressed, but there's still hope theme to it. It fits perfectly for gamblers who lose big and still believe that they can change. The background music is okay too. The producers didn't go wrong in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS... Kaiji is the only character that you need to know, and he is by far one of the most characters that people can relate to. Not by what he is, but by what he goes through and his qualities as a person. Kaiji is a low-life bum who resorts to not so conventional means to make a living for himself. He struggles everyday, and at times he even cries about his problems, but then suddenly realizes that crying ain't gonna do him any good. Also, how many of you have been betrayed by people whom you thought were your friends? How many times were your morals tested to the limit?  Wouldn't you say that's very human? This is just one of the many sentiments Kaiji undergoes through the series. Kaiji's morals are constantly pushed to the limit throughout the series and it is inspiring to watch him desperately hold on to his dignity as a good human being. But where Kaiji really shines is during the gambles. He has this \"keep struggling to pull the come from behind victory\" attitude and expresses his emotions loudly. These are just a few of the many things in Kaiji. He is such a great main character. You will like him for the character development he undergoes. Now, there are some side characters, but they don't stay very long, they are somewhat insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 7/10= Good\\n\\n\r\nSTRENGTHS\\n\r\n+ Great main character in Kaiji.\\n\r\n+ Has loads of twists and SHOCK VALUE, not predictable.\\n\r\n+ Even provides insight/tips on how to become a better gambler.\\n\r\n+ Has one of the most shocking endings in Anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\\n\r\n- The internal dialogue can drag the series to a boring halt sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nNote: If you're looking for a gambling series, this is it.",

            "content": "Kaiji isn\u2019t a mainstream series like Naruto or Bleach. If your high school has an anime club and that is where you hear about the series you watch, then you probably haven\u2019t heard of Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. However, if you spend time on MAL and read through suggestions, you have probably at least heard of Kaiji as a sophisticated and highly lauded work. I will be examining this 2007 anime that is already widely viewed as a timeless classic. Instead of my usual format, I will be breaking the review into pros and cons because Kaiji is a special series, so I figure it deservesa special review!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tKaiji is INSANELY addicting. This is one of the best paced and tense anime I have ever seen! You will quickly start binge watching this series and not stop until it is finished. Every episode ends on an intense cliffhanger and you simply NEED to watch another episode to find out what happens to poor Kaiji! Just the fact that this series has the ability to grab the viewer so effectively and make us care so much about Kaiji is a strong point in favor of its merit as a truly great story. \\n\\n\r\n2.\tThe character of Kaiji. We have seen many types of anime protagonists, but Kaiji for the most part feels truly unique. He is a flawed hero that is capable of being selfish, greedy, and above all fatalistic. However, he will regularly put himself at risk to help others and is capable of great kindness. Kaiji also possesses a strong sense of justice and fairness. Unfortunately, he allows other people to influence his life and tends to leave things up to fate. In other words, Kaiji\u2019s largest character flaw is his external locus of control. Kaiji\u2019s other flaw is that he is WAY too trusting and as a result is constantly getting backstabbed and betrayed. This is usually a trait reserved for a \u201cHoly Fool\u201d type character that is tragically too goodhearted and idealistic for the cruel and uncaring world in which they inhabit. It is extremely unusual for a degenerate gambler anti-hero like Kaiji. That would be like a Pokemon with the duel type Ghost/Fighting. It doesn\u2019t freaking happen! Since Kaiji feels like something unique and not an archetype that we have seen countless times, it makes him genuinely interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n3.\tThe plot actually feels fresh and interesting. In every arc, Kaiji will find himself in some kind of massive debt and must undertake an insane gamble in order to try get himself out. Very few anime actually revolve around gambling! Kaiji not only dives into the shady side of gambling and owing debt to the mob, but talks about actual superstitions and beliefs that gamblers tend to have. Much like Spice and Wolf, I got to give Kaiji some credit just for tackling a topic that I\u2019ve never seen done before in an anime.\\n\\n\r\n4.\tKaiji actually delivers some profound messages and delivers them with excellent poignancy. Instead of simply condemning gambling as purely a vice, Kaiji explains that we all need to take gambles in order to succeed. If we simply eat and breathe instead of ever going out on a limb, we will die without ever having truly lived. Kaiji also delivers the moral that people should be responsible for their own choices and have an internal locus of control, not leave everything up to others be it other human beings, God, or fate itself.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tI personally wasn\u2019t happy with the art. Firstly, I must commend the anime with taking a risk and keeping the mangaka\u2019s unique art style. It would have been far easier for the studio to follow the pack and draw Kaiji in the moe style that tends to sell best in Japan. That took some balls and I give them credit. However, Kaiji just doesn\u2019t look aesthetically appealing. You have an odd clash of character designs that mostly seems to draw inspiration from the 1970s like Lupin the 3rd and Cyborg 009, but you also have  random characters with 90s Nickelodeon lips from Ahh  Real Monsters or Wild Thornberries. The result can best be summed up with \u201cBURN IT WITH FIRE!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n2.\tThe main villain. Before I even talk about my problems with the character\u2019s personality and motivation, just open up a new tab and fucking look up a picture of Kazutaka Hyoudou! This is the character design they went with for a villain that they spend 15 episodes building up! He looks like the fucking 4chan Happy Merchant! Was Pepe the Frog not available?! Does this guy attend a council of evil image macros and occupy a table next to Scumbag Steve, Pedo Bear, and the janitor dog that works for free!? Now let\u2019s talk about what a shitty character he is. While Kaiji feels unique and interesting, this guy is the classic evil rich dude that laughs maniacally while his nefarious schemes kill the less fortunate. He is as clich\u00e9 and melodramatic as possible in a series that takes itself dead seriously. This guy should be palling around with Snively Whiplash, not occupying a series attempting to achieve artistic merit and dignity! Other characters in Kaiji feel generally realistic and fleshed out, but this guy has the depth of a kiddy pool and ruins literally every scene he\u2019s in. It suddenly shatters the series\u2019 feeling of believability and the viewer can\u2019t be moved when supposedly powerful drama happens because you\u2019re too busy laughing at Kazutaka to possibly take the scene seriously!\\n\\n\r\n3.\tCharacters are driven by the demands of the plot instead of the plot being driven by the characters. Kaiji is based on a VERY long running manga. In order to repeat the same formula in every arc, Kaiji must not win enough money to get out of debt, but must do well enough to survive the challenge. Here is why this becomes a problem. Kaiji will end up pulling a bullshit victory out his ass that contradicts all that we\u2019ve learned about Kaiji and derails his entire character, solely because the plot demands it! Kaiji will all of a sudden become a master of reading human emotion and manipulate his opponent like a marionette after repeatedly getting tricked by characters that have evil stamped on their foreheads! Kaiji ultimately ends up a tragedy and in a tragedy where you have a very flawed hero that repeatedly makes infuriating mistakes, it is only acceptable if the character is a truly great and consistent character. When we read The Idiot, we KNOW that things are going to go poorly for Myshkin, but we love Myshkin as a character and we know and accept that whenever he makes a mistake, it is the choice that we feel his character WOULD make in that situation. Now imagine if the hopelessly na\u00efve and Christ like Myshkin had to outwit a cunning adversary solely because the plot demanded it and suddenly for 1 chapter became the extremely cunning and devious financial criminal Ostap Bender from the novel 12 Chairs? It would not only be fucking stupid, but it would ruin the tragic decisions because the reader will say, \u201cwhere the fuck is the cleverness he had in that one chapter?! WTF is this bullshit!\u201d If I\u2019m going to watch a tragedy that gives me an emotional gut punch it better be damn good and it sure as HELL should have consistent characters. Kaiji is 26 hours and over 10 hours long! I will spend 10 hours of my life for a well written and character consistent tragedy like The Idiot, but I would rather hang myself than watch a 10 hour version of Spike Lee\u2019s Bamboozled!\\n\\n\r\n4.\tThe narrator cuts in every 5 seconds and explains what we already know as if we\u2019re complete idiots!\\n\\n\r\n5.\tThe melodrama reaction close ups whenever anyone reveals a game changing card or move. It was silly when Yugioh did it and Yugioh wasn\u2019t attempting to be taken seriously by mature adults.\\n\\n\r\n6.\tKaiji cries in EVERY EPISODE to try make the viewer empathize with him and feel sad. There is such a thing as diminished returns. Having a character cry when they experience a tragic loss or have reached their breaking point can be a very powerful dramatic tool and make the audience truly feel for that character and put themselves in that character\u2019s shoes. However, when you use this technique too much, it stops being effective and seems needlessly exploitive. It doesn\u2019t even feel realistic after a certain point! Imagine you were a slave or child soldier. Every day of your life is a horrible day and unspeakably terrible things happen to you. The only way that humans can survive is to basically shut off our emotion and diminish our ability to feel pain, loss, joy, humiliation, etc. During your 3rd year of hell, you would either have a strong emotional barrier or you would be dead. You would NOT still be crying every day multiple times like Kaiji in his hellhole of a life!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is an ambitious series, a unique series, an addicting series, but an incredibly frustrating series. It does enough things well to be worthy of the praise it receives, but you may put your fist through your laptop or TV screen on multiple occasions. I would still say it is worth watching, but you\u2019ve also been warned!\\n",

            "content": "This series does not get alot of love. If you don't enjoy enjoy thinking alot about your anime, you will not like this.\r\n However if you can think about it alot, you will enjoy this alittle or very much.\r\nFirst of all the story deserves it's credit. Gambling is not interesting unless it is presented in a interesting way. The original author of the manga  (Noboyuki Fukumoto) has created series based on gambling, finances, detective work, and basic struggle of surviving. And he does his work with perfection in psychological description.\r\nKaiji is a character you see grow. By the end of the series you willsee this. \\n\r\nKaiji himself gives this series 10/10 in character. \\n\\n\r\nHuman nature is a very core part of the story, and it is described through the use of a narrator. Without the narrator the story would lack something. A sound to fill the gaps of the moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something I like alot. From 2006 I have noticed animation getting sharper. Kaiji's animation uses hard-solid lines to emphasize the characters facials expressions. There are also visual props for when a character is describing something and I find this aspect intriguing and cool.\\n\r\nThe animation is nice. Especially when emphasizing the dramatic moments of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound. The music of the series is made by Hideki Taniuchi. And I love all the tracks of Kaiji. Much the tracks are used to enlarge the suspicious atmosphere of the series. The sounds effects are top notch nothing much else to say. Voice work is fine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. I give Kaiji it's 10/10 because it was able to do something great. Create a dramatic portrayal of a person's hardships.",

            "content": "First off, the reason that I am writing this review is that I feel this series is too overrated, the two current reviews here are both exemplary of that.\r\nSummarized review: \r\nStory had the potential to be great 9-10/10, however, after a while it gets really old, and all the cleverness is taken away, leaving a big sob show.\r\nArt - I am a big fan of this style of art, the huge noses, 2D characters, angular character design etc. \r\nSound - Nothing memorable, nothing to complain about.\r\nSame goes for characters and enjoyment, will get into more detail in full review.\r\nOverall : 6, vastly overrated due topeople saying it deals with the evils of humans in such great depth, and is shocking realistic, etc.\\n\r\nHowever, I feel that the majority of a viewing audience will realism that the real world is no utopia, and Kaiji does not realize this, it takes it audience to be the sorts of people that have no concept of the harsher side of life.\\n\\n\r\nFull review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: The initial concept is quite good, i.e. it has the potential to work itself up to a great storyline, however, after the first Jan Ken Pon arc I felt that it really started to fall flat on its face, there being no more mindgames, techniques, devious characters, just grown men crying. \\n\r\nHowever, it does manage to redeem itself slightly in the e-card battle, which I felt was quite well done, however, the tissue box lottery was ridiculous, more screentime was devoted to the actual planning of it that the actual execution. Additionally, the spontaneity and randomness of Kaiji's actions in this case do not seem to fit in with the rest of the show. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: As previously mentioned, I am a fan of this style, it is exactly the same as Akagi's and I feel it does not spoil the show in any way. The art style is basically, very flat and 2D, very large noses, extremely angular faces. However, the backgrounds, props, etc. are all drawn very well and in a normal fashion. \\n\r\nThe art may not be for everyone, in fact most people dislike it, yet I feel that this is actually the strongest point of the show.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing memorable, there was probably some BGM playing during the sad scenes, of which there are innumerable amounts. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED are suitable, but not amazing, and I give the director credit for not taking any old Japanese pop idol with an amazingly high voice and having her do some poppy song that would be completely inappropriate for this sort of show.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The protaganist Kaiji, I personally disliked him, not immensely, but the dislike was there nonetheless. \\n\r\nThe reasoning? Basically, he has been living as a bum for an unmentioned amount of years, but I assume since he graduated/left highschool. You think this would harden the man up, make him be aware of the evils that are present in the majority of people. However, he seems to think that all people are good, he unwittingly trusts them, in other words he is a bloody fool.\\n\r\nYet in other cases, e.g. the game of E-Card he shows that he is amazingly resourceful, can think of great strategies, and can smooth talk to deceive any man. It is just very unusual and flawed in a sense.\\n\r\nOther characters worth mentioning are Tongegawa, my personal favourite character from this show, Kaiji put it quite well saying that Tonegawa is a 'Snake'. Like a snake, he is tricky, apathetic, and devours the 'have-nots'.\\n\r\nThis is another failure on the show's part, usually one would empathize with the protagonist, yet here I find myself actually liking the antagonist more.\\n\r\nThere aren't any other big characters beside these, there are the two people who initially help out Kaiji on the ship, but they are very linear and behave in the fashion one would expect them to.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAlthough I did find myself initially enjoying the show, especially the first arc. After that the enjoyment level quickly dropped, I found myself hating Kaiji in ever-increasing amounts. His stupidity, his predictable actions, all attributed to this hatred. Then came in E-Card, if it had ended on that I would have probably given this show a 7/10 instead of a 6, as that was quite magnificently done and well thought out. However, instead of that the director chose to put in some crappy badly thought out ending whereby it just becomes even more obvious what an idiot Kaiji is.\\n\r\nThat being said the ending was fairly open, leaving the possibility of a season 2.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI found that Akagi was vastly superior to Kaiji, however, if you are a fan of Hagiwara, Masato (I definitely am, most badass voice actor around), and the style of art, and several mindgames that are logically thought out (few and far between in this show, I'm afraid, although they are still there), give Kaiji a go.",

            "content": "Murphy's Law, whatever can go wrong WILL go wrong. This is the basic premise surrounding almost any anime related to games. As you watch a show like Kaiji, you already know that over the course of whatever game they are playing, things will go badly. The key to these shows it to surprise you anyway, to be caught off guard by the things that go wrong, and to be impressed when the good guys overcome the odds. \r\nKaiji (mostly) accomplishes this. The main character, Kaiji, plays several different games in which he risks his life/body parts, etc. Some of the games he plays are extraordinarilyclever. The first arc especially, has one twist after another, and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the show is more off and on. A few of the games don't have any clever aspects and strategy like the first arc, which was disappointing, but I do give them credit for at least being pretty intense. These games just aren't at the level of the first arc though. One other game Kaiji plays comes close, but it isn't quite there. Basically, the first 10 episodes of Kaiji are absolutely amazing, and from there the show is a bit more off and on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key to games anime is generally to have some great characters. No matter how clever the writing is for the game, if you aren't compelled to cheer for the good guys, these games lose a lot of their intensity. Kaiji is a bit different from other shows in this regard. I honestly never liked any of the \"good guys\" in Kaiji. I found the main character to be \"OK\" but nothing more. I have to give them loads of credit for the bad guys they create though. I absolutely hated the bad guys, and was cheering for Kaiji just to see them lose. Thanks to this, I was able to stay into the show, but it is a shame that the \"good guys\" weren't that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty unique. The most noteworthy aspect being the large noses. I got used to the art, but I never really liked it. All the characters are pretty ugly thanks to the art style. Also, I felt like they overused computer animation a bit. It's not necessarily bad, but I never liked it. The sound on the other hand, is pretty bad. I hated the opening theme, and I never even noticed the music during the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main flaw with Kaiji is probably the last 4 episodes. They were pretty lame and predictable, and not nearly at the level of other episodes. I was completely uninterested most of the time, despite some crazy moments. The ending was also pretty lame, and pretty much solely to set up a new season.\\n\\n\r\nAnother slightly annoying aspect, is how the show constantly tries to give social commentary based on the games they are playing. I frankly did not care at all, and I felt like it was a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kaiji tries to be both intense and clever, it can truly be an amazing show, perhaps even at masterpiece level. However, Kaiji tries too hard sometimes to just be intense, without the added cleverness, and this is where the show falters. If you are into Hikaru No Go, or Akagi, you will surely enjoy Kaiji. If games anime aren't quite your thing, my reccomendation becomes a bit more shaky. I would suggest that anyone, even if you don't generally like games anime, should give the first 10 episodes a try, as they are easily the best of the show, and from there, decide if you want to keep watching.",

            "content": "Money is a very important part of our lives. To even do anything, you need money. Food? Money. Anime? buy a computer, which costs money. Clothes? Money. The only thing I can think of that won't cost money to build or maintain is yourself. So what do you do when you desperately need money, fast? Kaiji's answer to this question is to gamble for it. And damn, there's a hell of a lot of gambles in this anime.\r\nBasically, the story revolves around Itou Kaiji, who's broke and also in debt for about 3 million yen. Some black suits come and talks him into gambling ona ship to pay off his debt. There's a catch, however. Fail, and he will be forced to do manual labor on an island for 1-2 years. Getting 3 wins (stars) allows him to get off the ship. However, a star will be taken away for each loss. And this is only the first arc. The second arc pits Kaiji on a bridge, the third on a bridge that's electrocuted, another settling with a card game(and a very interesting one at that), and another a lottery. All of these arcs are very interesting, in their own way. Morals, Luck, Right or Wrong, Cheating, and Greed are only some of the things it discusses over the series. Mind that the story is also dark and very psychological.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has it's own distinct style. I admit I was turned off by it at first, but then I grew to like it. The animation is very smooth and flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty good. The right BGM at the right moments, and the theme songs kind of fits Kaiji's tone. The voices were perfect for each character (except for Furuhata, didnt like his voice)\\n\\n\r\nEach main and supporting character is very different in their own special way, mostly guys.  Kaiji is really a character that I can relate to. He will be betrayed, lose limbs, sees the deaths of his comrades, and thrown into impossible gambles and still Kaiji survives it, mostly through mixed emotions and strategic planning. The rest of the cast is memorable, except the lackeys in which Kaiji usually tells them to do stuff (you'll see what I mean)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot. More than I expected to enjoy it. Kaiji's character, the daredevil gambles, the strategic planning, everything! Well, almost everything. Some of the plans will make you think \"why the hell would you do that\" and the bad ending might be a turn-off to some people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. Trust me, you'll have a good time with this series.\\n\\n\r\nBTW this is my first review, please give me feedback on this!!! Thanks!",

            "content": "This is my first review so please bear with me :P\r\nI am also aiming at keeping this extremely spoiler-free, only explaining my viewpoint and impressions.\r\nTL;DR:\r\nThe story was very very unpredictable and excruciatingly tense, well paced and v well plot centered. I personally enjoyed the art style which kept its strong consistency throughout. The voice acting was superb, as well as the restless soundtracks. Each character - no matter the role - felt real and distinctive. Very addicting.\r\nStory- 10/10: \r\nCutting straight down to the chase - I loved the story. The story started off with a very amusing and somewhat relatable mc. The story dived straightinto the plot which was a great plus. The theme of gambling and risk was very prominent throughout the whole anime which is exactly what I came for. I gave this anime a 10/10 because of how unpredicatable and amazing the plot twists are - honestly, the tables can turn in a matter of split seconds, and I was left in awe and excitment every time. The story arcs were a suitable length and I never felt that an episode was too long. It is true that at some point, one 20 minute episode only captured 10 minutes of real time. However, time felt completely unrelevant due to the extreme tension the episode created and I did not feel any loss of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10: \\n\r\nThe art is very different to say the least, it somewhat reminds me of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu with the black inking/bordering around characters. Needless to say, I am a fan of unique art styles in anime and do place art as the least significant factor in rating anime. In my opinion, the art was pleasing to see yet it was nothing spectacular. The art style was very consistent with barely any mistakes (I only noticed 1). At the beginning, it felt like characters were designed by literally mixing and matching premade facial strucures and shapes, which didn't really affect my liking for the art - it made it seem that everyone is similar in a way. However, the art always kept a high standard and I didn't feel any awkward animations - every seemed to flow very smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in the anime were very good - they created a tense and engulfing atmosphere at very crucial times. I absolutely loved the ZAWA ZAWA~ throughout the entire anime. Voice acting was great - the casting, the emotions, everything. It really felt like the character voice's matched them. I really enjoyed the opening and ending songs, doesn't get stuck to mind that much but nevertheless, very fun xD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10:\\n\r\nThe massive variety of personalities was awesome. Kaiji (the main mc) was so loveable although all his bad qualities. You pity him at so many points of the anime, feeling his pain and anguish. However, he has such amazing moments of inspiration and motivation, that you sit in bewilderment. He is a great guy, with very terrible luck and fate. His enemies differ a lot - most characters differ quite a bit. Some are extremely hateable yet others are to be feared or avoided, which I think is a great mix. Even the sideline characters have very clear personalities, which are portrayed and developed very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\r\nNot much to say about this - its very subjective.\\n\r\nEach episode hooked me onto the next, I was flying through them more than ever. I loved the tension, the uncertainty, the risks.",

            "content": "\"Money, it makes the world go 'round.\" \r\nIt seems people, in general, will do all kinds of illogical and stupid things just for a little bit of cash. And, people who are well off generally find that amusing. But, when someone has their back against the wall in most cases they will do anything to make it out. Kaiji, a series about a man up to his neck in debt and who is forced to participate in all kinds of twisted \"games\" with the stakes seemingly much higher and repercussions much more sever each time he plays, gives the viewer a surprising and quite truthfullook at the darker side of human nature. \\n\\n\r\nFukumoto Nobuyuki seems to run on the belief that people can, and will, screw over each other when their back is against the wall. This is shown quite early, as Kaiji is tricked at the beginning of the very first arc and from then on it seems as though the series is just an exercise in him getting continuously screwed over. But, here's the thing: that is actually a good thing for the story. In a story where people continuously backstab one another and don't look out for each other, Kaiji is one of the few who seems to actually care for his fellow man to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nFukumoto deftly and skillfully contrasts the overall dark tone of the series with his protagonists' altruism and never really picks a side. Which makes it all the more effective, as morality should be handled as morally grey. That said, it isn't as though the characters that aren't Kaiji are particularly well developed. The villains of the series, for instance, Tonegawa and \"The Chairman\" are very obviously portrayed as evil for the most part, though they do have some interesting philosophies, with the typical \"bad guy\" poses that overly dramatic series like Death Note do. Think Light Yagami when he comes up with some dastardly plan.\\n\\n\r\nBut, strangely enough, this kind of works to the series' advantage as well. Because, to Kaiji, these people ARE evil. They put him in this terrible situation where he could die or possibly worse, so the dramatizing can be effective in this situation. That said, those who dislike melodrama may be kind of turned off. But, personally, I think it fits the tone and situations for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, every one who has any passing knowledge of this series and anything else by Fukumoto knows that the art can be kind of a turn off for certain people. The faces, in particular, look strange at first with the overly stylized nose. But, all but the most close minded should be able to get over this once the series gets into the swing of things. In fact, the art is effective in showing character reactions whether it be fear, shock, happiness or any other human emotion. Very effective stuff here, most viewers will probably be pleasantly surprised by the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects do the job nicely, with the most memorable part being the \"Za\" sound effect used throughout when ever something or someone takes a dark turn. Unfortunately, it is very easy to imagine this being an annoyance to some people. Personally, I thought it greatly added to the tension in key scenes. The OP and ED are okay, nothing overly memorable. Pretty good voice acting across the board, though nothing was overly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nA very effective series, all things considered. As someone who isn't exactly into gambling by any means, I was personally more pulled into the glimpses of human nature and the general darkness the series presented. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story about a man thrown into a series of games to make money isn't particularly interesting. But, when the story gets going this series has an interesting opinion on the human condition. The games themselves are interesting, with the most entertaining ones being the Rock, Paper, Scissors and E Card. Honestly, the series high point is the over the top but incredibly intriguing \"Brave Men road\" arc. It has to be seen to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\\n\r\nGreat facial expressions in dramatic situations. The artstyle takes a few episodes to get used to, but once the viewer is into the thick of things it shouldn't be a problem. The art has far more advantages than disadvantages.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\\n\r\nGood voice work, well done sound effects, and decent music. The sound effects, in particular, work extremely well in heightening tension.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is a surprisingly believable and easy to relate to character and his contrast with many of the other, \"look out for yourself\" characters is intriguing. Takegawa is pretty much the only other particularly interesting character as he has some interesting thought processes. Fukumoto wisely doesn't choose a particular side, though the \"evilness\" of the other characters does counter act this a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\\n\r\nA very addicting series, Kaiji can really suck the viewers time away. It's also entertaining for people who want \"something more\" from their entertainment while not digging to deeply. It's easy to imagine that the games could be entertaining to watch without the food for thought as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\\n\r\nAn impressive series that wasn't like what I thought it would be, aside from the  sense of style. The world view of this series is particularly gripping. Definitely worth the watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for an intelligent show about gambling, this is not it. This is a completely unrealistic story about someone who sucks at gambling facing off against people who suck even more. I confess that I did enjoy watching this and gambling is a favorite theme of mine, but this show does have an overwhelming number of flaws.\r\nFirstly, Kaiji is one of the most frustratingly irrational protagonists I've ever seen. His sheer naivety, lack of common sense, bad logic don't change much throughout the show, which is concerning when you would assume he is meant to persevere by outwitting others. Although Kaiji goes througha lot, his character development is quite unconvincing. The pacing of the episodes is too slow; everything gets over-explained as if this is a show for kids. The consistency of characters is very poor, with several individuals flip-flopping in terms of their level of empathy and skill in order to suit whatever needs to happen in the story. In this sense there are only a few characters in the show that make sense, and Kaiji isn't even one of them. There is also a lot about the setting of the show that is completely unrealistic. While suspension of disbelief is required in every gambling anime, there are just a lot of things in the storyline, setting, and supporting details that are too inconsistent or don't make sense even in a fictional world. Lastly, there's a fair bit of philosophical nonsense provided by Kaiji and the narrator, and I just found it boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does get more engaging throughout the series and the main thing I found thrilling was the uncertain challenges the gamblers had to face.",

            "content": "Video Version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vkAbdmdBkg\r\nIn this ever expanding world of Chinese Cartoons there are a few plots that seem to be recycled very often, happy go lucky high school kids with hair so pointy that it could gouge eye out, and random fanservice. So today i\u2019ll be talking about about a  show with a protagonist being a drifting deadbeat who has a nose so pointy that it could gouge your eye out and a cast that doesn\u2019t have a single girl, well unless you don\u2019t include Mikoko...Yep\r\nSo just because a show is popular [SAO] doesn't mean it\u2019s good or just because a show is unpopulardoesn't mean it\u2019s bad and this is certainly the case with Kaiji. It is one of those series that has some how not caught the eye of too many even though it is one of the best series that I've seen. But if you do watch it, one thing that probably catch your eye is the amazingly weird or great art style depending on how you look at it. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is based on a manga of the same name written by Nobuyuki Fukumoto who also wrote Akagi. Kaiji has been adapted by studio Madhouse and first started airing in 2007 with 26 episodes and a sequel was released in 2011 with another 26 episodes to make a 52 episode masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about the deadbeat Kaiji, when he gets into a large amount of debt due to a loan he cosigned for a former colleague. And to pay back the debt he goes on a  gambling ship 'Espoir' which sounds more like a cruise old people would die on, putting that aside, Espoir in French translates to the Hope but the place is anything but a place of hope, it is more like the place where your hopes get crushed, oh wait that's McDonalds. I was promised this! Not this! What?:( Putting that aside, this for our protagonist starts his journey of gambling at higher and higher stakes. [3,850,000 yen debt] \\n\\n\r\nKaiji is a deadbeat young man who for lack of a better word is just a scum bag. He really isn't the type of character that you'd think that you would want to root for, but surprisingly despite the description, he really is quite a charismatic character who you do feel sorry for and really wish him to succeed and when he doesn't it crushed you. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many other side character but they change for both seasons so I won't talk about them too much. But here are some honorable mentions.\\n\r\nAndou, the fat low life, Furuhata, the guy who got Kaiji into this mess, Ishida, the cry baby. Even though they aren't the main focus they are still very developed character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another this I want to talk about are the shows antagonists. Hyodo, the human cat. Ichijou who says weird things like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hORG93gbs5I] and Tonegawa.  All of them are extreme cartoons [its a god damn anime???] as in they are all so evil that it is unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nMany people are put off by the different art style of the anime which, i will admit, isn\u2019t the best style and some character designs are just ugly, the animation is pretty outstanding. This alongside the intense visual metaphors this anime gives 22us, I would say that the Madhouse did a pretty rock solid job on the animation.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you can overlook the different art style there is a lot of fun to be had in this series. There is tension building every episode and unlike other shows our character doesn\u2019t always win so the possibility of him losing is real. Though you might think that an anime about gambling sounds boring it is anything but the same is less about the actual game and more about the psychological battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe only drawback is a minor one, the narrator, though entertaining most times, helping you understand the logic of Kaiji, sometimes breaks intense moments with ridiculous analogies. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, moments in the second season made me laugh out loud due to the unexpected and hilarious innuendo like this.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that concluded i give both seasons of Kaiji a 9/10, so go watch Kaiji, it\u2019s amazing and it is one of the most underrated shows out there. Literally more people have seen Future Diary. I really want a third season.\\n",

Has he has no money to pay the debt plus the big taxes demanded, he gets in the world of gambling. Starting at a ship, and then after in an hotel, kaiji will have to gamble not only money but also his life, as they are like paws to the rich people, who have something like absolute control over then...kaiji will have to face those people to get rid of his problems, and if u want to find out if he really does itthen you should watch ;).\\n\r\nNot bad,Not amazing, a 7 here.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7.3) - Although the design of the characters and environment is not bad, i believe it could be better...i think it is rather simplistic, and a bit more details wouldnt hurt at all..\\n\\n\r\nSound (8.2)- I liked it..It really creates some atmosphere, in the midle of the psychological games and cheatings that occur in the games...really apropiatte and surelly a good thing to the progress of the gambles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacther (8.0) - Well, although the characters are not like those we can say ...&quot; wow, they are really cool&quot;, the fact is that they are well develloped, also the emotions of each one are very well made, and this makes me give an 8 in this point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.0) - Althoug some of the gambles are really interesting (restricted rock-papper-scissors, E-card) others werent that good ..the last gamble was really nothing special in my opinion, it was a strange way to end this anime, since it is normal to save the best fight for last, but in this case it ended with an unfinished fight between kaiji and hyoudou. Well is not that bad, still and nice way to spend some time. I recommend those who like anime with gamble, since i think between all, this one may be one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.3) - Although it is indeed a good anime, i believe it had the potential to be even better..so a 7 sounds well here, but dont misunderstand me, i&acute;m not saying it isnt good, i&acute;m saying i was expecting better ..",

There might be some spoilers so do take that in mind before proceeding.\r\nIf you wanted to watch this show because Wikipedia wrote stuff like, \"art of gambling\" or \"winner of the Kodansha Manga Award\" or hell, even recommended by some people like its the best thing ever, just stop and back away.\r\nI'll be blunt. This trash was boring and un-inspirational from the moment the 2nd half of the first part started. GyakkyouBurai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is nothing but a story of games of pure luck and courage turned way too overly dramatic. It's filled with boring, cliche'd and cheesy \"motivational\" lines throughout the whole show, spoken by a hypocrite like a true hypocrite.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also a story of a man who fails to understand his own limit and his surrounding. Even after being lied and betrayed many times, he still trust people with his own life. Oh, yet another NAKAMA PAWA bullshit used by delusional mangaka. This stuff gets very old and very boring very fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe rich is still rich and the trash became, well... trashier. There's nothing fun in this. There's no intellectual aspect in any of the so-called \"gambles\". Every single aspect of this show was overly used without deep thoughts put into them.\\n\\n\r\nI won't rate the sound and art, because they don't matter. People still watch Rick and Morty even with those kind of art style.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I admit I may be upset by the stupid main character not winning, but it's more about him not evolving. 26 episodes isn't a little, it's a lot. A lot of stuff can be put in 26 episodes, but they decided to drag it out and ultimately made the show boring. So boring that I had to play with my phone while listening to the boring monologues.\\n\\n\r\nA little spoiler:\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\n---\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThis show is filled with many manly tears. And driven by greed and ego, the man refuses to admit defeat only to destroy himself. He then continues to say stuff like, \"This is the last\", \"I've had enough of this\", blablabla, yet he still let his greed to overpower him and lose everything.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you knew it was bound to happen judging from the flow of the story and how easily predicted the show is.",

            "content": "I am going to start this review off by saying that I loved this show at first.  It was different from every other anime I had watched before and It really gave me a character I could get behind.  He is very likable and you root for him.  The first arc is incredible.  The boat and the whole scenario really feel like a new innovative thing that really kept me enthralled the whole time.  It was grim and bleak with no end in sight, but it worked.  Then it all changed.  The second arc was good, until theygot to the big bridge.  First thing I will say is this show for me is predictable at this point.  I can predict how it will go, who will die, and what will happen to Kaiji.  Its sad.  It becomes this sadistic game and this show really is trying to prove a point of, \"No matter how hard you try you will not get anything and no one will help you.  You are on your own\".  This does not sit well with me, but not because it is grim, but because there is no relief from it at any point.  I am fine with grim things, but this is grim to the point of predictability and is almost torturous to watch.  The whole time on the \"death bridge\", I knew how many people were going to die and that regardless of what happened it would be grim for Kaiji.  The show pushes this idea of no hope home so much that it becomes tiresome.  Overall, this show really did not do it for me and I wish I had stopped after episode 15 because it just gets worse and worse after that.  I will say as much as it was predictable and grim, the visual metaphors were great, I really enjoyed Kaiji and the supporting cast as a whole, and the art style and animation was solid.  It was just this grim predictability that did it in for me and really made this show unwatchable. 4/10",

            "content": "Mind games, psychological warfare, addiction, manipulation, strategy, vanity, betrayal, morality and corruption. These are a few words that best describe this gambling anime, which delves into the depths of human mind and soul to discover the extends that people can reach for money. \r\nThe French philosopher, Pascal, once referred to human beings as \"the glory and the scum of the universe\". Humans have the ability to make a leap of faith to achieve greatness and experience the grandeur of glory. But if you stumble during that leap of faith, you end up falling in the depths of the bog that is the human mind andbecoming the scum. Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor portrays exactly that idea: What it means to be the scum of the universe that still dreams of glory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very addictive and realistic. Despite the gambling games being simple enough, the stakes and intensity are extremely high because the characters are gambling with their lives for a slim chance at winning money. And naturally, when you life is on the line, your behaviour and attitude changes, or rather, your true colours come on the surface. At times, you cannot help but put yourself in the shoes of the characters and feel like you are there with them risking your life. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is a gambling addict with a sharp mind and strong perseverance but very emotional and easily agitated at the same time. Most of the times he ends up suffering due to his own folly and sense of justice. The antagonists are also very well thought characters. Despite looking like the biggest human scums that make others suffer, their reasoning is well-presented and their remarks hit right in the spot. They are not the ignorant fools that are just present to make things happen, but they are actually very well crafted personalities that play a vital role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not very impressive and perhaps one of the weak points of this anime. The sound is average, it fits the mood and enhances the intensity of the scenes but not very memorable. This anime uses a lot of narration and it is done excellently. The narrator is the same voice actor who does the voice for Admiral Akainu in One Piece (and Ikari Gendou in Evangelion) and hypes up the moment a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a great anime that you should watch even if gambling is not your cup of tea. Give it at least 3-4 episodes and I can assure you that you will get addicted to the series. A very enjoyable watch, a very interesting plot and definitely an unforgettable experience! A must see! Do not miss this one!",

            "content": "*This is a review concerning the first season of Kaiji ,This review only reflects my personal opinion*\r\nKaiji Ultimate Survivor is an anime that is about games with repercussions , It succeeded in many aspects Yu-gi-oh : The Shadow Games (A.K.A Yu-gi-oh Season 0) did not , while also failing on other aspects in which Yu-gi-oh succeeded.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe Story is mostly about corruption , corruption of the mind , corruption of businessmen , corruption of the human desires , the setting is where Businessmen control the world via money, in other words were money is power. the realistic theme of course of this series was great, the problem was that the story made little impact on how things go, and seemed to be forced just to create the games , The setting did not affect how the game flows and was just made to give a background story in which the games can progress , in short , the anime could easily be divided into 4 games , The first game was deeply thought of and was perfectly executed , the second game was just to show psychological nature of humans which was completely unnecessary *Nothing is added and the game didn't really have any thinking abilities*, The third game is completely unoriginal *An alternate state of the 1st game* but it was enjoyable till the writer took an unbelievable route. and the 4th game was too simple but it had a lot of intensity. All in all , it suffers from variety, But its main strength is in how psychological aspects in this series are easily explored with your own mind giving you a chance to get the idea before the main character does which is really enjoyable with the exception of the second game which has nothing of that.\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nNow this is the first time where I can say its not Madhouse's fault as Madhouse did its best to make it look as good as possible, The animation is pretty good and the studio made it look as best as it can , the fault here lies on the mangaka for the bad art style which is perfectly uncomfortable and I don't even know why did he choose such a bad art style. Madhouse made it look as best as possible.\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nNot giving opinions on the (Chaba Chaba Chaba) fx thing , The Music is nice and blends with the scenes perfectly , The characters voices are nice and they fit their characters\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe Characters are admirable in most cases , One of the good parts that Kaiji emphasizes on is how it allows the exploration of each character's agenda which makes things interesting and makes the mind games played enjoyable , the bad parts in the characters is how anything outside the realm of the games makes any sense , for example *A kills B , C wants to avenge B , so C challenges A to a game* and there was one lunatic unbelievable point that was out of character completely. rather than that the mind games and the agendas make up for it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nIn the Enjoyment level I Enjoyed it pretty much , the use of Xanatos Gambit (Agenda exploring) in the games instead of Deus ex machina (Asspulls) makes the series much interesting , It maintains unpredictability in some times which was good and gave intensity as I watched it , One thing I didn't like in this series is when it came to using metaphors , a one and two could be enough , but you don't have to use up to 3 or 4 metaphors to explain one psychological state. It was used to kill time and to be honest it wasn't a good idea to excessively use them , Even though I stated a lot of flaws , The anime is really enjoyable and the good makes up a lot for the bad.\\n\r\nOverall (7 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 8)/5 = 7.8\\n\r\nCeiling 7.8 is 8\\n\r\nSo it is an 8/10 (Very Good)",

The ingenious creation of several unique games allows for hundreds of opportunities for Kaiji and his allies to try and find a way to survive by the thinnest breadth. However, as the viewer becomes accustomed to Kaiji worming his way out of situations, this pushes the viewer to take this as an inevitability that the protag will find a way to a happy ending, or at least one with less suffering. This is where the show's excellent abilityto create suspense shows itself, due to the *spoilers* events at the end of the first series when Kaiji loses and is badly injured, the potential for Kaiji to be hurt or killed is not outwith possibility. Beside constantly changing advantages between Kaiji and his opponents, the tide of each contest is thrown back and forth with each episode, keeping the viewer desperately wishing for the result to be shown. Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji is up there with my favourites, and deserves another sequel, as unlikely as it seems, so it's definitely worth a watch.\\n",

I sat through that story arc and some amazing high-level gaming theory mathematics where I had to rewind several times to understand what the heck Kaiji was getting at -- and there's been a \"Dr.\" in front of my name for 30 freakin' years!\r\nThen I kept watching -- so it's all my fault.\r\n    With all his math skills, how EXACTLY, would kaiji allow himself to co-sign for a loan for a casual acquaintance co-worker to the freakin' YAKUZA, at somethinglike 200% compounded monthly?!  Based on the wizard math skills he demonstrates in the story arc, he would TOTALLY know what the interest on $3,000 loan would be  ($3,000 @ 200% monthly turns into $35,000 really quickly) and wouldn't dare put his mark on a note from a Loan Shark that Kaiji (OR his family would have to pay if the co-worker flaked on).\\n\r\n     Oh, and since he worked with the guy, we're supposed to believe that Kaiji just nonchalantly co-signed a loan and then what? Forgot about the co-worker and the loan with the M.A.F.I.A......really?  He put his SEAL on a loan with the Yakuza - with 200% interest per month!  and Kaiji was just whistling away the days?!  I for one want to know what was so special about that \"Co-Worker\"?\\n\r\n We get one 10 second \"flashback\" explaining the co-worker relationship which was not very helpful at all, and otherwise, absent Kaiji getting getting some pretty excellent ass-sex,  -- it's crap storytelling, pure and simple.  \\n\\n\r\n     The entire initial setup to get Kaiji into debt insults my intelligence and Kaiji's too.  He may be a slacker, but he's no dummy when it comes to numbers, but the story itself makes him out to be stupid/have a brain, so what gives?  Weak of will or gullible on some things doesn't mean that Kaiji wouldn't understand loan notes either.\\n\\n\r\nLAST EPISODES\\n\\n\r\n      Without spoiling it, in the last episodes of the first season, through twists and turns, Kaiji has amassed 20 crates of cabbage.  He says, repeatedly, that he owes 10 crates to a friend's family -- he owes 10!  Kaiji also owes several crates to clear his own debt.  After that, he will have a certain number of crates to himself..... at this point Kaiji's character starts doing things that he said he didn't or wouldn't do....  and I can only conclude that it was done to drive the show even if the main character is not acting right in the head.\\n\\n\r\n     So, at this point I'm so pissed off  that I decided to give this show a fucking \"3\" and write this review - my very first review - after watching over a hundred anime shows too!  please be kind.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:  This show went off the rails in the first episode, and I did not heed the whistle.  I deserve the spanking that I received by watching all 26 episodes.",

            "content": "Don't let the different approach in the animation put you off, just forget about the pointy noses and get ready for the ride of your life. \"Kaiji\" is not for the faint of heart. Not in terms of physical violence but for the sheer psichological violence in it. You'll feel like your in Kaiji's shoes and every ounce of feeling - despair, fear and desire - will fill your mind. You can't rationalize it because Kaiji's always in a \"no way out\" situation, and no matter how hard he tries to find a logical solution he ends up in a stalemate which he must overcomeby finding something like an hidden strenght, will or personal meaning so the painful struggle can ride him towards a new life, a life with no debts, as you watch the story develop you'll feel Kaiji's wish to be reborn.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall feel to the anime is something to the likes \"society got you cornered yet again\": the pressure to be a better person, to crush our own so called soul and obliterate our flaws, how very dependable we are when it comes to money and why this affects our very sanity often blinded by unthought greed. The so called system, no, the actual reality we all live in, make our very wishes, the deepest ones, be meaningless when confronted with the walls and obstacles that are put in front of us everyday, it's a struggle to free yourself from the shackles that constrict us from outside and from inside. I could show the philosophy behind \"Kaiji\" by pointing out some famous thinkers like Kierkegaard: \"The individual has the sole responsibility for giving one's own life meaning and with living life passionately and sincerely, in spite of many obstacles and distractions including despair, angst, absurdity, choice, boredom, and death.\" or Nietzsche, whom in the 19th century was already afraid of how society will end up teaching and raising new generations of kids to be materialistic to the point that money would mean more to one person than life itself. You study for money, life revolves around money, you can't live without it. Some of you will identify with with the problems Kaiji is put through, as the show reflects situations that resemble our deepest worries and dreams. \\n\\n\r\nThose who say \"it's nor for everyone\" is dead wrong, while you can dwell on it as a more complex piece of media it's also a rather accessible anime centered around gambling with cliffhangers in every episode that leave you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\n~zawa~\\n\\n",

Each situation tries to top the last one in terms of epic and thrill, so in the end you become more or less used to it so it's not as surprising as in the beginning (thisis when all the dialogue starts to piss you off).\\n\\n\r\nLiking Kaiji depends a lot on how you like your stories told.

            "content": "Okay before I start, I would like to say this isn't your typical anime. It's a very different, kind of a sleeper hit and has some amounts of cult following. If you like those interesting kind of makes you think animes, then you should give this a go without reading any further.\r\nFirst of all, Kaiji is a character driven... thriller/drama of some kind. It's about a man named Kaiji who's a bum... he's never had it good all his life, and his still bumming around aimlessly without clear direction which to apply himself.\r\nKeep in mind that... if you do not like the premise or themain character... then you probably won't find it memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe part that I found were important in this anime... are it's philosophies and qualities that make you think. It's very grim and dark... and it sometimes feel kind of preachy... but if you take a moment to think then you would find that those ideas have their own merits... and upon further application, that it's worth 100s of hours of thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very much about battle in society... or the rat race or should I say human stepping stones.\\n\\n\r\nThe philosophies root in money and the system that there is only a set amount of money and that if someone in the world is rich... someone is bound to be poor. Because really when your making money your getting it from somebody else.\\n\\n\r\nYou get where I am going with this? This anime documents these kinds of happenings around the world and how a low life bum would feel about it.\\n\\n\r\nAt first Kaiji is a very innocent man... able to trust anyone easily, but as the show goes on he quickly loses that innocence and becomes much more sharp... somewhat cynical but in the end he reaches a higher understanding and is able to have the spirit and the insight necessary to carry those all around him and himself into victory.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this around the time when I was 17... and when I was conscious about my deprecating innocence. I was also a kid who was poor and had gone through some life stories some hard ships of his own. I think this really made me identify with the characters... and what they were trying to say...\\n\\n\r\nThe later arcs philosophical ideas really made an impact on me... even though I was thinking quiet similarly before I saw it.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I am 19 and has changed some of my ideals... My ideals aren't as gritty as they used to be... but this anime still remains in a cozy part of my heart.",

The visuals in this show are just thebest i've never seen such sophisticated and \\n\r\nprecise graphics .  these visuals transmit the character's feelings perfectly : \\n\r\nthere are moments in kaiji ultimate survivor where an old man put his hand in a box to get a  piece of paper \\n\r\nbut in this normal scene i've never experienced such feeling of hype \\n\r\nDuring the 52 episodes of kaioji i was on the edge of my seat . The hype was real. And it was thanks to various\\n\r\nfactors : As i mentionned earlier this show is unique with his art style reflecting all the emotional feelings\\n\r\nkaiji and his mates have , also the author escaped from all the expectations i had . In anime genrally the main \\n\r\ncharacter is the winner but it may surprise you later in the show that it's not always the case in kaiji \\n\r\nfinally the OST contributed in a very positive way : metal for hype moments and sad violin for sad moments \\n\r\nThe composer of kaiji's ost did very well ( he's the composer of death note's ost also ) ;\\n\r\nif you didn't watch kaiji yet what are you doing ?

            "content": "Oh, where do I even begin here? This series has few redeeming qualities. With perhaps the most poorly paced story I've seen in years, shallow characters, a mediocre style, and middle-school level psychological aspects which are made to be a big deal, this series fell flat on it's face for me, almost completely.\r\nThe protagonist named Kaiji works a minimum wage job. He's such an intelligent guy that he manages to get himself into a ton of debt with the Yakuza by being his friend's guarantor for a 300,000 Yen loan. With the ridiculous interest on that loan, it quickly becomes over 3 million yen.\r\nThen theprotagonist demonstrates further intelligence by joining a gambling cruise with promises to eliminate that loan. Thus begins the story, involving various gambling and psychology elements. It's not a bad premise entirely. It's just executed very poorly.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the pacing is something awful. In the first game, they are given a deck of cards with rock/paper/scissors to play against other duelists in the battle for star chips which are worth money. The cruise is 4 hours long. It takes about 10 episodes to finish the cruise, but mind you the last 20 minutes of the cruise last two or three episodes themselves. I had serious DBZ 5 minute-Namek deja vu when the characters were talking about how only 17 minutes remained, then proceeded to spend NEARLY FIFTEEN MINUTES discussing what they should do next. By the end of the episode, only two or three minutes passed on the timer. Grandpa without his walking stick can move faster.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that while some psychological aspects are interesting, many more are just too basic, or something that can easily figured out by a middle schooler (which they proceed to explain for the next 60-120 seconds). Some are even nonsensical. Kaiji proclaims by just looking at a guy that he can tell he's a \"balanced\" type of thinker. Hey Kaiji, how about putting those prophetic powers to use and instead not sign a shady loan agreement? Even more so: When the first game is practically over, Kaiji assaults three other players, stealing all of their cash/valuables. He does so for some reasons, but why do the guards allow this when they wouldn't let him do so earlier? Earlier he assaulted another player and was promptly stopped.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Kaiji being a dunce a lot of the time and other times outwitting the opposition when the plot calls for it, there are no noteworthy characters. They are pretty much all shallowly greedy characters, with no real history or motivation or anything noteworthy about their design. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style will be a huge turn off for some, even if it didn't bother me much. Characters have weirdly shaped heads, eyes, and everyone has a big nose. There is nothing memorable about the music or voice acting or sound effects either. Nothing memorable in either department.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't finish the series because by midway through the second game, I was sick of the crappy pacing where they take an entire episode just to explain some rules, have some nonsensical dialogue, and then end the episode with whatever conclusion they came to, or to set up the drama for the proceeding episode. No character is remotely interesting, with grown men crying every episode. The art style didn't bother me personally so much but it will definitely be a turn off for some. Only a few neat gambling/psychological elements resonate strongly, but it isn't enough to override the overall stench of this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Some good psychological aspects\\n\r\n+Decent premise\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Awful pacing\\n\r\n-While some psychological aspects are good, many more are too basic/elementary\\n\r\n-Shallow characters\\n\r\n-Art style may be a turn off",

This kind of story is one of the unique ones and now it was made in animeI\u2019m pretty impressed. Although the anime ends in big cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was designed pretty well ship and casinos looked like real casinos and not the fake ones. Places looked nice too and animation was perfect and there wasn\u2019t too bright colors used in anime which was good. And anime detailed very well the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: In anime there is sometimes when Kaiji is thinking something and this sound is heard ZAWAZAWA It was weird like it begin without any warning :)\\n\r\nI haven't listened Soundtrack but OP was really good and song was really good. Insert music like when Kaiji challenged some fellows in battles were amazing. One thing I dislike this anime is ED it's Kaiji walking in wavering around and there is some man singing a song which sound like drunken one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Let's talk about the main character first so Kaiji is fearless and coward same time and he cries a lot in anime. But sometimes he's really cool especially in Battles when he finds way of beating opponents. Then there is Endou which is acting that he is Kaiji's friend but everything won't go so well. If you want to know more Characters you have to watch this anime :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all I enjoyed this one too and end episodes were so good that I was happy that second season was announced. Now I want to say that this anime is really good and I definitely recommend this anime all the casino and card gaming fans and maybe all of those who want to see something different than same shounen anime all over again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kaiji is nostalgic anime that won't leave you down and every aspect of anime is really unique and not boring at all. WARNING! You will be addicted if you watch many episodes in row. :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review and wait for next one it's coming soon so now I leave you this ZAWA ZAWA :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaiji is about the titular character, a NEET who spends his days vandalising foreign-imported cars, and generally feeling down with himself for not being a very successful person in life. He is confronted by a member of the Yakuza (Japanese mafia), who tells him that as he helped cosigned a loan for a former work colleague who's since gone missing, he is now several thousands in debt. The mobster sends Kaiji on a cruise ship wherein he, and many other people in similar situations, must now gamble with millions of yen, and either break free from the debts and finally be able to live anew life, or face slave labour under the hands of the Yakuza. The subtitle of 'Ultimate Survivor' is a very appropriate one, because, as it turns out Kaiji is brilliant at surviving, always finding ways to out-scheme the various Yakuza men, all trying to stop him from winning, and Kaiji has some Sherlock Holmes level methods of deduction, detection, and overall wit. Still, one thing I can very much commend the show for, is that he isn't always a winner - they aren't afraid to show Kaiji get beaten down, and beaten hard, which is very refreshing, especially in comparison to the standard \"he has to always win in the end because he's our main character\". \\n\r\nThroughout the series, Kaiji finds himself entangled in several Yakuza schemes, such as the aforementioned cruise ship, trying to get out of a labour camp, and in the grand finale, winning $500 million from a pachinko machine that seems to have more defences than the Siegfried Line.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of Kaiji is very unique, and in a multitude of ways. The one that sticks out to most people I would say would be the art style, which is certainly unconventional. Some would call it ugly, but I myself would describe it as more just a bit different to what is standard - the rough edges do serve the series very well, and I think this is best emphasised by the physical appearances of the main antagonists, who all look very menacing, and almost demonic. The soundtrack of Kaiji is simply phenomenal, and I get the impression that whoever was responsible for it had worked on video game OSTs in the past - the tension in Kaiji is unlike anything I've ever seen before, and I think that the masterful, and highly varied, pieces that play throughout are largely the cause of this.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is our main character, and he's certainly a very compelling one - seeing him get completely broken by the monstrous situations he's confronted with, and he is a man that is not well suited to it. Very emotional and prone to outbursts, and he seemed to end up crying in sadness almost once per episode. Still, his adversaries in the Yakuza should not take a sideline, and they seem to cover just about every main base you could expect for someone in there: a condescending man who likes to give long monologues, a man who just enjoys seeing people suffer, one who pretends to be friendly but is actually a massive Jew, and one with a God complex of sorts. I can't really do them justice with short descriptions like these, and any more would just spoil the excitement of the show.\\n\r\nAll in all, Kaiji is an excellent show, with some of the best tension I think I've ever seen, and is absolutely solid. Some of the forced faux philosophical monologues aren't great, and admittedly the finale is far from grand, I really did not enjoy it as the previous ones, but these are minor setbacks on a great show. Spoilers in the paragraph following this one, so you've been warned.\\n\\n\r\nI don't usually like to get into the \"messages\" behind shows, but I think I shall do so here. In the first episode, we see a poster that reads \"The future is in our hands\" on Kaiji's wall, and this is also the first line in the first season's OP. Just a minor message, it doesn't really mean much, and that's what I thought, up until the finale, wherein the OP started playing when Kaiji won the $500 million. As individuals, we may not be able to change the world, nor make things perfect, but for our own personal lives, we have great impact, based upon our decisions, and that's shown very clearly here. Kaiji wins the $500 million, most of which he sends to his friends in the camp, who helped him get there. It would have been all too easy for him to forget about them, and go live the good life, but he chooses not to, because he's a morally righteous man (and for the best, I wasn't especially interested in seeing his morals get corrupted by money, save that for shows wherein the protagonists are in the Yakuza themselves), and a large amount of it because he signed a contract for Endou with an extortionate interest rate, when he should've just read it first. He has just a couple thousand by the end of it, and shamefully admits he spent it all on pachinko, and this is just a testament to Kaiji's character. He never learns, he may get out of the hole he digs himself, but he falls back into another one. The future is in his hands, but is it safe in his hands? Not very. He was a NEET with no future by episode 1, and even though he won 500 million fucking dollars, by the episode 26, he had barely changed, the only difference is he probably got a mountain of mental health issues given what he had to go through.",

Like come on, you get used every time the other guy has a chance...\r\nI will try to make this review spoiler free, but if you come looking for a short answer, GIVE THIS ANIME A SHOT.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI love anime's that go deep and really make you think. Come on since when did a game of rock paper scissor or a game of running in a straight line decide if you live or die? Every episode I watched of this anime Iwas thinking along side Kaiji, but 90% of the time everything turned out the opposite what I anticipated. The anime really pulls you in the shoes of the main character and makes you cheer Kaiji on, even if he keeps making the same mistakes. Sure, season 2 isn't as good as this gem but if you're done with this masterpiece you should at least experience the underground arc, which is my favourite.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nYes I know, I know, everyone looks like f***** Pinocchio in this anime, but damn does it get serious and beautiful when everything is on the line, the motion of the characters when they place their bets or thinking their plan over really adds something to this all ready great story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI'm the type of guy that listens only to music in the background, mostly ignoring half of it. So when someone asks me about what I think about say, Kimi no na wa's soundtrack I'm like: \" bro I don't even remember music in that anime\" But the voice acting & everything else sounded fine and nothing was really lacking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime really only focuses on 3 people, other lesser characters just die off and when they do, you don't really care. Kaiji really has great character traits and is the perfect guy for the main role, the voice actor really had passion for the roll, or at least I think so. Tonegawa and the chairman are very interesting characters and when you find out what for manipulators they are, they really make the perfect villain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMy second if not most favourite anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nJust come on, stop reading go watch this great anime. Sure, this is not for everyone, but for the people who love deep, serious anime this is the one for you.\\n",

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming)\r\nStory: 8/10. From start to finish, I was hooked on finding out whether Kaiji would be able to survive the tribulations before him or if he would crumble and fall. Each situation Kaiji is faced in is exciting from start to finish, and you never know what plan Kaiji will concoct or how high the stakes will be raised. In some situations, we get interesting strategies proposed by Kaiji and are eager to find out if they'll work; in others, the stakes are death, and we don't know who will live, who will die and how the show will change from here. \r\nArt: 8/10.Despite being a relatively old series, Kaiji has a great, unique type of artwork. I've never seen an anime quite as stylized as Kaiji; it really brought a new type of atmosphere and personality to the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10. Wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack. There were one or two soundtracks that I liked, but overall nothing memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. For the most part, the characters the show puts focus on have dynamic personalities and a strong sense of purpose. Kaiji's determination is admirable and always pushes him along through the story; we feel his pain and his desire to win and change his life, and this really engages us when it comes time for him to put something valuable on the line in a match. The villains of the show also aren't one-dimensional or there just to be obstacles, and they never feel underwhelming in the slightest; we see how determined they are as well, and the plans they concoct are sometimes enough to break Kaiji and turn the tides of the match. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout each match, Kaiji grows as well, and we see more of how his ambition is rooted in a noble nature. It was quite interesting to see how, despite being in the most tempting of situations, Kaiji would never put anyone down for his own gain. In some shows, this comes off as naive and childish, but here it really adds a new dimension to his character and to how he progresses through the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. For the whole show, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for whether Kaiji would win or lose. Granted, I expected during the Espoir arc that Kaiji would end up winning in the end due to some plot armor reasons or the like, but I was pleasantly surprised when he ended up losing (all part of the plan of course); however, he also ended up getting betrayed and had to work from there, which kept the stakes interesting even AFTER the gambling had concluded. This really showed us this anime doesn't try to protect its main character, and the final climactic arc of the show drills this into us with an even stronger series of events. Every challenge is interesting and engages you to the fullest, and although there are times you'll know Kaiji will probably make it out of the situation alive, you never know how much he has to give up to get to that point -- and this is what makes Kaiji a great show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I was stuck between giving this show either an 8 or a 9, and in the end my enjoyment for the show and its unique nature as a great gambling anime make it worthy of the 9/10. Kaiji is an enthralling anime that will engage you from start to finish. It does a clever job in giving us gambling scenarios that require skill and strategy while also depending on psychological factors, such that we can't predict who'll win.  Each match feels realistic and organic, as we never feel a win is due to plot convenience or that a strategy isn't grounded in some logic.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also does a good job of really expanding on Kaiji's character and gradually having him fall down the rabbit hole (as we would expect a gambling addiction to do), except it also subverts our expectations by having this addiction rooted in noble causes; this really gives an overarching theme and purpose to the show while giving strong motives for Kaiji towards the latter half, as we really believe he wants to get revenge and will do whatever it takes to win. The themes touched in this show aren't anything super profound, but for a gambling anime they are pretty interesting and help you relate to the scenarios of the characters, and I appreciate that added depth.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'll mention is that if you don't like a show that maintains the same tone throughout, Kaiji might not be the show for you: from the start, Kaiji goes into full throttle serious gear and never stops. I was actually surprised at how little comedy or relief the show had, if any; everything is always at 100% throttle, and once one challenge finishes we get a brief break before the next one comes. There isn't much diversity to be had in the atmosphere of the show, and although Kaiji does a brilliant job in handling its gambling scenarios, it would've been nice to see some more emotion other than desperation and ambition. For me this wasn't a problem, and actually made me all the more engaged, but some people might consider this a flaw since Kaiji only operates on the level of its narrative and pushing forth the characters along that narrative instead of building up the characters by themselves.\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Kaiji' is a punk anime. Like punk, it has a particular preoccupation with style - but the choice for such a style is a content. The aesthetically boldness of the drawings and the pretty fun guitar-oriented soundtrack complement the overall spirit of the show.\r\nThe episode-to-episode narrative is a tense fight to survival against very bad odds of, ultimately, unfair games. Kaiji, the main character, is forced to these games as his only choice to clear a huge debt -- which the games actually make worse. This debt, as the series progresses, start to literally eat away at Kaiji's flesh. \r\nMoney is the source of infinitepower, and a power that is intrinsically corrupt: it produce systems that feed on the pain, death, and despair of those who fight to survive inside it. This structural situation is inherently destructive to Kaiji's humanism, which only affirms the paradox of how the only way to be set free and live said humanism is by getting a lot of money. This revelation leads to Kaiji's revolt about how the only way to survive in a corrupt system is to corrupt the system from within.\\n\\n\r\nLooser notes of things I like about it:\\n\\n\r\n- The first game is the best. It has a stronger playfulness, and its fun to, like the characters, think of ways to survive and crack it - and the constant twists keep it from getting stale. As is necessary from the theme, the games (and series) get bleaker from there, and the stakes higher.\\n\\n\r\n- When the metaphors are illustrated literally. Particularly everytime Death shows up.\\n\\n\r\n- The 'zoro zoro zoro' ambient chant in moments of intense tension. Brings me so much joy.\\n\\n\r\n- Everytime Kaiji's theme starts playing, the guitar bringing on hope. Also, the theme itself.\\n\\n\r\n- So. Much. Tears. They don't even know why they are crying - the characters just keep getting overwelmed by the situation",

            "content": "Kaiji is unique and interesting, but ultimately falls short of being a classic due to pacing, characters and shock value.  \r\nI watched Kaiji as a result of Super Eyepatch Wolf's YouTube video praising the show. It seemed like a refreshingly different anime.  It didn't contain over-the-top action or a dramatic love story, instead it focused on the psychological aspects of survival.  This is what caused me to give it a shot.  \r\nKaiji starts off simple enough; a low-life gambler with little going for him gets a chance to earn a life changing sum of money.  Albeit, the situation is farfrom ideal and he's found himself at the center of it for all of the wrong reasons. From then on, the show follows a pattern of introducing a variety of games that contain major consequences. \\n\\n\r\nPrior to exploring the flaws, let's highlight the qualities of the show.  The art style is very unique and although it may inevitably turn some of you off,  I felt it added greatly to the feel and world of the show.  Big noses, sharp expressions and the ugly faces of filthy gamblers/corrupt businessman captured and embodied the essence of the world in which the story was taking place. Not to mention, it was produced by Madhouse - who did a masterful job animating some of the most suspenseful scenes.  Additionally, the scenes truly come to life due to the soundtrack. It's from another dimension. You can hear glimpses of Death Note (thanks to the same composer, Hideki Taniuchi) within the world of Kaiji.  It's unique, it's memorable and it supports the tone of each scene within the story.  Check out the track \"Kaiji\" for a sample of its magnificence. \\n\\n\r\nThose qualities kept me entertained for the first arc but after that the show hits a sluggish pace.  In almost every episode, we have to stop for an announcer-like narrator to break down what just happened and what it means for Kaiji's chances of survival. It was entertaining at first, but quickly lost its appeal.  However, that was nothing compared to the annoyance of the bridge arc. The bridge arc seems to go on for far too long.  It ruins the flow of the story by introducing many new characters who are pointless and feel shallow. We don't know who they are or what they've done, but do we really care?  We're supposed to get invested into them, because they're being put in extremely shocking scenarios but...  I feel the opposite happened. The idea of a new game with a deadly trap reminded me of the Saw movies, where it progressively became more about the traps rather than the people in the traps.  I began rooting for the bad guys, because I wanted the show to move on and regain its footing.\\n\\n\r\nEven Kaiji himself became a caricature of who he was.  The constant crying, screaming and panicking grew tiresome because it was basically featured in every episode.  It wasn't until over halfway through the show that we got its most interesting character, Hyodo.  He's a man with a philosophy and true motivation for how he believes the world works.  As evil and diabolical as he is, he served as a great counterbalance to Kaiji's constant self doubt and questioning of our society.\\n\\n\r\n26 episodes for two great characters may seem like a decent trade off, but in reality, it isn't.  Contrary to Death Note, we don't see two major forces struggling against each other throughout the show - it's more like one force against all odds.  If the show was 10 episodes shorter and featured less annoying-announcer-guy amongst other fixes, then it might have a chance to be a top tier anime.  As it stands, it's worth watching but it didn't leave me wanting more of Kaiji.  Instead, it left me wanting more of Hyodo. \\n\\n\\n",

I loved final struggle of Kaiji for each game he participates in. Usually that would be the last3-5 minutes of the last scene.

            "content": "(THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS) - No spoiler until the Story Section\r\nThis gambling anime is one of the most beloved anime for many critics on this site, because of its unique concept and engaging story. The focus of the anime was the Psychological part of the game and provide a Thrilling experience for the viewers. The Games on the other hand engages a wider audience with its simple rules, but the simplicity is also exactly why it turned out to be the most disappointing anime I have watched. But before I talk about the games in this anime, I will talk about...\r\nCharacters: Itou Kaiji, the MC.A typical loser. He does nothing productive as he drinks all day, and he hates his own life. Until one day he has to pay a huge debt. But instead he chose to join an underground gambling tournament for a chance to win big and bring life into his emptiness. Unlike other GAME anime MCs who are overpowered, Itou Kaiji is rather balanced. He at times cracks under pressure and at time embrace it. So watching him play is very entertaining because it is hard to know what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nThe other \"gamers\" showcases how their motives change depending on the situation, and they contributes well to the psychological parts of the game. They were keys at changing Kaiji as a person, as he learns more from them throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe villain Hyoudou, is a sadist who spouts nonsensical philosophy. When talking about philosophy, in my opinion it should be somewhat realistic, which is not the case here. Also he was supposed to be portrayed as a mastermind, but instead he is portrayed as a one trick pony. So he is a miss.\\n\\n\r\nPolice? They never showed up in this anime... But I guess an anime shouldn't be taken too seriously.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, all the games had very simple rules. But arc 1 was well done because there were still strategies in the game itself. In the 2nd half it went downhill, and it is hard to talk about why I was not impressed without dissecting one of the games played.\\n\\n\r\nSo here comes the spoiler: One of the games played in the anime was Slave vs. King. It is a two player game where there are 10 cards in total. Player A and B take turns to change their role of Slave and King. If the player is a Slave, the player gets four citizen cards and a Slave. If the player is a King, the player gets four citizen cards and a King. \\n\\n\r\nKing > Citizen > Slave > King. Both players place one card face down until they agree to reveal it. If Citizen and Citizen, it is a draw and the game continues. If King and Citizen, the King wins and game ends. If Slave and King, the Slave wins and game ends. \\n\\n\r\nIt makes no differences between a blind man and a normal person playing this game. Either way 80% win for King and 20% win for Slave. So if anyone ever analyzes how they were able to beat someone in this game, it is crap. There is no strategy in this game, and any explanation for how they won this game could work. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists were well placed, and it was a breath taking experience for me, except the last four episodes. The game played in the last four episodes was too simple and everything Kaiji said were obvious and unimpressive. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art style fit well with the theme because the overall tone is dark and depressing. I am not an expert on art style but hey, it is produced by Madhouse. The voice acting was well done, especially the narrator, he hypes up every moment in the anime! The tone for OP was upbeat and the ED was depressing, I did not like it but that is just my music taste.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nItou Kaiji was entertaining and the most frustrating character to watch, everyone is flawed but his mistakes were too silly, and I dislike people who make dumb decisions (Myself included). First half still had a lot of surprising and memorable moments and then second half happened. Much of the disappointment were my own fault, because I had way too high of expectations. But as much as I disliked the show, it is still about gambling and I was a Facebook poker addict so I enjoyed most of it. \\n\\n\r\nGrading:\\n\r\nStory 5/10, Art 8/10, Sound 7/10, Character 7/10, Enjoyment 6/10, Overall 6/10 \\n\r\nI disliked it but I recommend this anime to anyone who has not seen it yet.",

            "content": "I will preface my review by stating that I really did not enjoy this anime. The premise was interesting, it is even similar to one of my favorite korean dramas, (liar game or lying game I forget, it's been a while). So it is fair to say that going in I had high hopes, which were only dashed as the series wore on. So I did rate the story fairly high, giving it a 7.5/10. \r\nThe art style seemed to be a throwback to some older animation style. It was not bad, but was not spectacular either. Many characters looked the same, given the samemajor characteristics such as stature, facial shape, hair style and nose. In any case I have seen worse so I rated it a 5/10 thinking it to be average. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were probably what bugged me the most. The protagonist was someone I really wanted to like. Much like any great hero he is irreparably flawed. In Kaiji's case he is an emotionally stunted, immature fool. That is made up in part by the fact that the author attempted to make him out to be intelligent, or have the capacity to be. Unfortunately he is also very weak willed, and incapable of making a decision. I spent the entire series hoping he would grow a pair and stand up for himself. The antagonists were, in Kaiji's mind, anyone wealthy. Though more specifically an organization dedicated to profiting off of gamboling on and through their debtors. While they were portrayed as being emotionally uninvolved, and even taking delight in cruelty, they always presented a logical argument. (That is not to say that the argument was always correct, but it was almost always a common argument used by many people everyday). Whenever Kaiji was faced with one such argument his default action was to deny its validity, cry about it, and attempt to delude himself into rising above such a petty thing as logic and conquer it with what little 'strength' of will he possessed. So while the antagonists were portrayed as evil to a certain extent, at least they were rational. Then of course there is all of the other debtors, and participants in the games. All they do is cry, moan, wail, scream and fall into a self-piteous stupor, including those who set out to take advantage of everyone to succeed themselves. I can appreciate the blatant metaphor here, but it was not well done, and very much thrust down the viewers' throats at every possible opportunity. So for these reasons I rated the characters as 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAdding everything together and the rating does not equal the sum of its parts. Episodes dragged on, I found myself skipping ahead a few minutes at a time towards the end with no real change, as the only thing I was missing was whining, crying, moaning, cursing, and various other meaningless things taking up the entirety of each episode. It became a chore to even finish the series. That said, my enjoyment of the show was a 2/10, and I rated the show overall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWorst perhaps of all, I forgot I had ever even watched this show it was that bad. The writer barely half-assed the logic behind the games and attempted the pass it off as the pinnacle of reasoned thought. Add that to all of the vacillating and crying and groaning and moaning, and all of the \"woe is me, my life is terrible\" crap, and you get Kaiji. It is a horrible show not worth watching ever.",

Nor does he pick up a gun and take down the ring. This is a gambling anime. And it is one of the most engaging, masterfully executed thrillers out there. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Premise 10/10 : \\n\\n\r\nKaiji as a thriller succeeds by constantly raising its stakes. Kaiji failing means that he falls further into debt or loses everything he's gained. The more debt he gains the more consequences to them, It keeps you on edge with elements such as time limits, new strategies, and Kaiji getting stumped and being forced into a corner. Which makes Kaiji even more enthralling. Kaiji doesn't always win which makes you really feel the pressure of his choices and the stress he's feeling. And that's what makes the stakes so high... Kaiji doesn't always win.  Kaiji is constantly backed into corners and forced to find other ways continue surviving. None of the games are repeated. Each game played by Kaiji is different and every game puts Kaiji at risk of losing something. Whether it be his freedom or punishment through a horrible bodily injury. The show is very tense and brutal forcing Kaiji to do everything in his power to think of ways to survive. We get to see his though process and dissection as he's desperately trying to work the system into his favor. Kaiji is very resilient and his diligence for survival is intense and motivational. One minor thing is Kaiji often has situations brought upon him or him getting out of certain situations in some way. Although it never feels like asspulls or like they came out of nowhere. The losses are always high and it never stresses your suspension of disbelief. Its pacing is also very solid and moves as quickly as it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji also tackles very dark themes. Such as Morality vs. Nature and Overcoming any obstacle that's presented by giving it your all. Nothing pretentious, its very well executed. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Presentation 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nThe show looks like an animated manga and that's sweet. \\n\r\nThe animation is very good technically, smooth, and clean. The over the top visuals, actions, and animation add to the flair of the show and will grab your attention easily. This makes it much more interesting than just watching two people sitting down playing a card game. \\n\r\nKaijis art is very distinct and has a certain flavor. Before Kaiji makes his move you are often given every emotion and thought he's dealing with prior. You will be so invested you won't mind the visuals even if you dislike them at first. Kaiji will causally animate visual metaphors of Kaiji overcoming an obstacle and these are interesting and add flair to grip you but simply put the presentation is fine. It's camera angles are sometimes just not flattering and the animated characters on (very well rendered) CG backgrounds is very obvious and makes the characters look very flat and unrealistic from angles like Birds eye...\\n\\n\r\nKaijis art style is very unique and you can complain about it all you want but its a very distinct western feeling style. Another positivity about the art style is how emotional the faces can look and how it paints a perfect definition of the feeling in the expression alone. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nKaiji has a kick ass theme and music that screams and makes you feel the tone and tension. It has tracks that make you feel on edge and tracks that make you feel triumphant and relieved. AN overall very good soundtrack. Not every track is flawless but every character and moment sounds great. From the sleazy to sounding sleazy and Kaiji having very realistic execution in basically every line in the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is an excellent character analysis. It puts the characters in extremely stressful, high pressure situations and shows every aspect of how they escape the hell set in them. Demonstartating to us how great a human's passion to survive is. Humans will react differently to the life and death situations but our lead is a survivor who won't buckle under the weight. It is also a character analysis because it  provides a look into how desperate the lower class is as well as how corrupt and sociopathic the 1% are. \\n\\n\r\nThe show never loses focus on Kaiji. He shows that even though he doesn't have motivation to work and is irresponsible with gambling he really has human compassion and is a will for surviving. Kaiji begins as being a very naive but bitter person but after being manipulated, he realizes his mistake and becomes a strong motivation who rallies his allies or crushes those enemies without a hint of mercy. Kaiji is the parallel to the human nature that comes out when others are trying to survive and Kaiji becomes a morally correct character that is willing to swallow his feelings and act rationally so he can continue to calmly survive. When humans are caged like animals they act like cruel and heartless animals. This is one of the main themes of the anime. Although Kaiji maintains his passion for surviving as well as his heart. Even in life and death situations, Kaiji never loses his humanity. \\n\r\nKaiji is shown to have this sympathy from the start when he tried to help bail his friend out of a lone. So from the starting line we see Kaiji has heart. Kaiji is an amazing character. He has a very black/white moral code and always tries to give people the benefit of the doubt. He believes everyone deserves mercy so he will trust even the shadiest looking people, because in reality that's what he wants. Kaiji wants a break. He will never stop fighting until he reaches the top of the pit that he dug for himself. Even people who cost him an ear he still will have sympathy for when seeing them endure harsh torture. As he notices they're just trying to survive and make it like him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Kaiji has flaws such as his irresponsibility, nativity, underestimation and overconfidence. \\n\r\nKaiji NEVER puts on the Shounen villain cockiness but his trust in his own flawed strategies is fully capable of biting him in the ass. When hes overwhelmed he cries very realistically. Having a full on emotional breakdown and sometimes cussing and screaming like a baby. When this happens you feel the emotional breakdown and urgency Kaiji is going through. You're seeing the weak side of this usually strong, determined character, as his own luck or a counter strategy has broken him. Its the flaws and the actions that help us all relate to Kaiji and make him such a deep and likable character. We see his entire thought process and plan as he tries to save himself from a horrible situation as well as his group at he time. Even with his flaws Kaiji is one of the most likable characters ever written and I wouldn't have any other lead. \\n\\n\r\nThe other cast members unfortunately don't develop enough or at all but are very good at furthering the growth of Kaiji who is a 10/10 character on his own. They have clear establishment but are confined to supporting roles. Although the supporting cast members are characters I still came to care about likely through Kaijis compassion and desire to help and motivate them to survive as well. The villains introduced later on are interesting and clever. They represent the hardships and struggles all humans must endure to survive and have very interesting philosophy. The main villain isn't some morally gray guy you can sympathize with but he is a gambling genius though and despite his philosophy is more of a character Kaiji must endure and overcome. Kaiji is what he doesn't want to see. He likes to see the true darkness of humanity with his gambling ring, but Kaiji is a force that totally opposes his expectations. \\n\\n\r\nIt hardly matters as Kaiji is beyond capable of holding the entire show on his back. So him being more of a solo act is perfectly fine. \\n\\n\r\nMisc Problems:\\n\\n\r\nThere was one Misc. problem and its that there is a narrator. While the over the top narrator adds enjoyment to the presentation. I can very well tell how Kaiji feels and how I'm supposed to feel at certain scenes. Silence is preferred. As some scenes invoke very intense emotions and the narrator comes in and disrupts your experience and thoughts. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is one of the best anime I've seen. It has an amazing lead, amazing story, great sound, alright presentation, is very intense, has great pacing, its fresh, its over the top, its unique and is overall an incredible thriller. If the art bothers you so much that you won't watch it you're missing out on something genius. Its theme is also just as badass as Kaiji himself. Get ready to shed some manly tears bro.\\n\\n\r\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor gets a 10/10. An A+ anime.\\n\r\nIts not perfect by any means but is an outstanding work that no fan of thrillers can miss.",

            "content": "Desperation has the capability of bringing out the worst of people. It can strip away all the remaining hope an individual once believed they had. It can turn humble beings into selfish, furious beasts that throw away all the humanity they have for a mere scrap of food. The possibility of maintaining a normal relationship with another of your kind is but an afterthought. Whether it\u2019s because of deception of others for the benefit of oneself or due to the clinging of another\u2019s good will, lack of companionship is but another addition to the multitude of hopelessness they share. People who have been putting offwalking on the path of hope will come in acquaintanceship with the dreaded being of despair as they\u2019re cast off from society into an unknown world that once was.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor, desperation among the population is what could be considered normality. Bottom feeders of society are put into corners by the regrets they so hold. Bigwigs constantly gain more and more wealth. Human morals are tossed aside. Awareness towards those in poverty is never considered, instead, discrimination occurs. Such is how the world is depicted in Madhouse\u2019s 2007 adaption of the Nobuyuki Fukumoto manga series\u2019 first installment. A truly exaggerated, yet uncomfortable world of egoistic bodies casting their shadows throughout the envious. Yet, it does all this while managing to reminiscently captivate a fragment of our world beneath all its ludicrous events, echoes of zawazawa, GAR, and moe noses. This creates an over-the-top narrative that isn\u2019t afraid to convey a sense of realism despite acknowledging where it\u2019s standing on.\\n\\n\r\nAs Ultimate Survivor (which will be what I will refer to the Kaiji anime as for the sake of clarification, bear with me) expositions itself, we\u2019re given an immediate look into the life crisis of the main character, Kaiji Itou. He\u2019s on the run from debt collectors, occasionally steals the minor possessions of others to boost his self-esteem, and probably cries himself to sleep whenever his delusion of living a good life is broken. Such is the daily routine in Kaiji\u2019s life. That is until what seems to be a dreaded debt collector confronts an anxious Kaiji. The shady figure, known as Endou, details to Kaiji that one of his former acquaintances has burdened Kaiji with an absurdly large debt, much to Kaiji\u2019s surprise. There is hope, however. Or so it seems. The primary reason as to why Endou bothered to interact with Kaiji was to propose him to a sweet deal that\u2019ll surely help him get rid of all his piled up debt: gambling. And not just any type of gambling. Kaiji has to battle it out with around 100 other people just like him in a ship known as the Espoir. Otherwise, Kaiji\u2019s thrown back into a hell worse than he could\u2019ve ever imagined.\\n\\n\r\nThe sole aspect Ultimate Survivor needs to exceptionally succeed at what its narrative strives to be is a good main character. It is essential to have a great protagonist in a series that heavily revolves around their survival in the midst of despair. For the whole duration of the show, the viewer\u2019s going to have to watch this man in his early-twenties confront horrors and engage in tense duels between others. If I\u2019m apathetic towards this long-nosed guy in need of a haircut, then watching him dilly dally around for 9 hours would be of no merit. Fortunately, that is not the case in Ultimate Survivor. If anything, the construction of Kaiji\u2019s character is where Ultimate Survivor excels at the most in its narrative. And, honestly, that\u2019s the only thing needed in its storytelling to make it engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe portrayal of Kaiji\u2019s character is the most crucial factor as to why Kaiji\u2019s characterization is one of worth. Ultimate Survivor doesn\u2019t aim to make Kaiji out to be an arrogant ace who snarks back at the opponents he has beaten with the help of plot coincidences. He isn't made out to be a pathetic wimp who's constantly beaten by the leash after having already received enough humiliation either. You won\u2019t find any of the traits of your average protagonist in Kaiji, he\u2019s none of that. The trait that defines Kaiji the most is simple: he\u2019s human. He makes his mistakes. He lets temptation creep in occasionally. He trusts others too much. He\u2019s naive. Yet, he learns from his faults to keep on growing. He accepts the fact that wishes can\u2019t be obtained easily. He is deceptive to others and himself when the time calls. And, most of all, Kaiji matures. Kaiji will be confronted with further sorrows from the obstacles he faces, and he\u2019ll cry. He\u2019ll cry, cry, and cry. But in the end of the day, Kaiji will come to terms with his circumstances and keep on moving forward. Even if the mindset that tells him to do so is naive. \\n\\n\r\nEven if he doesn\u2019t obtain what he desires, Ultimate Survivor isn't attempting to make Kaiji a sympathetic character by demanding the viewer to put themselves in Kaiji\u2019s shoes whenever he\u2019s in a dire situation. No, Kaiji\u2019s character works because the viewer's connection with him will further develop as Kaiji\u2019s resolve and realizations simultaneously grow. Combined with the surrounding dark atmosphere of the whole show, Kaiji\u2019s simply a character you\u2019d naturally want to root for. You just want Kaiji\u2019s gambling antics to succeed for him to clear his debts, live a normal life, and get the nonexistent girl. Each gain and loss Kaiji experiences only further constructs the desire to see Kaiji win. Yet, Kaiji\u2019s constant experiences of the contradictions between life and loss are much more than just a tool to reel in viewers into caring for this character. They\u2019re of more profound value. As Kaiji is the most prevalent character in the series, he\u2019s the one that carries all the show\u2019s themes on his back. All of Kaiji\u2019s dilemmas portray an outlook on the brutality of life and other people. The ones in which the whole series thematically stands on. Life is merciless and so are the people that have it, but if you move forward with all the gambles of hope regardless of the fact, you\u2019re sure to be at least one step ahead.\\n\\n\r\nThe situations in which Kaiji is put in are pure tensity. No further description of them would be needed, yet let me elaborate. The aspect of gambling is what Ultimate Survivor largely consists of. As Kaiji time is vastly different from ours, many of the normally short battles get turned into major arcs. Arguably, the show is divided into three. While the dragging out of battles definitely serves its purpose, both as build up for Kaiji\u2019s later battles as well as his own growth, it does have a chance of making one impatient. The first arc is where this flaw is most prevalent in, where the development of character and themes still had a rough start. Fortunately, Ultimate Survivor takes note of this and numbs the dragging of scenes down enough and ups significance occurrences to make this flaw hardly noticeable anymore.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, tensity is one of the traits that makes watching Ultimate Survivor so intriguing the further one gets into it. This is not even taking into account the psychological attacks Kaiji takes to his character in said situations. Gambling in Ultimate Survivor is no joke; lives are constantly at risk of being lost, something Kaiji had to quickly persuade himself to adapt to. Each of the opponents Kaiji confronts with challenge his growth, while also exposing some of his newfound weaknesses. In the conceiving of Kaiji\u2019s strategic logic that attempts to accommodate for such a fact, there\u2019s always lingering doubt. As such, predictability never becomes a problem that spoils the entertainment of watching Kaiji\u2019s tactics come into play. Even the slightest hint of predictability is used to Ultimate Survivor\u2019s benefit in how it presents its narrative, which, sadly, I cannot detail without entering spoiler territory. The elaborate balancing of rising risks and depletion of merits in the mind games Kaiji so participates in maintain the series for as much as they can. They\u2019re filled to the brim while constantly gaining possibilities of topping over. For the most part, it\u2019s beneficial towards Ultimate Survivor\u2019s goal in mind. The build-up in Kaiji\u2019s shenanigans is sure to make his later ones all the more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychology of the mind games and of the participants who gamble is a frequent aspect of Ultimate Survivor\u2019s narrative. It\u2019s a given, considering how serious Ultimate Survivor can get with its premise of the human condition and gambles of life. However, Ultimate Survivor doesn\u2019t delve itself further so much so into the psychoanalysis of opponents and their tactics. The complexity of strategies and convoluted plans to outwit one\u2019s opponent is not where Ultimate Survivor strengths itself in. The mindset of opponents is taken in a rather simple approach, actually. The prevalent narrator, whether you find him irritating or charming, will be the one who occasionally proclaims to the audience what exactly is happening in the midst of the sweating and close-ups of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, the mind games of Ultimate Survivor specialize themselves by each individually portraying a different side of the human nature under heavy pressure. For instance, the first game in which Kaiji is a participant of is a rendition of Rock-Paper-Scissors with vastly different rules. Many of the other participants show greed in their newly found chance of escaping debt, and gaining possible ecstasy. This, of course, eventually leads to selfish actions being performed. Betrayal, arrogance, and blinding of oneself are but some of the aspects explored in just the first arc. Likewise, these are just a few of the stepping stones to which Kaiji himself takes up in his descent to the depths of gambling. As the conditions get harsher on the road ahead, an experienced Kaiji\u2019s morale will be confronted with many questions. With the utilization of Kaiji\u2019s character, Ultimate Survivor\u2019s intense narrative on humanity through its conveyance of simple card games never becomes dry or shallow.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time to settle down the GAR praise for Kaiji\u2026 It should be acknowledged that side characters do indeed exist in Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. And, quite frankly, they\u2019re not much. At least in comparison to the amount of depth Kaiji himself carries. The characters in Ultimate Survivor aren\u2019t written to be conventional characters. They\u2019re written to be plot devices. Now, questionability of whether plot devices are indicative of the quality of writing is debatable. However, in the end of the day, all narratives have them in one way or another. And how exactly such devices are used to execute what the narrative desires are ultimately what determines substantial work. Ultimate Survivor is but a minor example of a work that utilizes its side characters as plot devices properly. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters in Kaiji usually consist of a few correlating traits. Some of them are malicious, deceptive excuses for human beings. The opponents Kaiji faces usually contain some of the aforementioned traits. The usages of these minor antagonists are simple. They\u2019re made to be against what specific mindset Kaiji has on at the moment, and to an extent, his ideals. Others are modest, fearful people that succumb to their distress. Such characters are the ones Kaiji becomes, unconsciously at times, sympathetic towards. Further characterization of both types of characters' actions are needed, and it times it even proves to be undesirable towards the ambition of Ultimate Survivor\u2019s narrative. It would be a waste of time doing so. Everyone in it are simply humans who want to survive towards any means possible. Like Kaiji at times, opponents are humanized. Albeit not as gravely as him, the attribute still stands. In Kaiji\u2019s sole road to the depths of gambling, relationships are but an afterthought. He can\u2019t make any friends on this trip, even if he wants to. Instead, he simply has to take in what he observes in other people and live on for what they\u2019ve left behind. With clever usage, Ultimate Survivor\u2019s seemingly excuses for characters actually aids in keeping its narrative rich and profound.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019ve stated most of the side characters lack any ground to stand upon, I feel the need to give an honorable mention towards a particular character: Yukio Tonegawa. Tonegawa is what could be considered one of the most prevalent antagonists in the first season of Ultimate Survivor. His presentation as such is straightforward. He\u2019s the one you see overlooking participants or the one that\u2019ll be giving out oppressive monologs as if they\u2019re nothing. Eventually, however, his role as an antagonistic idealist is optimized towards the final arc. Hereafter is where Tonegawa\u2019s character is wonderfully utilized for both thematic purposes and significant development in Kaiji. Yet, unlike usual side characters, Tonegawa\u2019s bearing of motif usages is done greatly enough to actually make him stand out as his own thing, his own character. It makes for a little more spice being added in retrospect to Tonegawa\u2019s speeches, and in return, the narrative once again. He even gets his own mini manga spin-off. A pretty cool guy he is, that Tonegawa.\\n\\n\r\nTonegawa, however, is not the only antagonistic force present in Ultimate Survivor. An overlooking Big Bad that lurks in the shadows of the games Kaiji participates in is a fulfilled necessity in Ultimate Survivor\u2019s narrative. The Big Bad in question, contrary to what one would expect, isn\u2019t as well-composed of a character as Kaiji. No further characterization or justification to the tortuous actions The Big Bad executes is ever explored beyond what\u2019s presented. The guy\u2019s just evil. Pure, despicable, evil. Yes, the old fart does provide Kaiji with philosophical ramblings, yet any basis from his own character as to what he\u2019s blabbering on about is practically nonexistent. He\u2019s just a villain straight out of the tritest tropes\u2014and it works. The guy is practically a complete contrast to everything Kaiji holds dear. Whereas Kaiji had to suffer through various circumstances to get to the particular mindset he has now, The Big Bad simply blocks Kaiji in motion just for his own irrational entertainment gathered from an influence of arrogance he's had for far too long. Ultimate Survivor is in no need to give him a detailed backstory for his motivations, doing so would be incohesive to what to what it\u2019s trying to achieve. In Kaiji\u2019s journey, he\u2019s the most dreaded figure of them all, the one representant of all the evils of humanity incarnate. Seeing him perform unfair actions in a sadistic manner only strengths the fuel towards rooting for Kaiji\u2019s success. He\u2019s made to be a loathable character for the very reason of developing Kaiji\u2019s cause as a character even further. Characterization beyond that would ruin the integrity he holds to the narrative as the fat figure that eats on the sorrow of others with a plastered grin on his face. Ironically, the lack of any traits in the Big Bad beyond brutality makes Kaiji\u2019s opposition to him all the more compelling. \\n\\n\r\nFukumoto has very particular art style in his works that you\u2019ve probably come across once or a twice. Ultimate Survivor is no exception to this. Exaggerated noses, thick outlines, and arousing eyebrows are but few of the trademarks Fukumoto so holds. In Madhouse\u2019s adaptation, the ludicrous character designs are adjusted to appear slightly sharper while still retaining their original charm. Some people, say, lovers of moe, may be put off by the obscure character designs Ultimate Survivor has to offer. But upon closer inspection, one shall realize that Ultimate Survivor might just transcend the capabilities that moe anime brings. The designs shouldn\u2019t be treated as a distraction, quite the contrary actually. Fukumoto\u2019s distinctive art style manages to captivate the show\u2019s atmospheric motifs quite well. The rough faces of the characters on occasion work with the tensity of the series by displaying the ugly characteristics of humanity, so to speak. Frequently does Ultimate Survivor do close-ups of characters\u2019 faces that showcase them anxiously sweating or, in the case of Kaiji, crying. Toppled with the absurdly inhumane situations the series plays with, it makes the series feel all the more bizarrely real with its often explicit connections to our society.\\n\\n\r\nOther visual aspects of the series, unfortunately, aren\u2019t all that grand, at least in comparison to the rest of what Kaiji offers. Nonetheless, they serve their conventional usage as tools to aid in the creating of mood and atmosphere that Ultimate Survivor so needs. Take visual directing for instance. Whenever Ultimate Survivor desires to display emoticons such as perplexion or anguish, it does so by putting its characters behind a cut of mesmerizing colors, usually red or purple. Or say a more avant-garde way of expressing character struggles wants to be made. Ultimate Survivor will simply display a visual analogy to what they\u2019re facing, such as a character looking towards a road branching into two different paths. They\u2019re pretty lackluster in what they want to present, due to how they can explicitly be a drag at times. Thankfully, Ultimate Survivor isn\u2019t in an abundance of scenes like these. At times even, some interesting compositions are made in accordance to what\u2019s folding out on screen. The usage of a melancholic color palette throughout the series, consisting of browns and blacks, as well dark lighting are also welcome additions in Ultimate Survivor\u2019s visuals. While Madhouse seems to have put their most effort in the consistency of the character designs, they don\u2019t completely disregard the other visual attributes of Ultimate Survivor. This results in a complete visual package with a few loose ends here and there that can easily be dismissed by all the GAR happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe other technicality Ultimate Survivor should be noted for is its audio, which is much more consistent in quality compared to its visuals. Similar to Fukumoto\u2019s obscure art style, a particular sound effect prevalent in his works is also a staple part of Ultimate Survivor\u2019s charm. Often times, when Kaiji is in an uncomfortable situation, will the lingering whispers of \u201czawa zawa\u2026\u201d ( displayed as [\u3056\u308f] visually) be heard, which roughly translates to just that, an uncomfortable atmosphere. Accompanying them is the hype-inducing score that Ultimate Survivor so has. Pieces of Ultimate Survivor\u2019s soundtrack compliment tensity well, and at times even the distress Kaiji so faces. \\n\\n\r\nUltimate Survivor doesn\u2019t always rely on its soundtrack to create tension, though. In specific moments in which pure silence would be most desirable, the usage of music is omitted, leaving only the isolated voices of characters to be heard. And, boy, is it effective. The voice acting of Ultimate Survivor is by far some of the best in anime. It\u2019s consistent with its capability to convey strong emotions as well as tone. Masato Hagiwara plays a brilliant Kaiji, displaying some of the rawest sentimentalities that greatly contribute in making an already excellent character all the more enticing. In similar regards, the VAs for Tonegawa and The Big Bad play the chilling vibes of their respective roles well. One of the more a more calmed variety, and the other of a more haunting one. Some of Ultimate Survivor\u2019s more memorable moments all, coincidentally, share the trait of a silenced atmosphere waiting to be broken by the lines of characters. Ultimate Survivor\u2019s audio truly make up for what some of its visual aspects lack. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all the zawas, eccentric noses, and GAR gambling is finished, Ultimate Survivor is ultimately a very human narrative. A narrative that portrays a world of towering figures watching over those of lower status try their best in a meek attempt at surviving the cruelties of life. Many of the latter will fail, their falling serving as only fuel for the richs\u2019 ego and discouragement for others behind them. There is no trace of justice in Ultimate Survivor, only selfish desires to rule on top of the fallen. Yet, despite all this, a challenger appears\u2014Kaiji Itou. Overcoming all of those opposing him and his own flaws, Kaiji dares to find the last remaining pieces of hope beneath all his despair. And that\u2019s what makes Ultimate Survivor such a timeless story. It shares many striking resemblances to ourselves as it sheds its faint light. But beneath all that lies hope, hope that we can better ourselves and those around us in many ways. It\u2019s what makes Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor so great. Besides the aforementioned GAR, of course.",

            "content": "Okay, first review and all that stuff.\r\n*May contain minor spoilers*\r\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: The Ultimate Survivor is an anime that revolves around the concept of gambling, the greed and morality that surrounds it, and the despair that addiction to it causes. It isn't a guidebook on how to gamble play poker, mahjong, or stuff like that, so if you came expecting these things you should best leave this anime alone.\r\nStory: 10     The Ultimate Survivor focuses on three arcs. During each arc, Kaiji is forced to wager his life in exchange for the opportunity to close his debts instantly and make some moneyduring this time. All the arcs are filled to the brim with deceptions, betrayals, plots, schemes, and twists. Each arc is closed with no questions unanswered and it always leaves you with empathy for Kaiji. The transition from arc to arc is flawless, including the ending, which just made want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8     The character designs was one of the reasons why I hesitated on watching this anime at all. It's a bit different, but you get used to it. Towards the end of the series I began to appreciate the uniqueness of it, and I now consider it to be Fukumoto's trademark style. The animators were able to portray the emotions that the characters feel, though sometimes it feels a bit over the top. I found every aspect regarding art to be above average, but not necessarily a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7     The OP and ED songs were very suitable considering the central theme of the anime. The OP represented the gambler's high (the pleasure gamblers feel) and the ED represented the despair of gamblers who gave in to their addiction and lost control of their life (very cliche statement, but it's how I feel). Since I wanted my first review to be about The Ultimate Survivor, I tried to listen to the OST while watching, but aside from a few memorable moments, I just didn't feel its overall impact.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9     I don't think that Kaiji underwent a big character development throught the entire series, aside from him getting better at gambling and a couple of changes to his thinking patterns. Likewise, the other characters didn't have or had little character development. That doesn't mean that they're not awesome in their own right. Kaiji had the potential to be a great gamer from the start; he tends to learn from his own mistakes and push through his hesitations. Tonegawa seemed like your average tough guy, but since the time his character last appeared, I began to respect him a little\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10     I've always been fond of survival games such as Liar Game and Kamisama no Iuutori. I like how practical, ingenious and resourceful the characters on this type of genre are. The plot twists, the uncertainty, and even though you know what might happen, you're still gripped by the possibilty of it happening otherwise. The Ultimate Survivor had inspired in me all these.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10     I put more weight behind Enjoyment and Story, since I almost always ignore Art and Sound when watching anime. This show makes up for its downfalls and I absolutely enjoyed the ride.",

Kotaro Sakazaki boasts about his daughter being, \"Beautiful\". Just wait until you see her. That's 4 years later, and as far as I know Season 2 is far less superior, perhaps they learned the difference between suspence and tension and just jumping the shark.\r\nSo why thisseries was disappointing? I had the same dissapointment on a similar story, Soul Eater, except that Soul Eater sucked at near the Climax scenes, Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor started sucking so hard after the forbidden Janken arc.",

            "content": "I watched Kaiji a while ago, in fact, a few years ago but I never thought to make a review of it... cuz... I didn't have a MAL account back then. Kaiji was one of the few anime I watched when I wasn't that into anime. When I wasn't too into anime, I watched very few anime a year, I watched about two per year since 2010. In that time, from 2010-2014, the time I wasn't too into anime, I watched Kaiji, Akagi, Death Note, Monster, Angel Beats! and Danganronpa. Of course you see I am also rewatching Akagi, putting it on-hold. Reason for thatis, I have no idea what the fuck happened. Anyway, enough explaining my shitty past life where I didn't watch anime that much. ON WITH THE REVIEW!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around a man named Aka-I mean... Kaiji... Kaiji is a good-for-nothing... well... idiot, who spends all his days drinking beer and stealing hubcaps... until he's tricked by his friend... I guess... just going off of what MAL is saying, and trying to see if it's legit info. He is invited to a cruise ship and he attends just to clear his debt of like... 3 million yen. Which is around 24,000 USD. Still a lot of money for Americans. I'm not American, just stating that right there. But a lot of shit goes down and he has do stuff that stuff... stuff stuff stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation... I'm pretty sure this is what art means, considering the creators do draw every single frame, then submit it to a software and shit, and then animate it... so, yeah, the art is acceptable, as I have no flippin' idea when the hell this anime was released, but considering it's art, I'd say it's around 2006-2008. Am I wrong? Lemme check... Fuck... 2007-2008. Damn it! Nearly there! But, it's acceptable... actually, it's pretty damn good. Kaiji can kill someone with that chin of his... possibly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI never really listened to the soundtrack (yes, using the same excuse as I did in my Ansatsu Kyoushitsu review...) so... actually, I didn't install it and listen to it, cuz' I just didn't feel like it. I really liked the opening, though, and it was weird how it was only 50 seconds. Yes, I know, it's only about 30 seconds difference from normal anime openings, but, still...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is pretty damn awesome. Even the antagonist I came to like, because, to be honest, the show wouldn't of even had a point if that guy didn't exist. For those of you who've watched this anime, you know who I'm talking about. I love every character, especially Kaiji... that moment... you know... with him in the bathroom... the ear? Yeah? You know? Yeah... that... was a bit violent. But... WHY SHOULD I CARE?! I'm a crazy mother-flipper.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTruly fascinating series. I was right to watch this 5 years ago, then rewatch it recently about five months ago. It's a great series, and I still haven't seen the second season cause' I cannot find it anywhere. Where da fack is it?! I've been looking for that business for 829 years... cuz' I'm totally that old. Anyway, Kaiji is a great, underrated series. Kaiji is one of the best protagonists you will ever come across. Ever.",

            "content": "This anime deserves more attention and popularity, it's as simple as that. But so many people have overlooked this anime for one obvious factor, and that is the art style. I'll be the first one to admit it, I have dismissed Kaiji upon seeing the character designs, but once I actually sat down and gave it a chance, I was hooked. The art does take a bit of getting used to (and I think if Madhouse didn't do it then it would have been a disaster), but by the end I was actively enjoying the way the series looked. Kaiji is so simple because, atit's core, it's pretty much just the main character Kaiji playing games for 26 episodes. But every little detail is carefully thought out and this is evident throughout the entire show. Another aspect of Kaiji that I like is that it shows what the real world can be like, in the sense that the powerful and wealthy look down on and control the weak and poor. Overall, Kaiji is definitely a series worth checking out and although I haven't seen the second season at the time of writing this review, I can say with certainty that this half of Kaiji is absolutely fantastic.",

A third person narrator, a strange almost American art style, and almost entirely supported by its main character, almost never relying on its side characters. The uniqueness and sheer hype factor this show has is absolutely insane. The story had me feeling for Kaiji all the way from the very first scene to the very last scene.\" Seeing Kaiji get revenge on someone who wronged him is among the most satisfying things I have ever watched. Whether he beats the absolute shit out of someone or just mentally obliterates them, is sosatisfying it felt good to see it . The narrator makes everything all the more exciting pushing you off the edge of your seat you where already on. The story is enjoyable and the art is cool as hell. To top it all off the op/eds are good and fun to watch. My review is so perfect because everything just worked. If you haven't seen Kaiji, do yourself the favor and go watch it. Well thanks for reading my first review and I hope it helped. Enjoy!",

            "content": "The sibling franchise to _Akagi_. _Kaiji_ follows a fairly standardized beat: Kaiji lazes around until catastrophe befalls him; to get out of it, he participates in a gambling game, is naive & trusting, plunges further into disaster, wakes up and (often with the trust & assistance of some even bigger losers than him) comes up with an ingenious trick or stratagem to win back all his losses and then some; and then he falls right back asleep and since he's a gambling addict/loser, he'll eventually lose most or all of it again, to repeat the cycle... Structurally, it's the opposite of _Akagi_ (even though thereare some _Akagi_ references in it), because Akagi is the inscrutable gambler par excellance, who coldly weighs every odd and plans every move on multiple levels - like the 'security mindset' of a good hacker, this is not something one turns off, and we cannot imagine Akagi ever co-signing a loan nor lazing around nor cheating nor can we imagine him ever falling for, say, a 'friendly' game of cee-lo without taking gambler's ruin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_ruin) into account nor could he be said to be addicted, because he's always in control; but also Akagi only ever plays one game, mahjong, while Kaiji plays a different game every time. Not being a mahjong player, _Akagi_ was almost entirely lost on me, while the games in _Kaiji_ are clearly explained and often simple. Some of the invented games are quite interesting: Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors layers a mini-economy onto rock-paper-scissors to produce complexities I'd love to see investigated more deeply, while E-Card is simple yet exemplifies what game designer Sirlin calls \"yomi\" (http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/7-spies-of-the-mind). The art is about the same as far as I can recall: no women anywhere (which makes one wonder if that's misogynistic or not: does he think that women don't matter, are too sensible to fall into these traps, or that men will always sacrifice themselves?), and characters with heavily stylized faces and noses so sharp that a losing character could commit seppuku with them; I can't decide if I love or hate it. The narrator, once you get used to the purple prose, is hilarious (at one point I noted that the narration could be used in a pornographic film with little or no editing.) The music takes a punk rock approach, echoing one of the major themes: that society is structurally unfair, filled with traps and deceptions and false promises of rewards to encourage people to trample on each other and throw away their time/lives to win position & wealth from the meritocracy, becoming 'slaves to those above, and tyrants to those below' only to eventually be fed into the maw of the system by their successor and discarded when their usefulness is over; those who win are not those who are lucky but those who have seen through the lies fed to the ordinary people and realized that you must cheat, deceive, and steal your way to the top - when the Chairman talks about a \"king's luck\", it is merely an euphemism for cheating (so in other words, 'kings' *make* their own 'luck'), and those who refuse to cheat but entrust their hopes to chance or God will eventually lose and will deserve to have lost, and indeed, failure to understand this is Kaiji's ultimate undoing at the end of season 1. (The critique is generically Marxist, complete with obese capitalist plutocrats savoring the suffering of the lumpen-proletariat.)\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the stew of ingredients which is _Kaiji_: a loser with a heart of gold and occasional flashes of genius who is too weak-willed and soft-hearted to escape his permanent cycle of debt-hell and is plunged into exotic games for the amusement of the wealthy where he must scheme & cheat for his salvation. Is it successful? I would say no. The character himself is too implausible to take seriously (again, we may not like Akagi or see any depth to his character, but he is like a shark: his eyes are flat and reveal no consciousness inside but he is perfectly adapted to his environment). The art remains a problem since we're going to be staring at Kaiji's face for a very long time. Solutions to the gambles are not always satisfactory, as Fukamoto is better at inventing games than solving them, so the resolutions often involve some overly convenient devices like some valuable jewels just feet away Kaiji can grab to save himself or cheating. (Season 2 in particular is a huge letdown in this respect.) Some of the twists make no sense: how is a man blown to his death from a window opening on the 22nd story? That is... not actually all that high up! And at the end of season 1, how can we possibly believe that it could end that way when one of the 3 special rules was very visibly broken and so Kaiji didn't actually lose? (Since the folding of the ballot was clearly depicted in the animation, and folding was explicitly forbidden by the Chairman as a rule, I was convinced that Kaiji would point this out and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, leading to my single greatest surprise in watching _Kaiji_.) The cheating in E-card made no sense: if a billionaire wants to cheat at his own card game at a time & place of his own choosing with his own custom cards in his own custom game room, there are approximately an infinite number of ways to cheat which don't involve elaborate electronic gadgets attached to someone, and heck, the cheating wasn't even necessary, since the entire arc would have worked just fine if Toneagawa had good tell-reading skills and Kaiji had to use desperate measures to defeat the reading! (Tonegawa was probably my favorite character, and I was disappointed to see him made to resort to such clumsy cheating.) The pacing of both seasons is atrocious, as episodes are grossly stretched out: season 1's Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors was too long, the Human Derby & death bridge were much too long, and the E-card / lottery games were somewhat too long; while season 2, with only 2 games in it (cee-lo and the pachinko machine) should have been done as maybe 9 episodes at the most (with zero loss) and I strongly advise watching at 300% speed if you watch season 2. (I wonder if the manga suffers from the pacing problem? I suspect probably not.) The pachinko machine arc is - let's not mince words here - pretty stupid, especially when you start season 2 with the understandable expectation that Kaiji has learned his lesson and will meet the Chairman again in an even more epic duel. (He hasn't, and won't.)\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, some fun games & hilariously over the top narration and an initially very promising first arc can't rescue a series with a flawed protagonist, ugly art, repetitive plot, simplistic social commentary, and direly slow pacing.",

It is one of the best animes I've seen in a while and is very addicting. I finished this in 3 days which is pretty quick for me and I yearned for more (luckily there is a second season which I'm currently watching). This deserves to be praised as much as death note, codegeass, steins;gate and other brilliant animes becuause kaiji is truly a masterpiece. Go watch it and see for yourself",

            "content": "Kaiji gets in trouble after co-signing his friend's yakuza loan. Said gangsters offer him the chance to pay off the debt with a 4-hour gamblathon on a cruise ship. It turns out to be much nastier than he expects, and leads to other, similar gambles.\r\nIt's good, and I recommend you watch it. Regardless, this review will mainly pick on the things I didn't like.\r\nPlot 7/10\r\nThe main problem with Kaiji as a series is that we ultimately know he is going to win. We know that he will think he\u2019s on top, get crushed, then defiantly battle against the odds until one of his theories ispowerful enough to allow him to succeed (always at the last minute). There\u2019s never any doubt. It\u2019s as bad as Dexter in that respect. And we know that at the end something unexpected will probably have to happen to make all that waiting worth it.\\n\\n\r\nWorse, is the way in which the episodes drag. And I do mean drag. Endless convoluted riffs on the same idea or theory, explained over and over in mildly different ways. That weird voiceover could be used to compress Kaiji\u2019s muddling, but instead it only repeats it.\\n\\n\r\nI was also less than satisfied by the relentless nature of the gambles. There was no break between the challenges. I would have liked to have seen time for Kaiji to reflect on his own life more. He always berates himself for being such a lowly soul, but doesn\u2019t really acknowledge that his extreme situation isn\u2019t his own fault. That\u2019s an interesting angle \u2013 he hates himself regardless of the whole yakuza mess. I wanted to see that explored.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, he has a severe gambling problem, as is expressed through his comments during the E-Cards game (\u201cIf I leave with this much money, I am setting myself this limit. I will never have this much again\u201d etc). We needed more of that.\\n\\n\r\nBut, on the whole I enjoyed it. It was original, lively, pretty mature. Not your average anime. It made me think, and not just about the things which I didn\u2019t think were done well. It's way too long, though. Way too long.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe style here is refreshing. It\u2019s basic (very), but fun all the same. In fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s too fun. Some pretty horrible things happen in this series which are not suited to the animation style at all. The character designs are rough and grisly, as they should be, but their movement is too cartoon-like to convey the emotions literally dripping out of them. It\u2019s a shame, because it could have worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGood voice acting and casting, despite the narrator not being sure if he was building tension in a comedic or genuinely tense manner. The music was appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is annoyingly stupid sometimes, and inhumanly sharp at others. His endless stream of theories and tactics are baffling in their complexity, and often plagued with holes.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s constantly in tears, as are most of the other characters \u2013 each representing a small part of the psyche of an addict. Sure, it works. But kind of annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe baddies are incapable of any positivity. Not that they should be: the addict battling the world in general will never see any kindness if still under outside control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it\u2019s kind of bleak. Even Kaiji has no hope for the future. His dream is to not be chased for money. Every time I go into a convenience store now all I see are people striving for that level of comfort. It\u2019s sad.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kaiji is meant to be a nice guy under it all \u2013 compassionate and a leader of men despite his problems. But he\u2019s still a ruin. Can we get behind him without seeing something in ourselves which makes us feel uncomfortable?",

            "content": "*Note: I am not an english speaker\r\nKaiji is one of those animes that is different in many aspects, from its art style to the premise itself, that\u00b4s why i cant understand why  kaiji being a fresh and different concept cant be as popular as crashbags like sword art online or mirai nikki...\r\nWell, let\u00b4s talk about Kaiji: Ultimate survivor...\r\nThe worst thing that i could say about the wholes series incluiding its second season, is the art style, despite i liked because of how it gave the show an identity,  its ugly and the low budget CGI doesnt makes the things better, its anart style that will repel most of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the things that the show did good, lets talk about the OST, even is not the most important part in an anime, all themes are put in the correct moment and make the expectator feel even more tense.\\n\\n\r\nTurning to the most important (and the best executed) parts of kaiji, lets talk about the Story and the characters...\\n\\n\r\nKaiji uses a premise that is not very usual in the anime... \"The debts\", yes, is an anime about the stress of having debts and gambling, in paper it sounds like a boring anime, but its execution is amazing... let me explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe matches arent only to try to pay debts that the main character has with the yakuzas (yes, there are yakuzas in this anime), but also to survive, in all the games kaiji is in constant danger, one bad step and he is dead, also the series manages to be psychological with simple games like \"Rock, Paper, Sissors\" making those games a lot more complex than they are suposed to be, and there is another thing about the strategies, they made sense, they arent Deus ex machinas or plot conviniences with no explanation that are there to make look cool the main protagonist (ejemejemlikecodegeassdidejemejem), they are logic strategies that have an explanation.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it works as a social critique of those that have money and society losers, The rich people are represented by yakuzas, people that lend money to those that need it, but, they dont want to be paid, they only want to have fun of the losers suffering, but, the losers arent victims of the society, they act like rats, they manipulate, lie, betray and also kill because of their desesperation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, but not least important, the main character Kaiji Itou is probably my favorite main character in anime, it is the most balanced and human character i have seen in anime, Is smart, but makes mistakes, is brave, but he has fears, it has a good heart, but he doesnt let others trample him, is MANLY, but he doesnt contains his emotions,  i could even say that is a tridimentional character, he is not like kirito or like yugi, he doesnt always wins because of the \"PLOT ARMOR POWER\", he has to think in a way to escape of the situation that he has gotten.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kaiji is one of the best anime that i have seen, it\u00b4s adictive because of the dynamic direction and the juxtaposition of the sounds, is fresh because of the concept and the way it manages to make it interesting, it has the best strategies i have ever seen, one of the best main characters of anime and an interesting point of view of the social classes.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \"I want a Third Season of this instead of a second of OPM\"",

He keeps on winning games, but as may luck have it finds himself battling for life on a gambling extravaganza the next night - and ifhe's as smart as he is then why would he get swayed by the same thing over considering the risks involved? \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OST and thought it captured the cringe-worthy moments in the show alive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhy such a low rating? Yeah, I'll have to be brutally honest here. As a guy who loved psychological anime, you cannot term an anime psychological where an mc just keeps on crying till something out of the blue happens and he changes to a mysterious genius. I can be glad that I'd never stoop as low as Kaiji. It's just a circle of never ending desperation, while it manages to get many things right, it just doesn't make the cut in making it an engaging psychological battle.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of badass mcs and intense psychological battles, you must search elsewhere.  I clearly was disappointed and hence the 5/10 rating\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaiji Ultimate Survivor is an incredibly underrated anime in my opinion and i had to give it a ten out of ten. I\u2019ve never really been into gambling but Kaiji changed my mind.\r\nI find the Story & Plot interesting because it takes place in the 90\u2019s during japans great recession and it has a good hearted relatable main character that has to go through gambles to get out of his crippling debt. Some of these gambles escalate to life or death situations with the possibility of paying back his debt almost instantly or he\u2019ll end up working for years to pay it off wasting hislife away.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise you can really relate to the characters especially the main character Kaiji. Over the course of watching the anime I was surprised to see how intelligent Kaiji was and the amount of character development he goes through. The characters felt human and grounded in reality. The amount of psychological mind games is also incredible combined with the extreme amount of detail involved in the gambling explanations via the narrator. This is a rare anime that has made me tense up and be on the edge of my seat every episode because of the unpredictability. Kaiji is written in such a way that no one is safe and no one can win a gamble every time; it\u2019s all up to luck and pure chance even for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kaiji anime was adapted by Madhouse, one of my favorite anime production companies so I knew this was going to be incredibly good. The animation is good while the artwork is really something I thought was unique; Nobuyuki Fukumoto set it apart from other works I\u2019ve seen/read by giving it his own identity with his artwork specifically facial designs (stretched eyes, pointy noses, and pointed heads etc) and despite the artwork looking the way it is the anime is really dark and serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was composed by Hideki Taniuchi who I remember composing music for Death Note. His musical compositions fit Kaiji perfectly from the eerie experimental electronic tracks to the mellow/desperate sounding guitar tracks. Speaking of the music the opening song is incredibly good but also incredibly deceiving compared to what the actual anime is like (which is something I found interesting) and it is sung by Kaiji\u2019s voice actor himself too. I really enjoyed the ending theme as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects were spot on in my opinion as well as the voice acting. The Zawa sfx for an uneasy atmosphere gives the anime its own visual and audio identity; kind of similar to JoJo in the sense of the text albeit vocalized.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly highly recommend Kaiji Ultimate Survivor, it\u2019s really an experience. You will be on the edge of your seat every episode.\\n",

            "content": "At the time I write this review, 2017 had a notable anime with a Gambling premise called \"Kakegurui,\" which was compared to the likes of this show. I personally did enjoy Kakegurui and when I heard about this, I decided to give it a shot. Needless to say, Kaiji was a very unique experience compared to Kakegurui and this anime left a very strong impression. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\n\"Kaiji\" is an anime about a young, deadbeat man named Kaiji who is dirt poor, tends to engage in cheap gambles and likes to violate expensive cars. One day, he is visited by a man named Endou whoinforms Kaiji that a debt he co-signed for a friend has fallen onto him after his friend disappeared. He ends up with a debt of 3.8 Million Yen, and with no options on how to pay it, he is offered a ride on a 4 hour cruise where he has to gamble with other people to take out his debt. Kaiji agrees to this, and so begins his descent into a dark world of underworld gambling, where as the anime progresses, the riskier the gambles are, to the point where it is literally 'Life-or'Death.' \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nOne of the things that puts down people from watching this show is the art style. To be frank, the art style is VERY UGLY. With darker shades of colors, and odd geometrical shapes for the faces, it's no wonder that people don't like the art style. Although, since this is an anime that deals with dark undertones in the story, it suits the anime well. I mean, can you imagine how this anime would be like if we had moe art style for this? Another good thing about this art style is the fact that the style allows the freedom to put an exaggerated facial expression. It really allows the viewer to see the agony and stress a character is feeling when facing a challenge that is testing their limits. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nIn my reviews, I never really pay attention to the sound details of an anime, usually the OP and ED of a series. Kaiji is a special exception. The sound is phenomenal throughout the season. The Voice Acting for Kaiji by Masato Hagiwara was one of the best VAs I've ever heard for a character. I really felt that Hagiwara sold the emotions well during the scenes where Kaiji was determined or agonizing. The OP is sung by Masato Hagiwara, the VA for Kaiji, while the ED is sung by Hakuryuu, the VA for Tonegawa. The OP has a kickass beat where you feel like being a badass, while the ED has a somber tone that fits the show. This anime was the first for me to enjoy the songs played throughout an episode. The songs were composed by Hideki Taniuchi, who has also composed the OST to 'Death Note.' The songs Taniuchi was really enjoyable, and they fit during scenes where it was needed. An example would be \"Defeat\" playing during the start of the 2nd part of the \"Brave Man Road\" arc. Definitely, the OST in Kaiji is one of my very favorites from anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nKaiji, despite being a deadbeat gambler, is one of my favorite characters in an anime- ever. Even though he wants money, Kaiji always tries to take a path where he is fair with those who gamble with him and tries to split his winnings fairly with others. He ultimately is a good guy and you're probably bound to end up cheering for him in his gambles. As for the other characters, they're pretty much 1-dimensional and serve their roles well. Tonegawa is one of the villains of the series, being the person who organizes the gambles, not caring about what happens to any of the contestants in the gambles. Hyoudou is an elderly man who oversees these gambles and enjoys seeing people suffer, ruin their lives and die. Endou is a loan shark who brings Kaiji into the world of underground gambling who only cares about getting his money. Other characters include Ishida, Andou, Sahara, Funai, and Furuhata, the friend he co-signed with. I give this an 8, since the other characters don't develop much and just serve their roles. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nKaiji was a thrill ride from start to finish. With the constant \"Life-or-Death\" gambles, there were times I felt anxiety from wanting to know what happens next. While it does start a bit slow, it picks up really quick and it gets very interesting from one episode to the next. Even though Kaiji is a shitty deadbeat, he is enjoyable to watch and you just want him to win and to get his life going. The games were interesting, and I really binged this series, considering it was very addicting. Rarely do I find a series that I want to binge, and Kaiji is one of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nKaiji in about 10 years time will probably be considered a Classic of the 2000s Anime (much like how we consider Classics from the 1980s and 1990s), and it's a pretty underrated and under supported anime. Kaiji is an absolute must-watch for anyone who likes anime and want and interesting story to watch. While the art style may put people down, the story, soundtrack and enjoyment of this show make up for the art, and this is genuinely, as as now that I write this, my favorite anime I have ever seen.",

            "content": "I have two rules for suspense stories\r\n1. The plot has to keep me invested\r\n2. The characters have to be likable enough for me to care about them \r\nKaiji exceeded expectations. \r\nPlot armor is always a problem when trying to tell a suspenseful story. High stakes make a story interesting, but most anime are afraid to follow through with the consequences, making all of the tension feel hollow. If you know for a fact that the protagonist can't die or be seriously injured, then you know that he'll always win when the stakes are high.\r\nKaiji, however, is an anime that throws this out the window. Thisis a show that isn't afraid to let its protagonist suffer, and that makes the it all the more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is a gambling anime, a genre which seems to be growing in popularity recently. In many ways, it is the model anime for the genre, and no gambling anime created after Kaiji will be able to get by without being compared to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is rather easy to sum-up: Kaiji is a young, unemployed loser with nothing going for him until a loan shark comes knocking on his door to collect on a loan he cosigned for a friend. With no way to pay, Kaiji is forced into the world of high-stakes, underground gambling where everything, even his own life, is on the line.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is composed of several arcs centered around different types of gambles, including everything from dice games, to variations on rock-paper-scissors.\\n\\n\r\nOn it\u2019s own, this doesn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly unique, but it is the execution of these story elements that makes Kaiji a fun and different experience.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji relishes in tension and drama. It\u2019s atmosphere is dark and theatrical, full of heavy linework, over-the-top metaphors, and an enthusiastic narrator. The character designs are expressive. Even simple actions are accompanied by elaborate fanfare, and the entire production is punctuated with appropriately foreboding and exaggerated sound design (...zawa, zawa).\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, Kaiji keeps you appropriately engaged with the action. You can never know whether Kaiji is going to win or lose his gambles, so the high stakes carry weight, and the overall design of the show serves to build tension very effectively.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no matter how well the story pulls off its high tension games, it's meaningless if you don't care what happens to the characters. Luckily Kaiji is a success in this department as well.\\n\\n\r\nThough I can't say much for the rest of the characters as they aren\u2019t really important, Kaiji is a very likable protagonist and genuinely a good character.\\n\\n\r\nIn other gambling anime, it is common to have a protagonist who is exceptionally skilled. As a result, much of the tension is lost. In such series, the enjoyment is derived from watching the protagonist\u2019s genius plans unfold as he takes his opponents down a notch.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji has a rather different focus, however. The enjoyment of this series comes from its ability to create tension. Kaiji is not someone who is particularly good at gambling. He is not a genius, though he is certainly not stupid. He is essentially an ordinary guy in exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nThe viewer doesn\u2019t root for Kaiji because of his skill; they root for him because they are invested. Luckily, Kaiji is a character who is rather easy to get invested in. The anime does a good job of making him likable and relatable without forcing it. \\n\\n\r\nI think Kaiji does a great job of creating a protagonist who is likable and easy to support while simultaneously being flawed and relatable. He clearly has a charisma that sets him apart from the rest, but it isn\u2019t a super-power. \\n\\n\r\nThe major part of Kaiji's appeal is that he isn't perfect. He's ever the underdog, often failing because of his shortcomings. Throughout the story, his gambler personality causes him to continue his games long after he needs to and to take unnecessary risks. Because of this, no matter how much he wins, he often doesn't stop until he has nothing left to gamble.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me. It is frustrating to watch a character risk life and limb (literally) to prove a point and maybe get some cash.\\n\\n\r\nBut through Kaiji's genius plans and infuriating losses, the viewer is always able to root for him. It's easy to sympathize with him through both his victories and his ensuing, crushing defeats. I don\u2019t think Kaiji would have been nearly as effective if it had a different kind of character for its protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two things to potentially hold you back from watching Kaiji: its over-the-top, drawn-out storytelling and its lack of rewatchability. \\n\\n\r\nThe former is all a matter of taste. I will say that Kaiji definitely drags its feet at times. It sometimes feels like it\u2019s padding for time with drawn-out narration and monologues (e.g. taking two entire episodes to draw out a piece of paper from a box). In my opinion, this adds to the tense atmosphere, but I can understand how this might annoy some.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter point about the series\u2019 lack of rewatchability is moot if you\u2019re watching Kaiji for the first time anyway, but as I said before, the appeal of Kaiji comes from its ability to create tension. If you\u2019re rewatching it, much of that tension is gone because the outcome is already known.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I still definitely recommend giving Kaiji a try. It\u2019s a fun ride that will make you both incredibly frustrated and incredibly excited, and honestly what more can you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nCheck it out. Maybe you\u2019ll end up like me and like it so much you buy a Kaiji figma :D\\n",

Kaiji gets sent on the ship called Espoir and if we wins, all of his debts will be erased. On ship he will learn what a hellish place it is. He has to play restricted rock-paper-scissors on stars, and on Espoir, stars are life. If you have 3 stars, you will survive, and under... well you can guess.\r\nI think that game of rock-paper-scissors was dull, boring, how ever creator of series tried to defend it, it was still boring. I wasabout to quit it... but, after restricted rock-paper-scissors (RPS) things got intresting. (no, i wont tell what will happen)\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, Kaiji really started, and it got my attention and i wasn't able to take my eyes off. Kaiji started to use fear and really psycholical (could someone tell me how to spell this word?) aspect on human mind, will you lose your some money or your life? Kaiji will push people to their limits, and you will see everything what human has to offer, trust, hate, betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nI loved how narrator / Kaiji tells what they think, and most importantly what others think. It makes you think what you would do in that situation. I even kept my hands on my ears on certain point (You will find out what i mean :))\\n\\n\r\nBut what i hated, i hated those pointy faces, pointy noses, pointy noses. It was really hard to get used to style what animator uses, its plain awful, but you will used to it. Other thing is that you will feel is that it wont go anywhere, that it just stands still, but on next episode 10 hours has gone by.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, i like to watch people put their life on the line and hope that they will change after that expirience. (Prefer: Saw series) \\n\r\nAfter all, first half of serie is boring as HELL and makes you want to quit, but for some reason you will keep watching it... and after that it wakes up, like phoenix and goes on a journey from what you cant keep your eyes off.\\n\\n\r\nYou liked Akagi, well it sucks, watch Kaiji and you will just love it!\\n\\n\r\nExcuse my for my bad english, and please comment to my profile review so i will know what to do better :)",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**\r\nWow! Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is one of the most intelligent anime I have seen in a while and it definitely knows how to keep its viewer hooked on it the whole time and of course, I will explain why I think it is.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nThe story of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor begins with a guy named Kaiji Itou who was just a normal guy who would spend most of his time gambling and stealing hubcaps off of cars until he is suddenly approached by a mysterious man who wants to collect the outstanding amount debt that hisfriend left onto him. Realizing that he cannot pay off all of the debt, the mysterious man gives him an option of participating in a underground gamble on a cruise ship called the Espoir that is able to clear off his debt in one night but soon enough Kaiji realizes that there is something even more sinister planed beyond this. One of the strong points to this story is how Kaiji overcomes most of these obstacles and twists and turns thrown at him by thinking up an unexpected strategy or plan that can leave you thinking of how he was able to come up with that with all the pressure put onto him or the amount of time he had and this type of events keeps the viewer immersed in the story. The unexpected strategies or plans he comes up with are all so well-thought-out whenever they come up which I thought that was very interesting because of how many other anime sometimes bring up something out of nowhere and never explain it and that we are supposed to take it as it is. Another strong point to this anime is how it delved into human emotions. The emotions that were shown like anger, regret, desperation, and many more were all well presented and the scenes that contained these emotions all felt very intense. The only problem I had with the story is how it would sometimes go a little overboard with the explanation of things and what I mean by this is how it would explain something once, then sometime later it would explain it again a second or third time like we didn't understand what happened the first time, so I thought it was a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor's art style is definitely a unique one that may turn off some people because of how it uses thick outlines which is rare to see in anime and how it uses a different style of drawn teeth but I don't mind any of this at all, I think it's cool. The art also helps boosts the scenes with the characters showing any emotion and the anime also adds some very interesting things during these scenes which I like to call visual symbolism. An example of visual symbolism would be like if Kaiji is losing and is feeling hopeless he is sinking into the bottom of the ocean or if Kaiji is winning there is light shining on him. As for the animation, I think that the animation is average because there is really nothing that catches you by surprise in this animation wise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime definitely has some good tracks to listen to and they all help make the scenes much more atmospheric and the little ZAWA ZAWA thing that they put in them are great. The OP and ED are good, I only wished that they could make the OP a little longer than just 47 seconds. The voice actors did great in this and the sound effects were good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is a really good main character due to how everything he has experienced like betrayal, regret, hopelessness, and seeing how cruel people can be just for money or to save themselves, he is still able to not break during these situations and overcomes them and the surprising thing is that he still puts his trust to people even after everything he has been through, so it really feels like he has been growing as a character. The villains in this anime are really nothing special but I do like how they all come up with all these different types of methods to deceive people that are all really well planed out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime always kept me on my toes with how Kaiji was going to overcome these obstacles while the stakes were getting higher and really immersed me to the point that I couldn't stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is an anime that I would highly recommend due to how intense scenes can get with its psychological mind games and how it knows how to immerse its viewer in its story.         \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm bored so I'm going to review this.\r\nStory -\r\nItou Kaiji, a depressed NEET loser who spends his time with petty crime and generally being miserable gets to go on a cruise. \r\nNot just any cruise though, a cruise ship paid for and owned by the Teiai Corporation, which is pretty much the Yakuza. They make money from gambling, slavery, loan sharks and most likely legitimate stuff too, there isn't a large span of episodes detailing the intricate details of the organisation because it's not called \"Teiai Group the animation\". It's Kaiji. \r\nOwing 3 million yen (\u00a316k) debt traced back to him due to co-signing aloan for a friend, a loan shark visits his apartment and offers him to board a cruiseship with the possibility of making his money back and more! Without any choice other than slavery, and nothing else going on in his life Kaiji accepts this offer.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kaiji arrives on the ship for an overnight cruise, the way to make money is revealed: Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors. Which is just Rock Paper Scissors but you use cards instead of your hand, participants only get a select number of cards and an even number of each type. I'm going to stop there because if you should just watch the show if you want to know more about that, but as with most psychological game genres you can't trust anyone. It's relatively unpredictable and at times Kaiji feels like a gambling addict, rather than a genius hero compared to L or the guy from Liar Game, also unlike Liar Game friendship doesn't match wits. A positive for me, but I still thought Liar Game was good, check that out too if you are into the genre, it's more genius vs genius like Death Note than desperate gamblers vs desperate gamblers like Kaiji is most of the time.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Really nice and unique style. It is a bit more dull than other anime, but the fact that 90% of anime are colourful, joyful styles that make me wonder where's my joy? it works fantastically. If more anime had a similar style it wouldn't be as impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Great voice acting, great op/ed, really nice background music. So basically I enjoyed it, adds to the dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I love Itou Kaiji as a man, he is what I wish I was like. He fights through fear, is brave ect. but he also acts like a gambling addict at the first few signs of possible success. He is relatively naive and trusting. He isn't a selfish person, unlike most of the other characters and genuinely wants everyone to be happy rather than focusing on his own greed. He is a fool at times, but if he was perfect I wouldn't like him nearly as much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is an odd one for me, as I don't get immersed like I did up to around 16. Life and my mental health melted is thanks to that, but seeing  someone so low is kind of relateable, which is nice. I would say it's (actually season 2 is) my favourite anime I've watched this year (2015) over Fate/Zero and many others. A couple of years ago I'd have probably been totally immersed in the fate series, but sadly that time is gone. Kaiji is a nice distraction from life, so it's something.\\n",

            "content": "Kaiji is an extremely solid series, and I wanted to give it a 9 or 10. The thing stopping me from labeling it as a masterpiece is the show's pacing. Out of a total 52 episodes, probably around 20 (possibly even more) play out the tension of a scene to its limit without advancing the plot. The episodes that do advance things can move very quickly, making for an odd mixture of rapidity and sluggishness.\r\nAn example of this is during the Pachinko arc (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the series yet). When Kaiji steps up to play a large machine witha huge pay out collected from the losses of other gamblers, you feel the tension along with him to succeed. That is a GREAT hook to keep people watching, and I can personally attest to staying up way too late to see how things would resolve. The problem is that it would take 5+ episodes for everything to play out, and in some of these episodes almost no progress was made at all.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji would benefit from cutting its episode count in half. The audience would still feel the suspense of high stakes gambling, but wouldn't need to sit for hours on end to reach the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that critique, Kaiji is a truly wonderful show. While the art may seem wonky, it has a very distinctive retro feel, and is instantly recognizable. The show tackles complexities in a realistic fashion, pulling no punches on the vicious cycle of addiction, the legitimate woes and also unique attitude of youth in modern capitalistic society, the harshness of organized crime and the both positive and negative extremes people will go to when desperate to save themselves.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many protagonists of anime of any genre, Kaiji himself is genuinely intelligent. If he had been diligent in school, he could very well be a lower level executive by the time the series starts (and he's only 21). Like many young people, he falls into the typecast of \"smart but lazy\" (how true that is varies from person to person). When the series starts he is an unemployed delinquent, but throughout the story he wins enough fortunes that if he could find it in him to quit gambling, he could invest and never have to work again. While I am singing the protagonist's praises, I should give an example of how grounded that character, and every character for that matter is. Kaiji is intelligent, but very immature and overall naive (he is only 21 after all). He is duped easily, reflecting his youth and optimism of systems such as debt and employment.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters share a similar balance of value. One higher up mobster is incurably smug in his attitude toward the youth he has gotten into gambling, however he himself is seen as a poor employee due to his lack of innate aggression or initiative and is demoted as a result. One family man genuinely wants to rid himself of debt, but is too cowardly to act.\\n\\n\r\nWrapping things up, Kaiji is incredibly enjoyable. From the hard suspense to the surprisingly acute social commentary, this series should not be missed by people who enjoy an anime that can be both deathly serious and amusingly absurd.\\n",

All the arcs had their own intense flow, which were well portrayed and explained. However, those moments alone were not enough to keep me engrossed in the show. With the slight exception of the cruise arc,I felt that the show was constantly involved Kaiji getting fucked - and making literally zero progress. Not really enjoyable to watch if you know what I mean.",

            "content": "Kaiji is amazing, minus a few short comings, we'll get to those.\r\nNot a spoiler free review, you have been warned.\r\nFirst let's start off with the best part about Kaiji, atleast for me. The story, the show can be broken into 3 main arcs but I like to break it into 5 and there's a specific reason for this. The first arc is amazing, the cruise ship arc. Basically Kaiji has accumulated some debt, well some is an understatement, a lot. So in order to pay it off he enters into a crazy deal were he knows none of the details just cause there's the promiseof paying off all his debt in one night of gambling. Kaiji enters and finds out that it's a crazy survival game of limited Rock Paper Scissors, I'm not gonna explain the rules because the show does a fine job of it but bascially what seems like something very simple is tuned into something insane. With crazy ideas and tactics being used to try and win out over the other hopeless sacks on the boat. Kaiji very early on gets taken down to a very dire situation and then spends the whole arc trying to work back to a point were he will be able to survive And get out okay. The kind of tactics and thinking that go into the first arc are nuts, i love stuff like this, people thinking up some really crazy mind games in order to come out on top. The writers did an awesome job and if the whole show was just this first arc then I would give the show a 9 and maybe even a 10. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is the human derby, bascially despite surviving the boat Kaiji still has debt to pay off and his even got more due to having to borrow money during the cruise gamble. Becuase of this Kaiji is in the worst situation his been so far and then when the men in black suits come and ask for his money they know he doesn't have it and so they offer a new survival game. Kaiji obviously refuses but his co-worker who was just out for drinks with him is there and he takes up the offer and after some sweet talk Kaiji also takes up the offer and thus a second survival game begins. The human derby is people walking across beams from a high place with the first two people getting money and the others getting nothing, this is the weakest of the 5 arcs in my mind becuase it's so slow and there's no room for crazy tactics to happen nor is it tense. Kaiji is both behind and in front of someone so he can push and be pushed but in the end cause himself and two others to be discaulfied for touching the beam with there hands but they still get to live. The problem is what Kaiji spends like 3 episodes talking about whether he should of shouldn't push the person in front of him most of the time going back and forth so much that the one in the middle is mostly pointless. The whole arc just doesn't feel tense and ends with the winner getting slips of paper that are tickets that have to redeem by going though yet another survival game. Since only one person won in the fifth batch of people for the human derby Kaiji is able to take the extra slip.\\n\\n\r\nThus we enter the second part of the beam arc, which I consider its own arc becuase it's so much better. Kaiji and the other survivors band together to do this next survival challenge which is crossing beams again but the beam has electricity running though it, so touching it will cause you to fall rather then just a discaluficafion. Kaiji helps rally the other people up and all of them support each other and start crossing this final beam however fear starts to set in and people start to think that there in more danger then they really are. This is what makes this arc so tense one dude think there is intense wind blowing but everyone else knows there isn't, they try to calm him down but he panics and grabs the beam killing him, this causes mass panic and once people calm down there's only three people left standing. Kaiji, his co-worker and an old man from the first survival game who Kaiji saved. Forgive me with the names, i don't remeber them very well. Basically the old man gets gripped by fear and makes the decision that he can't make it and hand his slip to Kaiji asking Kaiji to win and give the money that was meant to be for the old man to his family as he has a wife and kid, then as Kaiji moves on he silently kills himself so as not to distract Kaiji. It's stuff like this that makes me like this arc a whole lot more then the first beam walking, Kaiji eventually relises that the old man jumps which throws him off a little but then his co-worker calms him down just in time to freak out himself and have Kaiji calm him down into the end the co-worker runs forward, jumps and makes it to the other end. However there is an extra trap at the end causing him to also die and then Kaiji is left alone, once he gives up on making it he notices a glass Starway that breaks off the beams from the side, someone has to give up hope once and still be alive in order to make it through. Kaiji takes the glass stairway only to find out his slips arnt valid as at one point he yelled for them to cut the power off to make the beams safe and aprently they did, meaning they forfitted there right to the money. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji gets pissed at this and the two headmen of the whole survival game company thingy decided that since they didn't let him know or cut the power right away they will give him a second chance and this we enter the second best arc, the e-card arc with it basically limited rock, paper, scissors once again but even more different since one player has bascially all scissors and one paper while the other has all scissors and one rock, they have different names but this is bascially what it is and the stakes are made high with a twist. But I've spent way too much time talking about the story. So I'll try to make the rest shirt and sweet. This is a lot like the first arc with crazy over the top tactics and taking some serious risks, this arc is super tense and parts of it are just as if not more amazing the. The first arc but overall I'd say the first arc still wins out, but this is a very good one and Kaiji using a shard of glass to cut his ear off is insane, he goes to some crazy lengths in order to both survive and make money.\\n\\n\r\nThus we enter the next arc, this time it's awsome box! A lottery with only one true ticket, Kaiji actully cheats in this to make sure he can win a but load of money but the CEO offers Kaiji an amount no one would accept unless they knew they were going to win to find out that Kaiji has a plan going on and thus he is able to stop it and win out over Kaiji, in the end Kaiji wins nothing instead he still has his debt and now his lost an ear and four fingers along with it all. The kast arc is a little slow becuase it could be one episodes but it's like 4. However despite being slow its tense the whole time and it never feels like it's dragging on, the tactics and thoughts of these people are extremely important and so it's givin a lot of attention like when Kaiji relises that his cheat plan has failed, it must go deep into his thoughts now. As you can see the show has crazy tactics and some extreme moments all of it being ver tense and well written even if it all ends in failure, it's great stuff and I love the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are actully kinda bland. Not many of them get much development and even Kaiji is no better a person in the end of it all, he still continues to trust the people around him despite how many times he tries to stop himself and even in the final episode he is thinking about what he should of done differently. There's is a second season so I'm not going to say the ending is an issue or that Kaiji didn't develop enough but he really didn't, no one did and even if they did well everyone is dead now minus Kaiji and the bad guys, along with a bunhc of nameless un important side characters, maybe they do have names, either way They don't devlop either. The show focuses on what there thinking and that's becuase it's about humans as a whole not these specific people. It's showing how horrible people can be when rules be greed, how when fear steps in they are more submissive. What wins our fear or greed, how far do people go, how do they change there opnion on the people around them as situations change. One moment your buddies helping each other out and the next you betray the very person that is the reason your alive simply becuase it's no longer in your best interest. Humans are horrible creatures and do horrible things, that's what the show wants you to get out of its characters not who they are or how they change. However while that's great for aspects like the story, it's not great for the characters and so they are kind of a low point, even if Kaiji is awsome.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation I actully really like, there noses are huge but you get use to it pretty fast, atleast I did so it didn't bother me. Everyone has hard outlines and the art style is consistent throughout the entire show, all good things I really like the look of this show. I never really though that something looked bad or should of been done differently design wise, it's all really good, solid, consistent art. The music can leave a little to be desired though, the narrirstor is a pain in the ass but overall the music doesn't really do much. The Zuwa Zuwa (is that right) is really good and when it plays you know shit is going down and the opening and ending arnt bad, there actully quite nice in both what they show and the music used. The voice acting is good throughout the whole show, everyone did a great performance and they can all sounds happy when They need to but then later on the edge of despair. Everyone has great range and there was t a single performance that I though needed to be improved on. Another great thing about the presentation is the extreme metaphors. There's really not much going on most of the time, people talking, thinking or maybe there busy playing there cards or something that isn't super interesting to just see and hear normally. So there is a ton of these extream metaphor presentations of the situation which makes it much more interesting, think about the kind of stuff that's in N.H.K and it's a lot like that, an extreme representation of the situation, I really like stuff like this. Plus they also just make doing basic things very dramatic, like when Kaiji flips his card knowing his won and he lifts it over his head and then slams it down and when it lands there a huge gust of wind that spreads outward and wind streams coming off his hand and a small cloud of dust also rises when the card goes down. This mixed in with the extreme metaphor situations and the hard outlines of the characters makes for some really cool shots.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was only slightly dull during the first half of the beam arc, too much thinking that changes nothing, no cool tactics or clever writting, not enough interactions and just a whole lot of nothing, it seemed really out of place and slow. Even though slow can be done right like with the awsome box arc. There's been a lot of story in this and not a whole lot of analysis but I just got carried away when writting this and plus I feel like giving you examples is the best way to tell you how intense the story can get. The stakes are always high, although the highest stakes I have left out so that you can still enjoy the show, trust me although I said a lot this only scratches the surface of what happens in Kaiji. I now relise that this makes for a kinda shit review, oh well. I'll just go with it.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot my enjoyment of the show was massive I always wanted to see what was going to Happen next and I also got some weird looks at my universities library as I yelled out or gasped or did some crazy motion whenever things got really tense and I was just fully invested. Yes I watch anime while at university, don't judge me. Plus I watched the entire first arc in one sitting, I didn't plan to either. I was at freaking university, but hey I just arnt and watched the whole first arc in one go and I never had a moment of dull feelings or feeling burnt out which can sometimes happen. If you haven't seen Kaiji then go watch it right now, your bound to like at least the first arc and i haven't met anyone who had negative things to say about Kaiji, it's great at Keats give it a look. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 (the beam arc and characters let it down a little plus the other aspects arnt perfect, just really good) \\n\\n\r\nForgive my shitty spelling, I'm doing reviews in order to get better.",

            "content": "Let me just say that I wasn\u2019t interested in this series in the first place because I am not very fond of stories about gambling. However, after watching the live-action film I am so interested that I decided to watch this series right away.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nFantasy, mystery, and magical stories are all nice and interesting but nothing more can be interesting and inspiring than a story about life and the harsh reality that comes with it. Stories about the harsh reality of the world and how hard to literally live day by day can be really gloomy and painful for many.And if you are someone who likes watching animes or reading mangas because you want to be entertained and forget reality even for a minute then you would probably pass this one. However, the amazing thing with this kind of stories is that they are very inspirational and would always make someone think or reflect about life. That would be because more than the part where the harsh reality is showcased, there is also the part where one can survive despite all odds. It is also a story about how magnificently a loser can grow within a fight. How one can still stand up even after losing so many times. How one don\u2019t let his failures depress him for so long but rather learn from them. How one can still believe even after being betrayed countless times. THAT! IS NO DOUBT VERY ENCOURAGING AND INSPIRING. Plus, the drama that comes with it can be so authentic which would always shake some sense to any kind of viewer. Damn right! This is a story about gambling and what\u2019s at stakes? YOU\u2019RE LIFE! The games are made extremely simple but because it is life that is at stake it becomes extremely exciting and heart-pounding. My only concern is that the storyline can really be a bit complicated and run in a slow pace. And boy there are lots and lots of talks; monologues and narrations.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nFor most of the characters, more particularly Kaiji, their psychological stability is challenged in the most horrible and craziest ways. We get to see if they will be able to maintain their sanity with all the tortures they have to face. It is one of the most anticipating parts of the series. But of course, the most exciting and anticipating is Kaiji\u2019s part. Whether he will succumb to insanity or not is something to look forward to. With a survival plot that this series has, it usually shows the horrible side of human beings. Since ancient times, human beings had done so many things in order to survive.  It is a side that makes us similar to animals. But more importantly, it also shows the admirable side of human beings that makes us the highest creatures ever made. Creatures that have intellect, logic, will, conscience, and more importantly the ability to choose how we are going to live. Despite everything else, I honestly think that what the perpetrators of the games are saying about the debtors can be unfortunately true. It really hits the mark. BUT! That doesn\u2019t justify what they are doing. Let\u2019s not forget that there are countless of small creatures in the world that are still able to survive the world despite their sizes which I believe one of the moral lessons you will learn from this series. Plus, despite saying those very honest lectures about the debtors, they would cheat during a fight. AH! There\u2019s nothing I hate the most than hypocrites. The antagonists are beyond irritating. They are so damn evil. Nowadays, some antagonists are still made pitiable as well to make their actions justifiable somehow which I kind of hate but here, they are plain evil. The chairman is the creepiest and most irritating of all but surprisingly enough, he can be really funny to me.\\n\\n\r\nAbout KAIJI\\n\r\nAnother exciting and interesting about this kind of stories is that it is also about a person who will amazingly prove to those people who play with people\u2019s lives just for pleasure that it is a horrible decision to make fun with a trash who has nothing to lose. I just love stories about underdogs like Kaiji. Most of the characters are extremely irritating so whenever Kaiji prove them wrong, it also feels extremely good and exciting. Particularly the fight between Kaiji and Tonegawa. Kaiji\u2019s character development really makes him an ultimate survivor thus the title of this wonderful series. Kaiji is no doubt really admirable but later in the series; he becomes so full of himself perhaps because of his continuous winnings. It just so irritating that he still dared to gamble again despite what he\u2019s been through. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s a masochist or something.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATIONS and SOUNDS\\n\r\nThe animation can be quite different but it is still made amazingly. The characters\u2019 design is the most different but don\u2019t be deceive by how they looked. It is true that the illustrations looked like it was made straight from the manga but like they said that don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Well, like I did because the looks of the characters made me somehow doubt the quality of the series. Thank God I watched the live-action film because I would\u2019ve miss an amazing series. The sounds made every important scene such an intense and exciting moment. Plus, I believe the seiyu made the characters a lot more authentic, specifically Kaiji\u2019s. Wonderful job Seiyus!\\n\\n\r\nIt is no question that it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve watched something like this one that would make you really think about life. However, I honestly think that it is still enough to be compared to the amazing series such Death Note and Monster which are beyond amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLife is indeed a gamble. This series is about temptations, failures, chances, risks, insanities, and gambles; things that human beings knows very well. But more importantly it is about LIFE. You will learn or even think a lot about life with all its amazing teachings, wisdoms and lessons. And surprisingly enough, most of them came from the extremely irritating antagonists.\\n",

If I were to rate anime on a ranking scale with Death Note and Noein ranking 10 / 10 then Kaiji would rank 9 / 10. It is what I call an epic rated anime. \r\nIt can be counted in the same genre as Death Note as a psychological thriller anime. The only downside of this anime is that some people don't like the art style even though it is quite well done.",
