It seemed like an anime with no presence and no one would've cared about it.\r\nI was wrong.\r\nThe anime is actually really good overall and people started noticing it because it was actually good. I feel this is really underrated because of the unusual synopsis and such.\r\nThe story is about Tanaka and his friends around him, basically like the usual high school girl with the conflicts with the outside connections between the main MCs. This is the lowest point because, it is extraordinary in a way but the plot didn't really getto me. The story is cute though so it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe art backgrounds were very beautiful in my opinion. Character designs were unique in a way. I really liked the art for Tanaka-kun for some reason, what a relaxing sight.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also well made. I don't understand Japanese, but the upbeat tune with the cool, jazzy music works well with the anime\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters so much. They are so different from most other anime characters which are bold with no intentions at all. Basically they all have a reason for acting the way they do. This doesn't seem  to be a anime with character development but it still does.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9 and I enjoyed this very much. Please give this underrated anime a try!",

            "content": "This is an anime that was FULL of potential. I started it without many expectations, but the first two or three episodes managed to raise them, and make me think of this as the possible gem of the season. \r\nFrom summaries and reviews, one might be thinking Tanaka-kun defies mainstream narrative clich\u00e9s, and that the overall product tends towards a certain general calm feeling.\r\nThe truth is: Tanaka-kun had the potential to be that. It had the potential to tell an entertaining, relaxing, non-stereotypical story, while having an upbeat general tone and characters.\r\nThen it became... something else. There were a lot of harem hints, and alot of moe that didn't really add anything of value to the story, and also a lot (A LOT) of unnecessary emphasis on the romantic feelings from one of the characters towards Tanaka.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this suck in general? Not really. If you're watching something from a romantic, moe, or harem genre, then you're expecting this. If you're not, and you've come here looking for some nice gen slice of life, or have been bought over by the first episodes, then you'll feel like me, which can be summed up as: :/\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Tanaka-kun dropped the ball. It could've been something incredibly engaging and somewhat original, but instead it chose to be... basically the same as the 1000 harem, school life anime that came before it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, there ARE some episodes that are funny and entertaining, and some of the characters are GOLDEN (Miyano, Ecchan and Ohta). The art style isn't anything groundbreaking or particularly remarkable, but it accompanies the general atmosphere and feel of the story, and the coloring is really, really nice. The animation is okay most of the time. Just that. Okay. It gets below average, but never above. The sound is one of its best points, to me, since there are moments where really interesting things happen, diegetically. The opening song is really fitting. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is Always Listless is a show I didn\u2019t expect to like a lot. Initially, the show didn\u2019t really click with me because it just felt so dull and boring. The refreshing art was the only redeeming factor I saw. I asked to myself, \u201cHow can a show about a listless individual be of any good?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to see every episode to be just Tanaka lazing around and ramble on how it feels nice to be listless. There must be more to the premise than this. But as a person who upholds the \u201cno dropping\u201d rule, I kept watching if it gets betteror worse. A few episodes later, it ended up shattering my initial impression. I misinterpreted the premise of the show. It\u2019s not about simply promoting listlessness, it\u2019s about how others react to it. The main theme is listlessness and the show does a good job of revolving around that theme well. The show gives us situations that puts Tanaka\u2019s listlessness to the test, and make other characters respond to it with such hilariousness and tact. As the show progressed, it kept introducing other characters that became vital in making the show charming. We start with the tall and reliable Ohta who likes sweet things, the hyper and cute Miyano who looks up to Tanaka as her master, the athletic tomboy Echizen who acts like a deliquent but loves cute things, the charming and responsible Shiraishi who everyone looks up to, and the list goes on. Truly, the strongest point of this show is character interaction and how their different personalities mingle in such a fun and amusing manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe show really blends the comedy and slice-of-life elements well. It borrows conventional school tropes and clich\u00e9s but with the listlessness twist that works really well. The laid-back atmosphere was initially too dull to be relaxing but the charming cast breathes life into it. The comedy is easy-going and relies on character reactions whenever an awkward situation happens. The reactions are not extremely exaggerated like in rapid slapstick comedies, they are timed pretty well and are given ample time for the audience to react as well. For example, the show usually starts its episodes with a short situational skit and when the awkward situation kicks in, the characters involved freezes for a while with their respective reactions. Just because they freeze up, doesn\u2019t mean their surrounding does as well. You can still hear background noises and you can see the surroundings still moving despite the situation. Then about 5 seconds after the freeze, the opening sequence starts. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Tanaka is a double-edged sword, he can either make the show better or worse. The show can\u2019t stand on its own if it only focuses on Tanaka, giving less screen-time or even scrapping the other characters. Tanaka is uninspired and his listlessness delusions are absurd, but that is exactly why he works well when surrounded by a reoccurring cast that deals and reacts to his personality. The show is self-aware that listlessness has its problems but as long as you have someone to help you out then it becomes fine. What if Tanaka grows up to become an adult? Will his listlessness ruin his life? That leaves to another discussion, the show could have expanded on that aspect but that might ruin the show\u2019s lighthearted charm by taking itself too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is fun as a laid-back slice-of-life with a refreshing approach to comedy. Not everyone might find the show appealing due to its listlessness factor, but it\u2019s definitely rewarding to those who just want to watch something relaxing yet hilarious during a chill evening. \\n",

            "content": "We've all felt it at one point during our lives; that lethargy that grips us and doesn't let go, leaving us in a bumbling state where our basic motor functions just don't want to cooperate. The very prospect of moving makes us groan, and every surface suddenly becomes a veritable pillow. Our thoughts drift off into space, and daydreams abound. Whether you're taken in the middle of a class, trying to be productive in an office, or are simply kicking back in the garden with a beverage in hand, a state of listlessness has surely came about at least once. It is the antithesis ofproductivity, yet one can do little in the face of it, for it laughs at those who try to escape its grasp, denying any and all attempts to break free. Once caught, the only course of action is to accept one's fate and go with the flow. But it is that very state of listlessness that serves as the basis for this story, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge (Tanaka-kun is always listless).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is but a simple and modest one. It follows the life of teenage highschooler Tanaka, denoting his attempts at merely existing each day, and his interactions - or lack thereof - with those around him. Not much is ventured here; it is a barebones premise that, most surprisingly, ends up being highly entertaining because it leaves a lot of room for imagination and creativity. At first glance, it might seem somewhat uninteresting - after all, what enjoyment can be derived from a series where the main character can't be bothered to do anything? The answer to this rhetoric is a positive one - despite his unethused self, Tanaka manages to find himself in many a comedic situation brought about by his nature, in no small part thanks to his friends and compatriots. \\n\\n\r\nIt is these very friends - and Tanaka included, of course - that enable this series to stand tall and blast away any doubts one might have about its apparent lacklustre premise. This series is a comedic one, mixing humour with a relaxing air to itself. It is like a constant, slow-burning candle; each episode moves along at its own pace, drawing you in, bringing many a chuckle and smile on the way. Not much happens in each episode, and yet not once does it feel like the 20 allocated minutes are being dragged out. They all centre around the highschool they go to, and so the accompanying events are naturally school-themed, such as participating in the culture festival, or having mishaps with misunderstanding classmates. However, unlike other school-themed comedy series such as Seitokai Yakuindomo or Nichijou, Tanaka-kun does not rely on sexual content and fanservice, or exaggerated ridiculousness. It is mundane to its core, but with a highly positive spin. Cast away your negative connotations of mundane events, because it brings these down-to-earth events to life in a most refreshing manner.\\n\\n\r\nFor our main character Tanaka, listlessness is a perpetuity. For his own reasons, it is a state he cannot fight. It dominates his being, and is reflected in his every manner. He doesn't struggle against it - for that would contradict his very nature - but simply approaches life in the most easy and effortless way possible. Much to his chagrin, however, his days of school life are far from easy and effortless. He alleviates this by relying on his best friend Ohta, a man who can only be described as being the broest bro that ever broed. He is - in an almost literal sense - the backbone for Tanaka. He's there by Tanaka's side to help him through whatever each day throws at Tanaka, to the point where he even physically carries Tanaka to and fro wherever he needs to go. Yet not once does Ohta admonish Tanaka; he merely offers encouragement as he stoically goes about his duties. He's the ideal friend, one who accepts Tanaka for who he is and stays by him nonetheless. His abiltiies are such that even when shopping with Tanaka, Ohta attracts the attention of the ladies, resulting in their cries of \"I want an Ohta too!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic duo aside, there are a handful of other characters who make up the main cast, each filtered into the story episode by episode. Miyano - affectionally dubbed Myaano by her senpai Echizen - is a go-getter who finds herself mesmerised by Tanaka. In an ironically contradictory and humorous manner, she tries her utmost to emulate Tanaka's actions, wanting to be carefree and listless in the same way he is. She's bright, enthusiastic and well-meaning, but also naive, evidenced by her ignorance towards her efforts to be effortless.\\n\r\nThe aforementioned Echizen is a girl from another class, who has a fierce and imposing exterior but is actually a kind maiden at heart; this juxtaposition serves as another point of comedy because she tries to act as a punk but can't truly deny her kind side. One can't help but smile when the terrifying senpai berates Tanaka and Ohta but then goes googly-eyed as she gushes over Myaano, the affectatious nickname she gifted upon Miyano.\\n\r\nShiraishi makes up for the 3rd main supporting character. She's the class-rep, who, unbeknownst to everyone else, has an identity crisis. At school, she's a bishoujo who has top grades, flawless looks and graces everyone else with her presence. Such is her stature that she has a group of followers akin to groupies who dog her around and accost any who would dare converse with their Queen. But when nobody is looking, she cuts loose, tying her hair up, slipping into casual and comfortable clothing and popping her nerdy looking glasses on. She has issues with her self because it's so different to her appearance at school; she isn't vain but merely tries to fit in. She also finds herself enamored with Tanaka, but in a romantic manner, as opposed to Miyano's inspired one.\\n\\n\r\nThese 5 make up for the main cast, and it is their hijinks which are the source of the great entertainment Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge has to offer. They all interact with one another in different ways, bringing their own uniqueness to the table. The persiflage between Echizen and the rest keeps them on their toes; Myaano's adorableness mixes well with her go-getter mindset. Shiraishi finds solace in the group since they accept her for who she really is - even if that itself is based on a highly comedic misunderstanding. All three of them would appear as oil to Tanaka's water on the surface, but they flow together surprisingly well, and Tanaka is better off for them; he does occasionally try and make an effort for their sake.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the art is concerned, it fits very well for the series' tone. The character designs are all fairly simple, without overly much detail to them, yet they still manage to capture each character and their personality, from Tanaka's large eyes which look dull and tired to Echizen's imposing and intimidating features which make her look like someone you shouldn't mess with. They all look distinct, and the colours are all light and cheery. It is a colourful series, one filled with brightness that lifts your spirits. It really shows that you don't need the intricate detail of Berserk or the gorgeous and endearing art that KyoAni is known for in order to bring characters to life. The listlessness of the series is perfectly encapsulated with simple designs and bright colours. I'll also add on a personal note that Shiraishi's design quickly became one of my favourites; there's just something about her that makes her stand out in my mind. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, I can safely say that Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruga is a series that subverted all of my initial expectations. I only picked this up in the first place because I like to watch the vast majority of seasonal anime. I really can't say that I was overly interested in it or had any high hopes for it to be decent. It seemed rather droll at the onset, but I can quite confidently say that this quickly became one of those anime that I was most looking forward to each week. It is a testament to the writing of the series that such an uninteresting premise could end up being so funny. It is entirely a character driven show, and it is those very same characters where this series shines. The cast is varied and all bring something different to the table. This is an anime to be put on after having a bad day, something where you can really relax and have a laugh all the way through. Stress is relieved by the smile that will inexorably find itself on your face.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Out of nowhere, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge appeared and surprised everyone.\r\nYes, it's another school SoL comedy like hundred of others, so, what makes it so good? It's simple, it completely succeeds in what I think is the key aspect for this type of anime: the characters.\r\nIn anime like Tanaka-kun, it's expected to see little to no character development during the whole story, so it's a must to make them likeable and fun to watch, and just from the first episode, with the fantastic interactions between the two protagonists, Tanaka (incredibly lazy, just wants to live calmly and without troubles) and Oota (always taking care ofTanaka, that includes, for example carrying him from one place to another, yes, I'm serious), I was already impressed for how much I enjoyed watching them just doing their everyday life. After that, every episode presented a new character, and this anime never failed in making them fun to watch, memorable, and leaving me with the need to see more of them in the future, and they came back again lots of times, and after every episode I liked and laughed with them more than before.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about said secondary characters is that the anime never forces them to be there, while they befriend Tanaka and Oota, they still have their main group of friends, or another secondary character that prefer to stay with, interacting with the duo protagonist in other moments, while minor, it's a detail that I really like, because they feel a lot more real and less like that this anime forces them to orbit around the protagonist just for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, simple with the characters, but detailed and beautiful in the backgrounds (the school they are in looks so good in special), fits perfectly with the anime and it's overall good to look at.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, both opening and ending are pretty good, while they might not be of my personal taste to become one of my favourites, they do an amazing job in setting the tone of the anime, for the background music, I really like the song that plays most of the time during the episode, the others are quite average, but never fail to correctly set the tone of the moment accordingly to the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's work is fantastic and fits great with the characters, I specially like Kensho Ono's voice for Tanaka, and Natsumi Takamuri for Miyano, they make the voice that I totally would expect from said characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge caught me completely by surprise and ended up being the anime I looked forward the most every week while airing, if you're doubting in starting to watch it, really, just give it a try! If you already did, I'm sure that at this point you will be influenced enough by Tanaka to be too lazy to do anything else but watch more of this anime!",

The characters are adorable and the relationships in the show are just perfect. The thing I like about it most would have to be the timing. That might not make sense. What I mean by that is that there are times when the show just drags a moment out. The first, like, thirty seconds of the show you just watch Tanaka sleep. And Ohta watches him sleep. When there is an awkward silence, you just sit there and feel it.I guess I'm not explaining it well, but it is hilarious. There isn't much of a plot to the show, but the whole time I'm watching it I have a grin on my face. I have now watched it in both dubbed and subbed and love it both ways. The art isn't the best, but the way the eyes and hair are drawn is really cute. I have seen that this isn't the most liked show and lot's of people think it is stupid but I think it is a masterpiece. How can you look at Tanaka's listless face and say, \"I hate you\"? I can't. I love the show. I hope you watch it and agree with me, because I REALLY NEED a second season.",

            "content": "It\u2019s a shame that an anime like Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is getting overshadowed by many so many anime this season, and some of those anime pale in comparison to what Tanaka-kun has to offer. This series is one of the many slice-of-life anime that\u2019s airing this season, but this is the best slice-of-life of the season. It\u2019s relaxing, relatable, and most importantly, fun. With an immensely loveable cast of characters, this series manages to be both sweet and funny. The only flaws in this series is the general flaw a slice-of-life anime brings \u2013 a lack of a main story. Other than that, Tanaka-kunproves that even without a story, as long as you have great characters, you\u2019ll succeed.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of Tanaka-kun is quite simple. Our protagonist, Tanaka, is the most listless character you\u2019ll find. He always dozes off, never wants to do physical work, and always finds the easy way out. And he\u2019s got a friend named Oota that helps him with whatever he needs. Tanaka-kun is about Tanaka and all the characters that surround him and the series focuses on his relationship with other characters. As it already seems apparent, Tanaka-kun is a character heavy anime. There\u2019s no main story (which seems to be a case for most slice-of-life), however, the episodic stories are quite nice. There\u2019s not a single episode in Tanaka-kun where I felt bored like out protagonist. Every episode always has something, and that\u2019s all that matters. The series has moments that seems typical of a school anime, like a cultural festival episode. But all of these moments feel so much fresh due to the characters, especially Tanaka-kun. It\u2019s always fun seeing how a listless character like him would react to situations that require energy. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nTanaka-kun is exactly what a slice-of-life series should be. It needs to be relaxing, but not boring, exciting, but no overly energetic, and focused, but not precise. Its episodic stories of different situations Tanaka-kun has to go through is what makes this series so good. It\u2019s not story-driven like most anime, nor is it atmospheric-driven like many slice-of-life, but its character-driven. None of the characters feel lacking, at that\u2019s vital for a character driven anime. And the comedy it great in the series. It\u2019s subtler than most comedies, and that\u2019s perfect for a series like this. For example, Tanaka would abruptly enter a room and enter an awkward situation. There will be several seconds of silence with both characters making no movement. Then Tanaka, without a word, would walk away, only to make the moment feel awkward than it originally was. That\u2019s the comedy in Tanaka-kun. It may not be over-the-top enough for some people, but Tanaka-kun was never out to appeal to a large audience in the first place. It sure as hell isn\u2019t doing that right now, but hopefully they will in the future. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about Tanaka-kun is its characters. They ended up being so good that they were my favorite cast of characters for this season. Every character is unique from one other, each having some clich\u00e9 characteristics, but those characteristics are used as a foundation. The characters evolve to be something more. And when the characters interact with one another, that\u2019s when the series shines. Our protagonist, Tanaka, is a breath of fresh air, even for the slice-of-life genre. Very rarely does an anime decide to have an apathetic and listless main character, as it\u2019s easy to make your character forgettable, boring, and worst of all, irritating. But Tanaka-kun is never irritating. Instead he is extremely likable and ever relatable. Some of his insight are interesting and they make sense. He\u2019s not Hikigaya Hachiman, but he\u2019s a relatable guy. Our deuteragonist, Oota is everyone\u2019s dream best friend. He\u2019s perfect and he\u2019s always there for Tanaka. His loyalty is what makes him fun and the fact that his appearance and his personality is a mismatch, it makes many comedic situations funny. Then you have a large cast of supporting characters like Miyano, the short and overly excited girl who considers Tanaka to be a role model for her, Echizen, a short-tempered character that I should hate, but I can\u2019t due to how fun she is, and Shiraishi, the school role model who sees Tanaka as a hero. All of these characters ended up to be loveable in some way or another, and they\u2019re the primary reason why this anime is so good. \\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Tanaka-kun is simplistic, but quite good. The backgrounds look gorgeous in the series. Inside buildings there\u2019s so many well detailing. For example, during the cultural festival, the wide shots of the inside of the school looks beautiful. The amount of decorations and how all of them had similar detailing, regardless of depth, shows how dedicated the studio was. And some of the lighting is absolutely well done. The scenery outside looks good, and the sunsets look amazing. The anime uses lighter, more vivid colors, and it works with the series. And the character designs look great too. The designs represent how energetic they are and some character designs make great contrast, for example, Tanaka and Miyano. Overall, the art just adds to the relax factor of this anime.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations in Tanaka-kun are very well too. Though, there isn\u2019t a single moment in the series where the animation quality feels heavily demanding, just like most slice-of-life anime. But Tanaka-kun does whatever they do splendidly. The character movements are fluid and the overall animation quality is consistent. And during the more comedic moments, the simplified animation quality adds to the humor pretty well. The animation complements its art well. However, backgrounds aren\u2019t normally animated too much but it\u2019s nothing too bad. The addition of animation for background characters makes the series feel more alive, which makes a nice contrast between the background and Tanaka-kun. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe cast of seiyuu in Tanaka-kun is a mixture of well-known seiyuu and not so well-known seiyuu. Though all of them do a good job in capturing their character\u2019s personalities. Ono Kensho does an amazing job as Tanaka. The way he talks, with a lot of murmuring, adds to Tanaka\u2019s listlessness. He does the tones properly. Even when Tanaka gets hurt, his voice level would increase (which is normal for any human being), but not by much. Hosoya Yoshimasa does a very good job as Oota. He manages to make his character have a strong, mature voice and it well contrasts his character with other characters (same goes for his height and how that makes a contrast too). Takamori Natsumi did a very good job as Miyano and made the character feel as energetic as possible. Suwa Ayaka did a good job as Echizen, as she did both her irritated and joyful voice properly, without any of them lacking emotions. Koiwai Kotori does a really good job as Shiraishi as she got the calm aspect of her done right, but also during her \u201cshocked\u201d moments, she manages to makes her character sound funny enough. And you have some more well-known seiyuu playing a character, such as Yuuki Aoi (who sounds just like every other of her characters) and Touyama Nao, whom all do a good job. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Tanaka-kun is quite good too, however it doesn\u2019t appear much. Most of the series relies on a lack of background music and silence to add to the relaxing part of this series. A lack of background music during some scenes adds to the feel of some parts. And how the series cuts off some music is great too. For example, if a sudden awkward situation happens, the music would suddenly stop, and that would add to the humor. But the background music of the series is quite good. The OP, \u201cUtatane Sunshine\u201d, is quite unique as I\u2019ve rarely here an OP that heavily relies on vocals instead of background music. The music is comprised of just simplistic guitar sounds and nothing more. But the vocals are nice and it matches the relaxing feel of the anime. The ED, \u201cBON-BON\u201d is really fun to listen to. Unlike the OP that matches the listlessness of Tanaka, the ED makes a contrast with him due to the upbeat music of the opening. The ED was used to match Tanaka\u2019s surroundings instead of Tanaka. And the ED itself is pretty good. \\n\r\nMusic: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI enjoyed Tanaka-kun a lot more than Tanaka enjoying life. Slice-of-life anime need to be very unique in order for me to enjoy it and luckily this series does that. Just by the protagonist itself, the series manages to separate itself from other slice-of life anime. The characters are fantastic and entertaining, the comedy almost always works and never gets repetitive, and the atmosphere of the anime is so soothing and nice. The series leaves me wanting more, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tanaka-kun feels incomplete. It\u2019s just that I want to see the characters more and hopefully it gets a second season. At least there\u2019s a manga for me to catch up on! \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is an anime that deserves your time. It feels terrible knowing that many are skipping on this anime due to the slice-of-life tag and uninteresting key visuals. But this series is genuinely one of a kind. Rarely do you get characters this well done. Not a single character feels weak or out-of-place. And Tanaka is such an entertaining and relatable protagonist. And Tanaka-kun\u2019s comedic situations almost always makes me laugh. And there\u2019s not a single dull episode in the series as the series manages to be consistently good. Hopefully you give the Tanaka-kun an opportunity because it\u2019s more than just about a lazy protagonist. It\u2019s about all of the characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n+ Relaxing and soothing atmosphere with great comedic moments\\n\r\n+ Fantastic and unique characters that all complement each other, including a great protagonist \\n\r\n+ Consistently good in quality as every episode delivers\\n\r\n+ Art is, at times, beautiful to watch and the art style matches the series.\\n\r\n- Lack of a main story may be off-putting for some\\n\r\n- Sometimes the pacing can get a little too slow\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10",

            "content": "I really liked it at first, but the more I watch it, the more that the laziness of the MC gets on my nerves. To the point where I can guess why \"he doesn't want to do something\", or \"avoids certain situations\" because \"effort\", something he has none of.  I know that people really like this show and I could see why, but for me, as a person who loves slice of life more than any other genre, which is odd considering this is exactly that, just can't enjoy it anymore. \r\nThe art and sound? I don't even care about sound, I'll give itthe same as art I guess, but the art is good, simple and peaceful, all the characters look very cute and innocent. And I like how the layout and style of the school is different and unique so thats nice. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the characters (some), mainly the side characters, if Tanaka wasn't even in the show, I would definitely enjoy it much more, though it wouldn't be as unique, it would be less annoying. I can think of other SoL anime with better lazy or \"laid back\" characters. (ahem Lucky Star's Konata, Ore Monogatari's Suna, Wagnaria's Yamada for laziness is much funnier IMO, and then the king of not wanting to get involved and much cooler is the 8man.)\\n\\n\r\nI'm still thinking of whether to pick it back up, especially if it means meeting the little sisters, but at the moment, every episode seems like a montage of \"I dont feel like doing these normal things\" and pure laziness, which isn't for me. I've talked with others about it, most don't agree and like this show, I'm not sure why but i don't really care tbh. I hope that most don't agree actually, it will be nice to see someone with a different opinion on it I suppose, and this is all how I honestly feel about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Possible spoilers] there's some hinted romance at some points and it feels very rushed and lazy in my opinion, in fact one of them gets teased and pretty much shown to the point of me and others thinking it was actually happening and then forgotten about and thrown out the window at one point, which is mainly why I dropped it.",

            "content": "*yawns*  \r\nTL:DR:  This is a good series.  Watch it.  \r\nFor those of you who want to know as to why I say what I said above, here's the long version that probably took far too much time and energy to write, for a great series that only has a lack of energy.\r\nStory: Tanaka-kun lives a life of listlessness.  Due to his body being essentially non-functional in the way of physical activity, Tanaka's life revolves around sleeping in class, enjoying the quiet part of life, and having his buddy Ohta carry him over his shoulder because Tanaka just simply is unableto move himself sometimes on account of his lifestyle.  That's...pretty much it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main plotline of the story is simply put \"Tanaka doing things while other people invade his listless life.\"  As simple as the story looks, Tanaka-kun is a slice of life anime that is just a breath of fresh air.  While the show uses your generic highschool setting complete with a generally uneventful run of things that happen each episode, what sets this series apart from virtually every other school-related slice of life anime is its tone, or rather, its lack of energy.  Like its title character, the show feels very laid-back and casual, rolling with its own pace and doing its own thing to convey the show's unique feel.  \\n\\n\r\nTo emphasis the point of listlessness even further, the show's usage of comedy is a more roll off the tongue style of comedy where the jokes just come and go.  They never put any exaggeration to any part of the series where something funny or outlandish happens and makes the whole of the series just very relaxed and pleasant.  The show never puts one part of the series above another and everything is essentially put on this flat plane that while seems boring, just works.  \\n\\n\r\nCombining that with the seemingly endless amount of events that Tanaka is forced into, and Tanaka-kun shows itself to be a one-of-a-kind slice of life comedy that shines without really trying to shine.  Its laid-back feeling causes the story to feel a lot more unique and pleasant while at the same time, not making the show either boring nor slow.  My only real complaint for the series is the fact that it ended, because given the fact that the show was based off of a 4-koma series, the possibilities for what could be written are more or less endless.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique and well-executed tone for the series\\n\r\n+ Comedy fits and rolls well with the series\\n\r\n-  The show ended (And yes, this is a downside)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in Tanaka-kun vary not in terms of character traits, but in terms of energy.  Due to the fact that Tanaka is the character with the lowest amount of energy in the series, his other cast members fill up the other levels and help give the show its unique dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the main character for this series, Tanaka.  Tanaka is a pretty straightforward character.  Perpetually running on 'Power-saving' mode, Tanaka's policy in life is to live the listless life and to never put energy into anything he does because doing so would only be a hassle.  This includes arguing with people, eating, paying attention in class, and even walking.  Tanaka is really just the catalyst for events in the series.  As the show goes along, he comes into contact with various people that are either influenced by his listlessness, or change because of his sometimes profound statements.  But aside from that, there really isn't anything really that deep about his character.  But despite his simple characteristics, Tanaka doesn't really come with any flaws due to the series being about this boy in particular and his lifestyle that just lacks any form of energy.  So as such, he doesn't really have many shortcomings aside from being simple like the rest of his cast members.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Ohta, Tanaka's best friend and virtually his caretaker.  Ohta is the guy who's a teddy bear despite having a very scary looking exterior.  As well as being a connoisseur of sweets, Ohta serves as both Tanaka's guide when it comes to Tanaka attempting to do certain things, as well as functioning as his personal taxi, very often picking up his sleeping friend and slinging him over his shoulder or holding him under his arm because Tanaka is either sleeping or just doesn't have the energy to keep himself up, which happens quite often in the series.  Mostly acting as the straight man to Tanaka's oddly sporadic thinking process, the two create most of the series's dynamics as it is rare to see one without the other on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast feature various characters that slowly get introduced as the series goes along.  There's the tiny but energetic Miyano who sees Tanaka as her teacher for listlessness, Shirashi, the popular yet extremely modest girl, Echizen, the so-called 'delinquent' character, the two guy characters that never really get time dedicated to them (or I just never bothered to learn their names), our main characters' little sisters, and the Wcdonald worker who we still don't have a name for.  (Sad face)  The cast for this anime isn't really all that large and the side characters, like the main ones, are around the same level of complexity in terms of how many characteristics they have.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think really makes these characters shine is the fact that every single one of them is simple, yet despite that characteristic that all of them share, all of these characters just bounce wonderfully off each other and none of them are generic character tropes, or at the very least, they don't really feel like that.  They all fit with the tone of the show and due to the show being largely character-based, all play some part in the series and only help to bring the show's unique tone to life.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique yet simple characters\\n\r\n+ All characters play some part in the series one way or another\\n\r\n+ Character dynamics\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art for Tanaka-kun is just like the rest of the series, simple.  The general look of the series has a rather muted color scheme that doesn't explode out color but has a gentle and light shade to it that reflects the rest of the show's rather lazy tone.  Likewise, the character designs and backgrounds for the series shares this same look.  The characters are simple in design but have this very inviting and happy look to them.  The show does have quite a number of girls that fall into the 'cute girl' look of design, so if you don't like moe, this is something to watch out for.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the comedic artstyles for the series aren't all that exaggerated if any.  Most of the comedy just uses face changes to simulate certain expressions or an extra shade of dark color to show that they're displeased.  There're no exaggerated backgrounds, no stings in music, relying more on chibification or other forms of subtle comedic styles in order to give us their funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Muted yet light color scheme \\n\r\n+ Simple yet quality characters designs\\n\r\n+ Subtle yet effective comedic stylings\\n\r\n+/- Moe artstyle (Depends on your outlook on moe)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The tracks that we have for Tanaka-kun are Utatane Sunshine by Unlimited Tone, and Bon-Bon by Coorie, aka the OP and ED for the series respectively.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, Utatane Sunshine is the most fitting kind of song that this series could've ever hoped to ask for for an opening song.  The song is this slow band music that very heavily utilizes the piano to evoke the tones of lightheartedness with a moderate beat to give off this wonderfully happy and pleasant feel that completely reflects the series's somewhat eventful but mostly uneventful storyline.  It is by far the best track that the series has in its OST and is also its most memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED, Bon-Bon is...more or less the show's inverse.  It's very sprightly and energetic with some casual tones to it.  To me, while the song is rather unique with its very dotty and bouncing tone, doesn't really fit the series all too much.  Perhaps it's a dedication to the other, more enthusiastic characters in the series, but to me, it doesn't really fit the show as well as its OP does.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I have to mention for the series is its background music.  For the most part, background music goes unnoticed simply because there's nothing really all that special about it half the time, but this is a special case.  The majority of the background music is a group of just simple piano tracks that bring even more lightheartedness to the mood.  They're subtle yet effective, and I just thought that they brought more to the series and deserved mention.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple, beautiful, and fitting OST\\n\r\n-  ED didn't fit as well as the other tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Since you're all probably as tired as Tanaka is reading this review, I'll just cut to the chase.  I love this series.  I really do.  It's unique, it's fun, and I had a blast watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  There is virtually nothing about this series that I hate.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nNothing.  I can't find any downsides to this series.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  This show is a breath of fresh air for slice of life shows.  While it doesn't have the kind of merit that would deserve a 10/10 despite the show having virtually no flaws in its execution and overall quality, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is one of those extremely unique slice of life shows that delivers on its promise and is overall just a really relaxing and fun show to watch.",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is the first anime Ive finished where I was actually genuinely surprised at the rating upon finishing the show. \r\nThe show's premise is simple: The main character is lazy. That's it. That is where all the gags, all the humor, and the entire anime is focused on. Every episode is predictable to the point where the show becomes boring rather than entertaining- and the only reason I kept watching was for the supporting characters. Contrary to the main character- the supporting characters were interesting to watch on screen and they were believable as real highschool characters. \r\nWhile yes all the memes about \"lol Tanakais my spirit animal xD\" Or \"Wow this show is totes me_irl\" can appeal to a certain demographic- it will not appeal to everyone and certainly doesn't appeal to me. There is no variety in the episodic nature of this show with the exception of the introductions for new characters. The show that most closely resembles this show from this current season is Sakamoto- but unlike Sakamoto this show fails to go \"all-out\" in a sense. The jokes have the same quality and Tanaka's laziness never goes to an extremity or anything. Its just the same old same old. Every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I will never understand the appeal of a generic boring show like this one- I will say that there appears to be a pattern in recent anime. The visuals of this show are absolutely outstanding and out of this world- perhaps the prettiest show I have seen in a long long time. We saw last season a show with an absolutely abysmal story- Grimgar- rise in popularity essentially due to its unique watercolor art design. Similarly- Tanaka lacks in any story or character progression with its one dimensional characters and nonexistent plot. Each episode is the same as the previous and I don't think I'll ever find a more \"average\" anime in my lifetime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you run out of melatonin just watch an episode of this show. It'll put you right to sleep. And I don't mean it in a good way.",

Of course, said proclivity is taken to the extreme; Tanaka wants only to be left alone to nap. 24/7 if possible. The rest of the class had to accept this and nobody thinks it is weird when the muscular Ohta, Tanaka's best friend and enabler, carries his listless corpse to class (or even back home).\r\n\tSo far the premise seems mildly interesting at best  and that is the reason I almost skipped thatone. Thankfully, the terrible shows of this season forced me to give more chances than I usually do. After watching just first episode I was hooked; the calm pace was relaxing and the jokes plenty.\\n\\n\r\n\tOur main duo is supported by a cast of quirky female characters who, albeit with common roles, manage to deliver cuteness and laughs. This store has everything; Tsundere, genki-girl, faker girl, and, not only one, but two imoutos! There are also two boys that always appear together, but their screen-time amounts a total of around 5', so I won't bother with them.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show takes a page from its protagonist's book, and has the episodes delivered in a peaceful way; the conflicts/misunderstandings are neither severe nor too dumb, there is no crude slapstick, and everything follows a serene path. There are two things that are over the top though; The lengths that Tanaka will go in order to avoid action (as you probably guessed, he will go to counterproductive lengths), and the amount of dutiful effort that Ohta will spend just to cater to Tanaka's wishes of idleness.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf at this point of the review, the show still appears to you as generic and not worth your while, I will not begrudge you. This show is an example of how a talented writer can take genre conventions and elevate them to a level that the last dozen shows you watched convinced you that does not exist any more. Clearly the season's second best show (sorry Jojo). 8.0/10.",

It is nice that the \"romance\" did not sprout, so to speak. A change in pace. The art is very calming colours, and the side bits transitional are funny. However, it needs more development on the side characters.\r\nThe tidbits of classical piano at the beginning of episodes is a warm welcome. Deducted points due to the character develop. \r\nA side remark: I never heard the word \"listless\" to describe a lazy person, haha\r\nJust tonote, there is close to no plot. So if it does not attract or relate after Episode 1 or 2, simply drop it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Well, of course, the inappropriate curiosity all boys have is present in me, but not enough so that it's worth the effort to act upon it.\"\r\n- Tanaka\r\nA simple, sweet, and refreshing comedy,with a straight-forward and simple plot line.It is a series that follows Tanaka listless adventures (or should I say nonadventures, really, I mean tanaka was like:\"I don't want to be the main character of my own life.\") with his amusing ensemble of adorable and lively friends.\r\nThere are no twists and turns with dramatic climaxes or anticipating cliff-hangers that make you pull out all your hair. None of those. It is a pretty calm animewith a lot of hilarious,\u201dLOLs\u201d and facepalm moments.\\n\\n\r\n It is a very character-driven anime, and the characters have unique personality quirks which make their interactions really fun to watch.Especially the bond between the main characters Tanaka and Oota (the friend that we all need in our life lol); the main duo is the score and the backbone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was the cutest. I mean simple art style which follows closely to the style of the manga. They use bright and soft colors which really compliments the tone of the anime. The backgrounds, as well, are really pretty and well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, like the series, was very charming. There\u2019s a cheerful piano piece that\u2019s used pretty often in the background. Its scales, while simple, match the lighthearted tone of this school/comedy/slice-of-life series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part were the voice actors chosen as they portrayed the characters really well. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: \\n\r\n-Story: 10/10\\n\r\n-Art: 10/10 (A huge thumbs up for the studio on that.)\\n\r\n-Sound: 10/10 (The OP and ED was pretty calming, they fit the anime\u2019s atmosphere)\\n\r\n-Character: 10/10 ( All were funny and cute)\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 10/10 (I had such a blast watching it)\\n\r\n-Overall: 10/10 (it was a light and funny anime, great to watch when you want to rewind or have a chill day.)\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me....\"Yawn\" I'm going to sleep so don't try wake me up.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI\u2019ve been sick lately.\r\nA too private and too embarrassing medical issue has kept me down. Headache. Sore all over. Low energy. I\u2019ll most likely talk about it in-depth in the future, but, for now, I will simply say that I am not at 100%.\r\nKnow what has helped? Sleeping. The other day I slept for fifteen hours. I did have a bizarre dream where any action I took compelled me to take a similar yet opposite action. (It was weird.) Other than that, though, my knockout was bliss. For my body and my mind.\r\nTanaka-kun wa ItsumoKedaruge is like a really nice sleep session: wholly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSome people are concerned about after-school activities, and others are worried about life\u2019s obstacles. Tanaka of Tanaka-kun does not fret over such matters. Instead, he does his best to live without concerns and without worries. Unfortunately for this listless wonder, his friends and everyday events have a different mindset entirely.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun uses a cool technique throughout the season that gets at what the anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when a joke is cracked or the scene switches to a new setting, the anime lingers ever-so-slightly longer than normal. It\u2019s most noticeable when Tanaka or one of the other characters has a reaction. His or her look of disbelief or wonder stays on-screen a smidgen more than usual.\\n\\n\r\nA great example is in episode three. Myaano and Echizen just had a fight. Tanaka walks by while Echizen is still posed, reaching her hand out. Tanaka stops and looks at Echizen, but he doesn\u2019t just do so quickly. Instead, he stares for about five seconds before continuing on (and consequently getting reeled in by Echizen).\\n\\n\r\nIt adds to the comedy, but, more than this, it highlights the show\u2019s awareness of its main listless theme. In other words, the show\u2019s content, like Tanaka himself, is slightly lethargic in delivering its material.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does that content contain? Well, more listlessness. A surprising amount at that. Here\u2019s just a few examples.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode five, Tanaka is so listless that he cannot take home anything that is heavy or perishable because he may not make it back in time.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode eight, Tanaka\u2019s name is spelled wrong on the title card (Nakata), but he doesn\u2019t really mind, saying it\u2019s fine either way.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode eleven, Tanaka does not want to exert energy for the haunted-house project, so, in order to mask his presence, he turns invisible.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does have other types of jokes, too.\\n\\n\r\nMoments like Tanaka holding onto the Earth after a discussion about English\u2019s widespread appeal allow for imaginative scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have their own brand of comedy: Myaano acts silly when she thinks the world has been overtaken by android mascots, Rino gets beyond envious that Ohta is \u201cstealing\u201d her beloved brother, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEven the in-between scenes. From Ohta dressed up as mom to do some supplies shopping to Myaano shooting around the screen as a bullet, these quicker jokes are silly while still retaining the charm of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the listlessness and the comedy, Tanaka-kun also loves its cuteness. Shirashi champions this notion. Her moments, like when she is incredibly happy when Tanaka praises her in her yukata or when she is giddy to be using the same umbrella as him, are simple. But it\u2019s their simplicity that makes them so cute.\\n\\n\r\nEchizen and Myaano are cute too. Echizen misunderstanding Tanaka\u2019s surname suggestion and Myaano radiating confidence and happiness during her introduction are a couple of the ways in which the girls get cute right.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun does not strive for any grander ideals. Nothing on the effects of listlessness or what being active provides. In other words, it\u2019s (expectedly) not a serious show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in a way, that continues to fit with the anime\u2019s motif. It has no desire to do anything else besides what it is already doing \u2013 something that Tanaka would agree with wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does try. The final episode in particular pushes the idea that putting off effort does not mean one has failed, for life is long and filled with many chances at success. But because the message comes so late and without any other backing, and the show even goes so far as to make Shiraishi\u2019s efforts seem futile, it\u2019s a weak sentiment at best.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, as a slice-of-life story, Tanaka-kun nails its theme, its comedy, and its cuteness. So, while its narrative does not have that much weight, its other parts more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTo maximize its listless motif, Tanaka-kun includes a lot of nuances in its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nTake its artistry.\\n\\n\r\nRather than using loud colors, it uses calm colors to relax the audience. Lots of light yellows, tinted greens, and soft pinks create a relaxing atmosphere that suit the show well.\\n\\n\r\nSmaller details, such as sunset lighting and background-snail-like objects, also continue with the relaxation in their own, sometimes avant-garde manner.\\n\\n\r\nYet the best is something that\u2019s technically not there at all.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the locales are vacant, free of obstructions. The best example is the school. It looks quite fancy with its wooden floors and high windows. But its most distinguishing feature is its large, open main hallway where the students often walk in and the camera regularly shows.\\n\\n\r\nBy reducing the claustrophobia, Tanaka-kun further adds to its relaxed feeling. And this detail can be found in many other areas: the school\u2019s rooftop, the city streets they walk on, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, while not as involved as the artistry, are not without their own strengths.\\n\\n\r\nThey wear reserved colors: more pinks and yellows with a helping of white. Their designs are also playful: Ohta is tall, Myaano is short, Tanaka and his sister Rino are twins, Echizen is a tomboy with catlike eyes, and Shiraishi has both the beautiful and the uncaring looks down pat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it remains high in quality. A lot of the animated segments rely on more comical art, like reaction faces and exaggerated responses, so movement becomes easier to see. Of course, it has its downtime with the usual eye and hair movements that never look out of place. Interestingly, even when animation isn\u2019t going on, it fits the show. After all, listlessness is the name of the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the visuals are a sweet snack that never overstuff and always relax the audience.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTanaka, as one would expect, is not the most interesting of characters. That\u2019s not bad \u2013 because it\u2019s by design.\\n\\n\r\nHis call to fame is listlessness. So, he is, by nature, just sort of there. He\u2019s the one that (directly or indirectly) causes the various situations, sure, but he is very rarely an active participant. Indeed, he\u2019d rather sleep the day away than tend to any labor of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say he is not fun. Tanaka losing his listlessness because he was making too many funny faces is no doubt funny. But, most of the time, Tanaka just-so-happens to be in the area. As a result, the anime emphasizes the rest of its cast. Namely, Ohta, Myaano, Echizen, Shiraishi, and Rino.\\n\\n\r\nOhta is as cool a friend as any guy could have. A bro among bros. He can often be found carrying Tanaka at hip level with one arm. Caring for him when he needs help, looking out for him when he needs direction. He listens to Tanaka and takes time understanding him, too. Ohta is simply a really good guy \u2013 despite his ruffian persona.\\n\\n\r\nMyaano is the cute little ball of energy. She pines for maturity, wishing to fight back against her size to become a woman that others could see as dignified and refined. She\u2019s loud and hyper, making her utter contrast with Tanaka a riot to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEchizen is tough. She gets in others\u2019 faces, and she does not like to be looked down on. But beneath her rough exterior lays a girl who cares about cute things, longs for romance, and likes to help out her friends.\\n\\n\r\nShirashi is known as the school beauty. Yet, before her high-school days, she was more of a recluse, sitting at home and keeping to herself. Come the new year came a new Shiraishi. Which in turn brought her more troubles than she could have anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, they are all interesting. But when one considers their relationships with Tanaka, they become that much more fun.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka not-quite-jokingly sees Ohta as someone he could spend the rest of his life with. In his words, they\u2019re \u201csteady like an old couple.\u201d In other words, they are so close and so compatible that it\u2019s as if they are together.\\n\\n\r\nMyaano treats Tanaka as her leader, as the person that will catapult her into maturity. As such, she\u2019s constantly asking for advice and doing whatever she can to emulate her \u201cMaster.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEchizen misreads Tanaka constantly. First, she thinks he\u2019s some tough dude, then she thinks he\u2019s seeking her hand in marriage. And, given that Myaano looks up to him, she can usually be found, too, making sure that Tanaka is treating her small and cute friend well.\\n\\n\r\nShiraishi obviously is in love with Tanaka. After he was the only one that still recognized her while she wore her unkempt look, she fell for the listless boy. So, she can often be found trying to get closer to him or at least thinking about him in a romantic, heartfelt manner.\\n\\n\r\nRino technically has the closest connection, for she is Tanaka\u2019s younger sister. But she wants more; she has a thing for her brother. Crafting personal chocolates for him and enjoying the fact that she got to go on a \u201cdate\u201d with him at a fast-food restaurant are just a couple of her infatuated examples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show also connects its cast between the others. Echizen dotes on Myaano. Rino despises Ohta. Myaano knows Shiraishi\u2019s romantic feelings.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun\u2019s most clever character setup, however, is one that\u2019s not around for very long, but it\u2019s oh so hysterical.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody knows that Ohta looks after Tanaka. But, as it turns out, Tanaka\u2019s sister looks after Ohta\u2019s sister, Saya. Saya is extremely shy and has a hard time speaking loudly in front of others, so Rino repeats Saya\u2019s words for her. There\u2019s also how Tanaka and Rino look nearly identical, but Ohta and Saya do not. And, of course, Rino hates Ohta, but Saya sees Tanaka in a favorable light.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels between the characters are not as clever as this set here, but, given how each of their personalities survive on their own, and they are further amplified by Tanaka\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d personality, the cast comes out on top as a more than fun and equally sweet cast.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the best part of Tanaka-kun\u2019s sound is a sound-effect.\\n\\n\r\nIn many instances, like when Myaano is confident or when Tanaka seems sure of himself, a small glinting noise, accompanied by a tiny star, will play. It\u2019s a small, silly sound, but it\u2019s strangely fun to hear. A smile-inducing twinkle.\\n\\n\r\nNext would have to be the soundtrack. Its woodwind arrangements, classical pieces, and general slowness, per usual, contribute well to the listlessness and calmness that defines the show. The pieces themselves are light and fun \u2013 suitable as well for the slice-of-life style.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting performances are strong, too. Yoshimasa Hosoya as Ohta used a leveled way of speaking that demonstrated calm and understanding. Kotori Koiwai as Shiraishi spoke in a soft yet mature manner. And Natsumi Takamori as Myaano fit the energetic, high-spirited girl well.\\n\\n\r\n(A small shout-out goes to Nao Touyama as Saya. Her introduction, where she whispers and the anime puts her speaking voice down several decibels, made for a cute and fun joke.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd not to be forgotten are the opening and ending tracks. The opening track goes for that listless feel. The soft singing, the acoustic guitar, and the meandering pace could not fit Tanaka-kun any better. The ED, by comparison to both the OP and the anime, goes the contrasting route. It\u2019s a faster, more poppy piece. The \u201cbon bon\u201d lyrics, the myriad of sounds, and the ending background singers make the song fun to do a little jig to. (At least, when nobody is looking.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people were telling me to pick this one up after I initially didn\u2019t. I pushed back because I did not want even more anime to review, thereby putting me farther behind schedule. (I can\u2019t be too much further behind already but still.)\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the season, I\u2019m glad that they persuaded me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sold it for me is the characters. Tanaka threatening the gods if he does not have an uneventful day. Ohta being such a cool bro, dealing with Tanaka\u2019s laziness. Myaano making everything that much more cheerful. Echizen adding in a bit of roughness here and there. Shiraishi acting so gosh darn cute. Rino refusing to accept Ohta.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself laughing throughout each episode, having a blast at the creative takes on listlessness and the duo calmness and silliness. I had a ton of fun \u2013 which is something that I cannot say about many of the shows from Spring 2016.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do have a gripe with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s romance is adorable thanks to Shiraishi. Her joy and happiness at being with or around Tanaka made me joyful and happy in return.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t was Tanaka\u2019s perspective. When walking under the umbrella, he\u2019s more concerned about his shoulder getting wet. Or when he thinks about what having a girlfriend caused, he says, out loud, that it\u2019s probably better for him to never have one.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just that the romance did not happen. That would have been okay since the possibility would still exist. It\u2019s when the show goes so far as to tell me straight out that it may not ever happen that makes me sad to hear.\\n\\n\r\nYea, Tanaka\u2019s (maybe) joking around. And, yea, it fits his listless personality to a tee. But, as a romance buff through and through, I cannot lie and say I approved of the anime\u2019s decision.\\n\\n\r\n(Similar musings can be had for Ohta and Echizen\u2019s \u201cromance\u201d; there were one too many almost-romance happenings for my liking. No matter how funny they were.)\\n\\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s only one grip among a thoroughly entertaining experience. One that I hope gets a continuation sometime down the line.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge takes listlessness to heart and delivers a strong slice-of-life outing. Its content is filled with comedy and cuteness. Its art is often clever and beautiful. And its soft music supports its fun characters. Altogether, a cure for any sick day.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, takes advantage of its listlessness, using comedy, cuteness, and a simplistic narrative to deliver a feel-good time\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, smart artistic direction, nice backgrounds, good character designs, and nice actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Tanaka\u2019s listlessness emphasizes the rest of the cast, allowing them and him to shine\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, good VA performances, and an awesome little twinkling sound-effect\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, while the \u201cromance\u201d was disappointing, the sheer amount of laughs had is undeniable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge starts off as a really charming, relaxing but a little bit disappointing anime.  I really enjoyed most of the jokes presented in early episodes but sadly the anime starts falling on the same clich\u00e9s as a lot of slice of life animes.  \r\nOne thing I really loved about this anime was the art and animation: it was lovely and relaxing.  None o the characters seem poorly drawn or generic, and you'll probably like them in the end.\r\nMusic is really cute and always goes according to the situation.  The ending song is also one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I really enjoyed watching everyone of them.  Oota is probably my favorite characters, since he acts very mature and is always taking care of Tanaka.  Most of the characters are likeable and their personalities shine a lot.  They don't seem to take most of the things seriously and that's pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy some of the last episodes of this series, since they included pool episodes, another fireworks episodes and a whole drama about Tanaka having a girlfriend.  Most of this things feel very clich\u00e9 and I would rather watch more situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are looking for a great slice of life anime with loving characters, Tanaka-kun wa itsumo kedaruge is for you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's a particular type of anime apart from the usual hustle and bustle of RomComs that I like. And that's slice of life. A genre I got introduced to when I first started watching anime. While watching Tanaka-kun wa Itsume Kedaruge, those nostalgic feelings came back, and I enjoyed this anime in a way I hadn't before with any other animes. In one word, I'd call Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge 'sweet'.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nEven while being a slice of life, the anime sweetly introduces it's plot in a very slow and easy going way, although it was done so to introduce our lazy MC, it also denotedhow beautifully and sweetly the pace flows in slice of life anime. It opens slowly, flows slowly and ends gracefully. Such a calm demeanor of a plot could deserve a 10 easily, if only the plot was a bit more tightened. Otherwise, Tanaka kun had a wonderful and unique story that most slice of life watchers would get a sugar rush out of due to it's sweet nature.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. It fit perfectly with the slice of life genre and accentuated the comedy too. The character design was another thing to mush over. If I was asked to describe it in one word, I'd call it cute!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA slice of life should be soft, so the sound track too has to be soft. And frankly speaking, I've already run out of cute words to describe this anime. The adorable OP was very memorable and nostalgic at the same time, even though the ED wasn't memorable as much the OP more than made up for it. The VAs did a brilliant job of portraying the characters, they fit in perfectly, especially the three MCs, namely our title character, Ohta and Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and slice of life are always at odds. And so if you wanted or expected character development from this or any slice of life anime, you won't be satisfied as that's not the purpose of this anime. Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge's purpose is to introduce the daily life of the characters so character development will be minor or won't even exist. I rated the characters out of their personalities instead of development as this is a slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nTanaka: Our MC, Tanaka is an extremely lazy person, so lazy that he can go to extreme lengths just to relax later on. Even though he's quite lazy, that doesn't stop the fact that he's considerate of his friends and can even beat himself up for one too. Unlike most other MCs who're dense brats, Tanaka isn't. What sets him apart is that he isn't interested in such relationships just because it wastes his energy. He has quite a funny and sweet way of going about daily issues too, which further boosts his appeal to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOhta: Tanaka's close friend and 'wife' (watch to understand why he's called that), Ohta is the opposite of Tanaka in the sense that he's dependable, arguably active and takes care of Tanaka's *every* need. But fortunately his character isn't sacrificed, he has his own opinions and thoughts as well and instead of supporting the comedy, leads it at times. A feature seen in few 2nd MCs (as in the second character). Ohta is a sweet person too who like sweets and always tries to help Ohta. So the female community might be appealed by his kind and generous personality. \\n\\n\r\nShiraishi: Arguably the only non MC who gets the most screentime, Shiraishi develops a little too, she learns to stay true to herself and her embarrassed and shy nature (to some extent) is also a refreshing aspect to slice of life (which nowadays are bombarded with Tsunderes, though I'm not complaining). She finds it difficult to cope with her feelings due to her double persona (watch to understand what I mean) and her struggle is notably seen in the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I loved Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge. It's sweet nature triggers the sweet side inside of us and teaches us to enjoy life as it is. That's a lesson I enjoyed learning. The comedy also delivered extraordinarily. If you've read my previous reviews you'd notice how few anime actually make me laugh and I'll confidently tell you I was laughing at almost every comedy scene. Which shows that this show is actually really good at comedy as it is fresh and original while also using the characters in a unique way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've already said the word sweet so many times so I'll try not to say it now. Overall, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge was a sweet (dangit, I lost already) and cute anime that could be the slice of life of the year in my opinion. Anyone who wants something sweet (again...) can and will find satisfaction in watching this anime. Slice of Life lovers will most likely praise this as I did. One of the best slice of life anime out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Shiraishi is best girl <3",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is what I'd consider an example in the comedy SoL genre, the standard of which all entries since should be held up to. Many people are highly critical of this genre for its highly formulaic, uninspired and overall samey nature, but I do believe that Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge strikes as an example that it can differ from this, and when it does, it is an excellent piece of comedy.\r\nIf you stumble upon Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge for the first time, it probably looks rather mediocre, and something not really worth your time, but I think it truly does mark anexcellent piece of comedy anime. The anime is about the titular Tanaka and his extreme laziness, so much so that he struggles with basic activities such as doing basic schoolwork, ordering fast food, etc. He is accompanied by Ohta, a tall, hard-working friend whose main role is to (often literally) carry Tanaka around so that he can get by in his day to day life. The humour found between these exchanges is top-notch, albeit humour is subjective and all. I'd also like to note the fact that the character Echizen (childhood friend of Ohta; tomboy and delinquent) is one of the few examples of a good tsundere in anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nI have one gripe with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, and one only, and that is the character of Shiraishi (seito kaichou who tries to create a facade of a 'perfect' girl, but is broken when Tanaka and Ohta find her dressed undesirably, but she maintains as the two agree to keep it a secret), whose character is fairly standard and one I'm not a great deal bothered by - my grievance is the fact that, in typical anime fashion, falls in love with Tanaka for no reason, and this just doesn't fit the standard \"just a solid comedy anime, not of that harem shit\" that it usually follows, but this sees little prevalence, so I'm willing to forego it (I'm never too fond of romance arcs that don't actually amount to anything but I consider it forgiveable)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is a solid anime, a shining example of how to properly write a comedy SoL and I hope to see more in its vein in the future.\\n\r\n8/10",

However, due to my business i cannot watch it until it is Match 2018. After i watched the anime, now i know why my friend really rushed me to watch this - This anime really describes what \"Slice Of Life\" means.\r\nOther than the point i mentioned before (slow-paced), this anime will give you the feel of being so tranquil and peace. From the BGM to thecharacters itself, they deliver conflicts in without having to make any audio or visual riots like panic BGM or Flashing screens. Instead, they use silence for it, especially the awkward scenes - you get the climax, your hands itch knowing you can only watch and cannot involve yourself directly in the anime, and you get all the excitement guessing what is going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed without any nonsense like traps or sexually attractive imouto - I don't like animes including that even though it is a Slice of Life. The character promised in the title \"Tanaka-kun is Always Listless\" is just perfectly... lazy as promised, i know it is odd to feel super excited caused by this character. I won't spoil much, but the character types in this anime is just so various, and worked harmonically with the listless Tanaka. Tsundere and imouto are included.\\n\\n\r\nThis will be one of Slice of Life animes i will never forget, but this never beats Nichijou. Unlike Nichijou, i didn't hope any more season from this anime since the ending is already perfect, pretty hanging but making any extensions would make the ending in this first season weird.",

            "content": "The slice of life anime from spring 2016 'Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless' was well-known for its cuteness and lax comedy. When I finally got around to see the first episode, I was excited because of its comedy. It was unique and something I hadn't seen before. Summer 2016 anime started, and I couldn't finish 'Tanaka-kun'. But I got around to it finally! And I'm so happy I watched it. \r\nTANAKA IN THE RAIN PICTURE\r\nIt was so funny that Tanaka tried so hard to be lazy. This was ironic because trying is the polar opposite of being lazy. Tanaka was a walking contradiction. He continued tobe funny with his efforts. Every episode had another challenge for him to conquer. Whether it was a girl clamoring to be his apprentice or a cultural festival. Tanaka's reactions to these challenges really made the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime was funny. Laugh out loud funny. There were moments where I couldn't help but laugh out loud. This anime had small jokes. Most of these were simple. But they made me laugh. Overall, this was a good comedy anime. Solid.\\n\\n\r\nSHIRAISHI PICTURE\\n\\n\r\nRomance has never been my thing. Even though I watch and read a lot of shoujo, I've never chosen romance over a good action scene. Unless it's a badly animated action scene, then sure. But this anime forced Shiraishi's unrequited love onto you. There was no reason for her to like Tanaka. I don't know what she sees in him.\\n\r\nWhat I do like about this is the fact that it IS unrequited. She has no chance with him. And that's how life is. We have crushes and may never get mutual feelings. And that's okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was fine. It wasn't the best. It feels like there should be a second season, but there isn't the demand. It's a cute anime. But they should have wrapped it up better. Maybe Tanaka finally getting a peaceful sleep? Well, that might be boring. I don't know. SOMETHING. It felt very uneventful. Nothing happened really. I didn't get any closure.",

Tanaka kun wa itsumo kedaruge is the first slice of life anime that I watched, and I can say that this anime tuned my interest to the slice of life genre. Ah, what a theme, what a animation, beautifully molded characters, it's just awesome. This anime is and will always be my favorite (Please there be second season to this magnum opus.).\r\nAfter only Tanaka kun, I turned towards school life anime. Introverts characters are always my idols (Tanaka being the king, followed by Oreki Houtarou). His laziness, dealing with various daily life situations, despite his laziness he's someone's crush (I'mso envious of him), ah the Shiraishi san (My first anime crush), brother sister relationship, these all small things makes the show very enjoyable. I salute to the author for giving this anime to us. Maybe I am exaggerating, but I loved the anime from bottom of my soul. I re-watched it 2 to 3 times and still it's charisma and charm is unchanged for me. I highly recommend this anime to the people who are introverts simultaneously wants to be with some friends. This anime tells us that without any superpower one can be a superhero (with listlessness obviously!).\\n\r\nApart from main story, the Opening and ending are truly Soul Soothing musics. There's one music clip in first episode, I don't know what it is (the words are like Langhesan  Lange-san), oh my god what a beautiful symphony! Awesomeness is overloaded here. (love you CooRie!) \\n\r\nI hardly write any review for anime, but I couldn't  stop myself writing this review. No words to describe this anime. Love you Tanaka kun wa itsumo kedaruge!",

It seemed like an anime with no presence and no one would've cared about it.\r\nI was wrong.\r\nThe anime is actually really good overall and people started noticing it because it was actually good. I feel this is really underrated because of the unusual synopsis and such.\r\nThe story is about Tanaka and his friends around him, basically like the usual high school girl with the conflicts with the outside connections between the main MCs. This is the lowest point because, it is extraordinary in a way but the plot didn't really getto me. The story is cute though so it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe art backgrounds were very beautiful in my opinion. Character designs were unique in a way. I really liked the art for Tanaka-kun for some reason, what a relaxing sight.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also well made. I don't understand Japanese, but the upbeat tune with the cool, jazzy music works well with the anime\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters so much.

I started it without many expectations, but the first two or three episodes managed to raise them, and make me think of this as the possible gem of the season. \r\nFrom summaries and reviews, one might be thinking Tanaka-kun defies mainstream narrative clich\u00e9s, and that the overall product tends towards a certain general calm feeling.\r\nThe truth is: Tanaka-kun had the potential to be that. It had the potential to tell an entertaining, relaxing, non-stereotypical story, while having an upbeat general tone and characters.\r\nThen it became... something else. There were a lot of harem hints, and alot of moe that didn't really add anything of value to the story, and also a lot (A LOT) of unnecessary emphasis on the romantic feelings from one of the characters towards Tanaka.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this suck in general? Not really. If you're watching something from a romantic, moe, or harem genre, then you're expecting this. If you're not, and you've come here looking for some nice gen slice of life, or have been bought over by the first episodes, then you'll feel like me, which can be summed up as: :/\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Tanaka-kun dropped the ball. It could've been something incredibly engaging and somewhat original, but instead it chose to be... basically the same as the 1000 harem, school life anime that came before it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, there ARE some episodes that are funny and entertaining, and some of the characters are GOLDEN (Miyano, Ecchan and Ohta). The art style isn't anything groundbreaking or particularly remarkable, but it accompanies the general atmosphere and feel of the story, and the coloring is really, really nice. The animation is okay most of the time. Just that. Okay. It gets below average, but never above. The sound is one of its best points, to me, since there are moments where really interesting things happen, diegetically. The opening song is really fitting. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is Always Listless is a show I didn\u2019t expect to like a lot. Initially, the show didn\u2019t really click with me because it just felt so dull and boring. The refreshing art was the only redeeming factor I saw. I asked to myself, \u201cHow can a show about a listless individual be of any good?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to see every episode to be just Tanaka lazing around and ramble on how it feels nice to be listless. There must be more to the premise than this. But as a person who upholds the \u201cno dropping\u201d rule, I kept watching if it gets betteror worse. A few episodes later, it ended up shattering my initial impression. I misinterpreted the premise of the show. It\u2019s not about simply promoting listlessness, it\u2019s about how others react to it. The main theme is listlessness and the show does a good job of revolving around that theme well. The show gives us situations that puts Tanaka\u2019s listlessness to the test, and make other characters respond to it with such hilariousness and tact. As the show progressed, it kept introducing other characters that became vital in making the show charming. We start with the tall and reliable Ohta who likes sweet things, the hyper and cute Miyano who looks up to Tanaka as her master, the athletic tomboy Echizen who acts like a deliquent but loves cute things, the charming and responsible Shiraishi who everyone looks up to, and the list goes on. Truly, the strongest point of this show is character interaction and how their different personalities mingle in such a fun and amusing manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe show really blends the comedy and slice-of-life elements well. It borrows conventional school tropes and clich\u00e9s but with the listlessness twist that works really well. The laid-back atmosphere was initially too dull to be relaxing but the charming cast breathes life into it. The comedy is easy-going and relies on character reactions whenever an awkward situation happens. The reactions are not extremely exaggerated like in rapid slapstick comedies, they are timed pretty well and are given ample time for the audience to react as well. For example, the show usually starts its episodes with a short situational skit and when the awkward situation kicks in, the characters involved freezes for a while with their respective reactions. Just because they freeze up, doesn\u2019t mean their surrounding does as well. You can still hear background noises and you can see the surroundings still moving despite the situation. Then about 5 seconds after the freeze, the opening sequence starts. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Tanaka is a double-edged sword, he can either make the show better or worse. The show can\u2019t stand on its own if it only focuses on Tanaka, giving less screen-time or even scrapping the other characters. Tanaka is uninspired and his listlessness delusions are absurd, but that is exactly why he works well when surrounded by a reoccurring cast that deals and reacts to his personality. The show is self-aware that listlessness has its problems but as long as you have someone to help you out then it becomes fine. What if Tanaka grows up to become an adult? Will his listlessness ruin his life? That leaves to another discussion, the show could have expanded on that aspect but that might ruin the show\u2019s lighthearted charm by taking itself too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is fun as a laid-back slice-of-life with a refreshing approach to comedy. Not everyone might find the show appealing due to its listlessness factor, but it\u2019s definitely rewarding to those who just want to watch something relaxing yet hilarious during a chill evening. \\n",

            "content": "We've all felt it at one point during our lives; that lethargy that grips us and doesn't let go, leaving us in a bumbling state where our basic motor functions just don't want to cooperate. The very prospect of moving makes us groan, and every surface suddenly becomes a veritable pillow. Our thoughts drift off into space, and daydreams abound. Whether you're taken in the middle of a class, trying to be productive in an office, or are simply kicking back in the garden with a beverage in hand, a state of listlessness has surely came about at least once. It is the antithesis ofproductivity, yet one can do little in the face of it, for it laughs at those who try to escape its grasp, denying any and all attempts to break free. Once caught, the only course of action is to accept one's fate and go with the flow. But it is that very state of listlessness that serves as the basis for this story, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge (Tanaka-kun is always listless).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is but a simple and modest one. It follows the life of teenage highschooler Tanaka, denoting his attempts at merely existing each day, and his interactions - or lack thereof - with those around him. Not much is ventured here; it is a barebones premise that, most surprisingly, ends up being highly entertaining because it leaves a lot of room for imagination and creativity. At first glance, it might seem somewhat uninteresting - after all, what enjoyment can be derived from a series where the main character can't be bothered to do anything? The answer to this rhetoric is a positive one - despite his unethused self, Tanaka manages to find himself in many a comedic situation brought about by his nature, in no small part thanks to his friends and compatriots. \\n\\n\r\nIt is these very friends - and Tanaka included, of course - that enable this series to stand tall and blast away any doubts one might have about its apparent lacklustre premise. This series is a comedic one, mixing humour with a relaxing air to itself. It is like a constant, slow-burning candle; each episode moves along at its own pace, drawing you in, bringing many a chuckle and smile on the way. Not much happens in each episode, and yet not once does it feel like the 20 allocated minutes are being dragged out. They all centre around the highschool they go to, and so the accompanying events are naturally school-themed, such as participating in the culture festival, or having mishaps with misunderstanding classmates. However, unlike other school-themed comedy series such as Seitokai Yakuindomo or Nichijou, Tanaka-kun does not rely on sexual content and fanservice, or exaggerated ridiculousness. It is mundane to its core, but with a highly positive spin. Cast away your negative connotations of mundane events, because it brings these down-to-earth events to life in a most refreshing manner.\\n\\n\r\nFor our main character Tanaka, listlessness is a perpetuity. For his own reasons, it is a state he cannot fight. It dominates his being, and is reflected in his every manner. He doesn't struggle against it - for that would contradict his very nature - but simply approaches life in the most easy and effortless way possible. Much to his chagrin, however, his days of school life are far from easy and effortless. He alleviates this by relying on his best friend Ohta, a man who can only be described as being the broest bro that ever broed. He is - in an almost literal sense - the backbone for Tanaka. He's there by Tanaka's side to help him through whatever each day throws at Tanaka, to the point where he even physically carries Tanaka to and fro wherever he needs to go. Yet not once does Ohta admonish Tanaka; he merely offers encouragement as he stoically goes about his duties. He's the ideal friend, one who accepts Tanaka for who he is and stays by him nonetheless. His abiltiies are such that even when shopping with Tanaka, Ohta attracts the attention of the ladies, resulting in their cries of \"I want an Ohta too!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic duo aside, there are a handful of other characters who make up the main cast, each filtered into the story episode by episode. Miyano - affectionally dubbed Myaano by her senpai Echizen - is a go-getter who finds herself mesmerised by Tanaka. In an ironically contradictory and humorous manner, she tries her utmost to emulate Tanaka's actions, wanting to be carefree and listless in the same way he is. She's bright, enthusiastic and well-meaning, but also naive, evidenced by her ignorance towards her efforts to be effortless.\\n\r\nThe aforementioned Echizen is a girl from another class, who has a fierce and imposing exterior but is actually a kind maiden at heart; this juxtaposition serves as another point of comedy because she tries to act as a punk but can't truly deny her kind side. One can't help but smile when the terrifying senpai berates Tanaka and Ohta but then goes googly-eyed as she gushes over Myaano, the affectatious nickname she gifted upon Miyano.\\n\r\nShiraishi makes up for the 3rd main supporting character. She's the class-rep, who, unbeknownst to everyone else, has an identity crisis. At school, she's a bishoujo who has top grades, flawless looks and graces everyone else with her presence. Such is her stature that she has a group of followers akin to groupies who dog her around and accost any who would dare converse with their Queen. But when nobody is looking, she cuts loose, tying her hair up, slipping into casual and comfortable clothing and popping her nerdy looking glasses on. She has issues with her self because it's so different to her appearance at school; she isn't vain but merely tries to fit in. She also finds herself enamored with Tanaka, but in a romantic manner, as opposed to Miyano's inspired one.\\n\\n\r\nThese 5 make up for the main cast, and it is their hijinks which are the source of the great entertainment Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge has to offer. They all interact with one another in different ways, bringing their own uniqueness to the table. The persiflage between Echizen and the rest keeps them on their toes; Myaano's adorableness mixes well with her go-getter mindset. Shiraishi finds solace in the group since they accept her for who she really is - even if that itself is based on a highly comedic misunderstanding. All three of them would appear as oil to Tanaka's water on the surface, but they flow together surprisingly well, and Tanaka is better off for them; he does occasionally try and make an effort for their sake.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the art is concerned, it fits very well for the series' tone. The character designs are all fairly simple, without overly much detail to them, yet they still manage to capture each character and their personality, from Tanaka's large eyes which look dull and tired to Echizen's imposing and intimidating features which make her look like someone you shouldn't mess with. They all look distinct, and the colours are all light and cheery. It is a colourful series, one filled with brightness that lifts your spirits. It really shows that you don't need the intricate detail of Berserk or the gorgeous and endearing art that KyoAni is known for in order to bring characters to life. The listlessness of the series is perfectly encapsulated with simple designs and bright colours. I'll also add on a personal note that Shiraishi's design quickly became one of my favourites; there's just something about her that makes her stand out in my mind. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, I can safely say that Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruga is a series that subverted all of my initial expectations. I only picked this up in the first place because I like to watch the vast majority of seasonal anime. I really can't say that I was overly interested in it or had any high hopes for it to be decent. It seemed rather droll at the onset, but I can quite confidently say that this quickly became one of those anime that I was most looking forward to each week. It is a testament to the writing of the series that such an uninteresting premise could end up being so funny. It is entirely a character driven show, and it is those very same characters where this series shines. The cast is varied and all bring something different to the table. This is an anime to be put on after having a bad day, something where you can really relax and have a laugh all the way through. Stress is relieved by the smile that will inexorably find itself on your face.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Out of nowhere, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge appeared and surprised everyone.\r\nYes, it's another school SoL comedy like hundred of others, so, what makes it so good? It's simple, it completely succeeds in what I think is the key aspect for this type of anime: the characters.\r\nIn anime like Tanaka-kun, it's expected to see little to no character development during the whole story, so it's a must to make them likeable and fun to watch, and just from the first episode, with the fantastic interactions between the two protagonists, Tanaka (incredibly lazy, just wants to live calmly and without troubles) and Oota (always taking care ofTanaka, that includes, for example carrying him from one place to another, yes, I'm serious), I was already impressed for how much I enjoyed watching them just doing their everyday life. After that, every episode presented a new character, and this anime never failed in making them fun to watch, memorable, and leaving me with the need to see more of them in the future, and they came back again lots of times, and after every episode I liked and laughed with them more than before.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about said secondary characters is that the anime never forces them to be there, while they befriend Tanaka and Oota, they still have their main group of friends, or another secondary character that prefer to stay with, interacting with the duo protagonist in other moments, while minor, it's a detail that I really like, because they feel a lot more real and less like that this anime forces them to orbit around the protagonist just for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, simple with the characters, but detailed and beautiful in the backgrounds (the school they are in looks so good in special), fits perfectly with the anime and it's overall good to look at.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, both opening and ending are pretty good, while they might not be of my personal taste to become one of my favourites, they do an amazing job in setting the tone of the anime, for the background music, I really like the song that plays most of the time during the episode, the others are quite average, but never fail to correctly set the tone of the moment accordingly to the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's work is fantastic and fits great with the characters, I specially like Kensho Ono's voice for Tanaka, and Natsumi Takamuri for Miyano, they make the voice that I totally would expect from said characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge caught me completely by surprise and ended up being the anime I looked forward the most every week while airing, if you're doubting in starting to watch it, really, just give it a try! If you already did, I'm sure that at this point you will be influenced enough by Tanaka to be too lazy to do anything else but watch more of this anime!",

The characters are adorable and the relationships in the show are just perfect. The thing I like about it most would have to be the timing. That might not make sense. What I mean by that is that there are times when the show just drags a moment out. The first, like, thirty seconds of the show you just watch Tanaka sleep. And Ohta watches him sleep. When there is an awkward silence, you just sit there and feel it.I guess I'm not explaining it well, but it is hilarious. There isn't much of a plot to the show, but the whole time I'm watching it I have a grin on my face. I have now watched it in both dubbed and subbed and love it both ways. The art isn't the best, but the way the eyes and hair are drawn is really cute. I have seen that this isn't the most liked show and lot's of people think it is stupid but I think it is a masterpiece. How can you look at Tanaka's listless face and say, \"I hate you\"? I can't. I love the show. I hope you watch it and agree with me, because I REALLY NEED a second season.",

            "content": "It\u2019s a shame that an anime like Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is getting overshadowed by many so many anime this season, and some of those anime pale in comparison to what Tanaka-kun has to offer. This series is one of the many slice-of-life anime that\u2019s airing this season, but this is the best slice-of-life of the season. It\u2019s relaxing, relatable, and most importantly, fun. With an immensely loveable cast of characters, this series manages to be both sweet and funny. The only flaws in this series is the general flaw a slice-of-life anime brings \u2013 a lack of a main story. Other than that, Tanaka-kunproves that even without a story, as long as you have great characters, you\u2019ll succeed.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of Tanaka-kun is quite simple. Our protagonist, Tanaka, is the most listless character you\u2019ll find. He always dozes off, never wants to do physical work, and always finds the easy way out. And he\u2019s got a friend named Oota that helps him with whatever he needs. Tanaka-kun is about Tanaka and all the characters that surround him and the series focuses on his relationship with other characters. As it already seems apparent, Tanaka-kun is a character heavy anime. There\u2019s no main story (which seems to be a case for most slice-of-life), however, the episodic stories are quite nice. There\u2019s not a single episode in Tanaka-kun where I felt bored like out protagonist. Every episode always has something, and that\u2019s all that matters. The series has moments that seems typical of a school anime, like a cultural festival episode. But all of these moments feel so much fresh due to the characters, especially Tanaka-kun. It\u2019s always fun seeing how a listless character like him would react to situations that require energy. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nTanaka-kun is exactly what a slice-of-life series should be. It needs to be relaxing, but not boring, exciting, but no overly energetic, and focused, but not precise. Its episodic stories of different situations Tanaka-kun has to go through is what makes this series so good. It\u2019s not story-driven like most anime, nor is it atmospheric-driven like many slice-of-life, but its character-driven. None of the characters feel lacking, at that\u2019s vital for a character driven anime. And the comedy it great in the series. It\u2019s subtler than most comedies, and that\u2019s perfect for a series like this. For example, Tanaka would abruptly enter a room and enter an awkward situation. There will be several seconds of silence with both characters making no movement. Then Tanaka, without a word, would walk away, only to make the moment feel awkward than it originally was. That\u2019s the comedy in Tanaka-kun. It may not be over-the-top enough for some people, but Tanaka-kun was never out to appeal to a large audience in the first place. It sure as hell isn\u2019t doing that right now, but hopefully they will in the future. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about Tanaka-kun is its characters. They ended up being so good that they were my favorite cast of characters for this season. Every character is unique from one other, each having some clich\u00e9 characteristics, but those characteristics are used as a foundation. The characters evolve to be something more. And when the characters interact with one another, that\u2019s when the series shines. Our protagonist, Tanaka, is a breath of fresh air, even for the slice-of-life genre. Very rarely does an anime decide to have an apathetic and listless main character, as it\u2019s easy to make your character forgettable, boring, and worst of all, irritating. But Tanaka-kun is never irritating. Instead he is extremely likable and ever relatable. Some of his insight are interesting and they make sense. He\u2019s not Hikigaya Hachiman, but he\u2019s a relatable guy. Our deuteragonist, Oota is everyone\u2019s dream best friend. He\u2019s perfect and he\u2019s always there for Tanaka. His loyalty is what makes him fun and the fact that his appearance and his personality is a mismatch, it makes many comedic situations funny. Then you have a large cast of supporting characters like Miyano, the short and overly excited girl who considers Tanaka to be a role model for her, Echizen, a short-tempered character that I should hate, but I can\u2019t due to how fun she is, and Shiraishi, the school role model who sees Tanaka as a hero. All of these characters ended up to be loveable in some way or another, and they\u2019re the primary reason why this anime is so good. \\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Tanaka-kun is simplistic, but quite good. The backgrounds look gorgeous in the series. Inside buildings there\u2019s so many well detailing. For example, during the cultural festival, the wide shots of the inside of the school looks beautiful. The amount of decorations and how all of them had similar detailing, regardless of depth, shows how dedicated the studio was. And some of the lighting is absolutely well done. The scenery outside looks good, and the sunsets look amazing. The anime uses lighter, more vivid colors, and it works with the series. And the character designs look great too. The designs represent how energetic they are and some character designs make great contrast, for example, Tanaka and Miyano. Overall, the art just adds to the relax factor of this anime.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations in Tanaka-kun are very well too. Though, there isn\u2019t a single moment in the series where the animation quality feels heavily demanding, just like most slice-of-life anime. But Tanaka-kun does whatever they do splendidly. The character movements are fluid and the overall animation quality is consistent. And during the more comedic moments, the simplified animation quality adds to the humor pretty well. The animation complements its art well. However, backgrounds aren\u2019t normally animated too much but it\u2019s nothing too bad. The addition of animation for background characters makes the series feel more alive, which makes a nice contrast between the background and Tanaka-kun. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe cast of seiyuu in Tanaka-kun is a mixture of well-known seiyuu and not so well-known seiyuu. Though all of them do a good job in capturing their character\u2019s personalities. Ono Kensho does an amazing job as Tanaka. The way he talks, with a lot of murmuring, adds to Tanaka\u2019s listlessness. He does the tones properly. Even when Tanaka gets hurt, his voice level would increase (which is normal for any human being), but not by much. Hosoya Yoshimasa does a very good job as Oota. He manages to make his character have a strong, mature voice and it well contrasts his character with other characters (same goes for his height and how that makes a contrast too). Takamori Natsumi did a very good job as Miyano and made the character feel as energetic as possible. Suwa Ayaka did a good job as Echizen, as she did both her irritated and joyful voice properly, without any of them lacking emotions. Koiwai Kotori does a really good job as Shiraishi as she got the calm aspect of her done right, but also during her \u201cshocked\u201d moments, she manages to makes her character sound funny enough. And you have some more well-known seiyuu playing a character, such as Yuuki Aoi (who sounds just like every other of her characters) and Touyama Nao, whom all do a good job. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Tanaka-kun is quite good too, however it doesn\u2019t appear much. Most of the series relies on a lack of background music and silence to add to the relaxing part of this series. A lack of background music during some scenes adds to the feel of some parts. And how the series cuts off some music is great too. For example, if a sudden awkward situation happens, the music would suddenly stop, and that would add to the humor. But the background music of the series is quite good. The OP, \u201cUtatane Sunshine\u201d, is quite unique as I\u2019ve rarely here an OP that heavily relies on vocals instead of background music. The music is comprised of just simplistic guitar sounds and nothing more. But the vocals are nice and it matches the relaxing feel of the anime. The ED, \u201cBON-BON\u201d is really fun to listen to. Unlike the OP that matches the listlessness of Tanaka, the ED makes a contrast with him due to the upbeat music of the opening. The ED was used to match Tanaka\u2019s surroundings instead of Tanaka. And the ED itself is pretty good. \\n\r\nMusic: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI enjoyed Tanaka-kun a lot more than Tanaka enjoying life. Slice-of-life anime need to be very unique in order for me to enjoy it and luckily this series does that. Just by the protagonist itself, the series manages to separate itself from other slice-of life anime. The characters are fantastic and entertaining, the comedy almost always works and never gets repetitive, and the atmosphere of the anime is so soothing and nice. The series leaves me wanting more, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tanaka-kun feels incomplete. It\u2019s just that I want to see the characters more and hopefully it gets a second season. At least there\u2019s a manga for me to catch up on! \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is an anime that deserves your time. It feels terrible knowing that many are skipping on this anime due to the slice-of-life tag and uninteresting key visuals. But this series is genuinely one of a kind. Rarely do you get characters this well done. Not a single character feels weak or out-of-place. And Tanaka is such an entertaining and relatable protagonist. And Tanaka-kun\u2019s comedic situations almost always makes me laugh. And there\u2019s not a single dull episode in the series as the series manages to be consistently good. Hopefully you give the Tanaka-kun an opportunity because it\u2019s more than just about a lazy protagonist. It\u2019s about all of the characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n+ Relaxing and soothing atmosphere with great comedic moments\\n\r\n+ Fantastic and unique characters that all complement each other, including a great protagonist \\n\r\n+ Consistently good in quality as every episode delivers\\n\r\n+ Art is, at times, beautiful to watch and the art style matches the series.\\n\r\n- Lack of a main story may be off-putting for some\\n\r\n- Sometimes the pacing can get a little too slow\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10",

            "content": "I really liked it at first, but the more I watch it, the more that the laziness of the MC gets on my nerves. To the point where I can guess why \"he doesn't want to do something\", or \"avoids certain situations\" because \"effort\", something he has none of.  I know that people really like this show and I could see why, but for me, as a person who loves slice of life more than any other genre, which is odd considering this is exactly that, just can't enjoy it anymore. \r\nThe art and sound? I don't even care about sound, I'll give itthe same as art I guess, but the art is good, simple and peaceful, all the characters look very cute and innocent. And I like how the layout and style of the school is different and unique so thats nice. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the characters (some), mainly the side characters, if Tanaka wasn't even in the show, I would definitely enjoy it much more, though it wouldn't be as unique, it would be less annoying. I can think of other SoL anime with better lazy or \"laid back\" characters. (ahem Lucky Star's Konata, Ore Monogatari's Suna, Wagnaria's Yamada for laziness is much funnier IMO, and then the king of not wanting to get involved and much cooler is the 8man.)\\n\\n\r\nI'm still thinking of whether to pick it back up, especially if it means meeting the little sisters, but at the moment, every episode seems like a montage of \"I dont feel like doing these normal things\" and pure laziness, which isn't for me. I've talked with others about it, most don't agree and like this show, I'm not sure why but i don't really care tbh. I hope that most don't agree actually, it will be nice to see someone with a different opinion on it I suppose, and this is all how I honestly feel about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Possible spoilers] there's some hinted romance at some points and it feels very rushed and lazy in my opinion, in fact one of them gets teased and pretty much shown to the point of me and others thinking it was actually happening and then forgotten about and thrown out the window at one point, which is mainly why I dropped it.",

            "content": "*yawns*  \r\nTL:DR:  This is a good series.  Watch it.  \r\nFor those of you who want to know as to why I say what I said above, here's the long version that probably took far too much time and energy to write, for a great series that only has a lack of energy.\r\nStory: Tanaka-kun lives a life of listlessness.  Due to his body being essentially non-functional in the way of physical activity, Tanaka's life revolves around sleeping in class, enjoying the quiet part of life, and having his buddy Ohta carry him over his shoulder because Tanaka just simply is unableto move himself sometimes on account of his lifestyle.  That's...pretty much it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main plotline of the story is simply put \"Tanaka doing things while other people invade his listless life.\"  As simple as the story looks, Tanaka-kun is a slice of life anime that is just a breath of fresh air.  While the show uses your generic highschool setting complete with a generally uneventful run of things that happen each episode, what sets this series apart from virtually every other school-related slice of life anime is its tone, or rather, its lack of energy.  Like its title character, the show feels very laid-back and casual, rolling with its own pace and doing its own thing to convey the show's unique feel.  \\n\\n\r\nTo emphasis the point of listlessness even further, the show's usage of comedy is a more roll off the tongue style of comedy where the jokes just come and go.  They never put any exaggeration to any part of the series where something funny or outlandish happens and makes the whole of the series just very relaxed and pleasant.  The show never puts one part of the series above another and everything is essentially put on this flat plane that while seems boring, just works.  \\n\\n\r\nCombining that with the seemingly endless amount of events that Tanaka is forced into, and Tanaka-kun shows itself to be a one-of-a-kind slice of life comedy that shines without really trying to shine.  Its laid-back feeling causes the story to feel a lot more unique and pleasant while at the same time, not making the show either boring nor slow.  My only real complaint for the series is the fact that it ended, because given the fact that the show was based off of a 4-koma series, the possibilities for what could be written are more or less endless.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique and well-executed tone for the series\\n\r\n+ Comedy fits and rolls well with the series\\n\r\n-  The show ended (And yes, this is a downside)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in Tanaka-kun vary not in terms of character traits, but in terms of energy.  Due to the fact that Tanaka is the character with the lowest amount of energy in the series, his other cast members fill up the other levels and help give the show its unique dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the main character for this series, Tanaka.  Tanaka is a pretty straightforward character.  Perpetually running on 'Power-saving' mode, Tanaka's policy in life is to live the listless life and to never put energy into anything he does because doing so would only be a hassle.  This includes arguing with people, eating, paying attention in class, and even walking.  Tanaka is really just the catalyst for events in the series.  As the show goes along, he comes into contact with various people that are either influenced by his listlessness, or change because of his sometimes profound statements.  But aside from that, there really isn't anything really that deep about his character.  But despite his simple characteristics, Tanaka doesn't really come with any flaws due to the series being about this boy in particular and his lifestyle that just lacks any form of energy.  So as such, he doesn't really have many shortcomings aside from being simple like the rest of his cast members.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Ohta, Tanaka's best friend and virtually his caretaker.  Ohta is the guy who's a teddy bear despite having a very scary looking exterior.  As well as being a connoisseur of sweets, Ohta serves as both Tanaka's guide when it comes to Tanaka attempting to do certain things, as well as functioning as his personal taxi, very often picking up his sleeping friend and slinging him over his shoulder or holding him under his arm because Tanaka is either sleeping or just doesn't have the energy to keep himself up, which happens quite often in the series.  Mostly acting as the straight man to Tanaka's oddly sporadic thinking process, the two create most of the series's dynamics as it is rare to see one without the other on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast feature various characters that slowly get introduced as the series goes along.  There's the tiny but energetic Miyano who sees Tanaka as her teacher for listlessness, Shirashi, the popular yet extremely modest girl, Echizen, the so-called 'delinquent' character, the two guy characters that never really get time dedicated to them (or I just never bothered to learn their names), our main characters' little sisters, and the Wcdonald worker who we still don't have a name for.  (Sad face)  The cast for this anime isn't really all that large and the side characters, like the main ones, are around the same level of complexity in terms of how many characteristics they have.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think really makes these characters shine is the fact that every single one of them is simple, yet despite that characteristic that all of them share, all of these characters just bounce wonderfully off each other and none of them are generic character tropes, or at the very least, they don't really feel like that.  They all fit with the tone of the show and due to the show being largely character-based, all play some part in the series and only help to bring the show's unique tone to life.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique yet simple characters\\n\r\n+ All characters play some part in the series one way or another\\n\r\n+ Character dynamics\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art for Tanaka-kun is just like the rest of the series, simple.  The general look of the series has a rather muted color scheme that doesn't explode out color but has a gentle and light shade to it that reflects the rest of the show's rather lazy tone.  Likewise, the character designs and backgrounds for the series shares this same look.  The characters are simple in design but have this very inviting and happy look to them.  The show does have quite a number of girls that fall into the 'cute girl' look of design, so if you don't like moe, this is something to watch out for.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the comedic artstyles for the series aren't all that exaggerated if any.  Most of the comedy just uses face changes to simulate certain expressions or an extra shade of dark color to show that they're displeased.  There're no exaggerated backgrounds, no stings in music, relying more on chibification or other forms of subtle comedic styles in order to give us their funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Muted yet light color scheme \\n\r\n+ Simple yet quality characters designs\\n\r\n+ Subtle yet effective comedic stylings\\n\r\n+/- Moe artstyle (Depends on your outlook on moe)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The tracks that we have for Tanaka-kun are Utatane Sunshine by Unlimited Tone, and Bon-Bon by Coorie, aka the OP and ED for the series respectively.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, Utatane Sunshine is the most fitting kind of song that this series could've ever hoped to ask for for an opening song.  The song is this slow band music that very heavily utilizes the piano to evoke the tones of lightheartedness with a moderate beat to give off this wonderfully happy and pleasant feel that completely reflects the series's somewhat eventful but mostly uneventful storyline.  It is by far the best track that the series has in its OST and is also its most memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED, Bon-Bon is...more or less the show's inverse.  It's very sprightly and energetic with some casual tones to it.  To me, while the song is rather unique with its very dotty and bouncing tone, doesn't really fit the series all too much.  Perhaps it's a dedication to the other, more enthusiastic characters in the series, but to me, it doesn't really fit the show as well as its OP does.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I have to mention for the series is its background music.  For the most part, background music goes unnoticed simply because there's nothing really all that special about it half the time, but this is a special case.  The majority of the background music is a group of just simple piano tracks that bring even more lightheartedness to the mood.  They're subtle yet effective, and I just thought that they brought more to the series and deserved mention.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple, beautiful, and fitting OST\\n\r\n-  ED didn't fit as well as the other tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Since you're all probably as tired as Tanaka is reading this review, I'll just cut to the chase.  I love this series.  I really do.  It's unique, it's fun, and I had a blast watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  There is virtually nothing about this series that I hate.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nNothing.  I can't find any downsides to this series.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  This show is a breath of fresh air for slice of life shows.  While it doesn't have the kind of merit that would deserve a 10/10 despite the show having virtually no flaws in its execution and overall quality, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is one of those extremely unique slice of life shows that delivers on its promise and is overall just a really relaxing and fun show to watch.",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is the first anime Ive finished where I was actually genuinely surprised at the rating upon finishing the show. \r\nThe show's premise is simple: The main character is lazy. That's it. That is where all the gags, all the humor, and the entire anime is focused on. Every episode is predictable to the point where the show becomes boring rather than entertaining- and the only reason I kept watching was for the supporting characters. Contrary to the main character- the supporting characters were interesting to watch on screen and they were believable as real highschool characters. \r\nWhile yes all the memes about \"lol Tanakais my spirit animal xD\" Or \"Wow this show is totes me_irl\" can appeal to a certain demographic- it will not appeal to everyone and certainly doesn't appeal to me. There is no variety in the episodic nature of this show with the exception of the introductions for new characters. The show that most closely resembles this show from this current season is Sakamoto- but unlike Sakamoto this show fails to go \"all-out\" in a sense. The jokes have the same quality and Tanaka's laziness never goes to an extremity or anything. Its just the same old same old. Every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I will never understand the appeal of a generic boring show like this one- I will say that there appears to be a pattern in recent anime. The visuals of this show are absolutely outstanding and out of this world- perhaps the prettiest show I have seen in a long long time. We saw last season a show with an absolutely abysmal story- Grimgar- rise in popularity essentially due to its unique watercolor art design. Similarly- Tanaka lacks in any story or character progression with its one dimensional characters and nonexistent plot. Each episode is the same as the previous and I don't think I'll ever find a more \"average\" anime in my lifetime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you run out of melatonin just watch an episode of this show. It'll put you right to sleep. And I don't mean it in a good way.",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is a high-school, slice of life anime based off an ongoing 2013 manga. Its central theme lie with the titular character's proclivity to laziness. Of course, said proclivity is taken to the extreme; Tanaka wants only to be left alone to nap. 24/7 if possible. The rest of the class had to accept this and nobody thinks it is weird when the muscular Ohta, Tanaka's best friend and enabler, carries his listless corpse to class (or even back home).\r\n\tSo far the premise seems mildly interesting at best  and that is the reason I almost skipped thatone. Thankfully, the terrible shows of this season forced me to give more chances than I usually do. After watching just first episode I was hooked; the calm pace was relaxing and the jokes plenty.\\n\\n\r\n\tOur main duo is supported by a cast of quirky female characters who, albeit with common roles, manage to deliver cuteness and laughs. This store has everything; Tsundere, genki-girl, faker girl, and, not only one, but two imoutos! There are also two boys that always appear together, but their screen-time amounts a total of around 5', so I won't bother with them.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show takes a page from its protagonist's book, and has the episodes delivered in a peaceful way; the conflicts/misunderstandings are neither severe nor too dumb, there is no crude slapstick, and everything follows a serene path. There are two things that are over the top though; The lengths that Tanaka will go in order to avoid action (as you probably guessed, he will go to counterproductive lengths), and the amount of dutiful effort that Ohta will spend just to cater to Tanaka's wishes of idleness.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf at this point of the review, the show still appears to you as generic and not worth your while, I will not begrudge you. This show is an example of how a talented writer can take genre conventions and elevate them to a level that the last dozen shows you watched convinced you that does not exist any more. Clearly the season's second best show (sorry Jojo). 8.0/10.",

            "content": "\"Well, of course, the inappropriate curiosity all boys have is present in me, but not enough so that it's worth the effort to act upon it.\"\r\n- Tanaka\r\nA simple, sweet, and refreshing comedy,with a straight-forward and simple plot line.It is a series that follows Tanaka listless adventures (or should I say nonadventures, really, I mean tanaka was like:\"I don't want to be the main character of my own life.\") with his amusing ensemble of adorable and lively friends.\r\nThere are no twists and turns with dramatic climaxes or anticipating cliff-hangers that make you pull out all your hair. None of those. It is a pretty calm animewith a lot of hilarious,\u201dLOLs\u201d and facepalm moments.\\n\\n\r\n It is a very character-driven anime, and the characters have unique personality quirks which make their interactions really fun to watch.Especially the bond between the main characters Tanaka and Oota (the friend that we all need in our life lol); the main duo is the score and the backbone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was the cutest. I mean simple art style which follows closely to the style of the manga. They use bright and soft colors which really compliments the tone of the anime. The backgrounds, as well, are really pretty and well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, like the series, was very charming. There\u2019s a cheerful piano piece that\u2019s used pretty often in the background. Its scales, while simple, match the lighthearted tone of this school/comedy/slice-of-life series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part were the voice actors chosen as they portrayed the characters really well. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: \\n\r\n-Story: 10/10\\n\r\n-Art: 10/10 (A huge thumbs up for the studio on that.)\\n\r\n-Sound: 10/10 (The OP and ED was pretty calming, they fit the anime\u2019s atmosphere)\\n\r\n-Character: 10/10 ( All were funny and cute)\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 10/10 (I had such a blast watching it)\\n\r\n-Overall: 10/10 (it was a light and funny anime, great to watch when you want to rewind or have a chill day.)\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me....\"Yawn\" I'm going to sleep so don't try wake me up.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI\u2019ve been sick lately.\r\nA too private and too embarrassing medical issue has kept me down. Headache. Sore all over. Low energy. I\u2019ll most likely talk about it in-depth in the future, but, for now, I will simply say that I am not at 100%.\r\nKnow what has helped? Sleeping. The other day I slept for fifteen hours. I did have a bizarre dream where any action I took compelled me to take a similar yet opposite action. (It was weird.) Other than that, though, my knockout was bliss. For my body and my mind.\r\nTanaka-kun wa ItsumoKedaruge is like a really nice sleep session: wholly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSome people are concerned about after-school activities, and others are worried about life\u2019s obstacles. Tanaka of Tanaka-kun does not fret over such matters. Instead, he does his best to live without concerns and without worries. Unfortunately for this listless wonder, his friends and everyday events have a different mindset entirely.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun uses a cool technique throughout the season that gets at what the anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when a joke is cracked or the scene switches to a new setting, the anime lingers ever-so-slightly longer than normal. It\u2019s most noticeable when Tanaka or one of the other characters has a reaction. His or her look of disbelief or wonder stays on-screen a smidgen more than usual.\\n\\n\r\nA great example is in episode three. Myaano and Echizen just had a fight. Tanaka walks by while Echizen is still posed, reaching her hand out. Tanaka stops and looks at Echizen, but he doesn\u2019t just do so quickly. Instead, he stares for about five seconds before continuing on (and consequently getting reeled in by Echizen).\\n\\n\r\nIt adds to the comedy, but, more than this, it highlights the show\u2019s awareness of its main listless theme. In other words, the show\u2019s content, like Tanaka himself, is slightly lethargic in delivering its material.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does that content contain? Well, more listlessness. A surprising amount at that. Here\u2019s just a few examples.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode five, Tanaka is so listless that he cannot take home anything that is heavy or perishable because he may not make it back in time.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode eight, Tanaka\u2019s name is spelled wrong on the title card (Nakata), but he doesn\u2019t really mind, saying it\u2019s fine either way.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode eleven, Tanaka does not want to exert energy for the haunted-house project, so, in order to mask his presence, he turns invisible.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does have other types of jokes, too.\\n\\n\r\nMoments like Tanaka holding onto the Earth after a discussion about English\u2019s widespread appeal allow for imaginative scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have their own brand of comedy: Myaano acts silly when she thinks the world has been overtaken by android mascots, Rino gets beyond envious that Ohta is \u201cstealing\u201d her beloved brother, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEven the in-between scenes. From Ohta dressed up as mom to do some supplies shopping to Myaano shooting around the screen as a bullet, these quicker jokes are silly while still retaining the charm of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the listlessness and the comedy, Tanaka-kun also loves its cuteness. Shirashi champions this notion. Her moments, like when she is incredibly happy when Tanaka praises her in her yukata or when she is giddy to be using the same umbrella as him, are simple. But it\u2019s their simplicity that makes them so cute.\\n\\n\r\nEchizen and Myaano are cute too. Echizen misunderstanding Tanaka\u2019s surname suggestion and Myaano radiating confidence and happiness during her introduction are a couple of the ways in which the girls get cute right.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun does not strive for any grander ideals. Nothing on the effects of listlessness or what being active provides. In other words, it\u2019s (expectedly) not a serious show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in a way, that continues to fit with the anime\u2019s motif. It has no desire to do anything else besides what it is already doing \u2013 something that Tanaka would agree with wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does try. The final episode in particular pushes the idea that putting off effort does not mean one has failed, for life is long and filled with many chances at success. But because the message comes so late and without any other backing, and the show even goes so far as to make Shiraishi\u2019s efforts seem futile, it\u2019s a weak sentiment at best.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, as a slice-of-life story, Tanaka-kun nails its theme, its comedy, and its cuteness. So, while its narrative does not have that much weight, its other parts more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTo maximize its listless motif, Tanaka-kun includes a lot of nuances in its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nTake its artistry.\\n\\n\r\nRather than using loud colors, it uses calm colors to relax the audience. Lots of light yellows, tinted greens, and soft pinks create a relaxing atmosphere that suit the show well.\\n\\n\r\nSmaller details, such as sunset lighting and background-snail-like objects, also continue with the relaxation in their own, sometimes avant-garde manner.\\n\\n\r\nYet the best is something that\u2019s technically not there at all.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the locales are vacant, free of obstructions. The best example is the school. It looks quite fancy with its wooden floors and high windows. But its most distinguishing feature is its large, open main hallway where the students often walk in and the camera regularly shows.\\n\\n\r\nBy reducing the claustrophobia, Tanaka-kun further adds to its relaxed feeling. And this detail can be found in many other areas: the school\u2019s rooftop, the city streets they walk on, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, while not as involved as the artistry, are not without their own strengths.\\n\\n\r\nThey wear reserved colors: more pinks and yellows with a helping of white. Their designs are also playful: Ohta is tall, Myaano is short, Tanaka and his sister Rino are twins, Echizen is a tomboy with catlike eyes, and Shiraishi has both the beautiful and the uncaring looks down pat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it remains high in quality. A lot of the animated segments rely on more comical art, like reaction faces and exaggerated responses, so movement becomes easier to see. Of course, it has its downtime with the usual eye and hair movements that never look out of place. Interestingly, even when animation isn\u2019t going on, it fits the show. After all, listlessness is the name of the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the visuals are a sweet snack that never overstuff and always relax the audience.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTanaka, as one would expect, is not the most interesting of characters. That\u2019s not bad \u2013 because it\u2019s by design.\\n\\n\r\nHis call to fame is listlessness. So, he is, by nature, just sort of there. He\u2019s the one that (directly or indirectly) causes the various situations, sure, but he is very rarely an active participant. Indeed, he\u2019d rather sleep the day away than tend to any labor of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say he is not fun. Tanaka losing his listlessness because he was making too many funny faces is no doubt funny. But, most of the time, Tanaka just-so-happens to be in the area. As a result, the anime emphasizes the rest of its cast. Namely, Ohta, Myaano, Echizen, Shiraishi, and Rino.\\n\\n\r\nOhta is as cool a friend as any guy could have. A bro among bros. He can often be found carrying Tanaka at hip level with one arm. Caring for him when he needs help, looking out for him when he needs direction. He listens to Tanaka and takes time understanding him, too. Ohta is simply a really good guy \u2013 despite his ruffian persona.\\n\\n\r\nMyaano is the cute little ball of energy. She pines for maturity, wishing to fight back against her size to become a woman that others could see as dignified and refined. She\u2019s loud and hyper, making her utter contrast with Tanaka a riot to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEchizen is tough. She gets in others\u2019 faces, and she does not like to be looked down on. But beneath her rough exterior lays a girl who cares about cute things, longs for romance, and likes to help out her friends.\\n\\n\r\nShirashi is known as the school beauty. Yet, before her high-school days, she was more of a recluse, sitting at home and keeping to herself. Come the new year came a new Shiraishi. Which in turn brought her more troubles than she could have anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, they are all interesting. But when one considers their relationships with Tanaka, they become that much more fun.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka not-quite-jokingly sees Ohta as someone he could spend the rest of his life with. In his words, they\u2019re \u201csteady like an old couple.\u201d In other words, they are so close and so compatible that it\u2019s as if they are together.\\n\\n\r\nMyaano treats Tanaka as her leader, as the person that will catapult her into maturity. As such, she\u2019s constantly asking for advice and doing whatever she can to emulate her \u201cMaster.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEchizen misreads Tanaka constantly. First, she thinks he\u2019s some tough dude, then she thinks he\u2019s seeking her hand in marriage. And, given that Myaano looks up to him, she can usually be found, too, making sure that Tanaka is treating her small and cute friend well.\\n\\n\r\nShiraishi obviously is in love with Tanaka. After he was the only one that still recognized her while she wore her unkempt look, she fell for the listless boy. So, she can often be found trying to get closer to him or at least thinking about him in a romantic, heartfelt manner.\\n\\n\r\nRino technically has the closest connection, for she is Tanaka\u2019s younger sister. But she wants more; she has a thing for her brother. Crafting personal chocolates for him and enjoying the fact that she got to go on a \u201cdate\u201d with him at a fast-food restaurant are just a couple of her infatuated examples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show also connects its cast between the others. Echizen dotes on Myaano. Rino despises Ohta. Myaano knows Shiraishi\u2019s romantic feelings.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun\u2019s most clever character setup, however, is one that\u2019s not around for very long, but it\u2019s oh so hysterical.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody knows that Ohta looks after Tanaka. But, as it turns out, Tanaka\u2019s sister looks after Ohta\u2019s sister, Saya. Saya is extremely shy and has a hard time speaking loudly in front of others, so Rino repeats Saya\u2019s words for her. There\u2019s also how Tanaka and Rino look nearly identical, but Ohta and Saya do not. And, of course, Rino hates Ohta, but Saya sees Tanaka in a favorable light.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels between the characters are not as clever as this set here, but, given how each of their personalities survive on their own, and they are further amplified by Tanaka\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d personality, the cast comes out on top as a more than fun and equally sweet cast.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the best part of Tanaka-kun\u2019s sound is a sound-effect.\\n\\n\r\nIn many instances, like when Myaano is confident or when Tanaka seems sure of himself, a small glinting noise, accompanied by a tiny star, will play. It\u2019s a small, silly sound, but it\u2019s strangely fun to hear. A smile-inducing twinkle.\\n\\n\r\nNext would have to be the soundtrack. Its woodwind arrangements, classical pieces, and general slowness, per usual, contribute well to the listlessness and calmness that defines the show. The pieces themselves are light and fun \u2013 suitable as well for the slice-of-life style.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting performances are strong, too. Yoshimasa Hosoya as Ohta used a leveled way of speaking that demonstrated calm and understanding. Kotori Koiwai as Shiraishi spoke in a soft yet mature manner. And Natsumi Takamori as Myaano fit the energetic, high-spirited girl well.\\n\\n\r\n(A small shout-out goes to Nao Touyama as Saya. Her introduction, where she whispers and the anime puts her speaking voice down several decibels, made for a cute and fun joke.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd not to be forgotten are the opening and ending tracks. The opening track goes for that listless feel. The soft singing, the acoustic guitar, and the meandering pace could not fit Tanaka-kun any better. The ED, by comparison to both the OP and the anime, goes the contrasting route. It\u2019s a faster, more poppy piece. The \u201cbon bon\u201d lyrics, the myriad of sounds, and the ending background singers make the song fun to do a little jig to. (At least, when nobody is looking.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people were telling me to pick this one up after I initially didn\u2019t. I pushed back because I did not want even more anime to review, thereby putting me farther behind schedule. (I can\u2019t be too much further behind already but still.)\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the season, I\u2019m glad that they persuaded me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sold it for me is the characters. Tanaka threatening the gods if he does not have an uneventful day. Ohta being such a cool bro, dealing with Tanaka\u2019s laziness. Myaano making everything that much more cheerful. Echizen adding in a bit of roughness here and there. Shiraishi acting so gosh darn cute. Rino refusing to accept Ohta.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself laughing throughout each episode, having a blast at the creative takes on listlessness and the duo calmness and silliness. I had a ton of fun \u2013 which is something that I cannot say about many of the shows from Spring 2016.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do have a gripe with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s romance is adorable thanks to Shiraishi. Her joy and happiness at being with or around Tanaka made me joyful and happy in return.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t was Tanaka\u2019s perspective. When walking under the umbrella, he\u2019s more concerned about his shoulder getting wet. Or when he thinks about what having a girlfriend caused, he says, out loud, that it\u2019s probably better for him to never have one.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just that the romance did not happen. That would have been okay since the possibility would still exist. It\u2019s when the show goes so far as to tell me straight out that it may not ever happen that makes me sad to hear.\\n\\n\r\nYea, Tanaka\u2019s (maybe) joking around. And, yea, it fits his listless personality to a tee. But, as a romance buff through and through, I cannot lie and say I approved of the anime\u2019s decision.\\n\\n\r\n(Similar musings can be had for Ohta and Echizen\u2019s \u201cromance\u201d; there were one too many almost-romance happenings for my liking. No matter how funny they were.)\\n\\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s only one grip among a thoroughly entertaining experience. One that I hope gets a continuation sometime down the line.\\n\\n\r\nTanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge takes listlessness to heart and delivers a strong slice-of-life outing. Its content is filled with comedy and cuteness. Its art is often clever and beautiful. And its soft music supports its fun characters. Altogether, a cure for any sick day.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, takes advantage of its listlessness, using comedy, cuteness, and a simplistic narrative to deliver a feel-good time\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, smart artistic direction, nice backgrounds, good character designs, and nice actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Tanaka\u2019s listlessness emphasizes the rest of the cast, allowing them and him to shine\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, good VA performances, and an awesome little twinkling sound-effect\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, while the \u201cromance\u201d was disappointing, the sheer amount of laughs had is undeniable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge starts off as a really charming, relaxing but a little bit disappointing anime.  I really enjoyed most of the jokes presented in early episodes but sadly the anime starts falling on the same clich\u00e9s as a lot of slice of life animes.  \r\nOne thing I really loved about this anime was the art and animation: it was lovely and relaxing.  None o the characters seem poorly drawn or generic, and you'll probably like them in the end.\r\nMusic is really cute and always goes according to the situation.  The ending song is also one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I really enjoyed watching everyone of them.  Oota is probably my favorite characters, since he acts very mature and is always taking care of Tanaka.  Most of the characters are likeable and their personalities shine a lot.  They don't seem to take most of the things seriously and that's pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy some of the last episodes of this series, since they included pool episodes, another fireworks episodes and a whole drama about Tanaka having a girlfriend.  Most of this things feel very clich\u00e9 and I would rather watch more situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are looking for a great slice of life anime with loving characters, Tanaka-kun wa itsumo kedaruge is for you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's a particular type of anime apart from the usual hustle and bustle of RomComs that I like. And that's slice of life. A genre I got introduced to when I first started watching anime. While watching Tanaka-kun wa Itsume Kedaruge, those nostalgic feelings came back, and I enjoyed this anime in a way I hadn't before with any other animes. In one word, I'd call Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge 'sweet'.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nEven while being a slice of life, the anime sweetly introduces it's plot in a very slow and easy going way, although it was done so to introduce our lazy MC, it also denotedhow beautifully and sweetly the pace flows in slice of life anime. It opens slowly, flows slowly and ends gracefully. Such a calm demeanor of a plot could deserve a 10 easily, if only the plot was a bit more tightened. Otherwise, Tanaka kun had a wonderful and unique story that most slice of life watchers would get a sugar rush out of due to it's sweet nature.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. It fit perfectly with the slice of life genre and accentuated the comedy too. The character design was another thing to mush over. If I was asked to describe it in one word, I'd call it cute!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA slice of life should be soft, so the sound track too has to be soft. And frankly speaking, I've already run out of cute words to describe this anime. The adorable OP was very memorable and nostalgic at the same time, even though the ED wasn't memorable as much the OP more than made up for it. The VAs did a brilliant job of portraying the characters, they fit in perfectly, especially the three MCs, namely our title character, Ohta and Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and slice of life are always at odds. And so if you wanted or expected character development from this or any slice of life anime, you won't be satisfied as that's not the purpose of this anime. Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge's purpose is to introduce the daily life of the characters so character development will be minor or won't even exist. I rated the characters out of their personalities instead of development as this is a slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nTanaka: Our MC, Tanaka is an extremely lazy person, so lazy that he can go to extreme lengths just to relax later on. Even though he's quite lazy, that doesn't stop the fact that he's considerate of his friends and can even beat himself up for one too. Unlike most other MCs who're dense brats, Tanaka isn't. What sets him apart is that he isn't interested in such relationships just because it wastes his energy. He has quite a funny and sweet way of going about daily issues too, which further boosts his appeal to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOhta: Tanaka's close friend and 'wife' (watch to understand why he's called that), Ohta is the opposite of Tanaka in the sense that he's dependable, arguably active and takes care of Tanaka's *every* need. But fortunately his character isn't sacrificed, he has his own opinions and thoughts as well and instead of supporting the comedy, leads it at times. A feature seen in few 2nd MCs (as in the second character). Ohta is a sweet person too who like sweets and always tries to help Ohta. So the female community might be appealed by his kind and generous personality. \\n\\n\r\nShiraishi: Arguably the only non MC who gets the most screentime, Shiraishi develops a little too, she learns to stay true to herself and her embarrassed and shy nature (to some extent) is also a refreshing aspect to slice of life (which nowadays are bombarded with Tsunderes, though I'm not complaining). She finds it difficult to cope with her feelings due to her double persona (watch to understand what I mean) and her struggle is notably seen in the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I loved Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge. It's sweet nature triggers the sweet side inside of us and teaches us to enjoy life as it is. That's a lesson I enjoyed learning. The comedy also delivered extraordinarily. If you've read my previous reviews you'd notice how few anime actually make me laugh and I'll confidently tell you I was laughing at almost every comedy scene. Which shows that this show is actually really good at comedy as it is fresh and original while also using the characters in a unique way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've already said the word sweet so many times so I'll try not to say it now. Overall, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge was a sweet (dangit, I lost already) and cute anime that could be the slice of life of the year in my opinion. Anyone who wants something sweet (again...) can and will find satisfaction in watching this anime. Slice of Life lovers will most likely praise this as I did. One of the best slice of life anime out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Shiraishi is best girl <3",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is what I'd consider an example in the comedy SoL genre, the standard of which all entries since should be held up to. Many people are highly critical of this genre for its highly formulaic, uninspired and overall samey nature, but I do believe that Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge strikes as an example that it can differ from this, and when it does, it is an excellent piece of comedy.\r\nIf you stumble upon Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge for the first time, it probably looks rather mediocre, and something not really worth your time, but I think it truly does mark anexcellent piece of comedy anime. The anime is about the titular Tanaka and his extreme laziness, so much so that he struggles with basic activities such as doing basic schoolwork, ordering fast food, etc. He is accompanied by Ohta, a tall, hard-working friend whose main role is to (often literally) carry Tanaka around so that he can get by in his day to day life. The humour found between these exchanges is top-notch, albeit humour is subjective and all. I'd also like to note the fact that the character Echizen (childhood friend of Ohta; tomboy and delinquent) is one of the few examples of a good tsundere in anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nI have one gripe with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, and one only, and that is the character of Shiraishi (seito kaichou who tries to create a facade of a 'perfect' girl, but is broken when Tanaka and Ohta find her dressed undesirably, but she maintains as the two agree to keep it a secret), whose character is fairly standard and one I'm not a great deal bothered by - my grievance is the fact that, in typical anime fashion, falls in love with Tanaka for no reason, and this just doesn't fit the standard \"just a solid comedy anime, not of that harem shit\" that it usually follows, but this sees little prevalence, so I'm willing to forego it (I'm never too fond of romance arcs that don't actually amount to anything but I consider it forgiveable)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is a solid anime, a shining example of how to properly write a comedy SoL and I hope to see more in its vein in the future.\\n\r\n8/10",

However, due to my business i cannot watch it until it is Match 2018. After i watched the anime, now i know why my friend really rushed me to watch this - This anime really describes what \"Slice Of Life\" means.\r\nOther than the point i mentioned before (slow-paced), this anime will give you the feel of being so tranquil and peace. From the BGM to thecharacters itself, they deliver conflicts in without having to make any audio or visual riots like panic BGM or Flashing screens. Instead, they use silence for it, especially the awkward scenes - you get the climax, your hands itch knowing you can only watch and cannot involve yourself directly in the anime, and you get all the excitement guessing what is going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed without any nonsense like traps or sexually attractive imouto - I don't like animes including that even though it is a Slice of Life. The character promised in the title \"Tanaka-kun is Always Listless\" is just perfectly... lazy as promised, i know it is odd to feel super excited caused by this character. I won't spoil much, but the character types in this anime is just so various, and worked harmonically with the listless Tanaka. Tsundere and imouto are included.\\n\\n\r\nThis will be one of Slice of Life animes i will never forget, but this never beats Nichijou. Unlike Nichijou, i didn't hope any more season from this anime since the ending is already perfect, pretty hanging but making any extensions would make the ending in this first season weird.",

            "content": "The slice of life anime from spring 2016 'Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless' was well-known for its cuteness and lax comedy. When I finally got around to see the first episode, I was excited because of its comedy. It was unique and something I hadn't seen before. Summer 2016 anime started, and I couldn't finish 'Tanaka-kun'. But I got around to it finally! And I'm so happy I watched it. \r\nTANAKA IN THE RAIN PICTURE\r\nIt was so funny that Tanaka tried so hard to be lazy. This was ironic because trying is the polar opposite of being lazy. Tanaka was a walking contradiction. He continued tobe funny with his efforts. Every episode had another challenge for him to conquer. Whether it was a girl clamoring to be his apprentice or a cultural festival. Tanaka's reactions to these challenges really made the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime was funny. Laugh out loud funny. There were moments where I couldn't help but laugh out loud. This anime had small jokes. Most of these were simple. But they made me laugh. Overall, this was a good comedy anime. Solid.\\n\\n\r\nSHIRAISHI PICTURE\\n\\n\r\nRomance has never been my thing. Even though I watch and read a lot of shoujo, I've never chosen romance over a good action scene. Unless it's a badly animated action scene, then sure. But this anime forced Shiraishi's unrequited love onto you. There was no reason for her to like Tanaka. I don't know what she sees in him.\\n\r\nWhat I do like about this is the fact that it IS unrequited. She has no chance with him. And that's how life is. We have crushes and may never get mutual feelings. And that's okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was fine. It wasn't the best. It feels like there should be a second season, but there isn't the demand. It's a cute anime. But they should have wrapped it up better. Maybe Tanaka finally getting a peaceful sleep? Well, that might be boring. I don't know. SOMETHING. It felt very uneventful. Nothing happened really. I didn't get any closure.",

Tanaka kun wa itsumo kedaruge is the first slice of life anime that I watched, and I can say that this anime tuned my interest to the slice of life genre. Ah, what a theme, what a animation, beautifully molded characters, it's just awesome. This anime is and will always be my favorite (Please there be second season to this magnum opus.).\r\nAfter only Tanaka kun, I turned towards school life anime. Introverts characters are always my idols (Tanaka being the king, followed by Oreki Houtarou). His laziness, dealing with various daily life situations, despite his laziness he's someone's crush (I'mso envious of him), ah the Shiraishi san (My first anime crush), brother sister relationship, these all small things makes the show very enjoyable. I salute to the author for giving this anime to us. Maybe I am exaggerating, but I loved the anime from bottom of my soul. I re-watched it 2 to 3 times and still it's charisma and charm is unchanged for me. I highly recommend this anime to the people who are introverts simultaneously wants to be with some friends. This anime tells us that without any superpower one can be a superhero (with listlessness obviously!).\\n\r\nApart from main story, the Opening and ending are truly Soul Soothing musics. There's one music clip in first episode, I don't know what it is (the words are like Langhesan  Lange-san), oh my god what a beautiful symphony! Awesomeness is overloaded here. (love you CooRie!) \\n\r\nI hardly write any review for anime, but I couldn't  stop myself writing this review. No words to describe this anime. Love you Tanaka kun wa itsumo kedaruge!",

            "content": "Review: Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge\r\nStory (6/10): I can't say there is much of a story in this anime. But all I can say is that Tanaka, being the person he is, spends his ordinary high school life being listness. (I know that may sound boring, but bear with me.) But anyways, along with his listlessness, the people who are around him make his life interesting which is worth the watch! \r\nArt (8/10): I can't say too much about the art. As the source of this anime came from a 4-koma manga, I expected worse. But, I can quite say the art presented in this animewas fun to look at since this was made by Silver Link., the ones who made Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and Kokoro Connect. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Let's start off that the opening going into this anime is extremely catchy. Definitely pleasant to the ears as we get a break from 'heavy metal' which we encounter from every anime. The soundtrack and the ending song to this anime can be said as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) (7/10): If there were two words to describe this character's lineup. Bizarre and quirky. And, that is one's of it's strong points is what makes this anime great. The reason behind it is because each character had each of it's peculiar personalities which made this show so fun to watch. Each character, in my opinion, determines how the show's value or what not. But however, I have never seen a character like Tanaka-kun and his 'listlessness'. Even though he is a whole new concept of character I've never seen before, I've never seen how a 'pathetic' a character like him can be. Pathetic may sound a harsh word to describe a character, but that's criticism for the most part. Oddly enough, with his personality in touch, his character is humorous as it is. I can't say he's a fascinating of a character, but his quirks is enough to make me enjoy the show. But, I can say that the people who surround him on a daily basis makes what this show particularly interesting! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): I can say that I ejoyed the anime from beginning to end. Expect all kinds of humor thrown at your face. Because at every end of each episode, you'll smile wanting for more! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: After reflecting on my thoughts on this show, I can definitely recommend this anime to those who want a relaxing, soothing, light slice-of-life anime. Along with 'Flying Witch', this anime stands as one of the best anime of the Spring season. I'm surprised that very few people had picked up this anime since I think this is very underrated. The character lineup were very interesting in a way as each character presented each of their own, unique personalities. There may be practically be no story, but the life that revolves around Tanaka-kun and what unfolds before him is rather intriguing to watch. The comedy is not constrained unlike Sakamoto desu ga?, because with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kegaruge, expect all kinds of witty humor, satire, slapstick, and etc.  The art may be not the best, but since this source came from a 4-koma manga, I am not disappointed in any way. The art is indeed delightful and fun to look at. For the character lineup however, it's nice to take a break and see some new personalities pop once in a while. The characters who were the most rememberable however, were protagonist and deuteragonist Tanaka and Oota. You may think they are mundane and lacking of a personality. But along with Tanaka's listlessness, Oota's tranquil nature, the humor and different personalities that clash againist each other is what saves this show! Most importantly, the show was very entertaining to watch! With that being the case, I definitely recommend this anime who are looking for a humorous but relaxing, sooting anime to watch on a weekends. Or, just any other day in general. \\n\\n\r\nBut, if I had to find a flaw within this anime however, is the lack of character development with each character and Tanaka's listlessness. If there was a character that had changed throughout twelve episodes. It would be Shiraishi. And, she is the supporting character. Throughout twelve episodes, we saw no improvement into Tanaka's listlessness at all. You expect a character to develop some character, but with that being the case with Tanaka's listlessness, I found that furiously frustrating to watch. But, it some situations however, Tanaka's listlessness is what either saved this show from going down the gutter for the better or worse. Don't get me wrong I like this anime, loved all the characters, and the humor presented from this anime! If we were to see some character development, I think I would've rated this show much higher! But, an important lesson that can be brought to this anime, and is to only be yourself. That's true in most cases, but that shouldn't imply to Tanaka-kun. \\n\\n\r\n-Along with Flying Witch, I want a season two with this anime as well!\\n\\n\r\nRAW:\\n\\n\r\n8.23/10.00\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\n8.00/10.00",

            "content": "It's so far so good atm. And holy shit, i feel like im listening to an ASMR video whenever Tanaka talks man lol. And yo, dont forgot about that amazing jazzy, chilling, great vocals and melodic OST man. If i watch one of these episodes in a nice, calm and chilling park, alienated from other humans aside from myself. I would fall asleep right immediately lmao. \r\nIncidentally, the synopsis of this would be, the daily lives of a high school student name \"Tanaka\". Who have a natural talent for being listlessness, with his friend Ohta who's the opposite. And because he's the kind of agood person in nature; he usually helps Tanaka out, taking care of him due to the adverse effect that it has on Tanaka's high school lives for having the attribute of listlessness and indulging it, because \"it feels good\". In which they became best friend. Then they meet several others, with a pretty interesting attribution to each of the character presented. Some with a twist to their actual character, some pretending to be someone else just to be recognize among other (theme of appearance vs reality), and some having a raucous and Yankee like behaviour but actually weak towards cute things and inherently nice as a person. And the moe within this show is shining incandescently bright as fuck. And because of this, i can't resist the urge to see more of Tanaka in the future and the other character as well (especially Tanaka's sister, SHE's JUST TO DAMN CUTE!). These characters are pretty interesting so far, and unique. Plus their dialogue is pretty deep as well. One of these dialogue talk about globalization through the English language, some philosophy, rationalizing behaviour, evolution of humans etc. Some things that i have never expected a show like this to start talking about lol. But it was delivered so well and interesting coz it was deliver by our 2 stoic faces characters, Ohta and Tanaka. While Tanaka is listless, and stoic. His characters make him look like a quiet child that needs to be help in a lot ways. So you will get this feeling of spoiling him, or not wanting to left him alone to sulk. Because, ummmm. Im a guy but he's just too adorable man LOL. No homo. Just moe... Really...\\n\\n\r\nThese includes the act of wanting to carrying him to class (Ohta my man), carrying him to his home (Ohta again), carrying him to his home or his friend's house (Ohta again...). Yea he can't live without someone to help him get through his day, because he's really just too tired to do anything by himself lol. This makes Tanaka as a character alot cuter than he actually is without his silliness and ideas that will baffle us that will make us think, \"Why did you think like that man?\" or \"Tanaka... Dude how did you come into that conclusion lmao\", or just simply, \"WTF Tanaka\".\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, these characters, especially Tanaka are very unique and some of the very deep or touchy moment of this anime thus far are affected by his personalities as well. They are pretty good, while not having that pertinent to the cliche that we usually sees in a scene in relation to those parts. It's more of a self aware kinda thing for a character such as Tanaka which makes those scene alot more unique than the other anime out there. Probably because this is not an anime to stress yourself out into thinking about the bad stuff, and the complicated, emotional stuff to deeply. It's a relaxing anime. And Ohta has that quality of being the nagging wife or presumably good in nature. It's worth a try if you want to find something to watch for relaxation, filling your lack of cuteness in your lives, some light hearted moment and stoic comedy etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle and the background art really fit in perfectly to what the anime is aiming at when we, the audience is watching it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd obviously, this isn't a story aim to be the best anime out there. I mean we usually try to make out what makes an anime great based from the story progression of the story, the flow of the story, the dialogue, character development, intellectual/complicated plot development, being able to find other elements to forward the story in a unique ways, rational or badass MC and characters that makes a certain story great. But that isn't the case for an anime such as this. These kind of restriction kinda complicates the actuality of what makes a certain type of anime, story, movie or whatever great to certain individuals. That's why there are so many kind of these type of animes that are not aiming to be the best in the eyes of critics who wants to see something serious and profound, but to help the audience relax, enjoy the moe, and enlightening the meaning of happiness for many depressive men in Japan, or the stressful days we all have with reality.... ummmm i guess? I only watches this because the comedy is unique and new to having an MC that's listless. There're alot of female student selling themselves off, servicing men to walk with them, talk to them (old business, to young, or otakus), and so forth in Akihabara. And Otakus whose life are miserable and using anime as a pretext to live on with their unsatisfying life. But i'll end this conversation there, since it's kinda out of context. And yea.... Why the hell did i start talking about it.. Oh yea, these kind of animes, or story are popular in the anime community because sometimes we need something to alleviate the hates that we sees in the world, people, or community, or even family. And this anime kinda alleviate it in a more relaxing way. The kind of relaxing and cute that will makes you want to watch more of Tanaka-Kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this anime is pretty great so far, the humor is cute, silly, refreshing and funny. The aesthetics of the anime was great. Character design are pretty interesting (except for Ohta, his appearance looks plain). It's for that interesting for me at the very least, but just check it out for a couple of episodes.",

            "content": "Wow. This anime. One of the anime I was hype for when I was looking through the Spring anime season page in MAL. The anime that led me to think differently about life and this world.  Sadly, over already. However, I will always follow this kind of anime with a review obviously!\r\nOverall, this anime was pretty much an ideal for me. This anime was much more than what I expected when I was looking through the spring anime page. \r\n     Personally, what I look for in slice of life and comedy anime like this are how the characters develop overtime (What I will get to see in the character in the anime), how the characters effect the story of it, and how the art makes up the style of the anime. Mostly, it revolves around the match of the art, character and the story. And this anime, was the ONE anime that made up for all the \"Not preferable\" slice of life anime I have watched so far, and possibly not even made it to my list ( If you want to know what kind I watch, you can visit my list).\\n\\n\r\n     This anime, once again, overall was basically the closest anime to my ideal slice of life kind anime. I would recommend this anime to people who love the type of anime that will give you little laughs in between, type to watch in the morning and relax, and the type that makes you want to just be relaxed.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, I have to admit. It was good. Very good. However, I feel like that will be the only thing I will have to say for the rating of the story of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n     For me, everything in the anime was ideal and the closest to perfect , however, the only thing that made me feel like could have made the whole thing better was how the story went.\\n\\n\r\n     Most of the episodes were very attention grabbing for me, and very good. But about 1 or 2 episodes made me feel kind of empty. By empty, I mean by the feeling where I feel like \"thats it?\" that kind. But it really didn't effect my experience of this anime, and it was not even big enough to make it not ideal so it was counted as 1 point in the story section of my rating. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, the story was very interesting. Even though I didn't expect too much on the story section of this anime, this really fulfilled my mind and heart. I would recommend this to people who like stories that goes weird at times, but the kind that will give you a small laugh and go into the comedy section of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     The art of this anime was not the best art when looking at just the art, but the connection of the art and the story and the character was just the best, and for me, that the only way art matters for me, unless the art is just unwatchable or horrible. The art in the anime was very light, and it wasn't flashy or modern.\\n\\n\r\n     As it was a slice of life anime, the art made the whole thing be calm and smooth. The color fills in the art was very light colored, and very \"slice of life\" like.  For this anime, to say, the art was basically just perfect in all ways that it could be. I would recommend this to people who like chill and calm arts that will make your mind and eyes relax from all those action and flashy arts. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea how to start on this sound part. The sound part of this anime. Simply calming. The music of the anime was mostly consisted of the light and short staccato notes of piano and light percussion instruments that made the whole anime very calming and smooth. \\n\\n\r\n     The music was very \"In place\" and very relating to everything else of the anime.  The music wasn't \"flashy, and effected\" which soothed my ears.  The smooth and dragging music made up of a singer and piano in some ost made me relax along with Tanaka. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, I couldn't even notice the music in the background, because it just fit in so good with the anime, which is better in slice of life anime. I would recommend the sound part of the anime to basically anyone who likes good anime that has a matching music with it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis part is the one I would actually give more than a 10 if I could. This anime, with its \"unique but cliche\" characters made the story more interesting. The unison of the types of characters made the anime more appealing to me.  \\n\\n\r\nTanaka, the chill and lazy guy who isn't hated nor liked.\\n\\n\r\nOota, the tall and responsible guy who takes care of Tanaka in school.\\n\\n\r\nThere are much more but it would become a spoiler so I will stop there, but my point is, that all those characters in one anime just makes the perfect character development within the anime and makes the story more interesting. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, characters in the anime is over the point of perfect if I had to say. I would recommend this to people who like the harmony development of the characters that will make up the whole story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was, to me, the best anime in the spring. Whenever I woke up at Saturday morning, feeling sleepy, I would immediately wake up and run to my PC after realizing that I can watch Tanaka. To me, I didn't just enjoy this anime. I loved watching this series. Everytime I watch this anime, I would forget about the things that bothered me in life, and just fall into the relaxing world of Tanaka and relax along with him. This was very enjoyable to me as the \"best anime of 2016 spring\" for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime made up the part of me that made me relax and calm down. The harmony of all the good parts of the anime made up this ideal anime. This show has made my day brighter, and while watching without thinking, and the episode ends, I would think that I would love to just watch this anime forever, never stop and I wouldn't get bored. For long, I have looked for the perfect anime that will be good to watch with my whole family and friends, but most of the time, there were things like fan service and cliche romance stuff that made it just too awkward for me to watch with my family and friends. If you are one of those kind of people, well, you and I just\\n\r\n found just the perfect anime for that. This anime was very relaxing, made up the little crack ups in the middle, and made me want to know more about the characters.\\n\\n\r\n Thank you for reading my first ever review and I hope you found this helpful.\\n\r\n     >.<\\n\\n\r\nNow then, Go watch Tanaka-Kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge!! \\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS; DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVE NOT YET WATCHED THE SHOW. -\r\nI honestly didn\u2019t expect much from this show at all, I initially saw it while exploring what was offered \r\non Crunchyroll about a month back. Starting it off, it just seemed like your average slice-of-life anime \r\nwith a few jokes here or there about being listless and lazy (the MAL synopsis doesn\u2019t help it\u2019s case \r\neither). However, that initial impression I had was quickly shattered, the shows clever mix of, not \r\nonly, wholesome comedy slice-of-life but, also well done and engaging dialogue, quickly lets the \r\naudience know that thisisn\u2019t just a show about being listless. No, that\u2019s completely wrong. It\u2019s a \\n\r\nshow about how the public, and society, reacts towards the premise of listlessness. Tanaka (\u7530\u4e2d), being ,what seems to be, your overly lazy character, Is the beacon of listlessness in this show. Used \\n\r\nas more of a flag for starting up situations and less as a \u201cmain character\u201d, if that makes sense. As the \\n\r\nshow progresses, we get introduced to many different characters who help to fuel these interesting \\n\r\nsituations. Ohta (\u592a\u7530), a tall and strong man who loves sweet foods while also being the main \\n\r\nhelper for Tanaka throughout the show. Shiraishi, a former listless (in her words) \u201cdweeb\u201d who \\n\r\nappears as a sparkly \u201cidol\u201d looking girl after changing her appearance for her high school debut due \\n\r\nto her being practically shunned during her middle school days; She\u2019s used to create situations to \\n\r\ntest Tanaka\u2019s listlessness in the face of love. Miyano, who looks up to Tanaka as her master and \\n\r\nwishes to be as listless as him some day; who appointed herself as his \u201capprentice\u201d; And many more \\n\r\nengaging and well written characters to amplify this shows clever writing and execution. -\\n\r\nOverall, Silver Link and Kawatsura Shinya did an amazing job of adapting the manga for this show \\n\r\nand have truly created a fully enjoyable and engaging experience which, I believe, anyone can enjoy.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nAlso, the ED is a bop please listen to it I beg you.",

            "content": "There is a very easy cut when it comes to wether you'll like Tanaka-kun or not. Are you lazy or you feel you desire to be more lazy in life? Then you'll like it. There is no attempt to humiliate Tanaka for being useless or any mean spirited stuff, that would go against the spirit of the show. And that's why connecting with it is so important: the lazyness and relaxation saturate every aspect of this show.\r\nAt first it's easy to consider it one of those \"healing\" animus, the light colors and slow delivery of jokes that don't close with a tsukkomi punching and screamingtend to be common in those comedies. But in Tanaka is a 4koma comedy. There is little development, there aren't particularly emotive moments and there is nothing to get from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most evident moment when this saturation becomes evident is in the cut to the opening and eyecatches. After the joke the screen slowly fades to white, taking three or four seconds to eventually disappear. There is no loud noise or strong cut, just moving with ease to the next place. Or usually the same one moments later without any change.\\n\\n\r\nThe color pallete doesn't have full saturation, the music is something the MC from Detroit Metal City would love, and even the angry tsukkomi characters are quitely revengful instead of reactive. There is no opposition, in the plot or in the looks. It's impressive how a vague concept as being lazy is turned into visual and auditive metaphors all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime feels like an incredible excercise in expressing feelings through animation. But obviously if the comedy doesn't work for you there is no point in caring too much. I'd say you're not supposed to care too much about anything to enjoy this anime.",

Even though it's definitely one of the calmest and most laid-back anime series I've seen, somehow it never feels dull. \r\nArt 10/10: Honestly I can't believe how good it looks. The character designs are easy on the eyes and very fitting for each character's personality, the movement is fluid, and the backgrounds aresurprisingly detailed, especially all the shots of the sky during sunset. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The opening and ending songs are very appropriate for this show, except that they nearly put me to sleep every time I tried to listen to them, so I had to skip them every episode, which is a shame. I think I only noticed some background music once through the entire show, but that's okay, as the sound effects and the voice acting are amazing enough to make up for it. Seriously, Tanaka's voice actor is incredible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: There's Tanaka who's fascinating on his own, but his dynamic with Oota is basically the best thing in the entire show. The various side characters do a great job of balancing out Tanaka's listlessness with their own different energies, and some of them get their own mini-arcs as well, which I loved, though I probably could've done without the romance element. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: This probably isn't the sort of show you should binge, but I did anyway, and I don't regret it. It's mostly just something wholesome to watch after a hard day, but it does have its own fair share of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: It's probably one of my favourite slice of life shows to date, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes such shows. \\n",

It is enjoyable BECAUSE \"nothing\" happens.\r\nThis is the perfect show to watch when you come home after a hard day of school/work and just want to calm down and relax a bit.\r\nThe characters are really enjoyable too. Our MC Tanaka is the kind of person we have all been in our lifes: Listless.Sometimes he doesn't want to get up or move to get some food but that's exactly what makes him so likable because we've all been at that point in our lifes. His best friend Oota is the complete opposite of Tanaka: energetic, reliable and NOT listless. There's just some great chemistry between the two of them. The others are quite nice too.\\n\r\nStory: There isn't much to talk about. Every episode is basically one or 2 days in Tanakas life and how he deals with certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to write more but I'm too listless at the moment so I'll finish this quick.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This is NOT an action show by any means so you'll be very disappointed if you are looking for that.

While Natsume Yuujinchou has fantasy in it, but TwIK is a school life anime that features something that would happen in real life by the eyes of a listless person name Tanaka-kun.\r\nThere is not much of a plot progression apart of Tanaka-kun having to face more and more things that requires energy to do. Well, he once said he didn't want to be a main character, and sadlyhe is now. It's a simple comedy anime designed to make the viewers laugh and feel calm, away from the rowdiness of action-packed and psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters does not grow in any way, apart of several female characters growing in love to Tanaka-kun. This anime deserves a harem tag, for Tanaka-kun does not even need to do anything to make them fall for him. Sadly, to the girls' despair, Tanaka-kun have found his perfect waifu before meeting them, though the word \"waifu\" might be wrong to use in such situations. The characters are unique in appearance and personality wise.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise it was light and eye pleasing. Sounds are okay. Not much to say about this two.\\n\\n\r\nI have quite the enjoyment of watching this. While I do not laugh on their comedic moments, I enjoy every moment of the anime. I have no idea why. Was it due to the anime being related to something I have done in high school? While not too memorable, I believe people have done something stupid in high school that makes it hilarious to remember. This light-hearted anime manage to keep me going as I watch it every week, surprisingly over some action anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was good. While it was simple, something manages to pull me to enjoying it. I could not explain why, for I have not find the answer to Natsume Yuujinchou's charm as well. Maybe you could try it and tell me what was its charm that allows me to continue watching it all this time.",

            "content": "*contains a bit of spoilers*\r\nStory: 10\r\nTitle says it all. A super cute, chill and funny anime. This has little to no real story line and it just contains random things happening throughout each episode. You can sense bromance and a bit of Yuri too, which I don\u2019t mind at all. Also, there are some scenes which can be unpredictable so don\u2019t underestimate this anime! \r\nCharacter: 10\r\nTanaka is an extremely cute guy (especially when he\u2019s sleeping) in terms of the way he talks and thinks, lives his life like a cat with his own sense of humor and is very wise about things. The seiyuu isable to voice this character well because it\u2019s the same seiyuu for Kuroko from Kuroko no Basuke. Both of them have this \u201cmost of the time calm and hardly any form of expressions shown\u201d kind of personality. It\u2019s surprising that Tanaka can even play the piano when he\u2019s so lazy.  \\n\\n\r\nHis best friend Ohta is a strong, cool and reliable guy, someone important to Tanaka who he cannot live without (he even admitted it a few times in the anime oml). \\n\\n\r\nAnother character appears~ Miyano. Oh my god her extreme enthusiasm, respect and admiration she has for Tanaka is so so cute too! She\u2019s like a little kid.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters will take forever to explain so I\u2019ve only described my favourite characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSimple yet pretty well done. Background sceneries are relatively detailed and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCute and enjoyable opening and ending songs. Omg and for example some scenes when Tanaka was being shaken, when eating a macaron. The sounds were so detailed. The effect of actually being shaken and crunching sounds when eating. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\r\nOnce you start this anime, you\u2019ll be in for a lot of laughs. I got my friends to watch it with me when I was watching episode 8. There\u2019s this guy who hardly watches anime actually enjoyed this so there\u2019s a lot to say about that. Ah don't worry, the other friend who watched with me said it's good too. Both of them plan to watch the episodes that they missed out on. \\n\\n\r\nPeople might think this anime is bad or not even worth watching because of the title but don\u2019t let it put you off. This anime is actually very good, so a 10/10. This anime can be quite relatable too. Really well done for such an underrated slice of life anime. \\n",

After all the ups and downs of the other shows you may be watching its nice to just sit back and be entertained. It's refreshing in its most simplistic way. At the end of every episode you find yourself smilingand wishing for just a couple more minutes of this easy going anime. The interactions of all the different characters are cute and comical and they show you a different perspective on how to live life to its.....umm well maybe not fullest but to a way that's true to who you are. The art is nice to look at and the music will have you swaying along to the beat. Give it a chance, it might make your day. Stay listless guys ^_^",

            "content": "Tanaka-kun is the \u201csleeper\u201d hit of the season\u2026 eh that\u2019s all I got. I\u2019m not a big fan of slice of life, but Tanaka-kun was able to pull me in by finally giving me a protagonist that\u2019s more listless than myself. Makes me feel better as a person. It\u2019s a easygoing show that will have you glued to your screen watching a high school boy just staring and breathing and sleeping (Sleeping with Hinako, anybody?). Or on the other side of the spectrum, gladly put you to sleep. Just how listless is the show? Let\u2019s find out.\r\nWhat It Does Right:\r\n+Lovable Characters That Give the Showthe Energy It Needs\\n\r\nTanaka-Kun\u2019s strongest suit is undoubtedly it\u2019s characters. Each of them has a well defined personality that makes them a joy to watch. Some of them break tropes of typical high school comedies making for a fresh wave of wacky shenanigans. I was surprised at how many archetypes I would normally scoff at, I ended up loving (except for a certain character with a sibling complex, ugh why?!). I can\u2019t really pick a favorite character as many had their own special set of charm that I had fun watching. The interactions between these characters have a nice and natural chemistry. The show is never too forceful or melodramatic with it\u2019s romance or character dynamics making for a well balanced show.\\n\\n\r\n+Simple, Tranquil Feeling That Emits Coziness\\n\r\nKeep your expectations at a minimum, because Tanaka-kun is really just here to chill. Something about the show will just have your mind at peace, that is if you are in the right mindset. The nice backgrounds allow for a cozy experience and that paired with the colorful energy from the cast had me invested. While the show is basically a collection of events in the usual school setting, the show\u2019s presentation allows for a unique take on the typical cliches. The events can range from a simple half-episode\u2019s worth of slow-paced gags to a quick 4 panel-ish skit of\u2026 listlessness. Either way, if your body is ready to experience the laid-back world of Tanaka-kun, then by all means jump right in and relax.\\n\\n\r\n+Soothing Soundtrack to Carry the Mood\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Tanaka-kun is the star to lead the pacing of the show. Tanaka-kun does seem quite reliant on it\u2019s fine blend of various piano tracks to guide the mood and without it, Tanaka-kun would probably one of the most awkward shows in existence. The opening theme is always placed with precision to break the ice whenever the show decides to just pause. Both that and the ending are fitting of the show\u2019s personality and is a good way to get in the mood the show wants you to be in. The voice acting are nothing to complain about as each VA does there job whether it\u2019s the raw hyperactive personality of Miyano, the intimidating vibe of delinquent Ecchan, or the conflicted awkward sides of Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nWhat It Does Wrong:\\n\\n\r\n-Tanaka-kun Should Have Been a Secondary Character\\n\r\nI know the show is called Tanaka-Kun is Always Listless, but a gag of a dude sleeping and feeling lazy as heck can only entertain so many times. It eventually got to a point where it was becoming repetitive and onenote which eventually led to Tanaka dragging the show down. The show may try to spice things up every once in awhile, but I would much prefer if the rest of the cast got their time to shine (except for the one with the brother complex) to complement the constant \u201clol i\u2019m tired\u201d jokes which would lead to an arguably better paced show. There are so many other characters with much more interesting quirks and stronger comedy potential.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation Can Get as Lazy as Tanaka-kun Himself\\n\r\nAlong with Tanaka is equally lazy animation that drags the show back from reaching better heights. The designs are one-of-a-kind, but the animation to support this is rather still and sort of just does nothing. It\u2019s competent when it wants to be, but then decides to cut corners and take it\u2019s sweet time. While this may be part of the pacing, there were points where characters would just awkwardly stare and stare even more, which was too excessive to my liking. The screen transitions and 4 panel skits were also just characters doing nothing leading up to nothing. The show just lost me at these moments due to the sheer anticlimactic nature akin to an overly long loading screen on a game.\\n\\n\r\n-Not Much of a Purpose Rather Than a Collection of Events\\n\r\nTanaka-kun isn\u2019t really trying to give any messages, themes, or any narrative at all. There\u2019s no coming of age or notable developments to speak of. The show just does what it wants and it chooses to give us an honest anthology of mundane high school activities lit up by the expressive characters. In the process, the show may come off as pointless and eventually forgettable. If you saw a few episodes of Tanaka-kun, you pretty got a good basis of what the show is. Don\u2019t expect to get much out of the show because for better or for worse, this is a harmless comedy and nothing more and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nMy Pointless Enjoyment:\\n\r\nTanaka-kun pretty serves as my weekly fix to relax, chill, and embrace my inner nothingness. Like every comedy, Tanaka-kun isn\u2019t consistent with its laughs. Some jokes had me cracking up by the sheer absurdity of the misunderstandings (which by the way, this show is fanservice free, yay) while others had me staring and silently nodding my head. But for the most part, I had enough enjoyable moments to salvage and that\u2019s all I really ask for in a comedy. While Tanaka, the animation, and obligatory \u201coni-chan\u201d spouting little sister bored me, the rest of the cast provided enough energy to hold that off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nShould you watch Tanaka-kun? If you have no idea what the word listless means and aren\u2019t burnt out by high school comedies, go for it, this show has quite a bit to offer. It stands out among the other slice of life this season with it\u2019s above average characterization and honest intent to provide a relaxing time. Before I rewatch Sleeping with Hinako and fall asleep from utter listlessness, I award Tanaka-Kun is Always Listless with a 5.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to comment on my review. I'm always up for advice so I can improve my reviewing skills. Thanks for reading!",

Everyone seems to deeply care about their friends, with one friend's concern becoming everyone's concern, and the way people bond doesn't seem overly contrived, although admittedly, perhaps one particular character does seem to have that kind of aspect.Overall, though, any issues that are present aren't bothersome, and thus, the anime does deliver a mostly genuine feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was absofuckinglutely gorgeous. I haven't seen backgrounds this good in a while. There are definitely good backgrounds, yeah, but this particular anime seemed to blow me away every time, which has extremely rarely happened (only other time art blew me away was Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is excellent and meshes well with the overall vibe of the anime. ED is  OK. I've seen better, but it somehow does work.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, for me, the anime feels 70% relatable which jacked up my enjoyment a lot since I felt so emotionally connected to it. Daily life and hanging out with friends is definitely something to be cherished, and this anime celebrates that, which I love.\\n\\n\r\nI'm feeling a bit listless just like Tanaka-kun, so I guess I'll end my review here.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention the art is outstanding though? Like seriously. It's insane.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr vibe and art are godly, friendship/daily life are prevalent themes, sound is excellent",

It's fun and relaxed as well as the story. The animation is good. The studio silver link. (Kokoros Connect, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia) always makes an above average animation.

Theending is beautiful and combined with art and aesthetics was completely perfect. The soundtrack is light and refreshing as the air.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are good and funny.

There are twelve of them and one of them is Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, in list number eleven. I chose Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge because nowadays, i tend to watch anime that has 10-13 episodes and Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge has 12 episodes in it.\r\nStory:\r\nWhen i watch about slice of life anime, i don't set the expectation to high on the story, because i know it will always about the daily life, ithink what makes it good or bad is up to you the watcher whether you can enjoy or relate with the story or not and i think Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge who tells the story about a highschool boy who has mastered the listless way of life is actually unique. On the first episode, i find it usual but as the story goes by, i begin to enjoy this anime. I recommend you try this anime, for me personally (as a person who is picky about what anime to watch) find it worth my time.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFor the art, if you have watched Isshuukan friends and like the art of it, i think you will like the art of this anime too because it is similar and i think anime with this is kind of art is still enjoyable to watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound director of this anime i think has done a good job, because of the musics that played in the certain momment are suitable with the ongoing situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nit's just too much focused on Tanaka and Ohta. I just hope that Tanaka's friends other that ohta can get more involved because there are some character which i think can make this anime more lively and funny if the others get involved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSame with the title of the article that i read, this anime will heal your soul after a hard day and you can feel relax while watching it and enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Going into the Spring 2016 season, strangely enough, this funny little SOL anime called Tanaka-kun is Always Listless caught my eye. I always have time for a good slice of life comedy, but it is rare that I actually look forward to one. Tanaka-kun, with its odd little description, hooked me and reeled me in before it even started, and I have to say, it lived up pretty well to my expectations.\r\nWell, I suppose I'll get to the review now.\r\nStory: 7\r\nNot much to say here. The series is episodic in format, with little to no overlying story. It follows much the same formula as manyother slice of lifes, but it's lack of a strong plot is not a draw back. I would say that it is more of a fact that has little impact over the anime itself. I'm giving it a 7 on story because there's very little new here, but that isn't really a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nBright yet soothing and calm visuals, good and not over the top character designs, and beautiful back drops. The art isn't ground breaking, but it is definitely a solid 9 on my scale.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OST fits the laid back mood of this anime to a T. The voice acting is great, I really think that the cast made the characters come alive (or go to sleep in some cases). The OP and ED are suiting, if forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile each character can loosely be put into the shapes of the different tropes, each has a unique personality that at least puts some twists and turns into their shape. The character interactions are great, and they even manage to add some character development for a few of the main cast members while maintaining quite a large number of regulars. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nNot every anime can make me laugh out loud at my computer screen, and the ones that can usually get a high rating in this category from me. Tanaka-kun is no exception. This was one of the only anime of the season that I actually knew the hour that it aired, and I looked forward to it every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best none-romance focused slice of life animes that I have ever seen. I would describe it as a slow paced, laid back comedy with a loose plot. Its definitely worth a try for those looking for a laugh.",

Then Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo kedaruge is the one for you.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nJust like you've read in the description, this anime is all about how commited Tanaka-kun is to living a listless life. Unlike the hype you find in other anime, this one is quite laid-back but yet lets you experience how it feels like to be listless. What made this anime so special is the humor that didn't rely on any cheap jokes or fanservice. Instead, itonly contained humor that added to the light mood which was created by the characters' interactions. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nNow to be honest, this isn't the most eye-catching art you could find, but it's good enough to catch your attention. Because after all, it serves the purpose of making you relax along with the characters. The one thing you will notice is how light the colors are, and it makes the atmosphere seem even better, it draws a stress-free world with no complications to make things worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThere's no denying that we all have a different taste in music, but what's there to hate about this anime's soundtrack? It mostly consists of light string music that make you want to drift away as if nothing else matters in the world. And in this anime, nothing really does.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nFinally to the most anticipated part. We talked about a relaxing story, relaxing art and relaxing sound, so what exactly do you expect? Of course relaxing characters. What is so beautiful about this is that the characters blend in so well it feels unnatural. It's quite astonoshing how well developed the characters are, each one complimenting the other. And even with Tanaka-kun's resting dead face, he still took part in other's lives and contributed in making this fun to watch. This is what it's all about after all, a listless guy's daily life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nHow can i not enjoy this? This is my most awaited anime out of all the ones on my list. It just washes my problems away and gives me time to rest for what's around 24 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nHonestly, i've never came across an anime so calming and enjoyable like this one. At first sight, i thought it won't have much potential seeing how it didn't have an actual plot. But turns out that's the one thing that made this anime so special.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone still hestitant to watch, i hope this review gives you that one last push.",

            "content": "With a colorful cast of characters, great comedy, all while having a calm atmosphere, Tanaka-kun is Always Listless is the sleeper hit of the Spring 2016 season (pun definitely intended).\r\nThe story is as slice-of-life as it can get: set in a high school with nothing too extreme about it. Because of the nature of the series, it has a real laid back feel to it, like you can be at ease when watching. Plus, the timing of the comedy in it is on point and I find myself laughing quite a few times each episode. These types of shows I've always enjoyed. It's a breatherfrom all the action and shounen out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the ones that make this show the way it is. Each of them has their own unique personalities that mix well with everyone else. Might I say that not only are they funny, but they are absolutely adorable. I pretty much love all of them. The only major complaint is that there were some that didn't get enough time to shine, which kind of sucks.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what you would expect with a slice-of-life series like this: very simplistic. However, it's not to the point where it's generic, because it has a distinct look to it, specifically the design of the characters. I'd say there were a few flaws here and there, but being too engrossed with the story and characters didn't make it bothersome.\\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly the kind of slice-of-life series that I love the most. What normally makes these kind of shows is the characters, which this does well with. Honestly, while I had this on my list, before it premiered I wasn't sure what the show was going to be like. Having finished it, I'm glad I decided to stick with it all the way through.",

It was also nice because it gives you all of this without so much going on that you feel like you have to watch all in one go or youwill forget who likes who and who is doing what. You can easily put this down to let life continue, and then pick it right back up when you can and still enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n So, if you are looking for an anime that is that reminds you of very slow, lazy, enjoyable summer days - this is it. It's the kind that makes you wish your life was currently just as slow and listless as Tanaka's. \\n\\n\r\n  Don't choose this anime when you want action, emotions, events, etc around every corner. \\n\\n\\n",

Suiting this oddity is what makes the comedy striking. Forget about romance buildup, since it comes naturally in this series. Talk about characters: a guy who loves to have an uneventful life, blessed with a buddy that wants to help him and understands his listlesness in a different light, a popular girl with a not-that-bad secret who falls forTanaka but not bitchy, a self-oblivious followerof Tanaka but can understand others, a delinquent-wannabe with a kind heart that was given already from first appearance, and a sister that helps set the series' fun-meter to higher bars.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is fast-paced, it is based on events not on thrills; it gives you what you need to know from the characters from their first or second appearance but it never slows down the tempo of the comedy and surprises.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "To open this very clearly, I do not believe this is a bad anime. I actually enjoyed it a lot, especially when I felt I knew where it was going. The characters, as introduced, are really fairly interesting. In the first few episodes one can see how they start to evolve. But then, disappointingly, it feels like all the characters get somewhat pretty quickly after they're introduced. So many things are introduced and then abandoned. Arcs are basically repeated. It feels like, relative to the length of the anime, so there could have been a lot less revisited and a lot more innovation. \r\nThe mostdisappointing thing is how much potential it feels like the characters and show had. The artwork was inventive and stunning at times, the characters seemed to be presented as to imply they would evolve from the tropes they started in. It represents enough tropes that I found it a useful point of reference in solidifying my interpretation of a few other shows. By the midway point I honestly really looked forward to seeing where everything that was set up would go, and so more than anything the show felt disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThis was not a bad anime, and it could have been a very good one. It was heartwarming and adorable, but if one sees the initial ambition and direction, it's difficult not to be a bit let down. However, I don't regret watching it and think it's a worthwhile short anime that can act as a reference point.",

As\u00ed que si eres amante del Slice of Life y la vida de los chicos de preparatoria, Tanaka-kun Wa Itsumo Kedaruge es para ti, y si no te gustan, tambi\u00e9n puedes darle una opotunidad a este g\u00e9nero, tal vez te haga cambiar de opini\u00f3n.\\n",

I was, to some degree, correct. \r\nThis anime is very laid back but it is also very funny. I found myself laughing at some point of each episode and although it is somewhatlike a compilation of shorts for some episodes it is highly enjoyable. Although Tanaka-kun does not have any cliche MC traits he still an MC we come to love.\\n\\n\r\nHis friend, Ohto, is also a great support character, supporting and understanding Tanaka-kun throughout the series. So much so it gives off a bromance vibe as Tanaka basically relies on this guy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not very serious but is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone and if that hasn't convinced you this anime is made by Silver Link studios, the same as Kokoro connect and Baka to test!!",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge. This show was a blast, and I would love to see more. Honestly I could probably watch four or five seasons of this slice of life show.\r\nThe story isn't really special. We follow our main character Tanaka as he lives his life being lazy and listless. Some events arise that bring more characters into the mix and we watch as these events disturb his normally peaceful days.\r\nThe art was great. The soundtrack also great. The intro song is slow and fits the anime perfectly and its also good enough to listen to outsideof the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make this show awesome. Tanaka is the main character and he goes to great lengths to preserve his lazy and peaceful days. He however is rather weak so his best friend Oota takes care of him. Oota is a large guy who carries Tanaka around and takes care of him like a wife. Miyano is an energetic girl who wants to learn the ways of maturity and laziness from Tanaka and proclaims herself his apprentice. Then you have Shiraishi who is the model student and plays the role of the odd love interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic and there are more to list but its rather hard to write more without spoiling some early plot lines. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I enjoyed this anime a lot. The comedy was excellent and had me smiling and laughing constantly. The interaction between the characters didn't seem forced or fake and even though it was a slice of life show it was still really interesting to see what happens next. Seriously you should give this one a watch. If you don't like the first episode you probably wont like the rest of the show, but I highly recommend trying it.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Great, every aspect was awesome. Comedy, characters, art, and sound all amazing. Highly recommend giving it a shot.",

I feel pretty glad that I'm giving one for this fantastic anime. the story of a tanaka-kun wa itsumo kedaruge can be described as the struggles faced by a lazy kid in his daily life. the comedy is good along with the story line. I'm not particularly interested in music so I may rate it as 7. you may get bored in the end, but the middle episodes are damn good. I enjoyed a lot while watching this, you may feel the same I actually love it. it stands as a refreshing anime like if you arewatching an anime with episodes more than 100, and if you are bored in middle, This will give you a time pass just like barakamon and usagi drop.",

            "content": "Why bother reading this? Well, at least that's what Tanaka-kun would've asked. And it's this personality of his that made this anime great. Being a character-driven show (at least in my view), it made us remember the characters than really care for the plot.\r\nSpeaking of plot, it was... okay. First of all, it's a comedy, so even if there was a plot, not many people would care about it. It's quite similar to ecchi, which you mostly watch for the fanservice.\r\nThe characters, however, are a different story, especially the MC. Now I've watched a lot of school-related anime with mediocre MCs, but Tanaka-kun isn't oneof them. He's lazy and listless, to the point that it's almost impossible for anyone to be that listless. It's this trait which made him unique. I could also relate to most of his antics since I get listless sometimes as well. It's his way of showing the things can relate to that made him all the more memorable. Together with his friends, they make the prefect comedic acts.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy myself? Heck yeah! And I recommend this to those who want some laughs. But don't bother analyzing the anime, because you'd be too listless to do it anyway after watching Tanaka-kun's daily life.\\n\\n",

            "content": "How far are you willing to go just to be lazy?  Would you write your name in braille just to avoid more pencil strokes?  Are you willing to walk through the rain if it means not putting in the work to hold an umbrella?  Or how about just skipping this anime and just read this review and make your opinion so that you don't have to keep your eyes open for another 4 hours?\r\nStory: What story?  It's only about a guy, Tanaka, who puts everything in his might just to do nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  He's lucky enough to havea friend, Outa, who likes him enough to carry him everywhere if it has a 0.0001% chance of doing something after.  They live their lives facing 12 episodes of cliche settings and scenarios.  The main thing that makes this anime more than worth a watch is the comedy for it is consistent, amusing, and some episodes are downright hilarious.  Most of the comedy that I found funny were Tanaka's explanations on to how far he is willing to go if it just means doing nothing.  The show was very relaxing and gave me a good laugh in the morning every weekend.\\n\r\nAs for my complaints, I would say episodes 1-9 were consistently ROFL funny but 10-11 were actually not all that interesting.  Tanaka began to be less funny because he was just being lazy instead of speaking his mind as to why he doesn't want to put in effort (which was where the comedy truly excelled in the show).  This factor will be different for every viewer.  Some might still like it all thorughout and some might get tired of it and feel that the comedy is waning earlier.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are definitely the strong core that holds the show together.  If you will be producing an episodic show, the characters matter much more than the scenario of each episode and Tanaka-kun wa Itsudemo Kedaruge without a doubt succeeded at that.  Tanaka is the lazy boy in class who always makes the viewers laugh as much as he's trying not to be funny.  Outa is the best friend who's amount of concern for people does not match his delinquent looks (seen it before but it still works).  Shiraishi was a stand out character who had a lot of funny moments but also added some depth to a few episodes for how she transformed from a dorky girl to the most respected student in class.  Echizen was a likeable tsundere who put on a tough girl act but had a soft spot for cute things such as another character Miyano.  The last character I will mention is Rino, Tanaka's imouto (cuz otoutotachi are uncool).  She is the kuudere of the series but she very cares for Tanaka and had a somewhat distant yet healthy relationship with him.  Plus her hatred for Outa for always stealing her onii-chan away from her was also very comedic.  There are some characters that were forgettable and less interesting but the interesting characters that I mentioned got more focus and carried the series well so I don't have any complaints.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Animation and art were solid.  But what caught my attention was the design of the high school.  If was more wooden than plaster and it made for a unique-looking setting and was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The score was not very apparent mainly because it was quiet all the times to fit the tone of the anime.  But the opening was very calming and I never felt like skipping it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Tanaka-kun is one of those anime that didn't aspire to be a lot but it mainly succeeded in what it wanted to be so I give this anime a lot of respect.  If you are down for slow and somewhat relaxing slice of life anime and you are in the mood for a laugh, then you should definitely give this a check-out.  This was the hidden gem of the season and I'm relieved to have found an anime that shows people that slice of life is one of anime's strongest genres when you find the right one.  I enjoyed this anime beginning to end and end was definitely satisfying.  Tanaka for all the effort you did not put in, I humbly rate this a 7/10.",

At first it might not seem like it, with the slightly boring synopsis and the fact that it's 'slice of life', not many people might want to watch it. I was like that at first, but felt like giving it a go since it seemed cute. \r\nAnd wow, that was a great decision.\r\nAlthough it is slice of life, the show adds great detail to their main characters and even adds more detail to background characters where a normal anime wouldn't. But wait, there's more!\r\nTanaka's story is such a fun one to follow, his friendship with Ohta absolutelyhilarious and, I have to admit, it's very cute. Not many animes show such a close platonic relationship without it being romantic. Especially with two men, although I doubt many people would mind.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fluffy and cute with humour in every episode. Each episode I laugh my ass off.

            "content": "With anime being swabbed to the floor with hundreds of anime about high school, I was a bit apprehensive to this show. The PV for this anime showcased bright colors with a main character who did not seem listless, but a main character who seemed like another quiet rebellious type. My expectations for this anime were quite low.\r\nHowever, I am glad to have watched this series. This show may not be the best anime that the 2016 year had to offer. But, the animators of Tanaka is always listless accomplished their goal with flying colors. The characters drove a very simple story, and did notdrag down the series. The comedy was a breath of fresh air that did not include many sexual jokes over its entire 1 cour. Tanaka is the star of the show, and the animator + voice actor who portrayed him should be commended because this anime is a showcasing of how subtlety within voicing and character design can create wonderful dynamics. Ohta and Shirashi as the main supporting cast were good as well, but I felt were too underutilized for this season, especially Shirashi. Echizen and Myaano were ok characters for me, but with their lack of screen-time beyond their couple of episodes made them forgettable for me, even if Myaano has an OST track that is completely dedicated to her. The characters of any Slice of Life is the life-blood of that series. The characters of Tanaka is Always Listless had great chemistry and fit well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is something that needs to be discussed because Slice of Life anime I feel throw away the story. Slice of Life anime should still have a direction, and I feel the lack of direction of Tanaka made this series have slow points multiple times in the series, especially towards the end. The reason for the slow down at the end is that this series started to lean on high school anime cliche Slice of Life episodes like the *Pool Episode*, which I still found hilarious. But, that should not excuse that the animators had a really good thing going for them in the first half of this anime with its exploration of its characters. There should have been some overall ending goal with its story. This lack of direction not only slowed down the pace closer to the end of the series. It ultimately gave a weak ending to a rather enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and animations for Tanaka are nothing to talk about. Sometimes the animation for Tanaka will be surprisingly good and smooth at points. The only issue is that when those times finish, the anime stays rather average for a hand-drawn anime. That is not to say that it looks bad, rather, Tanaka is an average looking anime with music that I found to be quite to forgettable, except for a few key tracks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Tanaka to be really enjoyable to watch. The characters are the star of this anime, and showcase that good character chemistry can make an oversaturated genre (High-School, Slice of Life; Comedy) anime can still be an enjoyable watch. The only downfalls of this anime come from its lack of an overarching story to guide its characters. The animation and sound did not do much to improve the anime as a whole. If I had to give 10 anime that anyone should watch from 2016, Tanaka would be on that list. It would be near the bottom, but being a top 10 anime is still pretty stellar. 8/10",

            "content": "When I first clicked on this anime and watched the first episode I have to admit: I didn't enjoy it. It was alright, but I was fully prepared to drop it until I saw that some of my friends had seen it and given it high ratings. So I decided to give it another shot and kept watching. \r\nAt first the pauses throughout the anime bugged me (you'll have to watch to get what I mean) I ended up loving them within a few episodes. I am so so glad that I kept watching. I loved this anime. So much. \r\nThe overall themes of friendship(and listlessness of course) are great, and the opening theme is fantastic. The art is amazing, and I love the characters. Although the ending did not satisfy me (simply because I wanted more episodes and I don't think they covered every story line they could have) it was still good and at least gave ending to one of the main stories.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mainly loved about this anime was the friendship between the two main characters, who are very close, and have an adorable and often humorous relationship throughout the anime. The other characters and their relationships with the two main characters are great as well, I quickly found myself becoming emotionally attached to them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme I really can't praise enough. I loved it so much, and I can't stop listening to it. It's really pretty and the lyrics are wonderful too.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I really want to repeat and bring attention to is the art. It's honestly really pretty. The main character especially is beautiful (a bit Haru (from Free!)  like in looks and personality, and I love the scenery. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say to definitely watch this, and if you're put off by the first episode don't let it stop you. I really loved this anime, it's characters, it's music, it's humor (I laughed a lot watching this anime), and it's heartwarming themes. I fully recommend this.\\n\\n\r\n(This is my first review so I'm sorry if it's bad ^.^)",

Now it is time to stumble headlong into my potentially spoiler filled review. \r\nI really enjoyed the first episode of Tanaka-kun, after watching I thought it would be a toothless show about a guy being lazy and his sweet loving friend helping him through daily life. While that is the main premise of the show is just that, the second episode introduces one of my favorite characters,Miyano. Now Miyano could have been any silly ditzy character but the show actually chooses to give her depth, as the main joke surrounding her is that she desires the ability to be calm and relaxed when her nature contradicts that to the extreme. That character flaw still would have felt hollow until you find out that she is doing it because of her good friend who she loves and wants to impress. Episode four is another heavy hitter dealing with the conflicting nature of how we wish to be perceived by others and how we are comfortable acting like our true selves. Now I wish I could say Tanaka-kun kept this up but sadly quite a few of the later episodes fall into a purely comedic category. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as for the most part I enjoyed the comedy of the show, I just wish it had kept up with those powerful character developing moments of the first four episodes. One thing I can say I loved all the way through is the music, here have a listen (plays music), I have listened to the OST of this show a few times though and I just can\u2019t get enough. It can be quirky and fun, relaxed and subdued and most of all I adore the instruments used! So if you are looking for a more laid back show with instances of solid character development \u201cTanaka-kun is Always Listless\u201d is just the show for you.",

However, my friend had watched it and recommended it to me. Turns out, it was a good anime!\r\nAccording to my friend, they say that it isn't a very popular anime, especially with the way the main character acts, the story, and in general the anime itself, but like they say, \"You can't judge a book by its cover\". It is true that for some people, it may be boring, and it doesn't have a storyto it. But that's the glory of it. Sometimes, you don't need a story to follow. It kind of explains LIFE right there.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely encourage to give this anime a chance. Or at least watch the first episode I wasn't sure about it myself, but as soon I started I realized this would be an anime I would love. It has a bit of comedy here and there, some romantic feelings here and there (but it doesn't go too deep down into it). It is very calm anime for those looking to pass time. I will admit that some episodes might be boring for some, but there are some really funny episodes and the characters are really funny and developed.",

            "content": "What is \"listless\"? Listless is the manner of lacking enthusiasm, interest or energy within a person. \r\nThe beginning of this anime Tanaka is laying in the shade of a tree on school grounds. While the camera takes its time to capture the worry-less Tanaka bathing on the cushion of the grass as the breeze of the wind comforts him as he sleeps. His friend Oota, large in stature and what could only be described as 'Yankee' with dirty blonde hair approaches Tanaka and asked \"what are you doing?\". These are the show's main characters. \r\nTanaka is the living example of the word lazy. Pale, thinand feminine, he is often lethargic and so uninterested that he could fall asleep or stare at nothing. The story tells us how this individual goes through his daily life and how such simple things bother him. Tanaka admires peace and does not like this being taken away from him. This usually means if there are things he has to put effort into then he would rather not bother with it to begin with. For example because of how slow walks he is, he would never buy anything perishable from the supermarket as products such as ice cream would often just melt by the time he arrives home. Though that being said, Tanaka is lazy enough that he would put some effort in if it meant he could be even more lazy later on.\\n\\n\r\nHis friend Oota is not only aware of Tanaka's listlessness but he is also very supportive of it. Oota's large physique means that he often helps people out whenever he can and would help Tanaka by looking after him and carrying him under his arm between classes, just so Tanaka is not late. I think it is fair to say that Oota enables Tanaka's listlessness but his caring personality often shines through in his own dependable and loving way. That and the rest of his class do not want to look after Tanaka.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, we get introduced to other characters such as Miyano who is a short, energetic and loud girl who wishes to be a mature and mysterious girl and believes that if she copies Tanaka's way of life that she can obtain her wish. This does not come without its own lot of shenanigans as a few more other characters also get introduced through this and causes problems for Tanaka's listless lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a very leisurely paced anime which is super light-hearted that you cannot help but enjoy the same laze that Tanaka feels. It is a very endearing anime which will make you appreciate the character interactions and maybe make you think or wish that your own relationship with friends were similar. Either way you will get a few laughs and is something to watch if you need something to cheer you up.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Watching.",

I just love this anime so much that I really want other people to know how great this is.\r\nWhen I first read the plot... I totally ignored this anime as I think it will be a boring anime. But as I have watched so many anime, there were many times that the plot is not that convincing but after watching it... it is totally unexpected, the story itself is great. So after 2 weeks after its release, I give this anime a chance and guess what... it easily captures my heart.\r\n\u2022 Story (9/10)\r\nThepacing of the story is quite fast maybe because it has no particular line of story, just random events of an everyday life of the protagonist. So if you're not a fan of this kind of setting, it might not satisfy you.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is well balanced as it is perfect for a school themed anime. The design for each characters is drawn perfectly and in lined with their personalities, which make each one of them stand out on their own distinct qualities. The colors used are not quite bright wherein I think it suit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending theme are both very suitable with the theme of the anime. Also the other sound effects used matches well with every scenes. And most specially the ending theme.... I LOVE IT VERY MUCH, it is really cute (I really like cute-like music).\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character (10/10)\\n\r\nSo far, the development for each characters is not in a slow or fast paced manner, but it is executed well. And each supporting characters have been doing their roles very well.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 OVERALL\\n\r\nIt might be your typical school themed anime that you can easily find everywhere in an anime BUT... I assure you that the comedy in this is very ENJOYABLE and REFRESHING. And you can't help but fall inlove with the protagonist or even with all the characters supporting the protagonist. Also, how can you resist if the protagonist is so listless that you want to cheer for him in overcoming the obstacles and challenges for each day even though it is not really a challenge for an average normal person. And because of that, it makes this anime unique.\\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND this anime.\\n\r\nThis anime is worth your time, every second of it. I assure you that you will not be disappointed, and you might surprise yourself that you will feel very happy that you have watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLets support Tanaka-kun!\\n\r\nI hope there will be Season 2.\\n\r\nI miss him already.",

He will do anything for the sake of relaxing. I can very much relate to him but not to his extent, wherein he does it at a very huge length. His bestfriend, Ohta, is his forever slave, who cares for Tanaka so much that he's willing to carry him for Tanaka not toget tired. There's a lot of other characters that are likable and funny, like the kawaii Miyano, the beautiful relatable Shiraishi, funny tomboy Ecchan, doppelganger Rino, pretty Saya, funny duo Kato and Shimura. There's no character to dislike. It is so comforting !!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are so fantastic. The funny thing is, the OP is so relaxing and the ED is upbeat which is unusual for other animes. The seiyuus did a maginificent job at portraying the characters, especially Kensho Ono (Kuroko no Basuke) who voiced Tanaka-kun, he really embodied the tired voice and zero presence that the show needed. The other seiyuus too, are a perfect fit. They are funny bunch indeed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode and every scene of the show and am so happy I had watched this anime, this anime brings out happiness in you without much effort unlike other \"hype\" animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it totally deserve a 10 for its perfection !! :D",

It's weird because I never get hyped for the next episode unlike other shows but when I watch it I feel calm and relaxed, and after finishing each episode I'm always left in a good mood making it amazing.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThis anime doesn't really have a main storyline but it's how the characters, mainly Tanaka, deal with everyday life and events hence being a Slice of Life show. Because of the great characters the story for each episode doesn't fall out of place. Iguess the only progression you'd find is how Tanaka finds measures in becoming more and more listless no matter the situation and its fun just to watch him try.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art style is simple yet aesthetically pleasing which fits right in the show. The simplicity creates an atmosphere that personifies Tanaka's personality. It was well thought out and is beautiful to watch at least from my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music also fits right in being 'lazy-like' and calm. You could probably even use the OST for your sleep playlist. \\n\r\nNow the OP is pretty good, it being the only OP that I don't skip for each episode this season which is saying something. \\n\r\nThe actors did a good job in portraying their characters especially Tanaka's VA who really captured what a listless person would be like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThese characters are the most original I've seen in a while except for Miyano (the hyper-active, child-like dwarf) and Echizen (a tsundere in a way) but those are supporting characters and they're what make this show more interesting since Tanaka interacts with a flip-side version of him. \\n\r\nTanaka himself is very creative when it comes to looking for ways to becoming more and more listless and Ohta is an obliging person who always takes care of Tanaka but sometimes misunderstands situations. This basically tells you that the show can be quite funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe characters' interactions with each other are enjoyable to watch especially the main characters. You don't really feel as if you need more after each episode since there isn't a storyline as I've mentioned before but when a new episode comes out you'll always have the need to watch it.\\n\r\nKnowing that this show is over makes me want more, ironically. I usually just expect new episodes to appear sometime each week but since there aren't any I can't help but miss it.\\n\r\nEach episode is like a dose of relaxation that you need each week; almost like a drug taken in moderation. It is a masterpiece in its own right.",

            "content": "this is a good anime to watch.\r\nIf you wanted to watch a light, refreshing theme this anime is a must watch.\r\nFor starters, a lazy character is not a new thing in anime but centralizing the story on being listless or should we say lazy feels is what it gives the anime the humor that anybody could enjoy. Tanaka has this deep thinking on how he can establish his listlessness on level exert on human expectation. LOL... but his laziness and way of thinking is just pretty humorous. \r\nCharacter design and art design are very well done, not heavy in the eye for it is alaid back anime. Light strokes and colors mixed well in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound is good. The OP is very cool, some sound like the BG is well suited as the art is light, it blended well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are laid back as it give the supporting role to Tanaka's weird antics. When you know your lead is lazy, it needs a supporting character who is different from the lead. Ohta who is responsible and opposite of Tanaka matches the mood as it is needed to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe impact of this anime is pretty much good, hilarious and well establish plot. The main point here is that how can i be listless every damn day and it is executed as seen in every episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is an overall top notch anime that you can watch without worrying about anything at all. It will give you a good ride of happiness as it revolves in his listlessness. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Tanaka-kun - such a sweet and silly anime. It's so relaxing to just sit back and enjoy the funny antics. With a humorous premise expanded upon well enough, stellar art/sound direction, and great characters, this slice of life is well worth the time put in.\r\n[Story - 8]\r\nThe premise was enough for me to check this out - the daily life of high school student Tanaka(-kun), who is listless to the point of it being a primary objective in life. Of course, this is hard to achieve when you're a student who has to balance schoolwork with an adequate social life, and so we followhis adventures in trying to maintain all 3 well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the anime follows through on this - from seeing how he copes at a local pool to having to deal with sickness, tons of laughs are to be had! Seeing how various people, such as his friends and random passerbys, react to his behaviour is always worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also themes of connections to others (such as the proper give-and-take in these relationships and how to form them), which are explored well enough to warrant a follow-up season to see how they evolve from there. \\n\\n\r\nI do, however, wish that there wasn't a romance subplot. It's just me probably, but I honestly don't believe that it would work well with this specific premise, and I found that it detracted a bit from some of the characters' potential development.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 9]\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was honestly really astonishing to see. I wasn't expecting a lot, but it's really surprising to see how much detail was put in. For example, the background/setting artwork is beautifully rendered with a soft/warm palette of colours and just enough detail to warrant a slightly-closer look at times. I'd even dare to say they vaguely resemble a Makoto Shinkai movie at times with how beautiful these can turn out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design isn't too exemplary, though - while it is successful in distinguishing and conveying each character's core traits, it does fall into some typical anime tropes at times. This is a nitpick, though, so your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting was pretty good! It's like the character design - while it can fall into some typical anime tropes at times, all the seiyuus did well in capturing the 'essence' of their roles. Shout-out to Tanaka's and Ohta's for doing this so well, of course - their banter and range of expression is admirable.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are SO darn cute - the OP is rather upbeat, but soft enough to reflect the show's atmosphere, while the ED is exclusively the former and provides a nice pick-me-up after the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual OST is pretty solid too - while it isn't /super/ memorable, its melodies, ranging from soft/slow to sharp/brisk (primarily performed on a piano and some woodwind instruments) suit the show well in its various scenes of listlessness, comedy, and heartwarming moments. It actually makes for good background music while you study or nap ;) \\n\\n\r\n[Character - 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization in this show is pretty solid, albeit with a couple of drawbacks. Again, the character design + voice-acting lead to some occasional Typical Anime Tropes, but otherwise these characters are enjoyable enough. \\n\\n\r\nTanaka is....well, he's listless, but he can be rather dedicated to certain objectives, along with being more friendly at times. His friend/caretaker/potential husband Ohta is the straight-man of the two-person act, and thus provides contrast by being more active (both in his own world and in Tanaka's) and serious (at times). \\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that, while not the primary actors, receive enough attention to have a proper 'arc' + have enough depth to be enjoyed. Example: Miyano, while being the Overexcited Gal Pal, shows a desire to be the best possible friend for Echizen, a fellow student who falls into the 'delinquent' trope but nonetheless has a rather soft side to herself. These two have arcs both for themselves and with each other, as they learn about the other's struggle and realize just how much they appreciate each other. Naturally, there is tons of comedy to be had here - from Miyano being the 'apprentice' of Tanaka to Echizen's aggressiveness confronting Tanaka's sleepy nature, it's a fun ride.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there is the 'romance' subplot that I found unsuitable. Shiraishi is the \"love interest\" (you'll see) here, and while I do enjoy her a lot, I wish that she was either reduced to a supporting role like Miyano's or received less stereotypical writing. She's fine on her own, as she has her own arc (confronting her identity as a Star Student) and is a generally likable girl who has a great dynamic with everyone. However, seeing her constantly thirst after Tanaka and try so hard for him was a bit annoying, as it's clear that he isn't interested (at least for now).\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 9/8]\\n\\n\r\nDespite a couple of flaws/nitpicks here and there, I had a lot of fun with this show. It's nice to just kick back and enjoy some slice of life every once in a while, especially one with a premise ripe for humour. I highly recommend this to anyone, even people who want to try anime for the first time - it's short, filled with both humour and sweetness, and shows a couple of the medium's stronger points.",
