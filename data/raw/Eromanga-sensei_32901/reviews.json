            "content": "I don't normally tend to point fingers at people, but just this once I feel like I need to get some things off my chest here.\r\nAlmost every single season nowadays, it seems there has to be a scapegoat. An anime which you are somehow obliged to publically hate on or you'll be looked down upon by the community and no one will take you seriously. I'm honestly sick of this kind of group pressure/bandwagon mentality. We're now halfway through the year 2017 and yet hating on popular stuff over the internet is somehow still considered to be the coolest and best thing since sliced bread.*Especially* when it's gross, creepy and immoral shit made for closet pedos, am I right? Shows like this really bring out the most toxic sides of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have an anime which totally wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn't try to hide its true intentions in any way, why is it that so many people seemingly insist on still making themselves watch it even when it's clear as day that they're not going to like it and that they're not part of the target audience? Eromanga-sensei is one of the most blatantly polarizing series in the last few seasons, and quite frankly you should be able to easily figure out whether you will enjoy it or not just from reading the synopsis and by considering the fact that it is written by the same author as Oreimo.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Eromanga-sensei features the following:\\n\r\n- A glimpse into the life of a young, aspiring light novel author in Japan\\n\r\n- Lots of references to other anime, light novels, the industry itself and more\\n\r\n- Pseudo-incestuous relationship themes (they're not actually blood-related)\\n\r\n- Somewhat trope-filling and eccentric characters\\n\r\n- Cutesy moe-style heroines\\n\r\n- Frequent suggestive shots of various middle school girls\\n\r\n- An abundance of romcom clich\u00e9s and sexual gags\\n\r\n- Memes\\n\r\n- Cameos of characters from Oreimo\\n\r\n- The perfect setup for providing tons of juicy ero-fanart and doujins\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have a problem with several of these themes, you don't need to watch this anime. It really isn't any more complicated than that. It is clearly not for you, and you don't need to go out of your way to force yourself to watch it just so you can go on a lengthy rant afterwards about how trashy it is, how it is \"pandering to otaku\", label it as \"pedo-bait\" or anything along those lines. If you're not even part of an anime's target demographic then quite frankly you have no business trash-talking it for not adhering to your own standards\u2014the problem lies entirely on your end in that case. Criticizing an anime for its execution is logical\u2014criticizing an anime for merely belonging to a certain genre is not. You don't need to go on the aggressive from the safe place behind your monitor just to feel better about yourself. If your sole reason for watching an anime is to make fun of and insult the people enjoying it, you really need to get your priorities straight. Even more curious are some comments I've seen basically saying \"i-it's not like I enjoy watching this terrible anime or anything, don't get the wrong idea, baka!\", as if implying that either their morals or the group pressure is preventing them from admitting to themselves that they actually like it. Give me a break already.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, as someone who actually does enjoy those kinds of themes and absolutely loves imoutos in general, Eromanga-sensei is a pretty solid anime that does just about all the simplistic things I could ask of it. It's cute, light-hearted, decently funny at times, has a lot of sexy shots of ero-kawaii and energetic moe girls, and is just plain fun and enjoyable in general. And as a result, what you have is a thoroughly entertaining anime despite everything. Yes, that is in fact all that's needed, as shocking as that might be for some people to believe.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Eromanga-sensei follows the lives of a high school light novel author named Izumi Masamune and his hikikomori little sister Sagiri, who somewhat secretly works as an erotic illustrator for his novels amongst other things under the pen name Eromanga-sensei. The story follows both their struggles with their respective jobs as well as their relationship with each other as step siblings. There are also a number of other girls involved in one way or another, primarily the eccentric Yamada Elf who is also a top-selling light novel author, as well as the even more successful Senju Muramasa who on top of being an author is also Masamune's biggest fan. There's also Sagiri's pushy classmate Jinno Megumi who keeps trying to find ways to convince Sagiri to leave her room and go to school for once. It's a simple setup overall, but it serves as an easy way to get the protagonist and the various girls intimately involved with each other on both a personal and professional level, which is a good thing since the main selling point of Eromanga-sensei is the characters' interactions with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, it is all quite similar to Oreimo in not just the incestuous themes but the type of chemistry between the main characters and the side characters as well. And as it happens, they generally fulfill somewhat similar roles too. Just like Kirino, Sagiri is here the otaku imouto with a rather perverted hobby who is also quite obviously in love with her Onii-chan. In terms of personality though, they're very different from each other. Whereas Kirino was an outgoing honors student and a rather extreme tsundere, Sagiri is shy, reclusive and more of a dandere than anything, and she gets embarrassed easily whenever she's not hiding behind the mask of her online Eromanga-sensei persona. But perhaps most importantly, just like Kirino, Sagiri is incredibly sexy. The vast majority of the show's fanservice is centered on her in the form of various suggestive shots of her inside her room, but it's done in a rather smooth and natural way so it doesn't feel out of place. It's the type of eroticism which greatly enhances an anime's enjoyment value in my mind; the kind that makes you repeatedly pause the video to rape the screenshot button for academic purposes. I appreciate it quite a lot. It's no wonder that Sagiri has already been crowned the clear ero-fanart queen of the season by the Japanese portion of the internet, as is quite evident if you go visit just about any major anime image board at the moment (which is also a bit ironic considering that drawing such pictures is literally what Sagiri does for a living herself).\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, if Sagiri is supposed to be \"the new\" Kirino, then you'd also have to argue that Elf is the new Kuroneko. Elf is the energetic and weird yet funny girl of the show, being an immensely talented writer but also a rather lazy one who only sees her work as a hobby, and thus only writes whenever she feels like it, much to the dismay of her editors. Furthermore, she's also a bit of a chuuni nutcase who consistently does stupid things for the amusement of all. As a result, while she's not quite as sexualized as Sagiri is, overall I would still say Elf is the most likable and entertaining girl of Eromanga-sensei due to how enjoyable her personality is. In other words it's pretty much the same story as with Oreimo where (in my opinion) Kuroneko was ultimately the best girl even though Kirino was sexy as hell. For all the old Ayase fans out there though, I'm sorry to say but there isn't really a replacement for her in Eromanga-sensei. Instead we have Muramasa taking the role of the third love rival, but she's not particularly similar. If anything she's the most publically affectionate towards Masamune out of the trio, but for rather... questionable reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story itself goes, the viewers are pretty much told from the beginning that this will eventually head down the pseudo-incest route as Masamune and Sagiri are evidentially in love with each other and Masamune makes it quite clear on numerous occasions that she is the only girl he has eyes for. While he is still a little bit dense at times, Masamune at least has the guts to confess that he is in love with Sagiri from quite early on in the series, which is pretty commendable considering their relationship. However, it will probably take a while before that ship really sets sail, because in this (first?) season alone, there isn't really much in the way of romantic progression beyond that confession. It is more of a standard romcom in terms of execution thus far, but certainly not a bad one. Meanwhile we also have the ongoing subplot of the siblings trying to create the supposed \"greatest light novel ever\" together where Masamune writes the story and Sagiri draws the illustrations. It reminds me a bit of Bakuman in that sense, but of course it's not quite as forefront about it here. However, this subplot is most certainly something that really asks for a sequel one day.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Eromanga-sensei though is that despite everything, Masamune and Sagiri aren't actually blood-related. The main appeal of incest in anime to me is the general taboo feeling of it, you know: \"it's forbidden, therefore it's exciting\" and all. Making them step-siblings instead is thus both a bit of a boner-killer as well as a cop-out move by the author, and it kind of feels like the anime goes out of its way to remind the audience of this annoying fact a few too many times. However, if you're familiar with the infamous ending of Oreimo and more importantly the backstory behind why that happened in the first place, this was most likely a conscious decision by the author in order to make sure the same thing won't happen a second time around. Oreimo was kind of ruined by its terrible ending, so having the knowledge that at least Eromanga-sensei won't suffer the same fate is a bit of a relief. I just wish he didn't have to sacrifice part of the show's main appeal to ensure this part, but I guess SJWs are unfortunately just that powerful in today's society.\\n\\n\r\nYou probably shouldn't compare everything to Oreimo though\u2014after all this is just as much of a standalone work as that was\u2014but considering that even the main characters of Oreimo makes appearances in Eromanga-sensei, they're not only similar but evidentially also take place in the same universe and time span. For what it's worth though, minus its ending I would still probably say Oreimo was slightly better not only because of the blood-relation issue, but there was also more of a struggle there due to Kirino's conservative father being fully against her otaku hobbies, whereas in Eromanga-sensei, Masamune's parents are both conveniently absent from their house. It all feels a bit easier in Eromanga-sensei, which is not inherently a bad thing mind you but I think it makes it a little bit less unique. Then again, as they say: \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the production values goes, the animation (done by A-1 Pictures) is... okay, I guess? Nothing out of the ordinary but enough for the girls to always look attractive, which is about all that's required in this case. On top of that, both the OP and ED of Eromanga-sensei are honestly great; they're both incredibly catchy tunes that easily stand out as among the best from this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eromanga-sensei is a simplistic, clich\u00e9 and quite lewd romcom which will surely turn off a lot of people due to its themes, but it excels at doing the exact things it sets out to do for its own specific target audience, and thus at least for me it was one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.\\n\\n\r\nI also find it a bit ironic how other shows like New Game for example (which I also really liked) get to receive general praise from the community for doing nothing but showing cute moe girls working in the entertainment media industry, mixed with comedy and fanservice, yet Eromanga-sensei is receiving so much hate for doing basically the exact same thing? Hypocrisy at its finest. Are the incest themes really *that* big of a deal? Or is it the supposed ages of the girls? I mean really now? I can't help but feel legitimately sorry for people who let something like that ruin their enjoyment of an anime.",

            "content": "Something I find hilarious is that no one can explain why Eromanga Sensei is a good show. I see people giving this an 8-10 rating and saying it's a good show, but not once I've seen anyone mentioning any legitimate good quality about Eromanga except for: \"it's cute\", \"Sagiri is so cute\", \"it has cute girls\", \"incest is wincest\". This may be unfair since I shouldn't be trashing on anyone's likings and I believe people have the right to enjoy whatever the hell they like, but I cannot shake the annoyance that some people are just satisfied with anything at this point. Trust me, Ilike cute girls and lolis as much as the next guy does, but somewhere somehow we need to draw the line and notice when our intelligence is being insulted. Does the only thing that an anime needs is for it to have cute girls, some type of incestuous relationship, a copy/paste generic protagonist (that took no effort to create), a bunch of terribly forced memes and loli fanservice for us anime fans to be all over it on social media and be supporting this garbage? If this isn't an insult to the viewer's intelligence then I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who do not know, this story was done by the same people who made the highly controversial Light Novel (later adapted into an anime), My Little Sister Can't be this Cute (better known as OreImo). Apart from targeting a niche audience with the sibling romance subplot, OreImo is infamous for receiving harsh backlash from fans upon its completion for its trash ending. Details were revealed that the LN editors did not allow Tsukasa Fushimi to go through with a full incest ending.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping this in mind, it becomes very apparent that Eromanga Sensei is trying to be OreImo. Not only does this series do a terrible job at copying all the elements that made OreImo successful, but it makes sure to establish the single fact that led to the downfall of the show. It utilizes one of the most used loopholes sibling romances do to get away with what they're doing by making sure everyone knows that the two main characters ARE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. Did you hear that? THEY'RE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. The previews make sure you know this, the manga makes sure you know this, the anime makes damn sure you know this.\\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to believe anyone genuinely thinks Eromanga Sensei will not have the brother & sister get it on at some point. It only takes a fraction of knowledge about the author, OreImo and its history to know this has been created just because the author hasn't gotten over his sister fetish. Even so, there are a bunch of other female characters (not)worth mentioning. The thing is, none of these characters seem remotely interesting or feel like real people. They're walking anime tropes that will only exist for the purpose of having the main guy hang around with other girls than his sister and to let the audience have a bit of variety. I have checked the manga and there is no indication they will get interesting enough to carry this bad comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI found it very sickening how cynical and shamelessly Eromanga Sensei tries to bait the siscon/lolicon audience. Countless promising shots of the girls (especially the FREAKING 10-YEAR-OLD) are shown to obviously excite the viewer and trust me, I don't want to be the normie guy who trashes the sexualization of kids in anime, but these are literally middle schoolers. Like, this show is WAY too in your face with fanservice shots. Only 4 episodes in and we've basically seen the little sister naked at least 3 times already. It doesn't even try to hide the fact that they want to attract \"that\" type of audience, and what bothers me is that they're so out of place. Eromanga Sensei does this so much I'm kinda creeped out that full grown men have such cynical mentality to attract people into their mediocre show with a few ass/breast shots of little girls (if this was an ecchi series I could understand, but Eromanga is not). Every episode gets so much worse with the fanservice it reaches to a point that is just absurd, even for modern anime standards. I honestly feel like I need to call the cops ASAP while watching Eromanga Sensei, just for witnessing the amount of pedophilic vibes this series gives off. If you're into that stuff, then knock yourself out I guess...\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk a little bit more about the characters: they all suck. Every single one gets on my nerve, and the one who doesn't (the black haired who works as a librarian) is so uninteresting it's shocking. First off, the main girl is the lolicon's/siscon's dream imouto, a ridiculously cute, empty shell of a girl who's only noteworthy characteristics are that acts like a tsundere, refuses to leave her room and draws porn for fun. The main guy is generic MC #198,567 (he's voiced by Kirito ffs) who has a terrifying obsession with his sister. People accuse Kyouske of being a terrible siscon, but Masamune is on another level. When he's not screaming, he's ranting on how beautiful his 10-year-old sister is and you can just feel this guy wants to bang her brains out. OreImo at least had the decency to slowly develop the sibling romance, and most of the side characters were interesting and felt like real people (Kuroneko alone makes OreImo a better show btw). The other characters in Eromanga Sensei are stock templates and not worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nPeople criticize OreImo for being a bad anime with nothing new to say, and solely aimed at the siscon/lolicon otaku audience. I find these allegations funny because I've seen those same people dare to claim this is better than OreImo. Unlike Eromanga Sensei, OreImo HAD something to say (nothing that hasn't been explored, but nevertheless it was something). In part, OreImo's first season had a couple interesting themes like the exploration on otaku culture in Japan, the difficulties of liking something that is heavily looked down upon in society and those around you, and the evolving friendship (ultimately romantic interest) between two different types of siblings. Eromanga Sensei, on the other hand, is a soulless, empty copy of its predecessor that could only appeal to the type of people it is obviously intended for. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that bothered me the most about Eromanga Sensei is that it tries so damn hard to create memes. This show is just asking, BEGGING to be the next meme on Twitter. From having a character's first trait being that \"SHE LOVES DICKS\", to having the main loli have a cute (completely out of character) dance at the beginning and opening themes that is begging you with red letters to make a gif out of it and share it with your friends. The show constantly has looping, cute or \"funny\" moments that are obviously intended to be the laugh of the week (this isn't Konosuba, so it doesn't work). Since the show is trying so hard to be a meme, I propose we treat it as such. The meme of the season. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I have nothing more to say in this unorganized rant. I really needed to get this anger I have towards this show off my chest somehow and hopefully open some eyes. If you have nothing to watch this season, maybe you would want to check out Eromanga Sensei. Watching one episode a week is more easy to pass than when a series is completed (it's the only reason why I might watch some more; also to possibly rant about it some more in the future). However, expect a \"moe-blob\" of a series that shamelessly copies its big brother and all the cliches of the industry. As I indirectly suggest throughout this review, if you want to watch a similar show done by the same people and with the same ideas, watch OreImo if you haven't and do not waste your time on this. It has a more refreshing and interesting cast than Eromanga, it connects much better with the ideas it's trying to present and is overall more presentable than this garbage. The thing that bothers me the most is that Eromanga Sensei is becoming extremely popular amongst anime fans. To my understanding, it has been very successful in preorder sales in Japan and it is very talked about in online communities. Yes, all those meme attempts have been working so far, and people are loving the ass shots of Sagiri and Megumi saying she loves dicks. This motivates the industry into producing more of this quality of anime, and we all know anime deserves much better. All I can say is that I really hope Eromanga Sensei gets forgotten after the season ends and it's remembered as the cheap theatrics it is, or at least I hope so.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is my proof that every day we stray further from Kamisama, and that Miyazaki-sensei was right about anime all along.",

            "content": "For better and for worse (mostly worse), Eromanga-sensei is the successor to OreImo and its themes of sister-banging. But where OreImo had some interesting things to say about the otaku community, Eromanga-sensei possesses nothing, and is nothing, puerile and creatively bankrupt. \r\nEromanga-sensei in many ways represents everything that is bad with light novels. It is a story (I guess, if we put aside its flagrantly incestual nature) of a group of twelve-to-fifteen-year-olds who are famous artists, as if adults do not and cannot exist. If Eromanga-sensei was taking inspiration from the scribbles of a bunch of middle school students, its rubbish writing would actually makea great deal of sense.\\n\\n\r\nStop me if you've heard this one before: the protagonist and a sexy lady, both being inexperienced in the affairs of love, try to imitate romantic situations with one another as a source of creative inspiration. No? How about the protagonist's rival conveniently being revealed as a cute girl who is desperately in love with him? Or the heroine angrily retreating to her room and screaming \"bakaaa!\" as the camera pans away? See, Eromanga-sensei isn't an anime that is particularly concerned with sharing anything you haven't already seen in dozens or hundreds of other equally brain-dead romantic comedies. (And seriously, if I have to watch another anime with a hikikomori heroine who is portrayed as some goddess of attraction, I'm going to have an aneurysm.)\\n\\n\r\nI suppose the difference here is that Eromanga-sensei is neither romantic nor comedic. It sure as hell is not funny (unless you are the type who thinks burping is the pinnacle of comedic genius), and its 'romance' is merely a thinly-veiled attempt to make it seem somewhat less like masturbation fodder. Fodder which, by the way, has a regularly sexualised heroine who is only twelve-years-old. Let that sink in for a second: twelve-years-old. She is twelve, and the anime frequently displays detailed shots of her ass, her panties, her naked body, and so forth, and even thinks it is amusing to have her friend (who is the same age, by the way) howling about how she loves penises. Yeah. Really. \\n\\n\r\nEven if lolicon pornography does not bother you, it would be an impossible task to claim this contributes to the story or the characters in any meaningful way. It actively sabotages whatever emotional value it tries to create between Sagiri and Masumune's relationship, and makes it impossible to take seriously anything that happens or could conceivably happen. For example, the anime will reveal Masamune's tragic past in the span of about one minute, and then immediately open the next episode with a girl clad in her bikini and flirting with him. Eromanga-sensei doesn't even do the incest part right since it is more concerned with creating some periphery harem for Masamune than it is with developing his feelings for Sagiri beyond \"hey I like you lol.\" It is stupid on the level of KonoSuba and yet has the audacity to pretend without a hint of sarcasm that it is some touching story. No.\\n\\n\r\nIt is actually a fairly sad result when compared to the author's previous work, OreImo. OreImo, flawed and infuriating as it was, actually put a great deal of time into making Kirino and Kyosuke's feelings for one another feel meaningful. Kirino was no doubt insufferable, but by the end, you could at least look at her as something more than an assortment of tropes and incest appeal. Likewise, it also went into a fair amount of detail with regards to the life of a stereotypical otaku. It represented Comiket, eroge, offline meetings, and the conflict people can have when they possess hobbies they are ashamed of. It was no Genshikan, but OreImo did at least try to contribute something to the industry with more appeal than \"well, gee, banging your sister sounds like a fun idea.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for Eromanga-sensei, which does and says nothing about the industry. Any moment when it does display the struggles of Masamune's career, it is extremely, unbearably dull, and often propelled by silly plot devices like one of his love interests offering all their royalties in return for Masamune becoming their slave. The whole premise of being a light novel author is an accessory that may as well not even exist. If you stripped all the fanservice away, all that would expose is the show's unsightly skeleton. \\n\\n\r\nI can't think of any situation where Eromanga-sensei could come as a recommendation. It is asinine dreck, without so much as a modicum of creativity. I suppose its colourful art and catchy opening animation may lead some people into thinking the anime is more than it truly is, but it is best to be honest: the sole reason anyone likes this show is because they want to bone the twelve-year-old heroine. \\n\\n\r\nNow how much merit is there in a story like that?\\n\\n\r\nI'd wager not a whole not.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is a culmination of everything I hate in lazy, insipid, vacuous, pandering entertainment. Now, to clarify, first of all, I don't believe that just because an anime, or any piece of entertainment, panders towards a certain demographic, that it is inherently bad necessarily. There has been plenty of anime that pander towards the otaku audience while, at the same time, remaining fun, and some instances, good shows, but Eromanga-sensei is not such an example. It's a show that lives by the convention in terms of its plot structure, comedy, character archetypes and dives head first into trashiness at any moment it can get. Whatcould have been an interesting look into why and how people who shut themselves inside their homes live on a daily basis, akin to something along the lines of Welcome to the N.H.K or something, the show just decides to opt out instead for loli fan-service instead, ditching anything that made Oreimo, somewhat enjoyable, and, in some parts, decent. Before I continue, I'd just like to clarify that I am not hating on this show just because the original creator also created Oreimo. As I just said, I found that show to be decent (until the ending anyway) but it also had a few things that I could appreciate when it comes to meta humour about otaku and the anime industry as a whole. Eromanga-sensei has none of that. It's pointless, empty and has no value as a show at all. It's trash in every sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before I dive into the numerous reasons as of why I believe this show to be as poor as I think it is, let's discuss the plot first of all. Masamune is a somewhat successful, trashy light novel author who has been writing for several years now to support his younger step-sister, Sagiri, a shut-in, t, who refuses to go out and stamps on the floor of her bedroom whenever she wants anything. While Masamune writes these books and even has illustrations done for him, he doesn't actually know who this illustrator actually is, who goes by the name 'Eromanga-sensei' who actually turns out to be Sagiri herself! That's right! A 13-year-old girl draws erotic pictures! Oh boy! Anyway, the rest of the show sees Masamune and Sagiri begin to bond and grow closer together, while splicing in some romance between the two (because that's needed between siblings, am I right?) while Masamune is challenged by numerous other light novel authors in the business for slots in magazines, eventually becoming their friends and going along their merry way. The show's narrative is incredibly simple and boring to boot since there is no objective or even direction in the story. It moves awkwardly from scene to scene with no sense of flow or reasoning behind any of the characters and the entire show just feels like one big filler arc from a long-running shounen series or something. Now, I'm not saying that all anime need some kind of story, especially if it is going for comedy, but Eromanga's comedy in itself is poor, repetitive and so predictable, mostly derivative from seeing characters becoming embarrassed at removing their clothing, or from juvenile misunderstandings. One such example is a joke centred around a gay misunderstanding, in which another light novel author believes that Masamune is gay and has the hots for him, resulting in some of the most dreadful gags in the show. It feels like a 14-year-old wrote the entire thing, which is ironic, considering that I can only imagine that demographic finding this sort of weak comedy actually funny. \\n\\n\r\nSagiri's problem of being a shut-in was the only, the ONLY thing that the show had going for it and it throws it out so fast! I was genuinely interested to see what the show may do with this element; perhaps comment on the bigger picture of shut-ins in Japan perhaps, or delve into the psychological reasons behind this character's reasoning for why she has to say inside, but nope! They ditch this element and Masamune doesn't even try and help her with this issue at all and instead panders towards. He doesn't try to make her see why this is a problem, nor does his try to help her go into the outside world or anything. Sagiri is there just to be cute and that's it! We hardly learn anything about her as a person and she is such a brat that I can't stand every moment that she is on screen. Like most bad shows, the anime attempts to throw incest into the mix, and it comes across as so forced and disgusting. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which isn't actually related to me by blood, the thought of Masamune and Sagiri entering into a romantic relationship generally disgusts me to no end and all I hear people shout is \"INCEST IS WINCEST\" constantly, actually hoping the two will get together in the end. I also just hate the general excuse of \"oh! They're not related by blood, so it's fine!\". No, it's not. It's just as creepy and strange. To me, this aspect of the show baffles me, and I've never understood the appeal of little sisters in anime. This problem is also highlighted by the fact that we have young 13-year-old girls proclaiming that they love dicks out in public, just for all of the filthy weebs to rub their dicks at the thoughts of seeing this in action or something. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things the show has received a lot of flak for is the excessive amounts of loli fan-service all around; most of the cast consists of young girls, who are consistently put into revealing swimsuits or underwear. Now, I don't necessarily have any problem with fan-service in a series, as long as it serves some kind of purpose or is not intrusive on the narrative at any point. \\n\r\nIt feels like Eromanga-sensei's fan-service scenes were made for the sole purpose of padding the episodes out and the whiplash from seeing a bunch of kids half naked, to a heartfelt speech about love is so jarring that it makes each one of these scenes an absolute chore to watch since you know that nothing is happening and is just killing time. Not only that, but the situations the show sets up for its fan service feels just as equally as contrived and weak, and it's not like the fan-service by itself is even that alluring either as the animation and art style is rather generic and uninspired. While not a good show by any stretch, the currently airing Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, is a much better example of a fan-service vehicle since it is full frontal with its trashiness and doesn't try to hide underneath the pretence of being any more than that like Eromanga-sensei does with its terrible attempt of sounding more emotional and deep. The show has a plethora of more emotional moments and speeches between each of its characters, all of which are generic, but the main problem is that they feel like a cheap attempt at making these characters have more depth than they actually have. Nowhere is this more evident than in the penultimate episode of the show, where we learn that Masamune and Sagiri were contacting each other over the internet even before they met and formally became siblings. This twist feels needlessly convenient and lazy. That's the best word I can use to summarise this show: it's lazy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, every single one are essentially archetypes of already existing characters that have been done to much better effect in the past. As such, I often inadvertently find myself comparing them to similar characters, even when I dislike doing so as I wish to treat each piece of media as its own thing. Masamune is your generic main lead, who has a kind soul, is a hard, earnest worker, has a soft voice while getting embarrassed and flustered whenever a girl is revealing any clothing within his proximity. Oh, and every girl falls in love with him, just because the plot demands them to do so! Sagiri, likewise, has very little to offer in terms of character or personality. As I have already mentioned, I disliked this character, with a burning passion! She is so selfish, and acts so much like a brat, screaming \"ONII-CHAN IS A BAKA!\" at the top of her lungs that I feel like reaching through the monitor of my laptop and slapping her in her face. While, yes, she does warm up to her big brother to a certain extent (a little too much if you know what I mean) her character is just incredibly stale and unoriginal. She has no merits at all, and as I have already discussed, any possible potential for her development in regards to her shut-in problem is thrown completely out the window because the show is too lazy to even have one decent idea. We do learn the back-stories to both Sagiri and Masamune, something I can appreciate, it feels so tacked on and forced that it leaves no impact, and, instead, feels like, again, a lazy and cheap way for the audience to care about these two without building up their characters at all. A sad and tragic back-story is a good way to make a character feel tragic and helps the audience empathise with them, but the character also has to develop too and, at the same time, be well written, which this show fails at.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my hatred for Sagari (and little sisters in anime in general), even she is nowhere near as bad as Yamada Elf! She is another light novel author, only this time, stuck up her own ass, believing she is the greatest thing that has ever walked on the planet. She is also extremely selfish, but also EXTREMELY annoying to watch, due to her actions and her voice actress. Hell, one of our earliest introductions to her character is when she is playing the piano in her house while also being completely naked at the same time! Thanks, Eromanga-sensei, I am, as everyone else is, now on the FBI watch list. Oh boy. While her character does eventually confess her love for our dry-as-wood main protagonist, her character arc (or lack of character as a whole) goes nowhere. Her only point in the narrative is fan-service, and that's it. She is not interesting, fun to watch and every scene she was in only drew me closer to kicking the chair from beneath my feet to taste the sweet release of death from this shitty world. The only somewhat decent character is Muramasa, another girl who falls for Mr Light Novel Guy (our protagonist) and the only character who has some reasoning and justification into her love for him. As a whole, the characters themselves are very weak and the comedic chemistry the show attempts to build between them doesn't work at all, and, again, feels so trite and forced to boot. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic is just fine, very typical of what you'd expect from A-1 Pictures. The character designs were somewhat cute (so much so that one of my friends said he would 'destroy' Sagairi if you catch my drift) but it just feels so mundane and 'safe'. The same thing can be said about the music too. While the opening and ending track were both fine (especially the ending track which was both catchy as hell, and, admittedly cute seeing Sagairi dance despite how much I hate her) the music as a whole is horribly generic, which, at the very least, is consistent with the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing people may say in defence of the show is that you're supposed to just enjoy it and not take anything seriously since the show doesn't really take itself seriously at all. With its outlook on the workers of the light novel industry, it presents its characters as all being rather incompetent and it seems to acknowledge, to some degree, that these writers are indeed bad, but tries to excuse and justify this by claiming that the stories are interesting to read. This philosophy presented in the show may also arise in arguments in favour of the show, which, I guess is fine, but I didn't find anything about this show interesting at all, and certainly not entertaining. The comedy is extremely weak, the characters are boring archetypes that go nowhere and the entire show sexualises young girls to ridiculous degrees. Yes, the show is somewhat self-aware of how trashy it is, but just because it is so, doesn't make the anime any good. In fact, it only makes it worse since it does nothing else to subvert or go against these troupes presented in the show, and instead decides to go down the lazy route, and just appeal to the lowest common denominator. Now, I want to make it clear now, that I do not begrudge anyone for actually enjoying this show, as the tone in this review may suggest otherwise. I honestly am glad if you managed to find enjoyment in a show that I found so repulsive, and more power to you because of that. But, for me, this show was abysmal in every possible way, and I'll be seeing you all in prison when the FBI eventually tracks us all down...\\n",

            "content": "After watching Eromanga Sensei my eyes have opened of how most modern anime from 2015+ have been dumbed down in terms of story and characters.\r\nWe have been recently getting a lot of shows that either decent or downright bad that have no real impact on the anime industry.\r\nSure we got some great and memorable shows such as 3 Gatsu no Lion Assassination Classroom, Shokugeki no Souma, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju and Little Witch Academia (TV) but at the same time, we had to deal with mediocre to awful shows like Charlotte, Gangsta, Berserk 2016/2017, Scum's Wish etc.\r\nNow do I think for Eromanga Sensei. Is it\u00a0amodern masterpiece or it's a train-wreck that represents everything wrong with modern anime?\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert this show is a dumpster fire that shouldn't seen the light of day.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Eromanga Sensei is very similar to Bakuman as it follows a guy named Masamune who is a light novel author in high school. Masamune has a sister named Sagirl. A hikikomori girl who hasn't left her room for an entire year. Sagirl forces her brother to bring meals for her as well as washing her clothes. Masamune's novel illustrator, Eromanga likes to draw extremely perverted drawings who is very reliable.\\n\r\nIt's later revealed that Eromanga-Sensei is actually his younger sister. Now Masasume must bond with her sister so she can get out of her room as well as making a novel together.\\n\\n\r\nNow imagine Bakuman but with a poorly written story, cringe-worthy characters and Oreimo 2 dialogue and you got yourself Eromanga Sensei. A shit show filled with creepy incest with no substance whatsoever.\\n\r\nAs much I hate to admit it Oreimo Season 1 has some good theme exploration and social topics such as okatu cloture, hiding hobbies that you love from other people due to bad reputation from society and bonding with your family member.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has no themes, no artistic value, no message and no point other to be another shitty okatu pandering show with no soul whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThis is actual dialogue...\\n\r\nThe writing in the show is downright abysmal that is filled with cringe-worthy and awkward the dialogue that insults the viewer's intelligence in many ways.\\n\r\nOne example of this horrific dialogue is in episode 5 where Elf asks Sagirl to make an illustrator of her if she shows her panties on a webcam where it can be possibly be tracked down by police. Instead of saying no and leaving the video chat like a normal person with a brain she shows her panties on the webcam.\\n\r\nThat scene gets followed up with horrendous jail-bait dialogue...\\n\r\nWho the hell wrote this shit seriously!?!?\\n\r\nOverall the story is utter shit and it features some of the worst writing I have ever seen in any anime.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe chararters in Eromanga Sensei aren't chararters\\n\r\nThey are just a bunch cringe-worthy archetypes who have no character development and have no unique personally whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is just your bottom of the barrel siscon/lolion character who does cute things as well as being a shitty tsundere who refuses to leave her room and does weird shit.\\n\r\nMasamune or generic main protagonist #883 who has a creepy obsession with his sister. People may despise Kyouske for being a retarded siscon freak in Oreimo 2 along with that horrific Oreimo 2 special. Masamune, on the other hand, is on another level. When he's not screaming like a marron he's always ranting how beautiful his 13-year-old sister. \"Am not even joking when I say that\"\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters such as Elf Megumi and Muramasa are complete garbage and they are not even mentioning at all. They just exist for cringe-worthy dialogue and meme-service for the Meme community for many social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc.\\n\r\nHell one of the female supporting characters in this show has dialogue that was written by a horny 12-year-old.\\n\r\nThere is a girl in the anime where almost all of her dialogue is base around loving peoples dicks.\\n\r\nAm not even joking when I say that. That's literally her fucking character trait in this fucking show.\\n\r\nOverall the characters are downright awful with no redeeming values whatsoever.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\u00a0\\n\r\nVisually Eromanga Sensei looks nice.\\n\r\nThe characters designs are good for what they are as you expect from a moe show, alright background scene recently and the overall animation is fairly standard. However, there is one thing about Eromanga Sensei that I utterly hate that literally destroys everything.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the camera positioning as well as the camera angles.\\n\r\nThe camerawork and the overall camera direction is just fucking horrendous.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has a lot of unnecessary camera placement for fan-service that is both creepy and stupid. It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable as the anime like to show likes to show a freaking 13-year-old doing sexual things.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so much unnecessary camera shots that honestly makes the viewer sick and uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the pointless shots include.\\n\r\nA close-up ass shot of Elf naked playing the piano. (Episode 3)\\n\r\nAn extreme close-up shot of Megumi panties where the label itself even had Japanese text (Episode 6)\\n\r\nA panty shot of Sagirl from the first 8 seconds of Episode 11. (Am not even fucking joking)\\n\r\nA close-up shot of Sagirl legs in a compromising position. (Episode 11)\\n\r\nA close-up shot of Sagirl getting changed from her jumpers for 20 seconds in episode 5.\\n\r\nThere are still more pointless shots that I missed but I decided to mention these ones as they offended me because not only shot like these wasted time but they also made feel disgusted when every time these shots appear in an episode.\\n\r\nHell, the show at times doesn't know how to use The Rule Of Thirds correctly.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the visuals are decent but it gets ruined by awful camera positioning filled with underage girls and pointless fan-service.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Eromanga Sensei is generic.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are cute and quite catchy for what they are but they are nothing special.\\n\r\nVoice acting is standard as you expect. what more needs to be said really.\\n\r\nIn short, the soundtrack, the opening/ending themes, and voice acting is pretty average.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei is an insult in every sense of the word.\\n\r\nit's an insult to anime fans.\\n\r\nit's an insult to Japanese Illustrators.\\n\r\nIt's an insult to women and its an insult to siblings who are portrayed in this anime as nothing but stalkers and idiots who do incest stuff on screen for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is utter shit that is filled with some of the worst writing and dialogue I have ever seen in any anime. The characters are horrendous archetypes who are annoying and very poorly written from start to finish.\\n\r\nThe visuals are average that ruined by horrific camera angles and camera work that has no point other than to show underage girls in sexual positions and the soundtrack is generic.\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show to anyone whatsoever and you're better off watching Bakuman or go watch Oreimo Season 1 instead of this pile of waste.\\n\r\nThis show represents everything wrong with modern anime and because and I will forever loathe this show with a burning passion.\\n\r\nThis show is nothing but jailbait material.\\n\r\nIf you liked or enjoyed Eromanga Sensei then good for you but for me, screw\u00a0this shit!!!\\n\r\nIf I have to see Sagirl in a compromising position again am really going to lose it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1.5/10",

            "content": "[1/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nOh no. Oh no...\r\nI was holding off on publishing a review until I finished watching. Not for any hope that something like this would get better, but simply due to the fact that I couldn't bring myself to write about whatever this is. Eromanga-sensei is everything wrong with the anime industry. And you know what? That's not funny. I see so many jokes about that concept. How viewers laughingly remark about this series' and how horrible it is but eat it up regardless, promoting this utter shit until it becomes the most popular non-sequel of the season.\r\nAnd it is. Eromanga Sensei is the most popularnon-sequel in Japan. Can you believe it? A show about a fourteen year old trying to fuck his twelve year old sister while she molests other twelve year old girls is the most popular program in Japan. It is probably the most popular program amongst western anime fans too. It baffles me. Coming from a western background, series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad steal that limelight. Sure we have duds like The Walking Dead drifting about with their cable appeal, but even that is understandable to me. At least that has elements of redeemable quality.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga has none of that. Eromanga is the mutated lovechild of everything that's hate-able about this industry and the sole reason why anime series' won't ever be taken seriously. For every angered fan of anime that realizes that their favorite show or non-ghibli film will never see the light of day in any extended theater run or any major awards show; this is why. Eromanga Sensei is hopefully the worst series I'll watch to completion. That's because as a viewer I've mostly stuck with some of the most popular anime. I've made my way through the highly-touted projects and ignored the seasonal popularity. Well, this is my first time delving deep into it and it yields an unforgettable, but totally forgettable product that fails at even the most basic storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThis will have spoilers. If you are reading this and haven't seen the show, good. Don't watch it. It isn't worth it. It's not funny, or engaging, and the memes you have seen about it don't give a holistic representation of the insane tedium which this show revels in. This show isn't \"so bad it's good.\" Far from it. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei is just fucking garbage. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[A Dancing Girl and a Pedophile] \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis series follows a harem protagonist on a mission to fuck with a plethora of forgettable girl archetypes that you've seen a million times in a million different anime. The girl that he will end up being with is Sagiri, his twelve year old NEET sister who has not left her room in years. He also happens to write shitty light novels, much like the ones this series is based on, and his artist just so happens to be the twelve year old non-blood related sister living upstairs. What a coincidence! And of course he finds out and helps her hide her identity. \\n\\n\r\nThen we meet a few other girls who are also light novel writers and play no role other than to create fanservice scenes that aren't just of the main girl. Honestly, the first ten episodes of this series really don't matter. The eleventh episode provides some much needed backstory which just renders the rest of the series up until that point completely useless. Anyway, Eromanga is just a series of empty husks waddling around on screen. It is a collection of sexual gifs that patrol the internet. From the totally inexplicable character writing to the horrendously boring direction to the non-story that is told throughout this series, Eromanga struggles to get anything right. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Visuals]\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are probably the most positive aspect in this series, and even they are incredibly uneven. You see, A-1 hired a unique key animator for Sagiri, the little sister, and only Sagiri. So her animation is often much more fluid than the rest of the characters. This creates an animated whiplash of epic proportions. You go from a well-animated movement to a seizure-like stutter within the same scene. So even if her animation is good, this show has a tendency to skimp out on everything else. \\n\\n\r\nSome highlights are absurdly off-model characters that kind of look hilarious. Really egregious oversights, even in the shows forgettable OP. A-1, like they do, put the minimal effort required into making this show palatable to look at while forgetting to actually give it direction. It looks like any generic as all hell sitcom. Bad. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is mostly just a compilation of characters sitting around talking exposition for minutes on end before they get to the two minutes of fanservice that peppers the internet for the next few days. They virtually just include the last eighteen minutes for no discernible reason. This could've been just two minutes of soft-core porn and I think the fans would have been just as happy, if not more so, with this series. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's bad. The OP is forgettable but not painful, the ED I already forgot. The show has a seasoned atrociousness, as it's unfunny and bland writing is often back-ended by painful background music. Now this ranges from \"fat guy walking\" tuba to \"Squidward playing the clarinet\" and it was initially funny that this series had such abrasive background music. But it got tedious really quick and ended up just making me angry by episode four. \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say. This show sounds horrible.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters/Story]\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow lets get to the meat. And by meat, I mean the meat of a bunch of underage girls that are endlessly used as tools to turn on a bunch of creepy fucking virgins watching this series to get off. I get it, it's okay to imagine children naked if they are fake. And i'm a supporter of the notion that thought-crime shouldn't be illegal because it doesn't harm anyone. I don't honestly care what you think about on your free-time and I care even less if it is totally fictitious and not exploiting anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo my problems with this series isn't that it sexualizes kids. That's nothing new in anime (as disturbing as that is) and it is far from its biggest fault. It's pedophilic and gross, and I often felt ornery watching this series due to the kind of framing devices it used to express its sexuality. For example, instead of diagetically forcing fanservice on us, the director made the 'brave' choice of literally just having shots of characters from below. It felt like a pedophiles hidden camera every time a character was talking. \\n\\n\r\nWhether the show is being serious and dramatic or light-hearted and unfunny, the fanservice never ends. Character is being cute? Show them being cute with a below-the-skirt shot. Character crying? Have it framed so their still developing tits take up half the shot. It's cringe. It is a repulsive way to shoehorn this nonsense into your show. But on the other hand, this is the only thing this show has going for it anyway. It is riddled with plot-holes and totally clueless characters that defy any logic whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nIn one scene it is established that Sagiri cannot draw girls with big tits. Why? Because she uses herself as a model for all her drawings and she is twelve. So her brother, being the great, enabling guy he is, tells her to look up idols on google to discover how to draw big tits. It works! She can now draw big meatsacks. However, two episodes later she regresses back to not being able to draw titties because... a girl showed her, her panties on skype. Let me get this straight, seeing panties made you unable to draw tits. \\n\\n\r\nBut it gets better. \\n\\n\r\nThe way she says she can resolve this issue is if her brother literally lures girls into her room and has them show her their panties. Not only is that fucking creepy, but more importantly, how does drawing panties even relate to drawing tits? Why are glaring issues like this not resolved in the initial adaptation phase?! \\n\\n\r\nThis would be fine. Well, no it actually wouldn't, but not as bad if it didn't lead to one of the most genuinely disturbing scenes i've seen in anime. Now i'm not one to be disturbed, although I am definitely one to cringe. But her brother does it. He finds a girl and drags her to her room, ties her up and blindfolds her and has Sagiri draw her panties. But get this, Sagiri, the twelve year old girl, rips that other twelve year old's panties off. She literally molests another girl. And it isn't really played as anything either, that girl is genuinely uncomfortable and so was I. Get this. They become great friends afterwards too. Talk about Stockholm syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nI wish this was the only ridiculous inanity that occurs, but it isn't. A character called Elf exists. She has pointy elf-ears for literally no reason. It is never explained or mentioned. She just does. Her characterization is as confusing as she is repulsive. Very much so. She shifts between big-sister-esq and comforting to childish and annoying to a complete tsundere from episode to episode and it makes virtually no sense. She is also a part of our protagonist's harem.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the third character. Muramasa. Who's probably the most well-designed of the bunch, but has the personality of a grapefruit.  She's a best selling light-novel author yet it is revealed that she was inspired by our harem protagonist's work ever since she was young. Well, younger. This was an element I guessed the second I saw the character simply because you can't have a character in a harem that is better than the male protagonist. You just can't. This is a power fantasy series for lonely kids and adults that want young girls to flock all over them in their dreams. So you can't have them be worse at anything. You need them to be virtually perfect. And our protagonist is.\\n\\n\r\nThese days, i'm developing a blase attitude towards the inherent sexism showed in anime. Which is a bit sad because I do love me a strong female character who \"don't need no man\". But you know, when the entire medium is marketed towards teenage boys it kind of makes sense to have every male be the best and every women be a toy to be played with. Even if it is obnoxious and kind of distressing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is obviously not any different. In one titular scene we have our protagonist chat with the big brother of Elf, and when he discusses the great things about Elf the only thing he can say is, \"She's nice and is a good cook.\" Wow. What a charmer. And this isn't even played off as a joke, this was a genuine scene with sappy, saccharine music in the background. \\n\\n\r\nThis kind of character writing extends throughout the series, too. The character writing is so bad that it feels like our protagonist is maliciously playing with these girls, since he's shown to be so oblivious that it becomes hard to believe. He rejects a girl, but obviously she keeps pursuing him, but then he proceeds to invite her to plenty of social events, as if it won't be awkward as all hell for her. It truly is a baffling kind of attitude. \\n\\n\r\nI get the excuse, too, that he's just a \"stupid teenager\", and he is. But you know what? Using character stupidity as a plot contrivance isn't good writing. It doesn't make the protagonist or the story any better knowing this dude might actually be handicapped. It just makes it even more frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nWe are getting front row seats to this idiot fucking with these girls. And it isn't funny. Whether he understands that he is doing this or not, it's happening, and it is the least funny thing in a show that is already aggressively unfunny. If it was well-written comedy then it could be played as dark humor, but it isn't, it's just a bunch of girls yelling \"baka!\" really loudly. \\n\\n\r\nTo refer back to that scene of our protagonist talking with Elf's brother, who by the way asked him to marry her in that very scene. Get this, marrying a fourteen year old. He says that he would if he wasn't in love with someone else, referring to his twelve year old sister. However, the episode before he actually told the sister he would be with Muramasa if he wasn't in love with 'someone', as he puts it, since he's unable to admit his love of his sister, sometimes. So this entire scene played as a total contradiction, unless the protagonist was supposed to be a total lying scumbag fuck. I don't think that was intended, though. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to script writing this show is a masterpiece. Much like a Michael Bay script, Eromanga has a tendency to describe everything that is shown. I'm not talking about emotions, i'm talking about literally shown. In one scene they are goofing off instead of working, and when the brother of Elf walks in to catch them in the act of goofing off, Elf stands up and literally explains what he is seeing. It is this baffling mixture of having to exposit a moment and also badly adapting dialogue from the light novel. \\n\\n\r\nYou are seeing everything she is saying. It isn't even the whole \"show don't tell\" rule, that doesn't apply. That's a criticism for bad writing. This isn't bad writing. This is like the a new universe of writing. It is so abysmal that it bore it's way out of the crust of her earth and floated off into space. This kind of writing extends to multiple different episodes too, often times characters restate their purpose multiple times and it still leads to nothing. For example, the entirety of episode ten was about how Muramasa loves the protagonist, but that's been established since her second introductory episode. She literally just reuses the dialogue she used that episode. It is a special kind of absurd.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Speed Round : This show is shit!]\\n\\n\\n\r\n* After a one-episode tournament-esq arc finishes, there is an after party to which everyone who participated in the competition established gets to come. Elf ends up going, even though she wasn't in the competition and this wasn't addressed at all. It was just an excuse to bring all the girls together. \\n\\n\r\n* Everything ties back to the MC for virtually no reason but to make him the focal point of every characters lives. Every character backstory has something to do with our main character and it might be the most contrived bullshit I've ever witnessed on screen. And I watched the entirety of SAO. \\n\\n\r\n* The backgrounds lack any detail whatsoever. We are in a character's room but their room doesn't have any personal mementos or knickknacks. In fact, the only room that has detail is Sagiri's, but she's a NEET with the cleanest room I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\n* To piggy-back off that. She's a NEET hikikomori, stating she hasn't left her room in years. Yet her room is perfectly clean. There is also no bathroom in her room. How does this even work? Does she shit out of the window? This entire show plays this seriously negative affliction as totally okay. \\n\\n\r\n* Uninspired character designs. The parents of our two protagonists are virtually just the same characters but aged up. It is lazy as all hell. \\n\\n\r\n* This show lacks any timing whatsoever. Not only for it's comedic punchlines, but for its fanservice as well. Fanservice can strike at any time and it is distracting and undercuts any potential catharsis this show is trying to establish. \\n\\n\r\n* Episode eleven changes the entire story of the series and renders the past ten episodes totally irrelevant to where the conclusion is heading. \\n\\n\r\n* The finale was completely and utterly pointless, playing more like an OVA than a finale. It was nothing. Much like the rest of this series. \\n\\n\r\n* Girls get embarrassed for virtually no reason. As in, in one scene our protagonist is getting hit on by Elf on the beach as she asks him to spread some sunscreen on her back. Then once he repeats her orders she gets embarrassed about it. Why? Why is girls being embarrassed about inane shit such a cliche in anime? \\n\\n\r\n* In one episode of the series Sagiri makes Elf and Muramasa her models so she can draw them in revealing positions. Yet, to describe the positions, she draws them. So they are models she already had drawn... so why did she even need them to model in the first place? It made no fucking sense. \\n\\n\r\n* Muramasa was often played as the really \"cute\" one, as in, the characters acknowledged how pretty she was. However, since she has the same kind of body-type as any other girl, apart from bigger tits, it wasn't convincing at all. The usual anime presentation of \"same-body, different standards\" that makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\n* If you've noticed I haven't actually said what our protagonist's name is, and that's because it doesn't matter. \\n\\n\r\n* Every girl is a fucking slut. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The state of anime]\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this show isn't that it is bad. Well, it is, it's abhorrent in every way. But the biggest problem, and perhaps the most upsetting issue, is that it is so incredibly popular. It is, undoubtedly, in the mainstream. A show like Eromanga is the mainstream in anime. That is so fucking confusing to me. I tried to explain this earlier but the people who genuinely love this show seem incredibly insecure about their love for it. \\n\\n\r\nThey explained to me that I'm simply being bias and that I'm \"trying\" to hate this show. When that isn't true at all. I actually discovered this show through a meme, which is ironically why it is popular in the first place, because it's made to be a  meme, and I thought the meme was kind of hilarious and I decided to watch the series. Sure, once I realized it is awful I went into every episode expecting nothing but terrible nonsense, but that's logical. You shouldn't go into a snake pit, get bitten, and then go into a snake pit again expecting not to get bitten. Maybe i'm just a masochist, but I feel like I needed to finish this series simply to experience the most awful possible thing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to many people from what I've seen, this is far from the most awful possible thing. I was constantly told that this is just a \"mediocre\" show. That i'm over-exaggerating it's awfulness. To that I say, if this is mediocrity to you, then you might have the most incredibly low standard for television. If this is \"mediocre\" for anime, then anime fucking sucks. If this is \"mediocre\" for anything, then that anything is the worst.\\n\\n\r\nIt is paramount we criticize it too. Supporting a product like this will help fuel more products like this. In 2014,  Miyazaki said something incredibly poignant about anime as an industry, and the fans, instead of taking it seriously, decided to take it as a joke. He made it clear that as an industry, anime is spiraling out into nothingness. There is an endless loop of self-inspiration that will never actually prompt original or groundbreaking content. \\n\\n\r\nAs an industry, anime is otaku driven, and as a people, according to Miyazaki, otaku's aren't usually capable of understanding how people work. And if you are writing characters to represent people and don't understand how people work, your characters will take roles that are wholly unrealistic. We already see this in anime constantly. Completely stupid character archetypes that simply don't exist in the real world, from Tsunderes to the concept of a pure, yet sexual girls that seems to inhabit essentially every anime with inherent, childish sexuality in it. \\n\\n\r\nSo when these totally unaware shows become popular and are roots for inspiration, they spawn more shows like them. Much like SAO did, much like Re:Zero is doing, much like Eromanga sensei will do, and it is a constant loop of something getting worse and worse. It's not funny. It isn't worth joking about. It genuinely makes this industry look awful. I care because I love animation, and while anime and I have mixed feelings about each other, I can't help but support animation as a medium and I want to see it succeed and be utilized to its full potential. But as it stands, anime is hardly scratching the surface and it will continue to scratch less and less as this loop of uncreativity continues. Which is deeply saddening. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion and Criticism]\\n\\n\\n\r\nCriticizing something is important. Critics help spur movements and change notions and promote something of quality. Look no further than the French New Wave, the most influential movement in film history which was spawned in the palms of upset critics that wanted to change the status quo. This movement permeated throughout the world and ended up inspiring the greatest films and directors in of all time. Without the French New Wave, some of the greatest anime wouldn't even exist. Satoshi Kon wouldn't have edited like he did. Monogatari wouldn't have its signature style. At its base, this starts with a criticism. Bringing attention to something. It is incredibly important to fight for the kind of television you want to see. \\n\\n\r\nI get it, though, not everyone wants this in their television. Some viewers just want to see cute girls prance around on screen saying random shit and yelling \"baka!\" loudly. I get it. Some people don't care about a narrative, or characters, or even visuals half the time. This show being popular makes that clear. However, on behalf of everyone that does care. That does want television, specifically anime to push itself further away from the stigma regarding the quality of the medium, I ask you to perhaps watch a series with cute girls but in a narrative that actually exists. Characters that are actually there. And there are plenty of shows like that, too. You don't have to settle for something like Eromanga-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation specializes in cute girls but with engaging characters, exceptional directing, and spectacular visuals. If you are looking for porn, look up porn. If you want to watch a series, make the sacrifice of watching something that at least has an element of positivity past sexualizing its objects. This'll promote series that will actually create maybe something a bit more interesting and original. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei is genuinely a saddening experience. It is so incredibly bad in just about every way, yet people really love it. It is so popular that it will spawn plenty of sequels and shows copying its already cliche formula that it truly makes me upset. An industry that is already a mecca for unoriginal concepts that virtually just copy one another will just continue to be an industry of looping inspiration and nothing to break up the tedious formula.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is truly the worst.",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past century, it\u2019s no secret how perverse the Japanese culture can be sometimes, mainly in the medium of anime. Writers and producers litter their animations with heavily endowed females, ecchi harems bordering on hentai and lewd jokes about a ten-year-old\u2019s panties. Anime like High School DXD and Masou Gakuen HXH continue to push the boundary of what is acceptable to show to its viewers, and I\u2019ve been partly responsible at times myself of indulging in this trashy, sexual fanservice. However, with A-1 Studio\u2019s 2017 release of Eromanga Sensei, I\u2019ve officially hit a tipping point in myopinions of what is right and wrong. The series exhausts every effort to forcefully suggest an \u201cincestuous\u201d relationship between a teenager and his stepsister. What results is one of the most disgusting, tasteless works of fiction ever produced. It's a show that\u2019s harrowing to my own morality, and whose influence could degrade the already thinning strand of legitimacy the anime industry has left. \\n\\n\r\nAs soon as Eromanga Sensei begins, evidence of the writer\u2019s true intentions come to light. Masamune, our main protagonist, lives with his mother, and Sagiri, the blushing lolli, lives with her father. Magically the pair\u2019s parents become romantically involved and eventually make the decision to live together. Thus, their dramatic introduction begins, leading to the intended incest theme. Sagiri appears from behind her father\u2019s back, timid and radiating with a brilliant light of angelic proportions. Masamune locks eyes with her and is immediately overcome with romantic intentions. It\u2019s naturally what every 13 year old does when meeting their preteen stepsister for the first time...amirite? Apparently the manga\u2019s writer Tsukasa Fushimi had a previous work in which he tried to force the ACTUAL brother and sister to be in a relationship, only to have the idea not get greenlighted for obvious ethical reasons. Hell, I guess even some of Japan has a moral conscience.\\n\\n\r\nFast-forward a few years to the devastating yet convenient turn of events in which the two parents perish in an undetailed car accident and Masamune and Sagiri are forced to live with each other. Naturally Sagiri locks herself in her room, forcing her \u201cbrother\u201d to answer to her every beck and call. Masamune is an aspiring manga author who works with an anonymous erotic manga artist in hopes of someday hitting it big in the industry. However, while anxiously viewing one of his masked partner\u2019s live streams, Masamune accidentally discovers that Eromanga-Sensei\u2019s true identity is that of his own sister Sagiri...\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT THICKENS.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is rather generic from a plot perspective. Sagiri and Masamune are secretly attracted to each other, however neither of them admit their infatuation due to a plethora of awkward misunderstandings. More female characters enter the fray, further clouding Masamune\u2019s perception of love, and at the end of it all we as viewers are left with nothing more than a shell of a stereotypical romantic comedy. There\u2019s just one catch. It isn\u2019t the overall plot structure that bothers me about Eromanga Sensei. It isn\u2019t the apparent reality that every teenager in Japan is a manga author. It isn\u2019t even the vanilla or recycled characters omnipresent in seemingly every facet of the series. What incessantly infuriates me about this anime is the shameless amount of forced sexual topics and fanservice shoved down my throat around every turn. I\u2019m not by any stretch of the imagination an ecchi fan, but at least most of them have the decency to shy away from the taboo of lolita porn. Scattered shots of some rather private scenes involving Sagiri or other pre-teen girls, either blatant or subtle leave a disgusting taste in my mouth. Added to this are countless suggestive panty shots, only fueling the stigma many already possess related to the anime industry. Not to mention the mention the random expletive from a twelve year old about liking penises. Is the industry even trying anymore?\\n\\n\r\nAll of the fanservice aside, the aspect of Eromanga Sensei I found most unnerving is the suggested incestuous relationship between Masamune and Sagiri. Countless anime before it have alluded to or even explored the romantic sibling complex (Koi Kaze, OreImo, No Game No Life), but Fushimi\u2019s methods in Eromanga are so sloppy and pathetic it\u2019s embarrassing. There is no \u201crelationship\u201d between the two main characters. It\u2019s as if they are actors dropped into an improv scene with pre-assigned roles. \u201cOh, this is when I\u2019m supposed to blush when he says something!\u201d or \u201cOh, I better internal monologue about my sister now\u201d. It all reeks of contrivance and agenda. At least OreImo seemed more realistic in its relationship development. And when are we going to draw the line with what is acceptable to release in an anime? Shock value scenes with large breasts and convenient erotic shots are desensitizing and generally understood to be exaggeratory. However, showcasing more personal themes like incest to such an impressional target audience can actually have long-lasting effects with their ability to discern what is moral and acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT- It\u2019s not normal to want to have sex with your brother or sister. \\n\\n\r\nI digress.\\n\\n\r\nFushimi\u2019s creation of Masamune was flawed in how he appears to just \u201cexist\u201d without really creating much opportunity for relatability. The feelings for his sister are never really internalized or matured, but instead seem to exist from the moment he meets her. For the rest of the anime, viewers are now transfixed on what taboo thought or emotion Masamune will have for Sagiri and couldn\u2019t care less about him as a person. His manga author career serves as nothing more than a vessel to exploit his relationship and complicate things as more loli\u2019s are introduced. It\u2019s cringeworthy characterization at best. In essence, Masamune is just a plot device for the underlying themes of the show. Well done sir, you created one of the most boring characters in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is the most forgivable character in Eromanga Sensei. She\u2019s young, so in a way, she has an excuse for acting the way she does in terms of isolationism when her father passes away. Her interpretation of what an acceptable relationship is could also be skewed due to her young age, which is why she has strange feelings for her brother. Unfortunately, this does far less than make her an interesting character. At times, she can be really frustrating because of how irrational her behavior can be and it doesn\u2019t help her build a strong likability case. Elf is cute, annoying, and is the tsundere trope in a nutshell. Another plot device with pre-installed emotions and perogatives. The rest of the cast does far from marvel, consisting of a gaggle of uninspired and forgettable personalities. Character development does little to nothing in justifying the existence of such a tasteless anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Eromanga is what you would expect from an anime in 2017. Flashy, bright hues accompany each scene, with a plethora of cutesy blushing character models to boot. Each character was constructed with individuality in mind, so their appearance is unique and eye-catching. It\u2019s a shame more couldn\u2019t have been done in the art department to overshadow the supreme lack of depth in the characters themselves. And as attractive as the models looked, it wasn\u2019t enough to salvage the eventual trainwreck bestowed upon them by Fushimi\u2019s writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Eromanga Sensei was playful and fun, ad nauseum. Whether it was the seemingly innocent and bubbly OP, or the adorable ED sequence of Sagiri dancing in front of a laundry machine, the cute factor was never dialed down from 11. The rest of the OST fit in well with the scenes as much as I hate to say it, I really can\u2019t fault the sound designers here. Voice acting was also believable and well cast.\\n\\n\r\nAs I descend from my soapbox, I\u2019ll leave you with this. Eromanga Sensei is not a \u201cquality\u201d anime. It may be disguised with endearing female characters and a relationship portrayed as innocent or normal, but when you brush off the surface you\u2019ll find nothing more than a lewd and often inappropriately centered series. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend it to someone that I know would like it, because at some point the spread of immoral content has to stop. Fans of shows like this are what gives the anime industry a negative light in mainstream media. Maybe when we start to take the medium serious and stop promoting crap like this, more skilled writers and producers will be drawn to it. Honestly, I\u2019m embarrassed as an anime fan that a show like Eromanga Sensei even exists. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 1\\n\r\nCharacters- 1\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\nSound- 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1\\n\r\nOverall- 1.8",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nYeah, I know I'm WAY late to this party. A friend requested a review though, so why not? Eromanga Sensei made quite the splash online as THE bad anime of 2017. Gigguk hyped it up famously as \"The perfect bad anime\" and \"The ULTIMATE bad anime\". He made it seem like it's so bad it's amazing and hysterical. Sadly, I must disagree. Eromanga Sensei is NOT \"The Room\" of anime. It isn't uniquely bad or uniquely depraved. It's just an amalgamation of the shittiest cliches and tropes from other bad echii anime. \r\nBackground:\r\nArt in general is highly subjective, but what qualifies as \"So bad it'sgood\" is especially fuzzy. For me personally, the best examples either display extreme technical incompetence where the creators clearly didn\u2019t know what they are doing, or batshit insane projects that beat all the odds by somehow getting made in the first place. Let's look at a classic bad movie with Dolemite. I\u2019ve never seen a film where the director gave less of a fuck. The lead actor flubs a line? Who cares! Keep shooting. The sound equipment AND crew are visible? Who cares! An actor wasn\u2019t ready and has to run to his cue at the start of a scene? Doesn\u2019t matter. Every fight scene is our overweight protagonist awkwardly lifting his leg in the rough proximity of the bad guys and them hurling themselves backwards. The writing is astonishingly bad throughout. On a purely technical level, Dolemite makes The Room look like Citizen Kane. It\u2019s that perfect type of mesmerizingly bad where it\u2019s impossible to tell what was intentionally funny and what was honest incompetence. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at some underdog stories that beat the odds just by getting made. Look at every movie made by Troma entertainment. Lloyd Kaufman graduated from Yale and had the intelligence and the right friends (including Oliver Stone) to be a major Hollywood director. However, he hated that movies were greenlit or denied by a board of executives based on how well they were projected to sell. Kaufman rebelled and founded a studio based entirely around producing the ludicrous shit that would NEVER get greenlit elsewhere. Most of these movies were indeed horrible like \u201cThey Call me Macho Woman\u201d and \u201cSurf Nazis Must Die\u201d, but Kaufman\u2019s middle finger to Hollywood gave him cult status as a kind of anti-hero. It\u2019s thanks to people like Kaufman that we get rare indy gems like \u201cSix Stringed Samurai\u201d. That\u2019s a movie about a katana wielding Buddy Holly! He\u2019s on a quest to find the last American city after a nuclear war and claim the throne from Elvis. The soundtrack couldn\u2019t afford to use Buddy Holly or Elvis\u2026so they found some random Russian band called the Red Elvises, who were willing to do the soundtrack for free. The Red Elvises specialize in playing 1960s Surf Rock and Rockabilly using a balalaika instead of a guitar! Six Stringed Samurai is the kind of insane shit that SOMEHOW exists and should be celebrated for that reason alone!\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get back to Eromanga Sensei. Eromanga is perfectly fine on a technical level and was made by people who although lazy, knew exactly what they were doing. The series knew it had an audience based on the success of Oreimo and sure enough was a decent hit in Japan. It was no mistake that Eromanga got made, rather a cynical decision to milk some cash out of the lolicon otakus. Eromanga in my mind is NOT worth celebrating. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a light novel author named Izumi. He\u2019s still in high school, but only cares about being a successful writer in the world of ero LNs. Izumi is extremely hardworking and prolific but is unfortunately a terrible writer. Izumi kind of acts as the avatar of series writer/director, Tsukasa Fushimi. Izumi\u2019s novels only sell as well as they do thanks to his mysterious illustrator, who specializes in drawing lewd imagery. It turns out that this illustrator is Izumi\u2019s obnoxious little step-sister named Sagiri. It ALSO turns out that their next-door neighbor is his arch rival in the world of erotic LNs. Izumi must try rise to the top of the ero LN world while also struggling with feelings of love for his step-sister. Basically, if you\u2019ve seen Oreimo, you\u2019ve seen Eromanga Sensei. If you\u2019ve seen any of the dozens of shitty sibling incest echii, you\u2019ve seen Eromanga sensei. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei isn\u2019t funny. It isn\u2019t erotic. It isn\u2019t unique and amusingly bad. It\u2019s just trite, boring, garbage. Well, at least it\u2019s scratching an itch for loli lovers, right? Surely it features the most naked little girls of any anime in recent memory! Nope! Thanks to changes in Japan\u2019s censorship laws over the last few years, there is no full-frontal nudity or unobscured rear-view nudity in the entire series. If you were hoping for something uniquely perverted, this isn\u2019t it. Go watch Aki Sora instead. I have nothing further to say about this pile. It\u2019s just this utterly mediocre echii with no reason to exist that you shouldn\u2019t watch under any circumstances. \\n",

Long-ass reviews coming right noowww. (I'm not really good at english, tho', so hopefully you who decided to read this anywaycan understand what I wrote)\\n\\n\r\nWell, When I first seen the trailer, what I had in thought was \"So... Another of that infamous Oreimo? but they're not blood related? ...It's like a cue for the author to get wild this time lol. Still can't watch it, tho'\". \\n\\n\r\nBut damn I was wrong. The show is actually, even tho' it shares the same element with Oreimo, actually differs in theme and feels more light than Oreimo in some sense that even someone who's pretty much against watching an anime with incest as its main theme like me could actually enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nJust like one of the reviewer here said, the show introduces us to the otaku community (just like Oreimo), but this time, it's more specifically about Light Novel. It's not really a show with generic MC, where the big bro doing everything he can so he will able to bang his imouto (The guy even actually against incestual relationships), it also give us a little hindsight on what LN's Authors through before he could publish their works.  \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off with The Big Bro, Masamune, who wished he can see his lil' sis face again as after the incident where their parents died, She never going out from her bedroom again. \\n\r\nIt shows how dedicated the big bro in still taking care of her sister although just from the other side of the door. \\n\r\nA lot happen and after some 'Accident', they found themselves to be closer than before. \\n\\n\r\n-Story: 7 \\n\r\nAs I said, this kind of story already around since long time ago but it gave us a different theme from what's been around before (Imho). We really can think of this as OreImo v2, lol, but it really is different from it's big bro. \\n\\n\r\n-Art: 9 \\n\r\nWell, it's another A-1 masterclass. Not really my favorite studio but they really done a good job with the visuals. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 9 \\n\r\nClariS song will always got 9 or 10 rating in my book lol. \\n\r\nAnd the OP and ED is kind of adorable, too. \\n\\n\r\n-Character: 7 \\n\r\nThe MC is a generic MC we can found in many anime, but what differs here is his mindset, where he really do love his Lil' sis, but he against the incestual relationships and still try to act as a proper big bro as best as possible (Even tho' they're not blood-related, but this is 'That' kind of show, so it can be expected they will ended up as couple in the end). \\n\r\nAnd the main love interest too, Sagiri, is FCKING BETTER THAN KIRINO. Like She has that unique voice, ADORABLE LITTLE DANCE IN THE OP AND ED, not a bitch at all, and actually has a respect to his big bro. \\n\r\nThe other casts are pretty much really generic, that's why I give 7 scores in this category. Like, rival that ended up have a feelings for the MC, an easygoing boss, and so on. ...Except that one loli who said She loves 'D*ck'. It made me freeze on front of my computer for a few secs lol. It's the first time I seen this kind of scene not from hentai. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nHad many little giggling throughout the episodes. It's not the best anime I've watched, yeah, but it's still pretty enjoyable, too. The conversation between the characters weren't really as bland as what peoples pointing out, especially between Masamune and Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 7 \\n\r\nIf you enjoy a little lighthearted story, you might give this a chance. but this anime is certainly not for e\u0336l\u0336i\u0336t\u0336i\u0336s\u0336t\u0336 every audience, so try to watch at least 1 or 2 episodes before you decided to drop the show or not. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all from me. For you who actually read the review, hope you can understand what I typed. Hope I can see you sons of gun again. \\n\\n\r\nNext time.",

            "content": "I have a rule: I must sit through several (or all them if the series is done airing) episodes before writing a review or forming any sort of opinion and I try not to be quick to judge a series with a few rare exceptions. But oh goodness, please, forgive me, I couldn't, I simply couldn't take this anymore because I feel like my nerve cells were irreparably damaged. Anime is supposed to entertain, not shorten one's life.\r\nStory: 3/10.\r\nThere is not much to say about it because I really cannot approve of a plot about a 13-year-old girl drawing lewd illustrations while her brother, ayoung novelist, pretty much allows it (despite a brief apology in the first episode). Yes, I am aware of how low the age of consent in Japan is, so this is my culture and mentality speaking here, but I fail to understand what's so entertaining about this, neither do I think it's okay just because the heroine is technically of age. This is downright unacceptable, as well as disgusting, and I am not willing to tolerate an anime that sexualizes minors and makes them say that they love, pardon me, dicks. To each their own, perhaps, but this anime is supposed to be a simple comedy yet it fails to find balance between risks and what can be considered funny and appropriate. Eromanga-sensei tries to be funny and fails on a scale so epic that it's practically cringe-worthy.\\n\r\nNow here is the thing: I actually enjoyed the first season of OreImo despite its risky themes. Yes, I see OreImo's flaws neither do I approve of Kirino's favorite genre and maybe things get worse later on, but at least OreImo was entertaining in comparison to whatever this circus is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nSmooth animation and the fact that I like this show's art style are its only redeeming qualities, if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10.\\n\r\nCutesy songs plus forgettable soundtrack. I always give this aspect 5 out of 10 when I cannot seem to remember anything, which means that there was nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10.\\n\r\nI. Don't. Understand. Any of them. So here we have these two siblings-but-not-really as they are not related by blood, which is, apparently, an excuse to push their possibly romantic relationship down our throats. No, thank you. Masamune refers to Sagiri as his little sister, acknowledging her as one, so I do not think it's cute or funny. Not even a bit. These two are weird, painfully bland and boring and driven by horrible logic that is beyond my understanding. If it goes on like this, things will get out of hand. Of course, that's what this show is about, risky themes and relatively lewd semi-incest relationship between two kids and one of them just reached the age of consent (in accordance with Japanese laws, but most of us here still see her as a minor as we have our own laws to rely on).\\n\r\nBoth Sagiri and her so-called brother are as blank as a sheet of paper. Masamune is a cheap copy Kyousuke Kosaka and has a personality of a toothpick. He is not believable or relatable and, as a result, it is almost impossible to like him because he doesn't make you feel anything. Sagiri, in the meantime, is laughable: a loli tsundere that, apparently, doesn't even know what the hell she wants. Infantile to the point of acting like a 6-year-old (she's 13), she is a cute but very annoying character and her adorable face does not count as a redeeming quality. Summing it up, both Masamune and his sister-but-not-really are ridiculously immature and unlikable. Given that they are protagonists of the series, that is not a way to go.\\n\r\nDon't get me started on the rest of the cast, Megumi Jinno in particular, someone needs to slap this girl once or twice, she collects friends like Pokemon and is too perverted for a 13-year-old. How is that funny? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10.\\n\r\nThis show is boring and sometimes it can be pretty confusing and downright disgusting and, as much as I'd like to be brave and believe that it gets better, I can't. Maybe it does, but I do not want to know.\\n\\n\r\nI do not have any siblings, but I have friends who are like siblings to me and I cannot even imagine how or why a show like this can be considered funny. I gave it 3/10 and maybe, just maybe I am not harsh enough. I don't know if it gets better later on or not. But the truth is, I do not care much enough to be willing to figure that out. It's better to watch something else. What an utterly disgusting disappointment.",

It's sad that the number one most helpful review was someone trashing it because why not. People who gave it tens might have been over exaggerating, but giving it a one isn't fair to the show. The show does have lewded characters, but don't all animes have some sort of fan service? I don't understand how you couldrate it this harshly without realizing this fact. This may sound stupid, but the plot isn't always what decides whether an anime is great or not. It surely is a great contributing factor, but there are other things that make an anime fun to watch. First of all, I'd like to commend the great soundtrack of this show. I always sit and listen during the opening and ending, which I can't say I do for every show. To me, good ops and eds can make a show much better, being the hype in the beginning and the satisfying, familiar song at the end. The art is also amazing, and very appealing to the eyes. I will say that the shows plot isn't A+, but it's a rom-com, guys. The story is about the main character and the girls who surround him. It isn't meant to be full of action and adventure, it's meant to make you laugh and watch on as everyone becomes closer. If you want to watch a story with plot, Jojo is always there for you to watch. And obviously the age of the females in the show is a tad too low, but it's not like they emphasize on that. I'm always satisfied at the end of each episode and would recommend this to anyone and everyone reading. Please give this anime a chance, and try to remember that not every anime is a plot filled tear jerker, and that some are made to be enjoyed for what they really are.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is the portrait of an unusual comedy that plays with the morbid side of the mind. Moreover, the show salvages some ideas from other anime in search of acceptance. In the end, Eromanga-sensei only offers an unsatisfaction with an overused harem story and with some misleading sexual concepts.\r\nThe average: The anime started with a promising 8.23 and ended with a miserable 6.97. The 12 years old girl sexual behaviour. The silly and unrealistic story. \r\nThe good: Some hilarious moments and few characters.\r\nPerhaps, the biggest mistake is the story. Even if we eliminate the infamous incest debate, we end up with an empty harem story.A laddie with a collection of girls between the ages of twelve and fifteen who fall in love with the protagonist, an overused story romance in the anime world. To deceive the viewer with a new plot, an erroneous perception is created in which this promiscuous group is as functional as any group of adults to the extreme where they are most successful and can take their own decisions that are not in accordance with their ages. No one has ever asked, \u00bfwhere are the adults in this series? So far you will notice two, but they are mere puppets who try to propel dysfunctional relationships. The show portrays three young characters (Masamune, Elf and Muramasa) who are famous light novels writers and a twelve-year-old lassie (Sagiri) who is an erotic sketcher known as Eromanga-sensei. The irony is that this lassie, despite her alleged inexperience has developed sexual tastes or fetishes out of nuffink that can not be explained logically and credibly. To play a little more with your mind, this lassie lives with the laddie. In addition, she is his sister, but with a small countermeasure, she is a step-sister. For some persons they can hook together for others could be a problem. It is up to you which one is your side. \\n\\n\r\nLet's remove the sexual part for a bit because I need to be honest. The show is full of incoherency even for a comedy. \u00bfAre you going to believe that this little lassie locked herself in her room without any visual contact and this laddie never even bothered entering and see if she was ok? \u00bfWill you laugh after seeing a child, kid, youth locked in a room for several months without any visual contact? I bet that MOST all the persons will take the door down and see if the kid is ok or will try to seek help immediately. Don't play with our intelligence that argument is so lame that none will bite for it. Also, the irrational success case of the characters (they have published novels, and some have sold more than a professional writer).\\n\\n\r\nNow the sexual part, the main topic of the comedy. In one hand,  the relationship concept misleading the meaning of relationship or \"romance\" expressed in the constant sexual insinuation of a twelve years old girl. I need to repeat it, a twelve years old girl. The continuous  story twist hidden under the timid face of a kid \"Brother,  you are an idiot and a pervert\" twist \"I want Elf's panties.\" Scenes that play with the morbid desires of the mind, pushed by every panty angle in search of spectators. Second, the sexual misleading \"you are a pervert, but I like drawing erotic scenes\" or \"Can I see your penis?\" Third, the overused harem concept. All these ideas continuously resemble the fetishism introduced in this anime, and if you don't like them, then you will feel this anime as an immediate failure. I am not saying that this anime is a total waste, there are some exciting scenes and they could have used that scenes a bit more (final episode 9).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, nothing is relevant. A guy and lots of lolis that love him or want to have a relationship with him. Most all them are more successful than any adult, and some have unexplained sexual desires. If we let Sagiri's relation out of the spectrum then we can appreciate some characters like the promiscuous and introvert personality of Elf Yamada to the timid and polite nature of Muramasa but sadly if we add Sagiri to the equation, Masamune's relations are unbalanced and in some cases forced. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't bad. The definition of the characters was good. However, you will enjoy it just if you like the story if not the art will be irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are good. The OP was part of the J-Pop Billboard and the Oricon ranking. About the score, it is simple and matches the comedy moments.   \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I don't suggest this anime for kids. It has some sexual concepts that aren't explained and can lead to a misconception if you don't understand the difference between the joke and the reality.",

            "content": "This is easily the most enjoyable Anime of the season.  So much so that I want to go back and watch all the episodes up to the current one again right now.  First I want to preface this by saying, there is a lot of hate towards this show by really retarded people.  Before I even began watching the show, I knew what I was expecting to see.  The description is very clear, and knowing the mind behind it, if you don't want to see the new \"sibling romantic comedy\" then you shouldn't even begin watching in the first place.In real life, I don't purposely go looking for things I would hate and put hours of my time, effort, and energy into them.  If you understand that this will be an incest comedy, which it doesn't even try to hide being, then you will enjoy your experience with this show, if not, just go watch something more to your liking.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy everything about this show.  I also enjoyed OreImo, but this one is completely different.  I guess it's because in OreImo there was a feeling that the main character might choose a different girl, and in fact the arc where he dated Kuroneko was one of my favorite parts of that series.  In this show, it seems that all the side characters are firmly supportive of the Masamune/Sagiri ship.  In OreImo, you had some pretty serious competition for the main character, with each of the girls wanting to get a piece of the action.  So unlike the harem aspect of that series, this one is much more of a romance anime.  The characters are all likeable.  The least likeable is Elf, but after learning more about her, you will warm up to her as well.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is one of the most adorable characters you will ever encounter in anime.  She is certainly not equatable to any real life human, so don't expect  to find anyone in real life that resembles her.  As Masamune comments, Sagiri is more of a fairy like, almost ethereal character.  On one hand she is so innocent, yet on the other, she is a complete pervert.  But one thing is for sure, if I were to ever have a little sister, I would want her to be just like Sagiri.  Tempermental, but not so ridiculously cartoonishly tsundere.  You can really feel the genuine love she has, even if she can't really express it properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, although clearly a siscon, also has the restraint to not want to pursue those feelings.  There is a morality that keeps him in check.  Yet being able to pour those feelings into his \"love letter\" of a story which apparently is so genuine that it would bring a reader to tears, it is a sweet thing to see the closeness developing between brother and sister who are destined to be together.  If this series were to end with them not being together in some way, shape, or form it would be a complete travesty.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't think that there is anything wrong with non blood related \"family members\" having a relationship in real life.  Love is a strange thing and it's not two people's fault that their parents ended up in a relationship.  That happening should not make them having romantic feelings for one another something to be ashamed of.  Obviously two blood related family members should not pursue a relationship in real life.  However, despite my wanting Kuroneko to prevail in OreImo, I was still 100% behind Kirino being with her brother once she finally admitted her feelings.  \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, if you aren't going to flip your script over the \"sibling romance\", then you will love this show.  Very cute girls, great comedy, and overall a wonderful experience which will make you fall in love if you'll let it.  If you know you can't get past the premise of the show, don't willingly slit your wrists and cry to us while bleeding.  It just shows that you are childish and only care about people listening to you complain.  I hate country music, so, knowing that a music festival will feature all country music, you wouldn't catch me dead there... the same rule applies here.  Watch it if you are open minded and you will not regret it, it will no doubt become one of your favorites from this year.\\n\\n\r\nPS As a side note, the top commenter who tries to trash this Anime is incorrect in saying that Sagiri is 10, because she is in fact 13.  I'm not sure if that is her age in the Light Novel or not, but considering this is a discussion of the anime in which she is 13, their point is invalid about claiming that the sexualization of her character is promoting pedophilia. Whether you agree with it or not, 13 is the legal age of consent in Japan.  This may seem \"horrible\" to some people, but even in parts of the US a person can get married as young as age 12.  If you don't believe me, feel free to look up the legal marriage ages across the US yourself.  Without parental consent a girl can marry at age 15 in Mississippi.  With parental consent, a girl can get married at age 13 in New Hampshire and 12 in Massachusetts.  Even more interesting is that there is no restriction on age of marriage in Mississippi as long as there is parental consent.",

            "content": "Personally, this anime is actually pretty decent when it first started, but when I try to compare its later episode, where are of his harem came together, It became quite uninteresting, and even, unengaging when a certain episode is dedicated to a certain girl in his harem. Though, if you are going hate this show for its depiction of lewd 2D girls, who are obviously premature, then hate all the show that's out there that does the same too. Even if that includes your favorite show. Konosuba is one, they lewd Megumin. Tbh, it should be pretty normal to see such a thing in thiscommunity that you've gotten involved in. You may also hate this show for the somewhat revolutionary idea of romance of legal incest story, that being said, no one are going to make an actual romance of that IRL, so what's the big deal. I live in the same circumstances as this, not blood related sister and shit, if you see her as your sister, no sane person (ones that have a sister) who even want to hook up with them as a lover or as a love interest. That's only in anime and stuff from the ancient times, where King arthur fall in love with his mother without both knowing that they are related, and got kill for it or something along those line. Or, tribes, emperors, king practicing that lineage thing, where only blood related sibliings or descedent can make love and reproduce in order to keep that, idk, snobbish tradition of treating a certain blood as a part of the royalty, or being special and superior in a way from other human beings. And ofc, Eromanga is different because she's not blood related, but the general theme of the genre is the same.\\n\\n\r\nThis quality of animation is undeniably of a pretty high quality. The characters are consistently well drawn, and their designs or character are detailed and consistent through and through (we barely see the camera angle zoomed, or angled from afar for a very long duration). It's hard to bring in subjectivity, the way you felt about the show, and lesser the quality of the art/animation through subjectivity, in order to justify a 1/10 or even lower for the art/animation of the show. In order to explain how shit this show really is. It's irrational to take irrationality (subjectivity) and apply it to rational things such as art. Art are obviously something that we all can agree on. If something looks good and well drawn, that's a good quality art. some people tries to bend logic or idea of artistic around, to push their bias view that pampered to their own irrationality and subjective feelings, over evaluating things with a certain degree of maturity and objectivity in it. The evaluation on the story are entirety subjective, though, it's hard to say the same if you are going to evaluate the external content of the anime, like the art, music, voice acting, animation (the amount of frame to frame picture that is drawn to make the animation looks smooth or not smooth) and so on. And some scene in this is actually smooth as hell. There are some cartoonish art style here and there to charaterized the character (like when sagiri do popeye looking mouth thing). And the lewd of fanservice is justified, look at the fucking title name mate. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga sensei is a very fun show for its early 5 episodes and so; though, I kinda lost interest once there's this trip event in the show, as the entirety of his harem grouped up, indicating signs of wanting to be his love interest to one another (basically to their rivals in romance). I mean, it's cool how at least this anime, unlike many other harem, are extremely honest about their feeling for the MC, and even be as bold to confess their love. And this is through the used of scenery, or subtle ways of confessing, and other dramatic elements to make that scene of the confession, less boring and more romantic than any other harem series that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are quite a myriad of negatives when it comes to the approach, the method of developing a character, and the overly clicheness of the anime, where the show tries to be different, but done it in a pretty half assed way.\\n\\n\r\nAs we all know, a cliche harem show is basically a show where there's only one guy with multiplicity of women, who are seeking to fight one another (though, they will still care about one another either way as a friend) just to hook up with the MC, depending on the route that the anime may take for each or all girls. I'm actually pertaining to the VN of any harem series, that tend to contain a harem route, or a route that solely focused specifially on one candidate of the MC's harem. This being said, the anime tries to bring in at least other male character that seem to have no interest in girls, or bring in some random dudes into the story, pretending to be different from other harem show that we've seen. The pretentious part here isn't the fact that this anime have other males in it, ones that who are close to the MC and in a position to communicate with people from the MC's harem that is. The pretentious part here is bringing him out of nowhere, be a part of the different event that they took place in (like the beach episode), then forcely or conveniently put him away, making his existence seem quite unneeded. It's as if he wasn't even needed in the show but they just decided to keep him there anyway. There's no point of having him take part in a certain activities with the MC and of his harem, when you're going to get rid of him during it anyway (talking about the King's game screen, the game where you draw a number, and tell them to do whatever you want). \\n\\n\r\nThe approach of the harem is done quite horribly, it's not to say that this anime is bad as a whole for creating this horrible harem after all of the harem are introduced. It's just their way of presenting and giving only a little bits of moment for the MC and the girl of interest for a very short moment. It doesn't progresses to anything much, though, it might have created a reaction from the MC, but that either stagnated just to add in some dramatic scene in the episode, or to make the girls became even more competitive in becoming the MC's love interest. And his love for his little sister is a barrier for the MC to not hook up with other women, just like the very popular meme, \"I love emilia\" scene, rip Rem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, you also call any author of such medium like a manga writer, light novel writer etc as sensei in the otaku community (everyone calls them that, see the anime man interviews with spice of wolf author, or konosuba author, or shirobako and bakuman, an anime on the production making of manga and anime industry). \\n\\n\r\nThe actual story maybe about that rivaly thing in regards to being an author and all. So it's not weird for the story to be about it, but the anime neglected this aspect, and proceeds on towards the typical harem moment rather than focusing more so on the main aspect of the story, and that's, striving for success in the industry (mainly for the MC's case since other authors are more successful than him). And anime move the plot quite slowly as well, that's prolly a down side of the show if you hate seeing characters spending time together (having fun), and developing some kind of a relationship with those interactions. It's pretty slice of life-ish if I were to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime followed a typical template of a typical harem show, though that's not a negative of the show, since every story in other community does the same. Deadpool for example, it follows the exact same template like any typical hero shows, and the hero's journey (the infamous outline for hero's story that everyone accidentally followed). The matter of criticizing the show here is how it was done, and how do you like it personally. This part is really subjective to one's taste, since people expect different things from a story, and our definition of entertainment are never entirely the same. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that being said, this show has a great start, the quality drops though from its early episodes once all the harem is introduced, however, this is not a bad show. There are a number of negatives and positive in this show. But tbh, this show is pretty cute and fanservice heavy it maybe, it's a fucking fanservice show on premature girls and that isn't new at all in the otaku community. It's for a very niche audience that likes it. If you hate people lewding premature girls, hearing them saying lewd things like, \"I want to see your panties\", \"all girls my age love dicks\" etc. This anime is not for you.",

            "content": "I don't normally tend to point fingers at people, but just this once I feel like I need to get some things off my chest here.\r\nAlmost every single season nowadays, it seems there has to be a scapegoat. An anime which you are somehow obliged to publically hate on or you'll be looked down upon by the community and no one will take you seriously. I'm honestly sick of this kind of group pressure/bandwagon mentality. We're now halfway through the year 2017 and yet hating on popular stuff over the internet is somehow still considered to be the coolest and best thing since sliced bread.*Especially* when it's gross, creepy and immoral shit made for closet pedos, am I right? Shows like this really bring out the most toxic sides of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have an anime which totally wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn't try to hide its true intentions in any way, why is it that so many people seemingly insist on still making themselves watch it even when it's clear as day that they're not going to like it and that they're not part of the target audience? Eromanga-sensei is one of the most blatantly polarizing series in the last few seasons, and quite frankly you should be able to easily figure out whether you will enjoy it or not just from reading the synopsis and by considering the fact that it is written by the same author as Oreimo.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Eromanga-sensei features the following:\\n\r\n- A glimpse into the life of a young, aspiring light novel author in Japan\\n\r\n- Lots of references to other anime, light novels, the industry itself and more\\n\r\n- Pseudo-incestuous relationship themes (they're not actually blood-related)\\n\r\n- Somewhat trope-filling and eccentric characters\\n\r\n- Cutesy moe-style heroines\\n\r\n- Frequent suggestive shots of various middle school girls\\n\r\n- An abundance of romcom clich\u00e9s and sexual gags\\n\r\n- Memes\\n\r\n- Cameos of characters from Oreimo\\n\r\n- The perfect setup for providing tons of juicy ero-fanart and doujins\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have a problem with several of these themes, you don't need to watch this anime. It really isn't any more complicated than that. It is clearly not for you, and you don't need to go out of your way to force yourself to watch it just so you can go on a lengthy rant afterwards about how trashy it is, how it is \"pandering to otaku\", label it as \"pedo-bait\" or anything along those lines. If you're not even part of an anime's target demographic then quite frankly you have no business trash-talking it for not adhering to your own standards\u2014the problem lies entirely on your end in that case. Criticizing an anime for its execution is logical\u2014criticizing an anime for merely belonging to a certain genre is not. You don't need to go on the aggressive from the safe place behind your monitor just to feel better about yourself. If your sole reason for watching an anime is to make fun of and insult the people enjoying it, you really need to get your priorities straight. Even more curious are some comments I've seen basically saying \"i-it's not like I enjoy watching this terrible anime or anything, don't get the wrong idea, baka!\", as if implying that either their morals or the group pressure is preventing them from admitting to themselves that they actually like it. Give me a break already.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, as someone who actually does enjoy those kinds of themes and absolutely loves imoutos in general, Eromanga-sensei is a pretty solid anime that does just about all the simplistic things I could ask of it. It's cute, light-hearted, decently funny at times, has a lot of sexy shots of ero-kawaii and energetic moe girls, and is just plain fun and enjoyable in general. And as a result, what you have is a thoroughly entertaining anime despite everything. Yes, that is in fact all that's needed, as shocking as that might be for some people to believe.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Eromanga-sensei follows the lives of a high school light novel author named Izumi Masamune and his hikikomori little sister Sagiri, who somewhat secretly works as an erotic illustrator for his novels amongst other things under the pen name Eromanga-sensei. The story follows both their struggles with their respective jobs as well as their relationship with each other as step siblings. There are also a number of other girls involved in one way or another, primarily the eccentric Yamada Elf who is also a top-selling light novel author, as well as the even more successful Senju Muramasa who on top of being an author is also Masamune's biggest fan. There's also Sagiri's pushy classmate Jinno Megumi who keeps trying to find ways to convince Sagiri to leave her room and go to school for once. It's a simple setup overall, but it serves as an easy way to get the protagonist and the various girls intimately involved with each other on both a personal and professional level, which is a good thing since the main selling point of Eromanga-sensei is the characters' interactions with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, it is all quite similar to Oreimo in not just the incestuous themes but the type of chemistry between the main characters and the side characters as well. And as it happens, they generally fulfill somewhat similar roles too. Just like Kirino, Sagiri is here the otaku imouto with a rather perverted hobby who is also quite obviously in love with her Onii-chan. In terms of personality though, they're very different from each other. Whereas Kirino was an outgoing honors student and a rather extreme tsundere, Sagiri is shy, reclusive and more of a dandere than anything, and she gets embarrassed easily whenever she's not hiding behind the mask of her online Eromanga-sensei persona. But perhaps most importantly, just like Kirino, Sagiri is incredibly sexy. The vast majority of the show's fanservice is centered on her in the form of various suggestive shots of her inside her room, but it's done in a rather smooth and natural way so it doesn't feel out of place. It's the type of eroticism which greatly enhances an anime's enjoyment value in my mind; the kind that makes you repeatedly pause the video to rape the screenshot button for academic purposes. I appreciate it quite a lot. It's no wonder that Sagiri has already been crowned the clear ero-fanart queen of the season by the Japanese portion of the internet, as is quite evident if you go visit just about any major anime image board at the moment (which is also a bit ironic considering that drawing such pictures is literally what Sagiri does for a living herself).\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, if Sagiri is supposed to be \"the new\" Kirino, then you'd also have to argue that Elf is the new Kuroneko. Elf is the energetic and weird yet funny girl of the show, being an immensely talented writer but also a rather lazy one who only sees her work as a hobby, and thus only writes whenever she feels like it, much to the dismay of her editors. Furthermore, she's also a bit of a chuuni nutcase who consistently does stupid things for the amusement of all. As a result, while she's not quite as sexualized as Sagiri is, overall I would still say Elf is the most likable and entertaining girl of Eromanga-sensei due to how enjoyable her personality is. In other words it's pretty much the same story as with Oreimo where (in my opinion) Kuroneko was ultimately the best girl even though Kirino was sexy as hell. For all the old Ayase fans out there though, I'm sorry to say but there isn't really a replacement for her in Eromanga-sensei. Instead we have Muramasa taking the role of the third love rival, but she's not particularly similar. If anything she's the most publically affectionate towards Masamune out of the trio, but for rather... questionable reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story itself goes, the viewers are pretty much told from the beginning that this will eventually head down the pseudo-incest route as Masamune and Sagiri are evidentially in love with each other and Masamune makes it quite clear on numerous occasions that she is the only girl he has eyes for. While he is still a little bit dense at times, Masamune at least has the guts to confess that he is in love with Sagiri from quite early on in the series, which is pretty commendable considering their relationship. However, it will probably take a while before that ship really sets sail, because in this (first?) season alone, there isn't really much in the way of romantic progression beyond that confession. It is more of a standard romcom in terms of execution thus far, but certainly not a bad one. Meanwhile we also have the ongoing subplot of the siblings trying to create the supposed \"greatest light novel ever\" together where Masamune writes the story and Sagiri draws the illustrations. It reminds me a bit of Bakuman in that sense, but of course it's not quite as forefront about it here. However, this subplot is most certainly something that really asks for a sequel one day.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Eromanga-sensei though is that despite everything, Masamune and Sagiri aren't actually blood-related. The main appeal of incest in anime to me is the general taboo feeling of it, you know: \"it's forbidden, therefore it's exciting\" and all. Making them step-siblings instead is thus both a bit of a boner-killer as well as a cop-out move by the author, and it kind of feels like the anime goes out of its way to remind the audience of this annoying fact a few too many times. However, if you're familiar with the infamous ending of Oreimo and more importantly the backstory behind why that happened in the first place, this was most likely a conscious decision by the author in order to make sure the same thing won't happen a second time around. Oreimo was kind of ruined by its terrible ending, so having the knowledge that at least Eromanga-sensei won't suffer the same fate is a bit of a relief. I just wish he didn't have to sacrifice part of the show's main appeal to ensure this part, but I guess SJWs are unfortunately just that powerful in today's society.\\n\\n\r\nYou probably shouldn't compare everything to Oreimo though\u2014after all this is just as much of a standalone work as that was\u2014but considering that even the main characters of Oreimo makes appearances in Eromanga-sensei, they're not only similar but evidentially also take place in the same universe and time span. For what it's worth though, minus its ending I would still probably say Oreimo was slightly better not only because of the blood-relation issue, but there was also more of a struggle there due to Kirino's conservative father being fully against her otaku hobbies, whereas in Eromanga-sensei, Masamune's parents are both conveniently absent from their house. It all feels a bit easier in Eromanga-sensei, which is not inherently a bad thing mind you but I think it makes it a little bit less unique. Then again, as they say: \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the production values goes, the animation (done by A-1 Pictures) is... okay, I guess? Nothing out of the ordinary but enough for the girls to always look attractive, which is about all that's required in this case. On top of that, both the OP and ED of Eromanga-sensei are honestly great; they're both incredibly catchy tunes that easily stand out as among the best from this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eromanga-sensei is a simplistic, clich\u00e9 and quite lewd romcom which will surely turn off a lot of people due to its themes, but it excels at doing the exact things it sets out to do for its own specific target audience, and thus at least for me it was one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.\\n\\n\r\nI also find it a bit ironic how other shows like New Game for example (which I also really liked) get to receive general praise from the community for doing nothing but showing cute moe girls working in the entertainment media industry, mixed with comedy and fanservice, yet Eromanga-sensei is receiving so much hate for doing basically the exact same thing? Hypocrisy at its finest. Are the incest themes really *that* big of a deal? Or is it the supposed ages of the girls? I mean really now? I can't help but feel legitimately sorry for people who let something like that ruin their enjoyment of an anime.",

            "content": "Something I find hilarious is that no one can explain why Eromanga Sensei is a good show. I see people giving this an 8-10 rating and saying it's a good show, but not once I've seen anyone mentioning any legitimate good quality about Eromanga except for: \"it's cute\", \"Sagiri is so cute\", \"it has cute girls\", \"incest is wincest\". This may be unfair since I shouldn't be trashing on anyone's likings and I believe people have the right to enjoy whatever the hell they like, but I cannot shake the annoyance that some people are just satisfied with anything at this point. Trust me, Ilike cute girls and lolis as much as the next guy does, but somewhere somehow we need to draw the line and notice when our intelligence is being insulted. Does the only thing that an anime needs is for it to have cute girls, some type of incestuous relationship, a copy/paste generic protagonist (that took no effort to create), a bunch of terribly forced memes and loli fanservice for us anime fans to be all over it on social media and be supporting this garbage? If this isn't an insult to the viewer's intelligence then I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who do not know, this story was done by the same people who made the highly controversial Light Novel (later adapted into an anime), My Little Sister Can't be this Cute (better known as OreImo). Apart from targeting a niche audience with the sibling romance subplot, OreImo is infamous for receiving harsh backlash from fans upon its completion for its trash ending. Details were revealed that the LN editors did not allow Tsukasa Fushimi to go through with a full incest ending.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping this in mind, it becomes very apparent that Eromanga Sensei is trying to be OreImo. Not only does this series do a terrible job at copying all the elements that made OreImo successful, but it makes sure to establish the single fact that led to the downfall of the show. It utilizes one of the most used loopholes sibling romances do to get away with what they're doing by making sure everyone knows that the two main characters ARE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. Did you hear that? THEY'RE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. The previews make sure you know this, the manga makes sure you know this, the anime makes damn sure you know this.\\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to believe anyone genuinely thinks Eromanga Sensei will not have the brother & sister get it on at some point. It only takes a fraction of knowledge about the author, OreImo and its history to know this has been created just because the author hasn't gotten over his sister fetish. Even so, there are a bunch of other female characters (not)worth mentioning. The thing is, none of these characters seem remotely interesting or feel like real people. They're walking anime tropes that will only exist for the purpose of having the main guy hang around with other girls than his sister and to let the audience have a bit of variety. I have checked the manga and there is no indication they will get interesting enough to carry this bad comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI found it very sickening how cynical and shamelessly Eromanga Sensei tries to bait the siscon/lolicon audience. Countless promising shots of the girls (especially the FREAKING 10-YEAR-OLD) are shown to obviously excite the viewer and trust me, I don't want to be the normie guy who trashes the sexualization of kids in anime, but these are literally middle schoolers. Like, this show is WAY too in your face with fanservice shots. Only 4 episodes in and we've basically seen the little sister naked at least 3 times already. It doesn't even try to hide the fact that they want to attract \"that\" type of audience, and what bothers me is that they're so out of place. Eromanga Sensei does this so much I'm kinda creeped out that full grown men have such cynical mentality to attract people into their mediocre show with a few ass/breast shots of little girls (if this was an ecchi series I could understand, but Eromanga is not). Every episode gets so much worse with the fanservice it reaches to a point that is just absurd, even for modern anime standards. I honestly feel like I need to call the cops ASAP while watching Eromanga Sensei, just for witnessing the amount of pedophilic vibes this series gives off. If you're into that stuff, then knock yourself out I guess...\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk a little bit more about the characters: they all suck. Every single one gets on my nerve, and the one who doesn't (the black haired who works as a librarian) is so uninteresting it's shocking. First off, the main girl is the lolicon's/siscon's dream imouto, a ridiculously cute, empty shell of a girl who's only noteworthy characteristics are that acts like a tsundere, refuses to leave her room and draws porn for fun. The main guy is generic MC #198,567 (he's voiced by Kirito ffs) who has a terrifying obsession with his sister. People accuse Kyouske of being a terrible siscon, but Masamune is on another level. When he's not screaming, he's ranting on how beautiful his 10-year-old sister is and you can just feel this guy wants to bang her brains out. OreImo at least had the decency to slowly develop the sibling romance, and most of the side characters were interesting and felt like real people (Kuroneko alone makes OreImo a better show btw). The other characters in Eromanga Sensei are stock templates and not worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nPeople criticize OreImo for being a bad anime with nothing new to say, and solely aimed at the siscon/lolicon otaku audience. I find these allegations funny because I've seen those same people dare to claim this is better than OreImo. Unlike Eromanga Sensei, OreImo HAD something to say (nothing that hasn't been explored, but nevertheless it was something). In part, OreImo's first season had a couple interesting themes like the exploration on otaku culture in Japan, the difficulties of liking something that is heavily looked down upon in society and those around you, and the evolving friendship (ultimately romantic interest) between two different types of siblings. Eromanga Sensei, on the other hand, is a soulless, empty copy of its predecessor that could only appeal to the type of people it is obviously intended for. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that bothered me the most about Eromanga Sensei is that it tries so damn hard to create memes. This show is just asking, BEGGING to be the next meme on Twitter. From having a character's first trait being that \"SHE LOVES DICKS\", to having the main loli have a cute (completely out of character) dance at the beginning and opening themes that is begging you with red letters to make a gif out of it and share it with your friends. The show constantly has looping, cute or \"funny\" moments that are obviously intended to be the laugh of the week (this isn't Konosuba, so it doesn't work). Since the show is trying so hard to be a meme, I propose we treat it as such. The meme of the season. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I have nothing more to say in this unorganized rant. I really needed to get this anger I have towards this show off my chest somehow and hopefully open some eyes. If you have nothing to watch this season, maybe you would want to check out Eromanga Sensei. Watching one episode a week is more easy to pass than when a series is completed (it's the only reason why I might watch some more; also to possibly rant about it some more in the future). However, expect a \"moe-blob\" of a series that shamelessly copies its big brother and all the cliches of the industry. As I indirectly suggest throughout this review, if you want to watch a similar show done by the same people and with the same ideas, watch OreImo if you haven't and do not waste your time on this. It has a more refreshing and interesting cast than Eromanga, it connects much better with the ideas it's trying to present and is overall more presentable than this garbage. The thing that bothers me the most is that Eromanga Sensei is becoming extremely popular amongst anime fans. To my understanding, it has been very successful in preorder sales in Japan and it is very talked about in online communities. Yes, all those meme attempts have been working so far, and people are loving the ass shots of Sagiri and Megumi saying she loves dicks. This motivates the industry into producing more of this quality of anime, and we all know anime deserves much better. All I can say is that I really hope Eromanga Sensei gets forgotten after the season ends and it's remembered as the cheap theatrics it is, or at least I hope so.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is my proof that every day we stray further from Kamisama, and that Miyazaki-sensei was right about anime all along.",

            "content": "For better and for worse (mostly worse), Eromanga-sensei is the successor to OreImo and its themes of sister-banging. But where OreImo had some interesting things to say about the otaku community, Eromanga-sensei possesses nothing, and is nothing, puerile and creatively bankrupt. \r\nEromanga-sensei in many ways represents everything that is bad with light novels. It is a story (I guess, if we put aside its flagrantly incestual nature) of a group of twelve-to-fifteen-year-olds who are famous artists, as if adults do not and cannot exist. If Eromanga-sensei was taking inspiration from the scribbles of a bunch of middle school students, its rubbish writing would actually makea great deal of sense.\\n\\n\r\nStop me if you've heard this one before: the protagonist and a sexy lady, both being inexperienced in the affairs of love, try to imitate romantic situations with one another as a source of creative inspiration. No? How about the protagonist's rival conveniently being revealed as a cute girl who is desperately in love with him? Or the heroine angrily retreating to her room and screaming \"bakaaa!\" as the camera pans away? See, Eromanga-sensei isn't an anime that is particularly concerned with sharing anything you haven't already seen in dozens or hundreds of other equally brain-dead romantic comedies. (And seriously, if I have to watch another anime with a hikikomori heroine who is portrayed as some goddess of attraction, I'm going to have an aneurysm.)\\n\\n\r\nI suppose the difference here is that Eromanga-sensei is neither romantic nor comedic. It sure as hell is not funny (unless you are the type who thinks burping is the pinnacle of comedic genius), and its 'romance' is merely a thinly-veiled attempt to make it seem somewhat less like masturbation fodder. Fodder which, by the way, has a regularly sexualised heroine who is only twelve-years-old. Let that sink in for a second: twelve-years-old. She is twelve, and the anime frequently displays detailed shots of her ass, her panties, her naked body, and so forth, and even thinks it is amusing to have her friend (who is the same age, by the way) howling about how she loves penises. Yeah. Really. \\n\\n\r\nEven if lolicon pornography does not bother you, it would be an impossible task to claim this contributes to the story or the characters in any meaningful way. It actively sabotages whatever emotional value it tries to create between Sagiri and Masumune's relationship, and makes it impossible to take seriously anything that happens or could conceivably happen. For example, the anime will reveal Masamune's tragic past in the span of about one minute, and then immediately open the next episode with a girl clad in her bikini and flirting with him. Eromanga-sensei doesn't even do the incest part right since it is more concerned with creating some periphery harem for Masamune than it is with developing his feelings for Sagiri beyond \"hey I like you lol.\" It is stupid on the level of KonoSuba and yet has the audacity to pretend without a hint of sarcasm that it is some touching story. No.\\n\\n\r\nIt is actually a fairly sad result when compared to the author's previous work, OreImo. OreImo, flawed and infuriating as it was, actually put a great deal of time into making Kirino and Kyosuke's feelings for one another feel meaningful. Kirino was no doubt insufferable, but by the end, you could at least look at her as something more than an assortment of tropes and incest appeal. Likewise, it also went into a fair amount of detail with regards to the life of a stereotypical otaku. It represented Comiket, eroge, offline meetings, and the conflict people can have when they possess hobbies they are ashamed of. It was no Genshikan, but OreImo did at least try to contribute something to the industry with more appeal than \"well, gee, banging your sister sounds like a fun idea.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for Eromanga-sensei, which does and says nothing about the industry. Any moment when it does display the struggles of Masamune's career, it is extremely, unbearably dull, and often propelled by silly plot devices like one of his love interests offering all their royalties in return for Masamune becoming their slave. The whole premise of being a light novel author is an accessory that may as well not even exist. If you stripped all the fanservice away, all that would expose is the show's unsightly skeleton. \\n\\n\r\nI can't think of any situation where Eromanga-sensei could come as a recommendation. It is asinine dreck, without so much as a modicum of creativity. I suppose its colourful art and catchy opening animation may lead some people into thinking the anime is more than it truly is, but it is best to be honest: the sole reason anyone likes this show is because they want to bone the twelve-year-old heroine. \\n\\n\r\nNow how much merit is there in a story like that?\\n\\n\r\nI'd wager not a whole not.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is a culmination of everything I hate in lazy, insipid, vacuous, pandering entertainment. Now, to clarify, first of all, I don't believe that just because an anime, or any piece of entertainment, panders towards a certain demographic, that it is inherently bad necessarily. There has been plenty of anime that pander towards the otaku audience while, at the same time, remaining fun, and some instances, good shows, but Eromanga-sensei is not such an example. It's a show that lives by the convention in terms of its plot structure, comedy, character archetypes and dives head first into trashiness at any moment it can get. Whatcould have been an interesting look into why and how people who shut themselves inside their homes live on a daily basis, akin to something along the lines of Welcome to the N.H.K or something, the show just decides to opt out instead for loli fan-service instead, ditching anything that made Oreimo, somewhat enjoyable, and, in some parts, decent. Before I continue, I'd just like to clarify that I am not hating on this show just because the original creator also created Oreimo. As I just said, I found that show to be decent (until the ending anyway) but it also had a few things that I could appreciate when it comes to meta humour about otaku and the anime industry as a whole. Eromanga-sensei has none of that. It's pointless, empty and has no value as a show at all. It's trash in every sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before I dive into the numerous reasons as of why I believe this show to be as poor as I think it is, let's discuss the plot first of all. Masamune is a somewhat successful, trashy light novel author who has been writing for several years now to support his younger step-sister, Sagiri, a shut-in, t, who refuses to go out and stamps on the floor of her bedroom whenever she wants anything. While Masamune writes these books and even has illustrations done for him, he doesn't actually know who this illustrator actually is, who goes by the name 'Eromanga-sensei' who actually turns out to be Sagiri herself! That's right! A 13-year-old girl draws erotic pictures! Oh boy! Anyway, the rest of the show sees Masamune and Sagiri begin to bond and grow closer together, while splicing in some romance between the two (because that's needed between siblings, am I right?) while Masamune is challenged by numerous other light novel authors in the business for slots in magazines, eventually becoming their friends and going along their merry way. The show's narrative is incredibly simple and boring to boot since there is no objective or even direction in the story. It moves awkwardly from scene to scene with no sense of flow or reasoning behind any of the characters and the entire show just feels like one big filler arc from a long-running shounen series or something. Now, I'm not saying that all anime need some kind of story, especially if it is going for comedy, but Eromanga's comedy in itself is poor, repetitive and so predictable, mostly derivative from seeing characters becoming embarrassed at removing their clothing, or from juvenile misunderstandings. One such example is a joke centred around a gay misunderstanding, in which another light novel author believes that Masamune is gay and has the hots for him, resulting in some of the most dreadful gags in the show. It feels like a 14-year-old wrote the entire thing, which is ironic, considering that I can only imagine that demographic finding this sort of weak comedy actually funny. \\n\\n\r\nSagiri's problem of being a shut-in was the only, the ONLY thing that the show had going for it and it throws it out so fast! I was genuinely interested to see what the show may do with this element; perhaps comment on the bigger picture of shut-ins in Japan perhaps, or delve into the psychological reasons behind this character's reasoning for why she has to say inside, but nope! They ditch this element and Masamune doesn't even try and help her with this issue at all and instead panders towards. He doesn't try to make her see why this is a problem, nor does his try to help her go into the outside world or anything. Sagiri is there just to be cute and that's it! We hardly learn anything about her as a person and she is such a brat that I can't stand every moment that she is on screen. Like most bad shows, the anime attempts to throw incest into the mix, and it comes across as so forced and disgusting. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which isn't actually related to me by blood, the thought of Masamune and Sagiri entering into a romantic relationship generally disgusts me to no end and all I hear people shout is \"INCEST IS WINCEST\" constantly, actually hoping the two will get together in the end. I also just hate the general excuse of \"oh! They're not related by blood, so it's fine!\". No, it's not. It's just as creepy and strange. To me, this aspect of the show baffles me, and I've never understood the appeal of little sisters in anime. This problem is also highlighted by the fact that we have young 13-year-old girls proclaiming that they love dicks out in public, just for all of the filthy weebs to rub their dicks at the thoughts of seeing this in action or something. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things the show has received a lot of flak for is the excessive amounts of loli fan-service all around; most of the cast consists of young girls, who are consistently put into revealing swimsuits or underwear. Now, I don't necessarily have any problem with fan-service in a series, as long as it serves some kind of purpose or is not intrusive on the narrative at any point. \\n\r\nIt feels like Eromanga-sensei's fan-service scenes were made for the sole purpose of padding the episodes out and the whiplash from seeing a bunch of kids half naked, to a heartfelt speech about love is so jarring that it makes each one of these scenes an absolute chore to watch since you know that nothing is happening and is just killing time. Not only that, but the situations the show sets up for its fan service feels just as equally as contrived and weak, and it's not like the fan-service by itself is even that alluring either as the animation and art style is rather generic and uninspired. While not a good show by any stretch, the currently airing Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, is a much better example of a fan-service vehicle since it is full frontal with its trashiness and doesn't try to hide underneath the pretence of being any more than that like Eromanga-sensei does with its terrible attempt of sounding more emotional and deep. The show has a plethora of more emotional moments and speeches between each of its characters, all of which are generic, but the main problem is that they feel like a cheap attempt at making these characters have more depth than they actually have. Nowhere is this more evident than in the penultimate episode of the show, where we learn that Masamune and Sagiri were contacting each other over the internet even before they met and formally became siblings. This twist feels needlessly convenient and lazy. That's the best word I can use to summarise this show: it's lazy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, every single one are essentially archetypes of already existing characters that have been done to much better effect in the past. As such, I often inadvertently find myself comparing them to similar characters, even when I dislike doing so as I wish to treat each piece of media as its own thing. Masamune is your generic main lead, who has a kind soul, is a hard, earnest worker, has a soft voice while getting embarrassed and flustered whenever a girl is revealing any clothing within his proximity. Oh, and every girl falls in love with him, just because the plot demands them to do so! Sagiri, likewise, has very little to offer in terms of character or personality. As I have already mentioned, I disliked this character, with a burning passion! She is so selfish, and acts so much like a brat, screaming \"ONII-CHAN IS A BAKA!\" at the top of her lungs that I feel like reaching through the monitor of my laptop and slapping her in her face. While, yes, she does warm up to her big brother to a certain extent (a little too much if you know what I mean) her character is just incredibly stale and unoriginal. She has no merits at all, and as I have already discussed, any possible potential for her development in regards to her shut-in problem is thrown completely out the window because the show is too lazy to even have one decent idea. We do learn the back-stories to both Sagiri and Masamune, something I can appreciate, it feels so tacked on and forced that it leaves no impact, and, instead, feels like, again, a lazy and cheap way for the audience to care about these two without building up their characters at all. A sad and tragic back-story is a good way to make a character feel tragic and helps the audience empathise with them, but the character also has to develop too and, at the same time, be well written, which this show fails at.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my hatred for Sagari (and little sisters in anime in general), even she is nowhere near as bad as Yamada Elf! She is another light novel author, only this time, stuck up her own ass, believing she is the greatest thing that has ever walked on the planet. She is also extremely selfish, but also EXTREMELY annoying to watch, due to her actions and her voice actress. Hell, one of our earliest introductions to her character is when she is playing the piano in her house while also being completely naked at the same time! Thanks, Eromanga-sensei, I am, as everyone else is, now on the FBI watch list. Oh boy. While her character does eventually confess her love for our dry-as-wood main protagonist, her character arc (or lack of character as a whole) goes nowhere. Her only point in the narrative is fan-service, and that's it. She is not interesting, fun to watch and every scene she was in only drew me closer to kicking the chair from beneath my feet to taste the sweet release of death from this shitty world. The only somewhat decent character is Muramasa, another girl who falls for Mr Light Novel Guy (our protagonist) and the only character who has some reasoning and justification into her love for him. As a whole, the characters themselves are very weak and the comedic chemistry the show attempts to build between them doesn't work at all, and, again, feels so trite and forced to boot. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic is just fine, very typical of what you'd expect from A-1 Pictures. The character designs were somewhat cute (so much so that one of my friends said he would 'destroy' Sagairi if you catch my drift) but it just feels so mundane and 'safe'. The same thing can be said about the music too. While the opening and ending track were both fine (especially the ending track which was both catchy as hell, and, admittedly cute seeing Sagairi dance despite how much I hate her) the music as a whole is horribly generic, which, at the very least, is consistent with the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing people may say in defence of the show is that you're supposed to just enjoy it and not take anything seriously since the show doesn't really take itself seriously at all. With its outlook on the workers of the light novel industry, it presents its characters as all being rather incompetent and it seems to acknowledge, to some degree, that these writers are indeed bad, but tries to excuse and justify this by claiming that the stories are interesting to read. This philosophy presented in the show may also arise in arguments in favour of the show, which, I guess is fine, but I didn't find anything about this show interesting at all, and certainly not entertaining. The comedy is extremely weak, the characters are boring archetypes that go nowhere and the entire show sexualises young girls to ridiculous degrees. Yes, the show is somewhat self-aware of how trashy it is, but just because it is so, doesn't make the anime any good. In fact, it only makes it worse since it does nothing else to subvert or go against these troupes presented in the show, and instead decides to go down the lazy route, and just appeal to the lowest common denominator. Now, I want to make it clear now, that I do not begrudge anyone for actually enjoying this show, as the tone in this review may suggest otherwise. I honestly am glad if you managed to find enjoyment in a show that I found so repulsive, and more power to you because of that. But, for me, this show was abysmal in every possible way, and I'll be seeing you all in prison when the FBI eventually tracks us all down...\\n",

            "content": "After watching Eromanga Sensei my eyes have opened of how most modern anime from 2015+ have been dumbed down in terms of story and characters.\r\nWe have been recently getting a lot of shows that either decent or downright bad that have no real impact on the anime industry.\r\nSure we got some great and memorable shows such as 3 Gatsu no Lion Assassination Classroom, Shokugeki no Souma, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju and Little Witch Academia (TV) but at the same time, we had to deal with mediocre to awful shows like Charlotte, Gangsta, Berserk 2016/2017, Scum's Wish etc.\r\nNow do I think for Eromanga Sensei. Is it\u00a0amodern masterpiece or it's a train-wreck that represents everything wrong with modern anime?\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert this show is a dumpster fire that shouldn't seen the light of day.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Eromanga Sensei is very similar to Bakuman as it follows a guy named Masamune who is a light novel author in high school. Masamune has a sister named Sagirl. A hikikomori girl who hasn't left her room for an entire year. Sagirl forces her brother to bring meals for her as well as washing her clothes. Masamune's novel illustrator, Eromanga likes to draw extremely perverted drawings who is very reliable.\\n\r\nIt's later revealed that Eromanga-Sensei is actually his younger sister. Now Masasume must bond with her sister so she can get out of her room as well as making a novel together.\\n\\n\r\nNow imagine Bakuman but with a poorly written story, cringe-worthy characters and Oreimo 2 dialogue and you got yourself Eromanga Sensei. A shit show filled with creepy incest with no substance whatsoever.\\n\r\nAs much I hate to admit it Oreimo Season 1 has some good theme exploration and social topics such as okatu cloture, hiding hobbies that you love from other people due to bad reputation from society and bonding with your family member.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has no themes, no artistic value, no message and no point other to be another shitty okatu pandering show with no soul whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThis is actual dialogue...\\n\r\nThe writing in the show is downright abysmal that is filled with cringe-worthy and awkward the dialogue that insults the viewer's intelligence in many ways.\\n\r\nOne example of this horrific dialogue is in episode 5 where Elf asks Sagirl to make an illustrator of her if she shows her panties on a webcam where it can be possibly be tracked down by police. Instead of saying no and leaving the video chat like a normal person with a brain she shows her panties on the webcam.\\n\r\nThat scene gets followed up with horrendous jail-bait dialogue...\\n\r\nWho the hell wrote this shit seriously!?!?\\n\r\nOverall the story is utter shit and it features some of the worst writing I have ever seen in any anime.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe chararters in Eromanga Sensei aren't chararters\\n\r\nThey are just a bunch cringe-worthy archetypes who have no character development and have no unique personally whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is just your bottom of the barrel siscon/lolion character who does cute things as well as being a shitty tsundere who refuses to leave her room and does weird shit.\\n\r\nMasamune or generic main protagonist #883 who has a creepy obsession with his sister. People may despise Kyouske for being a retarded siscon freak in Oreimo 2 along with that horrific Oreimo 2 special. Masamune, on the other hand, is on another level. When he's not screaming like a marron he's always ranting how beautiful his 13-year-old sister. \"Am not even joking when I say that\"\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters such as Elf Megumi and Muramasa are complete garbage and they are not even mentioning at all. They just exist for cringe-worthy dialogue and meme-service for the Meme community for many social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc.\\n\r\nHell one of the female supporting characters in this show has dialogue that was written by a horny 12-year-old.\\n\r\nThere is a girl in the anime where almost all of her dialogue is base around loving peoples dicks.\\n\r\nAm not even joking when I say that. That's literally her fucking character trait in this fucking show.\\n\r\nOverall the characters are downright awful with no redeeming values whatsoever.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\u00a0\\n\r\nVisually Eromanga Sensei looks nice.\\n\r\nThe characters designs are good for what they are as you expect from a moe show, alright background scene recently and the overall animation is fairly standard. However, there is one thing about Eromanga Sensei that I utterly hate that literally destroys everything.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the camera positioning as well as the camera angles.\\n\r\nThe camerawork and the overall camera direction is just fucking horrendous.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has a lot of unnecessary camera placement for fan-service that is both creepy and stupid. It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable as the anime like to show likes to show a freaking 13-year-old doing sexual things.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so much unnecessary camera shots that honestly makes the viewer sick and uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the pointless shots include.\\n\r\nA close-up ass shot of Elf naked playing the piano. (Episode 3)\\n\r\nAn extreme close-up shot of Megumi panties where the label itself even had Japanese text (Episode 6)\\n\r\nA panty shot of Sagirl from the first 8 seconds of Episode 11. (Am not even fucking joking)\\n\r\nA close-up shot of Sagirl legs in a compromising position. (Episode 11)\\n\r\nA close-up shot of Sagirl getting changed from her jumpers for 20 seconds in episode 5.\\n\r\nThere are still more pointless shots that I missed but I decided to mention these ones as they offended me because not only shot like these wasted time but they also made feel disgusted when every time these shots appear in an episode.\\n\r\nHell, the show at times doesn't know how to use The Rule Of Thirds correctly.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the visuals are decent but it gets ruined by awful camera positioning filled with underage girls and pointless fan-service.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Eromanga Sensei is generic.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are cute and quite catchy for what they are but they are nothing special.\\n\r\nVoice acting is standard as you expect. what more needs to be said really.\\n\r\nIn short, the soundtrack, the opening/ending themes, and voice acting is pretty average.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei is an insult in every sense of the word.\\n\r\nit's an insult to anime fans.\\n\r\nit's an insult to Japanese Illustrators.\\n\r\nIt's an insult to women and its an insult to siblings who are portrayed in this anime as nothing but stalkers and idiots who do incest stuff on screen for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is utter shit that is filled with some of the worst writing and dialogue I have ever seen in any anime. The characters are horrendous archetypes who are annoying and very poorly written from start to finish.\\n\r\nThe visuals are average that ruined by horrific camera angles and camera work that has no point other than to show underage girls in sexual positions and the soundtrack is generic.\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show to anyone whatsoever and you're better off watching Bakuman or go watch Oreimo Season 1 instead of this pile of waste.\\n\r\nThis show represents everything wrong with modern anime and because and I will forever loathe this show with a burning passion.\\n\r\nThis show is nothing but jailbait material.\\n\r\nIf you liked or enjoyed Eromanga Sensei then good for you but for me, screw\u00a0this shit!!!\\n\r\nIf I have to see Sagirl in a compromising position again am really going to lose it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1.5/10",

            "content": "[1/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nOh no. Oh no...\r\nI was holding off on publishing a review until I finished watching. Not for any hope that something like this would get better, but simply due to the fact that I couldn't bring myself to write about whatever this is. Eromanga-sensei is everything wrong with the anime industry. And you know what? That's not funny. I see so many jokes about that concept. How viewers laughingly remark about this series' and how horrible it is but eat it up regardless, promoting this utter shit until it becomes the most popular non-sequel of the season.\r\nAnd it is. Eromanga Sensei is the most popularnon-sequel in Japan. Can you believe it? A show about a fourteen year old trying to fuck his twelve year old sister while she molests other twelve year old girls is the most popular program in Japan. It is probably the most popular program amongst western anime fans too. It baffles me. Coming from a western background, series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad steal that limelight. Sure we have duds like The Walking Dead drifting about with their cable appeal, but even that is understandable to me. At least that has elements of redeemable quality.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga has none of that. Eromanga is the mutated lovechild of everything that's hate-able about this industry and the sole reason why anime series' won't ever be taken seriously. For every angered fan of anime that realizes that their favorite show or non-ghibli film will never see the light of day in any extended theater run or any major awards show; this is why. Eromanga Sensei is hopefully the worst series I'll watch to completion. That's because as a viewer I've mostly stuck with some of the most popular anime. I've made my way through the highly-touted projects and ignored the seasonal popularity. Well, this is my first time delving deep into it and it yields an unforgettable, but totally forgettable product that fails at even the most basic storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThis will have spoilers. If you are reading this and haven't seen the show, good. Don't watch it. It isn't worth it. It's not funny, or engaging, and the memes you have seen about it don't give a holistic representation of the insane tedium which this show revels in. This show isn't \"so bad it's good.\" Far from it. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei is just fucking garbage. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[A Dancing Girl and a Pedophile] \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis series follows a harem protagonist on a mission to fuck with a plethora of forgettable girl archetypes that you've seen a million times in a million different anime. The girl that he will end up being with is Sagiri, his twelve year old NEET sister who has not left her room in years. He also happens to write shitty light novels, much like the ones this series is based on, and his artist just so happens to be the twelve year old non-blood related sister living upstairs. What a coincidence! And of course he finds out and helps her hide her identity. \\n\\n\r\nThen we meet a few other girls who are also light novel writers and play no role other than to create fanservice scenes that aren't just of the main girl. Honestly, the first ten episodes of this series really don't matter. The eleventh episode provides some much needed backstory which just renders the rest of the series up until that point completely useless. Anyway, Eromanga is just a series of empty husks waddling around on screen. It is a collection of sexual gifs that patrol the internet. From the totally inexplicable character writing to the horrendously boring direction to the non-story that is told throughout this series, Eromanga struggles to get anything right. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Visuals]\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are probably the most positive aspect in this series, and even they are incredibly uneven. You see, A-1 hired a unique key animator for Sagiri, the little sister, and only Sagiri. So her animation is often much more fluid than the rest of the characters. This creates an animated whiplash of epic proportions. You go from a well-animated movement to a seizure-like stutter within the same scene. So even if her animation is good, this show has a tendency to skimp out on everything else. \\n\\n\r\nSome highlights are absurdly off-model characters that kind of look hilarious. Really egregious oversights, even in the shows forgettable OP. A-1, like they do, put the minimal effort required into making this show palatable to look at while forgetting to actually give it direction. It looks like any generic as all hell sitcom. Bad. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is mostly just a compilation of characters sitting around talking exposition for minutes on end before they get to the two minutes of fanservice that peppers the internet for the next few days. They virtually just include the last eighteen minutes for no discernible reason. This could've been just two minutes of soft-core porn and I think the fans would have been just as happy, if not more so, with this series. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's bad. The OP is forgettable but not painful, the ED I already forgot. The show has a seasoned atrociousness, as it's unfunny and bland writing is often back-ended by painful background music. Now this ranges from \"fat guy walking\" tuba to \"Squidward playing the clarinet\" and it was initially funny that this series had such abrasive background music. But it got tedious really quick and ended up just making me angry by episode four. \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say. This show sounds horrible.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters/Story]\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow lets get to the meat. And by meat, I mean the meat of a bunch of underage girls that are endlessly used as tools to turn on a bunch of creepy fucking virgins watching this series to get off. I get it, it's okay to imagine children naked if they are fake. And i'm a supporter of the notion that thought-crime shouldn't be illegal because it doesn't harm anyone. I don't honestly care what you think about on your free-time and I care even less if it is totally fictitious and not exploiting anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo my problems with this series isn't that it sexualizes kids. That's nothing new in anime (as disturbing as that is) and it is far from its biggest fault. It's pedophilic and gross, and I often felt ornery watching this series due to the kind of framing devices it used to express its sexuality. For example, instead of diagetically forcing fanservice on us, the director made the 'brave' choice of literally just having shots of characters from below. It felt like a pedophiles hidden camera every time a character was talking. \\n\\n\r\nWhether the show is being serious and dramatic or light-hearted and unfunny, the fanservice never ends. Character is being cute? Show them being cute with a below-the-skirt shot. Character crying? Have it framed so their still developing tits take up half the shot. It's cringe. It is a repulsive way to shoehorn this nonsense into your show. But on the other hand, this is the only thing this show has going for it anyway. It is riddled with plot-holes and totally clueless characters that defy any logic whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nIn one scene it is established that Sagiri cannot draw girls with big tits. Why? Because she uses herself as a model for all her drawings and she is twelve. So her brother, being the great, enabling guy he is, tells her to look up idols on google to discover how to draw big tits. It works! She can now draw big meatsacks. However, two episodes later she regresses back to not being able to draw titties because... a girl showed her, her panties on skype. Let me get this straight, seeing panties made you unable to draw tits. \\n\\n\r\nBut it gets better. \\n\\n\r\nThe way she says she can resolve this issue is if her brother literally lures girls into her room and has them show her their panties. Not only is that fucking creepy, but more importantly, how does drawing panties even relate to drawing tits? Why are glaring issues like this not resolved in the initial adaptation phase?! \\n\\n\r\nThis would be fine. Well, no it actually wouldn't, but not as bad if it didn't lead to one of the most genuinely disturbing scenes i've seen in anime. Now i'm not one to be disturbed, although I am definitely one to cringe. But her brother does it. He finds a girl and drags her to her room, ties her up and blindfolds her and has Sagiri draw her panties. But get this, Sagiri, the twelve year old girl, rips that other twelve year old's panties off. She literally molests another girl. And it isn't really played as anything either, that girl is genuinely uncomfortable and so was I. Get this. They become great friends afterwards too. Talk about Stockholm syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nI wish this was the only ridiculous inanity that occurs, but it isn't. A character called Elf exists. She has pointy elf-ears for literally no reason. It is never explained or mentioned. She just does. Her characterization is as confusing as she is repulsive. Very much so. She shifts between big-sister-esq and comforting to childish and annoying to a complete tsundere from episode to episode and it makes virtually no sense. She is also a part of our protagonist's harem.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the third character. Muramasa. Who's probably the most well-designed of the bunch, but has the personality of a grapefruit.  She's a best selling light-novel author yet it is revealed that she was inspired by our harem protagonist's work ever since she was young. Well, younger. This was an element I guessed the second I saw the character simply because you can't have a character in a harem that is better than the male protagonist. You just can't. This is a power fantasy series for lonely kids and adults that want young girls to flock all over them in their dreams. So you can't have them be worse at anything. You need them to be virtually perfect. And our protagonist is.\\n\\n\r\nThese days, i'm developing a blase attitude towards the inherent sexism showed in anime. Which is a bit sad because I do love me a strong female character who \"don't need no man\". But you know, when the entire medium is marketed towards teenage boys it kind of makes sense to have every male be the best and every women be a toy to be played with. Even if it is obnoxious and kind of distressing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is obviously not any different. In one titular scene we have our protagonist chat with the big brother of Elf, and when he discusses the great things about Elf the only thing he can say is, \"She's nice and is a good cook.\" Wow. What a charmer. And this isn't even played off as a joke, this was a genuine scene with sappy, saccharine music in the background. \\n\\n\r\nThis kind of character writing extends throughout the series, too. The character writing is so bad that it feels like our protagonist is maliciously playing with these girls, since he's shown to be so oblivious that it becomes hard to believe. He rejects a girl, but obviously she keeps pursuing him, but then he proceeds to invite her to plenty of social events, as if it won't be awkward as all hell for her. It truly is a baffling kind of attitude. \\n\\n\r\nI get the excuse, too, that he's just a \"stupid teenager\", and he is. But you know what? Using character stupidity as a plot contrivance isn't good writing. It doesn't make the protagonist or the story any better knowing this dude might actually be handicapped. It just makes it even more frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nWe are getting front row seats to this idiot fucking with these girls. And it isn't funny. Whether he understands that he is doing this or not, it's happening, and it is the least funny thing in a show that is already aggressively unfunny. If it was well-written comedy then it could be played as dark humor, but it isn't, it's just a bunch of girls yelling \"baka!\" really loudly. \\n\\n\r\nTo refer back to that scene of our protagonist talking with Elf's brother, who by the way asked him to marry her in that very scene. Get this, marrying a fourteen year old. He says that he would if he wasn't in love with someone else, referring to his twelve year old sister. However, the episode before he actually told the sister he would be with Muramasa if he wasn't in love with 'someone', as he puts it, since he's unable to admit his love of his sister, sometimes. So this entire scene played as a total contradiction, unless the protagonist was supposed to be a total lying scumbag fuck. I don't think that was intended, though. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to script writing this show is a masterpiece. Much like a Michael Bay script, Eromanga has a tendency to describe everything that is shown. I'm not talking about emotions, i'm talking about literally shown. In one scene they are goofing off instead of working, and when the brother of Elf walks in to catch them in the act of goofing off, Elf stands up and literally explains what he is seeing. It is this baffling mixture of having to exposit a moment and also badly adapting dialogue from the light novel. \\n\\n\r\nYou are seeing everything she is saying. It isn't even the whole \"show don't tell\" rule, that doesn't apply. That's a criticism for bad writing. This isn't bad writing. This is like the a new universe of writing. It is so abysmal that it bore it's way out of the crust of her earth and floated off into space. This kind of writing extends to multiple different episodes too, often times characters restate their purpose multiple times and it still leads to nothing. For example, the entirety of episode ten was about how Muramasa loves the protagonist, but that's been established since her second introductory episode. She literally just reuses the dialogue she used that episode. It is a special kind of absurd.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Speed Round : This show is shit!]\\n\\n\\n\r\n* After a one-episode tournament-esq arc finishes, there is an after party to which everyone who participated in the competition established gets to come. Elf ends up going, even though she wasn't in the competition and this wasn't addressed at all. It was just an excuse to bring all the girls together. \\n\\n\r\n* Everything ties back to the MC for virtually no reason but to make him the focal point of every characters lives. Every character backstory has something to do with our main character and it might be the most contrived bullshit I've ever witnessed on screen. And I watched the entirety of SAO. \\n\\n\r\n* The backgrounds lack any detail whatsoever. We are in a character's room but their room doesn't have any personal mementos or knickknacks. In fact, the only room that has detail is Sagiri's, but she's a NEET with the cleanest room I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\n* To piggy-back off that. She's a NEET hikikomori, stating she hasn't left her room in years. Yet her room is perfectly clean. There is also no bathroom in her room. How does this even work? Does she shit out of the window? This entire show plays this seriously negative affliction as totally okay. \\n\\n\r\n* Uninspired character designs. The parents of our two protagonists are virtually just the same characters but aged up. It is lazy as all hell. \\n\\n\r\n* This show lacks any timing whatsoever. Not only for it's comedic punchlines, but for its fanservice as well. Fanservice can strike at any time and it is distracting and undercuts any potential catharsis this show is trying to establish. \\n\\n\r\n* Episode eleven changes the entire story of the series and renders the past ten episodes totally irrelevant to where the conclusion is heading. \\n\\n\r\n* The finale was completely and utterly pointless, playing more like an OVA than a finale. It was nothing. Much like the rest of this series. \\n\\n\r\n* Girls get embarrassed for virtually no reason. As in, in one scene our protagonist is getting hit on by Elf on the beach as she asks him to spread some sunscreen on her back. Then once he repeats her orders she gets embarrassed about it. Why? Why is girls being embarrassed about inane shit such a cliche in anime? \\n\\n\r\n* In one episode of the series Sagiri makes Elf and Muramasa her models so she can draw them in revealing positions. Yet, to describe the positions, she draws them. So they are models she already had drawn... so why did she even need them to model in the first place? It made no fucking sense. \\n\\n\r\n* Muramasa was often played as the really \"cute\" one, as in, the characters acknowledged how pretty she was. However, since she has the same kind of body-type as any other girl, apart from bigger tits, it wasn't convincing at all. The usual anime presentation of \"same-body, different standards\" that makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\n* If you've noticed I haven't actually said what our protagonist's name is, and that's because it doesn't matter. \\n\\n\r\n* Every girl is a fucking slut. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The state of anime]\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this show isn't that it is bad. Well, it is, it's abhorrent in every way. But the biggest problem, and perhaps the most upsetting issue, is that it is so incredibly popular. It is, undoubtedly, in the mainstream. A show like Eromanga is the mainstream in anime. That is so fucking confusing to me. I tried to explain this earlier but the people who genuinely love this show seem incredibly insecure about their love for it. \\n\\n\r\nThey explained to me that I'm simply being bias and that I'm \"trying\" to hate this show. When that isn't true at all. I actually discovered this show through a meme, which is ironically why it is popular in the first place, because it's made to be a  meme, and I thought the meme was kind of hilarious and I decided to watch the series. Sure, once I realized it is awful I went into every episode expecting nothing but terrible nonsense, but that's logical. You shouldn't go into a snake pit, get bitten, and then go into a snake pit again expecting not to get bitten. Maybe i'm just a masochist, but I feel like I needed to finish this series simply to experience the most awful possible thing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to many people from what I've seen, this is far from the most awful possible thing. I was constantly told that this is just a \"mediocre\" show. That i'm over-exaggerating it's awfulness. To that I say, if this is mediocrity to you, then you might have the most incredibly low standard for television. If this is \"mediocre\" for anime, then anime fucking sucks. If this is \"mediocre\" for anything, then that anything is the worst.\\n\\n\r\nIt is paramount we criticize it too. Supporting a product like this will help fuel more products like this. In 2014,  Miyazaki said something incredibly poignant about anime as an industry, and the fans, instead of taking it seriously, decided to take it as a joke. He made it clear that as an industry, anime is spiraling out into nothingness. There is an endless loop of self-inspiration that will never actually prompt original or groundbreaking content. \\n\\n\r\nAs an industry, anime is otaku driven, and as a people, according to Miyazaki, otaku's aren't usually capable of understanding how people work. And if you are writing characters to represent people and don't understand how people work, your characters will take roles that are wholly unrealistic. We already see this in anime constantly. Completely stupid character archetypes that simply don't exist in the real world, from Tsunderes to the concept of a pure, yet sexual girls that seems to inhabit essentially every anime with inherent, childish sexuality in it. \\n\\n\r\nSo when these totally unaware shows become popular and are roots for inspiration, they spawn more shows like them. Much like SAO did, much like Re:Zero is doing, much like Eromanga sensei will do, and it is a constant loop of something getting worse and worse. It's not funny. It isn't worth joking about. It genuinely makes this industry look awful. I care because I love animation, and while anime and I have mixed feelings about each other, I can't help but support animation as a medium and I want to see it succeed and be utilized to its full potential. But as it stands, anime is hardly scratching the surface and it will continue to scratch less and less as this loop of uncreativity continues. Which is deeply saddening. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion and Criticism]\\n\\n\\n\r\nCriticizing something is important. Critics help spur movements and change notions and promote something of quality. Look no further than the French New Wave, the most influential movement in film history which was spawned in the palms of upset critics that wanted to change the status quo. This movement permeated throughout the world and ended up inspiring the greatest films and directors in of all time. Without the French New Wave, some of the greatest anime wouldn't even exist. Satoshi Kon wouldn't have edited like he did. Monogatari wouldn't have its signature style. At its base, this starts with a criticism. Bringing attention to something. It is incredibly important to fight for the kind of television you want to see. \\n\\n\r\nI get it, though, not everyone wants this in their television. Some viewers just want to see cute girls prance around on screen saying random shit and yelling \"baka!\" loudly. I get it. Some people don't care about a narrative, or characters, or even visuals half the time. This show being popular makes that clear. However, on behalf of everyone that does care. That does want television, specifically anime to push itself further away from the stigma regarding the quality of the medium, I ask you to perhaps watch a series with cute girls but in a narrative that actually exists. Characters that are actually there. And there are plenty of shows like that, too. You don't have to settle for something like Eromanga-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation specializes in cute girls but with engaging characters, exceptional directing, and spectacular visuals. If you are looking for porn, look up porn. If you want to watch a series, make the sacrifice of watching something that at least has an element of positivity past sexualizing its objects. This'll promote series that will actually create maybe something a bit more interesting and original. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei is genuinely a saddening experience. It is so incredibly bad in just about every way, yet people really love it. It is so popular that it will spawn plenty of sequels and shows copying its already cliche formula that it truly makes me upset. An industry that is already a mecca for unoriginal concepts that virtually just copy one another will just continue to be an industry of looping inspiration and nothing to break up the tedious formula.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is truly the worst.",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past century, it\u2019s no secret how perverse the Japanese culture can be sometimes, mainly in the medium of anime. Writers and producers litter their animations with heavily endowed females, ecchi harems bordering on hentai and lewd jokes about a ten-year-old\u2019s panties. Anime like High School DXD and Masou Gakuen HXH continue to push the boundary of what is acceptable to show to its viewers, and I\u2019ve been partly responsible at times myself of indulging in this trashy, sexual fanservice. However, with A-1 Studio\u2019s 2017 release of Eromanga Sensei, I\u2019ve officially hit a tipping point in myopinions of what is right and wrong. The series exhausts every effort to forcefully suggest an \u201cincestuous\u201d relationship between a teenager and his stepsister. What results is one of the most disgusting, tasteless works of fiction ever produced. It's a show that\u2019s harrowing to my own morality, and whose influence could degrade the already thinning strand of legitimacy the anime industry has left. \\n\\n\r\nAs soon as Eromanga Sensei begins, evidence of the writer\u2019s true intentions come to light. Masamune, our main protagonist, lives with his mother, and Sagiri, the blushing lolli, lives with her father. Magically the pair\u2019s parents become romantically involved and eventually make the decision to live together. Thus, their dramatic introduction begins, leading to the intended incest theme. Sagiri appears from behind her father\u2019s back, timid and radiating with a brilliant light of angelic proportions. Masamune locks eyes with her and is immediately overcome with romantic intentions. It\u2019s naturally what every 13 year old does when meeting their preteen stepsister for the first time...amirite? Apparently the manga\u2019s writer Tsukasa Fushimi had a previous work in which he tried to force the ACTUAL brother and sister to be in a relationship, only to have the idea not get greenlighted for obvious ethical reasons. Hell, I guess even some of Japan has a moral conscience.\\n\\n\r\nFast-forward a few years to the devastating yet convenient turn of events in which the two parents perish in an undetailed car accident and Masamune and Sagiri are forced to live with each other. Naturally Sagiri locks herself in her room, forcing her \u201cbrother\u201d to answer to her every beck and call. Masamune is an aspiring manga author who works with an anonymous erotic manga artist in hopes of someday hitting it big in the industry. However, while anxiously viewing one of his masked partner\u2019s live streams, Masamune accidentally discovers that Eromanga-Sensei\u2019s true identity is that of his own sister Sagiri...\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT THICKENS.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is rather generic from a plot perspective. Sagiri and Masamune are secretly attracted to each other, however neither of them admit their infatuation due to a plethora of awkward misunderstandings. More female characters enter the fray, further clouding Masamune\u2019s perception of love, and at the end of it all we as viewers are left with nothing more than a shell of a stereotypical romantic comedy. There\u2019s just one catch. It isn\u2019t the overall plot structure that bothers me about Eromanga Sensei. It isn\u2019t the apparent reality that every teenager in Japan is a manga author. It isn\u2019t even the vanilla or recycled characters omnipresent in seemingly every facet of the series. What incessantly infuriates me about this anime is the shameless amount of forced sexual topics and fanservice shoved down my throat around every turn. I\u2019m not by any stretch of the imagination an ecchi fan, but at least most of them have the decency to shy away from the taboo of lolita porn. Scattered shots of some rather private scenes involving Sagiri or other pre-teen girls, either blatant or subtle leave a disgusting taste in my mouth. Added to this are countless suggestive panty shots, only fueling the stigma many already possess related to the anime industry. Not to mention the mention the random expletive from a twelve year old about liking penises. Is the industry even trying anymore?\\n\\n\r\nAll of the fanservice aside, the aspect of Eromanga Sensei I found most unnerving is the suggested incestuous relationship between Masamune and Sagiri. Countless anime before it have alluded to or even explored the romantic sibling complex (Koi Kaze, OreImo, No Game No Life), but Fushimi\u2019s methods in Eromanga are so sloppy and pathetic it\u2019s embarrassing. There is no \u201crelationship\u201d between the two main characters. It\u2019s as if they are actors dropped into an improv scene with pre-assigned roles. \u201cOh, this is when I\u2019m supposed to blush when he says something!\u201d or \u201cOh, I better internal monologue about my sister now\u201d. It all reeks of contrivance and agenda. At least OreImo seemed more realistic in its relationship development. And when are we going to draw the line with what is acceptable to release in an anime? Shock value scenes with large breasts and convenient erotic shots are desensitizing and generally understood to be exaggeratory. However, showcasing more personal themes like incest to such an impressional target audience can actually have long-lasting effects with their ability to discern what is moral and acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT- It\u2019s not normal to want to have sex with your brother or sister. \\n\\n\r\nI digress.\\n\\n\r\nFushimi\u2019s creation of Masamune was flawed in how he appears to just \u201cexist\u201d without really creating much opportunity for relatability. The feelings for his sister are never really internalized or matured, but instead seem to exist from the moment he meets her. For the rest of the anime, viewers are now transfixed on what taboo thought or emotion Masamune will have for Sagiri and couldn\u2019t care less about him as a person. His manga author career serves as nothing more than a vessel to exploit his relationship and complicate things as more loli\u2019s are introduced. It\u2019s cringeworthy characterization at best. In essence, Masamune is just a plot device for the underlying themes of the show. Well done sir, you created one of the most boring characters in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is the most forgivable character in Eromanga Sensei. She\u2019s young, so in a way, she has an excuse for acting the way she does in terms of isolationism when her father passes away. Her interpretation of what an acceptable relationship is could also be skewed due to her young age, which is why she has strange feelings for her brother. Unfortunately, this does far less than make her an interesting character. At times, she can be really frustrating because of how irrational her behavior can be and it doesn\u2019t help her build a strong likability case. Elf is cute, annoying, and is the tsundere trope in a nutshell. Another plot device with pre-installed emotions and perogatives. The rest of the cast does far from marvel, consisting of a gaggle of uninspired and forgettable personalities. Character development does little to nothing in justifying the existence of such a tasteless anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Eromanga is what you would expect from an anime in 2017. Flashy, bright hues accompany each scene, with a plethora of cutesy blushing character models to boot. Each character was constructed with individuality in mind, so their appearance is unique and eye-catching. It\u2019s a shame more couldn\u2019t have been done in the art department to overshadow the supreme lack of depth in the characters themselves. And as attractive as the models looked, it wasn\u2019t enough to salvage the eventual trainwreck bestowed upon them by Fushimi\u2019s writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Eromanga Sensei was playful and fun, ad nauseum. Whether it was the seemingly innocent and bubbly OP, or the adorable ED sequence of Sagiri dancing in front of a laundry machine, the cute factor was never dialed down from 11. The rest of the OST fit in well with the scenes as much as I hate to say it, I really can\u2019t fault the sound designers here. Voice acting was also believable and well cast.\\n\\n\r\nAs I descend from my soapbox, I\u2019ll leave you with this. Eromanga Sensei is not a \u201cquality\u201d anime. It may be disguised with endearing female characters and a relationship portrayed as innocent or normal, but when you brush off the surface you\u2019ll find nothing more than a lewd and often inappropriately centered series. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend it to someone that I know would like it, because at some point the spread of immoral content has to stop. Fans of shows like this are what gives the anime industry a negative light in mainstream media. Maybe when we start to take the medium serious and stop promoting crap like this, more skilled writers and producers will be drawn to it. Honestly, I\u2019m embarrassed as an anime fan that a show like Eromanga Sensei even exists. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 1\\n\r\nCharacters- 1\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\nSound- 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1\\n\r\nOverall- 1.8",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nYeah, I know I'm WAY late to this party. A friend requested a review though, so why not? Eromanga Sensei made quite the splash online as THE bad anime of 2017. Gigguk hyped it up famously as \"The perfect bad anime\" and \"The ULTIMATE bad anime\". He made it seem like it's so bad it's amazing and hysterical. Sadly, I must disagree. Eromanga Sensei is NOT \"The Room\" of anime. It isn't uniquely bad or uniquely depraved. It's just an amalgamation of the shittiest cliches and tropes from other bad echii anime. \r\nBackground:\r\nArt in general is highly subjective, but what qualifies as \"So bad it'sgood\" is especially fuzzy. For me personally, the best examples either display extreme technical incompetence where the creators clearly didn\u2019t know what they are doing, or batshit insane projects that beat all the odds by somehow getting made in the first place. Let's look at a classic bad movie with Dolemite. I\u2019ve never seen a film where the director gave less of a fuck. The lead actor flubs a line? Who cares! Keep shooting. The sound equipment AND crew are visible? Who cares! An actor wasn\u2019t ready and has to run to his cue at the start of a scene? Doesn\u2019t matter. Every fight scene is our overweight protagonist awkwardly lifting his leg in the rough proximity of the bad guys and them hurling themselves backwards. The writing is astonishingly bad throughout. On a purely technical level, Dolemite makes The Room look like Citizen Kane. It\u2019s that perfect type of mesmerizingly bad where it\u2019s impossible to tell what was intentionally funny and what was honest incompetence. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at some underdog stories that beat the odds just by getting made. Look at every movie made by Troma entertainment. Lloyd Kaufman graduated from Yale and had the intelligence and the right friends (including Oliver Stone) to be a major Hollywood director. However, he hated that movies were greenlit or denied by a board of executives based on how well they were projected to sell. Kaufman rebelled and founded a studio based entirely around producing the ludicrous shit that would NEVER get greenlit elsewhere. Most of these movies were indeed horrible like \u201cThey Call me Macho Woman\u201d and \u201cSurf Nazis Must Die\u201d, but Kaufman\u2019s middle finger to Hollywood gave him cult status as a kind of anti-hero. It\u2019s thanks to people like Kaufman that we get rare indy gems like \u201cSix Stringed Samurai\u201d. That\u2019s a movie about a katana wielding Buddy Holly! He\u2019s on a quest to find the last American city after a nuclear war and claim the throne from Elvis. The soundtrack couldn\u2019t afford to use Buddy Holly or Elvis\u2026so they found some random Russian band called the Red Elvises, who were willing to do the soundtrack for free. The Red Elvises specialize in playing 1960s Surf Rock and Rockabilly using a balalaika instead of a guitar! Six Stringed Samurai is the kind of insane shit that SOMEHOW exists and should be celebrated for that reason alone!\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get back to Eromanga Sensei. Eromanga is perfectly fine on a technical level and was made by people who although lazy, knew exactly what they were doing. The series knew it had an audience based on the success of Oreimo and sure enough was a decent hit in Japan. It was no mistake that Eromanga got made, rather a cynical decision to milk some cash out of the lolicon otakus. Eromanga in my mind is NOT worth celebrating. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a light novel author named Izumi. He\u2019s still in high school, but only cares about being a successful writer in the world of ero LNs. Izumi is extremely hardworking and prolific but is unfortunately a terrible writer. Izumi kind of acts as the avatar of series writer/director, Tsukasa Fushimi. Izumi\u2019s novels only sell as well as they do thanks to his mysterious illustrator, who specializes in drawing lewd imagery. It turns out that this illustrator is Izumi\u2019s obnoxious little step-sister named Sagiri. It ALSO turns out that their next-door neighbor is his arch rival in the world of erotic LNs. Izumi must try rise to the top of the ero LN world while also struggling with feelings of love for his step-sister. Basically, if you\u2019ve seen Oreimo, you\u2019ve seen Eromanga Sensei. If you\u2019ve seen any of the dozens of shitty sibling incest echii, you\u2019ve seen Eromanga sensei. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei isn\u2019t funny. It isn\u2019t erotic. It isn\u2019t unique and amusingly bad. It\u2019s just trite, boring, garbage. Well, at least it\u2019s scratching an itch for loli lovers, right? Surely it features the most naked little girls of any anime in recent memory! Nope! Thanks to changes in Japan\u2019s censorship laws over the last few years, there is no full-frontal nudity or unobscured rear-view nudity in the entire series. If you were hoping for something uniquely perverted, this isn\u2019t it. Go watch Aki Sora instead. I have nothing further to say about this pile. It\u2019s just this utterly mediocre echii with no reason to exist that you shouldn\u2019t watch under any circumstances. \\n",

Long-ass reviews coming right noowww. (I'm not really good at english, tho', so hopefully you who decided to read this anywaycan understand what I wrote)\\n\\n\r\nWell, When I first seen the trailer, what I had in thought was \"So... Another of that infamous Oreimo? but they're not blood related? ...It's like a cue for the author to get wild this time lol. Still can't watch it, tho'\". \\n\\n\r\nBut damn I was wrong. The show is actually, even tho' it shares the same element with Oreimo, actually differs in theme and feels more light than Oreimo in some sense that even someone who's pretty much against watching an anime with incest as its main theme like me could actually enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nJust like one of the reviewer here said, the show introduces us to the otaku community (just like Oreimo), but this time, it's more specifically about Light Novel. It's not really a show with generic MC, where the big bro doing everything he can so he will able to bang his imouto (The guy even actually against incestual relationships), it also give us a little hindsight on what LN's Authors through before he could publish their works.  \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off with The Big Bro, Masamune, who wished he can see his lil' sis face again as after the incident where their parents died, She never going out from her bedroom again. \\n\r\nIt shows how dedicated the big bro in still taking care of her sister although just from the other side of the door. \\n\r\nA lot happen and after some 'Accident', they found themselves to be closer than before. \\n\\n\r\n-Story: 7 \\n\r\nAs I said, this kind of story already around since long time ago but it gave us a different theme from what's been around before (Imho). We really can think of this as OreImo v2, lol, but it really is different from it's big bro. \\n\\n\r\n-Art: 9 \\n\r\nWell, it's another A-1 masterclass. Not really my favorite studio but they really done a good job with the visuals. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 9 \\n\r\nClariS song will always got 9 or 10 rating in my book lol. \\n\r\nAnd the OP and ED is kind of adorable, too. \\n\\n\r\n-Character: 7 \\n\r\nThe MC is a generic MC we can found in many anime, but what differs here is his mindset, where he really do love his Lil' sis, but he against the incestual relationships and still try to act as a proper big bro as best as possible (Even tho' they're not blood-related, but this is 'That' kind of show, so it can be expected they will ended up as couple in the end). \\n\r\nAnd the main love interest too, Sagiri, is FCKING BETTER THAN KIRINO. Like She has that unique voice, ADORABLE LITTLE DANCE IN THE OP AND ED, not a bitch at all, and actually has a respect to his big bro. \\n\r\nThe other casts are pretty much really generic, that's why I give 7 scores in this category. Like, rival that ended up have a feelings for the MC, an easygoing boss, and so on. ...Except that one loli who said She loves 'D*ck'. It made me freeze on front of my computer for a few secs lol. It's the first time I seen this kind of scene not from hentai. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nHad many little giggling throughout the episodes. It's not the best anime I've watched, yeah, but it's still pretty enjoyable, too. The conversation between the characters weren't really as bland as what peoples pointing out, especially between Masamune and Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 7 \\n\r\nIf you enjoy a little lighthearted story, you might give this a chance. but this anime is certainly not for e\u0336l\u0336i\u0336t\u0336i\u0336s\u0336t\u0336 every audience, so try to watch at least 1 or 2 episodes before you decided to drop the show or not. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all from me. For you who actually read the review, hope you can understand what I typed. Hope I can see you sons of gun again. \\n\\n\r\nNext time.",

            "content": "I have a rule: I must sit through several (or all them if the series is done airing) episodes before writing a review or forming any sort of opinion and I try not to be quick to judge a series with a few rare exceptions. But oh goodness, please, forgive me, I couldn't, I simply couldn't take this anymore because I feel like my nerve cells were irreparably damaged. Anime is supposed to entertain, not shorten one's life.\r\nStory: 3/10.\r\nThere is not much to say about it because I really cannot approve of a plot about a 13-year-old girl drawing lewd illustrations while her brother, ayoung novelist, pretty much allows it (despite a brief apology in the first episode). Yes, I am aware of how low the age of consent in Japan is, so this is my culture and mentality speaking here, but I fail to understand what's so entertaining about this, neither do I think it's okay just because the heroine is technically of age. This is downright unacceptable, as well as disgusting, and I am not willing to tolerate an anime that sexualizes minors and makes them say that they love, pardon me, dicks. To each their own, perhaps, but this anime is supposed to be a simple comedy yet it fails to find balance between risks and what can be considered funny and appropriate. Eromanga-sensei tries to be funny and fails on a scale so epic that it's practically cringe-worthy.\\n\r\nNow here is the thing: I actually enjoyed the first season of OreImo despite its risky themes. Yes, I see OreImo's flaws neither do I approve of Kirino's favorite genre and maybe things get worse later on, but at least OreImo was entertaining in comparison to whatever this circus is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nSmooth animation and the fact that I like this show's art style are its only redeeming qualities, if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10.\\n\r\nCutesy songs plus forgettable soundtrack. I always give this aspect 5 out of 10 when I cannot seem to remember anything, which means that there was nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10.\\n\r\nI. Don't. Understand. Any of them. So here we have these two siblings-but-not-really as they are not related by blood, which is, apparently, an excuse to push their possibly romantic relationship down our throats. No, thank you. Masamune refers to Sagiri as his little sister, acknowledging her as one, so I do not think it's cute or funny. Not even a bit. These two are weird, painfully bland and boring and driven by horrible logic that is beyond my understanding. If it goes on like this, things will get out of hand. Of course, that's what this show is about, risky themes and relatively lewd semi-incest relationship between two kids and one of them just reached the age of consent (in accordance with Japanese laws, but most of us here still see her as a minor as we have our own laws to rely on).\\n\r\nBoth Sagiri and her so-called brother are as blank as a sheet of paper. Masamune is a cheap copy Kyousuke Kosaka and has a personality of a toothpick. He is not believable or relatable and, as a result, it is almost impossible to like him because he doesn't make you feel anything. Sagiri, in the meantime, is laughable: a loli tsundere that, apparently, doesn't even know what the hell she wants. Infantile to the point of acting like a 6-year-old (she's 13), she is a cute but very annoying character and her adorable face does not count as a redeeming quality. Summing it up, both Masamune and his sister-but-not-really are ridiculously immature and unlikable. Given that they are protagonists of the series, that is not a way to go.\\n\r\nDon't get me started on the rest of the cast, Megumi Jinno in particular, someone needs to slap this girl once or twice, she collects friends like Pokemon and is too perverted for a 13-year-old. How is that funny? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10.\\n\r\nThis show is boring and sometimes it can be pretty confusing and downright disgusting and, as much as I'd like to be brave and believe that it gets better, I can't. Maybe it does, but I do not want to know.\\n\\n\r\nI do not have any siblings, but I have friends who are like siblings to me and I cannot even imagine how or why a show like this can be considered funny. I gave it 3/10 and maybe, just maybe I am not harsh enough. I don't know if it gets better later on or not. But the truth is, I do not care much enough to be willing to figure that out. It's better to watch something else. What an utterly disgusting disappointment.",

It's sad that the number one most helpful review was someone trashing it because why not. People who gave it tens might have been over exaggerating, but giving it a one isn't fair to the show. The show does have lewded characters, but don't all animes have some sort of fan service? I don't understand how you couldrate it this harshly without realizing this fact. This may sound stupid, but the plot isn't always what decides whether an anime is great or not. It surely is a great contributing factor, but there are other things that make an anime fun to watch. First of all, I'd like to commend the great soundtrack of this show. I always sit and listen during the opening and ending, which I can't say I do for every show. To me, good ops and eds can make a show much better, being the hype in the beginning and the satisfying, familiar song at the end. The art is also amazing, and very appealing to the eyes. I will say that the shows plot isn't A+, but it's a rom-com, guys. The story is about the main character and the girls who surround him. It isn't meant to be full of action and adventure, it's meant to make you laugh and watch on as everyone becomes closer. If you want to watch a story with plot, Jojo is always there for you to watch. And obviously the age of the females in the show is a tad too low, but it's not like they emphasize on that. I'm always satisfied at the end of each episode and would recommend this to anyone and everyone reading. Please give this anime a chance, and try to remember that not every anime is a plot filled tear jerker, and that some are made to be enjoyed for what they really are.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is the portrait of an unusual comedy that plays with the morbid side of the mind. Moreover, the show salvages some ideas from other anime in search of acceptance. In the end, Eromanga-sensei only offers an unsatisfaction with an overused harem story and with some misleading sexual concepts.\r\nThe average: The anime started with a promising 8.23 and ended with a miserable 6.97. The 12 years old girl sexual behaviour. The silly and unrealistic story. \r\nThe good: Some hilarious moments and few characters.\r\nPerhaps, the biggest mistake is the story. Even if we eliminate the infamous incest debate, we end up with an empty harem story.A laddie with a collection of girls between the ages of twelve and fifteen who fall in love with the protagonist, an overused story romance in the anime world. To deceive the viewer with a new plot, an erroneous perception is created in which this promiscuous group is as functional as any group of adults to the extreme where they are most successful and can take their own decisions that are not in accordance with their ages. No one has ever asked, \u00bfwhere are the adults in this series? So far you will notice two, but they are mere puppets who try to propel dysfunctional relationships. The show portrays three young characters (Masamune, Elf and Muramasa) who are famous light novels writers and a twelve-year-old lassie (Sagiri) who is an erotic sketcher known as Eromanga-sensei. The irony is that this lassie, despite her alleged inexperience has developed sexual tastes or fetishes out of nuffink that can not be explained logically and credibly. To play a little more with your mind, this lassie lives with the laddie. In addition, she is his sister, but with a small countermeasure, she is a step-sister. For some persons they can hook together for others could be a problem. It is up to you which one is your side. \\n\\n\r\nLet's remove the sexual part for a bit because I need to be honest. The show is full of incoherency even for a comedy. \u00bfAre you going to believe that this little lassie locked herself in her room without any visual contact and this laddie never even bothered entering and see if she was ok? \u00bfWill you laugh after seeing a child, kid, youth locked in a room for several months without any visual contact? I bet that MOST all the persons will take the door down and see if the kid is ok or will try to seek help immediately. Don't play with our intelligence that argument is so lame that none will bite for it. Also, the irrational success case of the characters (they have published novels, and some have sold more than a professional writer).\\n\\n\r\nNow the sexual part, the main topic of the comedy. In one hand,  the relationship concept misleading the meaning of relationship or \"romance\" expressed in the constant sexual insinuation of a twelve years old girl. I need to repeat it, a twelve years old girl. The continuous  story twist hidden under the timid face of a kid \"Brother,  you are an idiot and a pervert\" twist \"I want Elf's panties.\" Scenes that play with the morbid desires of the mind, pushed by every panty angle in search of spectators. Second, the sexual misleading \"you are a pervert, but I like drawing erotic scenes\" or \"Can I see your penis?\" Third, the overused harem concept. All these ideas continuously resemble the fetishism introduced in this anime, and if you don't like them, then you will feel this anime as an immediate failure. I am not saying that this anime is a total waste, there are some exciting scenes and they could have used that scenes a bit more (final episode 9).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, nothing is relevant. A guy and lots of lolis that love him or want to have a relationship with him. Most all them are more successful than any adult, and some have unexplained sexual desires. If we let Sagiri's relation out of the spectrum then we can appreciate some characters like the promiscuous and introvert personality of Elf Yamada to the timid and polite nature of Muramasa but sadly if we add Sagiri to the equation, Masamune's relations are unbalanced and in some cases forced. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't bad. The definition of the characters was good. However, you will enjoy it just if you like the story if not the art will be irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are good. The OP was part of the J-Pop Billboard and the Oricon ranking. About the score, it is simple and matches the comedy moments.   \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I don't suggest this anime for kids. It has some sexual concepts that aren't explained and can lead to a misconception if you don't understand the difference between the joke and the reality.",

            "content": "This is easily the most enjoyable Anime of the season.  So much so that I want to go back and watch all the episodes up to the current one again right now.  First I want to preface this by saying, there is a lot of hate towards this show by really retarded people.  Before I even began watching the show, I knew what I was expecting to see.  The description is very clear, and knowing the mind behind it, if you don't want to see the new \"sibling romantic comedy\" then you shouldn't even begin watching in the first place.In real life, I don't purposely go looking for things I would hate and put hours of my time, effort, and energy into them.  If you understand that this will be an incest comedy, which it doesn't even try to hide being, then you will enjoy your experience with this show, if not, just go watch something more to your liking.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy everything about this show.  I also enjoyed OreImo, but this one is completely different.  I guess it's because in OreImo there was a feeling that the main character might choose a different girl, and in fact the arc where he dated Kuroneko was one of my favorite parts of that series.  In this show, it seems that all the side characters are firmly supportive of the Masamune/Sagiri ship.  In OreImo, you had some pretty serious competition for the main character, with each of the girls wanting to get a piece of the action.  So unlike the harem aspect of that series, this one is much more of a romance anime.  The characters are all likeable.  The least likeable is Elf, but after learning more about her, you will warm up to her as well.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri is one of the most adorable characters you will ever encounter in anime.  She is certainly not equatable to any real life human, so don't expect  to find anyone in real life that resembles her.  As Masamune comments, Sagiri is more of a fairy like, almost ethereal character.  On one hand she is so innocent, yet on the other, she is a complete pervert.  But one thing is for sure, if I were to ever have a little sister, I would want her to be just like Sagiri.  Tempermental, but not so ridiculously cartoonishly tsundere.  You can really feel the genuine love she has, even if she can't really express it properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, although clearly a siscon, also has the restraint to not want to pursue those feelings.  There is a morality that keeps him in check.  Yet being able to pour those feelings into his \"love letter\" of a story which apparently is so genuine that it would bring a reader to tears, it is a sweet thing to see the closeness developing between brother and sister who are destined to be together.  If this series were to end with them not being together in some way, shape, or form it would be a complete travesty.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't think that there is anything wrong with non blood related \"family members\" having a relationship in real life.  Love is a strange thing and it's not two people's fault that their parents ended up in a relationship.  That happening should not make them having romantic feelings for one another something to be ashamed of.  Obviously two blood related family members should not pursue a relationship in real life.  However, despite my wanting Kuroneko to prevail in OreImo, I was still 100% behind Kirino being with her brother once she finally admitted her feelings.  \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, if you aren't going to flip your script over the \"sibling romance\", then you will love this show.  Very cute girls, great comedy, and overall a wonderful experience which will make you fall in love if you'll let it.  If you know you can't get past the premise of the show, don't willingly slit your wrists and cry to us while bleeding.  It just shows that you are childish and only care about people listening to you complain.  I hate country music, so, knowing that a music festival will feature all country music, you wouldn't catch me dead there... the same rule applies here.  Watch it if you are open minded and you will not regret it, it will no doubt become one of your favorites from this year.\\n\\n\r\nPS As a side note, the top commenter who tries to trash this Anime is incorrect in saying that Sagiri is 10, because she is in fact 13.  I'm not sure if that is her age in the Light Novel or not, but considering this is a discussion of the anime in which she is 13, their point is invalid about claiming that the sexualization of her character is promoting pedophilia. Whether you agree with it or not, 13 is the legal age of consent in Japan.  This may seem \"horrible\" to some people, but even in parts of the US a person can get married as young as age 12.  If you don't believe me, feel free to look up the legal marriage ages across the US yourself.  Without parental consent a girl can marry at age 15 in Mississippi.  With parental consent, a girl can get married at age 13 in New Hampshire and 12 in Massachusetts.  Even more interesting is that there is no restriction on age of marriage in Mississippi as long as there is parental consent.",

            "content": "Personally, this anime is actually pretty decent when it first started, but when I try to compare its later episode, where are of his harem came together, It became quite uninteresting, and even, unengaging when a certain episode is dedicated to a certain girl in his harem. Though, if you are going hate this show for its depiction of lewd 2D girls, who are obviously premature, then hate all the show that's out there that does the same too. Even if that includes your favorite show. Konosuba is one, they lewd Megumin. Tbh, it should be pretty normal to see such a thing in thiscommunity that you've gotten involved in. You may also hate this show for the somewhat revolutionary idea of romance of legal incest story, that being said, no one are going to make an actual romance of that IRL, so what's the big deal. I live in the same circumstances as this, not blood related sister and shit, if you see her as your sister, no sane person (ones that have a sister) who even want to hook up with them as a lover or as a love interest. That's only in anime and stuff from the ancient times, where King arthur fall in love with his mother without both knowing that they are related, and got kill for it or something along those line. Or, tribes, emperors, king practicing that lineage thing, where only blood related sibliings or descedent can make love and reproduce in order to keep that, idk, snobbish tradition of treating a certain blood as a part of the royalty, or being special and superior in a way from other human beings. And ofc, Eromanga is different because she's not blood related, but the general theme of the genre is the same.\\n\\n\r\nThis quality of animation is undeniably of a pretty high quality. The characters are consistently well drawn, and their designs or character are detailed and consistent through and through (we barely see the camera angle zoomed, or angled from afar for a very long duration). It's hard to bring in subjectivity, the way you felt about the show, and lesser the quality of the art/animation through subjectivity, in order to justify a 1/10 or even lower for the art/animation of the show. In order to explain how shit this show really is. It's irrational to take irrationality (subjectivity) and apply it to rational things such as art. Art are obviously something that we all can agree on. If something looks good and well drawn, that's a good quality art. some people tries to bend logic or idea of artistic around, to push their bias view that pampered to their own irrationality and subjective feelings, over evaluating things with a certain degree of maturity and objectivity in it. The evaluation on the story are entirety subjective, though, it's hard to say the same if you are going to evaluate the external content of the anime, like the art, music, voice acting, animation (the amount of frame to frame picture that is drawn to make the animation looks smooth or not smooth) and so on. And some scene in this is actually smooth as hell. There are some cartoonish art style here and there to charaterized the character (like when sagiri do popeye looking mouth thing). And the lewd of fanservice is justified, look at the fucking title name mate. \\n\\n\r\nEromanga sensei is a very fun show for its early 5 episodes and so; though, I kinda lost interest once there's this trip event in the show, as the entirety of his harem grouped up, indicating signs of wanting to be his love interest to one another (basically to their rivals in romance). I mean, it's cool how at least this anime, unlike many other harem, are extremely honest about their feeling for the MC, and even be as bold to confess their love. And this is through the used of scenery, or subtle ways of confessing, and other dramatic elements to make that scene of the confession, less boring and more romantic than any other harem series that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are quite a myriad of negatives when it comes to the approach, the method of developing a character, and the overly clicheness of the anime, where the show tries to be different, but done it in a pretty half assed way.\\n\\n\r\nAs we all know, a cliche harem show is basically a show where there's only one guy with multiplicity of women, who are seeking to fight one another (though, they will still care about one another either way as a friend) just to hook up with the MC, depending on the route that the anime may take for each or all girls. I'm actually pertaining to the VN of any harem series, that tend to contain a harem route, or a route that solely focused specifially on one candidate of the MC's harem. This being said, the anime tries to bring in at least other male character that seem to have no interest in girls, or bring in some random dudes into the story, pretending to be different from other harem show that we've seen. The pretentious part here isn't the fact that this anime have other males in it, ones that who are close to the MC and in a position to communicate with people from the MC's harem that is. The pretentious part here is bringing him out of nowhere, be a part of the different event that they took place in (like the beach episode), then forcely or conveniently put him away, making his existence seem quite unneeded. It's as if he wasn't even needed in the show but they just decided to keep him there anyway. There's no point of having him take part in a certain activities with the MC and of his harem, when you're going to get rid of him during it anyway (talking about the King's game screen, the game where you draw a number, and tell them to do whatever you want). \\n\\n\r\nThe approach of the harem is done quite horribly, it's not to say that this anime is bad as a whole for creating this horrible harem after all of the harem are introduced. It's just their way of presenting and giving only a little bits of moment for the MC and the girl of interest for a very short moment. It doesn't progresses to anything much, though, it might have created a reaction from the MC, but that either stagnated just to add in some dramatic scene in the episode, or to make the girls became even more competitive in becoming the MC's love interest. And his love for his little sister is a barrier for the MC to not hook up with other women, just like the very popular meme, \"I love emilia\" scene, rip Rem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, you also call any author of such medium like a manga writer, light novel writer etc as sensei in the otaku community (everyone calls them that, see the anime man interviews with spice of wolf author, or konosuba author, or shirobako and bakuman, an anime on the production making of manga and anime industry). \\n\\n\r\nThe actual story maybe about that rivaly thing in regards to being an author and all. So it's not weird for the story to be about it, but the anime neglected this aspect, and proceeds on towards the typical harem moment rather than focusing more so on the main aspect of the story, and that's, striving for success in the industry (mainly for the MC's case since other authors are more successful than him). And anime move the plot quite slowly as well, that's prolly a down side of the show if you hate seeing characters spending time together (having fun), and developing some kind of a relationship with those interactions. It's pretty slice of life-ish if I were to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime followed a typical template of a typical harem show, though that's not a negative of the show, since every story in other community does the same. Deadpool for example, it follows the exact same template like any typical hero shows, and the hero's journey (the infamous outline for hero's story that everyone accidentally followed). The matter of criticizing the show here is how it was done, and how do you like it personally. This part is really subjective to one's taste, since people expect different things from a story, and our definition of entertainment are never entirely the same. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that being said, this show has a great start, the quality drops though from its early episodes once all the harem is introduced, however, this is not a bad show. There are a number of negatives and positive in this show. But tbh, this show is pretty cute and fanservice heavy it maybe, it's a fucking fanservice show on premature girls and that isn't new at all in the otaku community. It's for a very niche audience that likes it. If you hate people lewding premature girls, hearing them saying lewd things like, \"I want to see your panties\", \"all girls my age love dicks\" etc. This anime is not for you.",

I know its the same author, but this anime is really, really fun. I dont enjoy anime as much as I did before, so I watch a lot of ep1 of new season anime usually drop most of them (I didnt even watch one anime properly last season) but this anime... I've been watching it a lot. I guess its because they really did a good job when to tell the story and when to make people laugh. Props to themfor that.\\n\\n\r\n---Story---\\n\\n\r\nIt's understandable to see people not liking it, because its really cliche at this point. But for those who say \"its OreImo\" no its not. I didnt even enjoy OreImo a bit. It was boring. Especially the second season. Story telling was bad, characters felt hollow. I didnt read the novels for OreImo but for anime it just felt like, they found a scene from it to make one ep, then found a completely different thing in it then made another ep from it. Story was really slow on that one. But in this one its really fun, I read the novels for Eromanga and they are really follow the novel well. Novel's story telling is great, and in anime they made it great too.\\n\\n\r\n---Art---\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, but its not detailed. Not like I want a detailed art from this kind of series though. \\n\\n\r\n---Sound---\\n\\n\r\nIt's great. It doesnt feel like its a comedy soundtrack for a serious moment like it does for modern anime (check Saijaku Muhai) For anime ED and OP \\n\r\nboth of them are great.\\n\\n\r\n---Character---\\n\\n\r\nNow I dont understand the complaints here. None of these characters feel hollow except for Tomoe, but she doesnt have enough screen-time for it anyways. Characters are great. I wont talk each of them here, but heres an example. MC doesnt feel like he doesnt have a life other than the screen-time he has for example. Sure it isnt realistic but this isnt like Berserk or Steins;Gate really. It's a romantic comedy. \\n\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\\n\r\nI'm quite happy that I finally found an anime that I can watch it without getting bored. It's been a while since I enjoyed an anime this much, I cant really explain it well, sure heroine is good looking but when they dont show her that much this anime is still fun. \\n\\n\r\n---Overall---\\n\\n\r\ngo watch it",

Therefore its only natural that there is going to be differences, usually more than there are similar viewpoints. I think this statement is quite evident in a lot of mainstream anime and especially anime like Eromanga-sensei.\r\nEromanga-sensei is this anime that circulates around the idea of enjoyment in terms of \"Shallow\" entertainment. The goal for the show is to tick off the viewer's sense of humor albeit by the previously referred \"Shallow\" factors.\r\nEcchi, recently popular Loli characters and something that started to catch the attention of that certain group people who are suitable viewersof this show, Incestual-like relationships, are the few factors that are accompanied by the awkward humor of this show. The show will project enjoyment upon the viewers in such a way that you can't find in more insightful anime with plot, not \"plot\".\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the answer to one of the major questions asked of this show is that you have to come to watch this show with certain expectations. Because this show will not respond to your senses like a seinen or a thriller. You have  to basically do this if you are to get anything out of this show: Turn off the critical side of yours and try to put your empty mind into watching the show. Then and then only will your mind be filled with the things that the show wants you to be full of. It wants the viewers to have fun without focusing on finer details (but there are fun easter eggs at times ;))\\n\\n\r\nYes, so basically to wrap this horribly bad review, this is what Eromanga-sensei is about: Mindless fun. Its no no different than many other famous anime of the same build.If you can't have some of the Mindless fun, Eromanga-sensei is not for you as it doesn't appeal to your expectations.",

            "content": "This show exceeded my expectations in every single aspect. It was an enriching experience from start to finish and I can't advocate for your viewership enough. Don't misunderstand me; this show is absolute fucking garbage - but it traverses past the point of being an ironically enjoyable experience to a point of unironic, earnest enjoyment.\r\nSlowly and surely, I began to board the bandwagon upon realizing this fact of life. At some point, you begin to accept that this is no mere sub-par show. You soon realize that this redefines what can be considered \"bad\". This show takes garbage to new territory.\r\nThough, all bias aside, froma critical standpoint, the art is visually pleasing - it really stands above as a cut above the rest in terms of visually aesthetic and is lacking in flaws. The sound design and original soundtrack created for this anime worked to it's benefit and sounds quite nice, from the masterful opening that encapsulates the spirit of the show, to the ending that pumps you up for the next episode, and everything in between.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing our critical analysis, the story is not the greatest - it has unique elements in the mainstream realm of anime but is nothing very special. It would stand at a solid 5 from a macroscopic perspective, assuming you only consider the overall basic, core plot. If you were to look at the more nuanced mini-arcs of this series, that perception would quickly fade, and you would soon realize that this show's plot is beyond the realm of a mere 1/10. It is much, much, much worse. They add in needless drama for the sake of extending the series and the flow is terrible. One might say - it is garbage.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a moment - indulge in the sheer beauty of this show through a perspective of how garbage this show really is - Eromanga-sensei stands to testify how an anime can be both objectively bad - but still be an immensely enjoyable experience. As to avoid spoiling any of the series, I will leave you with this final request.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch the show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is trash\\n\r\nand so am I",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is an insult to the medium. Everyone has their own tastes and that is fine if you want to make a show about an incestuous relationship then I would have just moved on. It is not the premise of the show that is the problem. Eromanga-sensei could not be more cookie cutter if it tried to be.\r\nStory:\r\nBasically OreImo but this time they are half siblings (implicitly from the very beginning). MC is your generic shouting bland guy, little sister is a bi-polar loli. The story starts off being mildly interesting but eventually deteriorates into contrived reasons for different characters to be in provocative positions.\r\nArt:\r\nThepalate is generic cutesy colours and the characters are all designed to make you think they are cute. The art is quite jarring as the forced cuteness really just makes it feel emotionless, like a randomly generated character was created by picking cute features out of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the sound. It wasn't bad and it wasn't outstanding, it just served its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacter dynamics start out quite interesting, but quickly deteriorate into just being another excuse for the fanservice. It is less like the characters are creating a narrative through their interactions and personalities and more that they become whoever the story needs that single person to be. The characters themselves (besides their physical features) have no distinguishing qualities about them. The only memorable character is the loli sister who is a walking contradiction, it's almost like the anime is trying to make fun of people with traumas in their life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can find no enjoyment in this anime. The setting is boring, the characters aren't characters but vehicles for fanservice, the story is a vehicle for fanservice. The worst part is that the fanservice isn't even that good, the attempt at a moe style hinders the amount of sexiness that could be conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI started by claiming that this was an insult to the medium, that isn't because it is fanservice anime, there is plenty good fanservice anime. It is an insult because it is a very clear cash grab. Seeing that people relatively enjoyed OreImo this has been created to pander to the same crowd. I did not like OreImo but at least I could say it was an interesting show, the characters were well defined and the story had some substance. Eromanga-sensei takes that and does away with it all so we can see more fanservice of little sisters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to describe how I feel about this show it would be that it is the type of show I feel a computer would generate. It is devoid of any sort of passion or effort and so feels soulless. It feels like an anime fresh off the mass production line. If you want to watch a show about somewhat cutesy girls in attempted sexy positions and don't really care about plot then please ignore me and enjoy to your heart's content.\\n\\n\r\nElsewise 1/10 I would recommend actively avoiding.",

His step mother died and the father is out of the picture. Which gives him a feeling of loneliness. This makes Sagiri and Masamune basically two kids who just happen to live in the same house. Masamune has had very few interactions with Sagiri.\\n\r\nWhich makes it easier to stomach than Oreimo's romance between siblings. You see with the removal of incest this show loses a very prominent theme Oreimo had which was; what is deemed taboo by society and morality and accepting yourself for who you are and wanting to be what you want. Now I actually like that this theme was removed because even though it gave point to the blood related relationship and the exploration of otaku culture in Oreimo... Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship wasn't written interestingly and felt more like pandering to fetishists. Now the pandering part is debatable BUT Kirino and Kyousuke's romance was unfortunately poorly written. And since Kirino and Kyousuke were so poorly written and unlikable it makes you root against their relationship. As its seen as a very toxic thing that emotionally wounds the cast. It could've been handled so much better.\\n\\n\r\nSomething about the story that I actually think is good for now is that Sagiri and Masamune don't get together and that creates more opportunities to expand on the dynamic of the relationship. While Sagiri was cute and they could've focused the show on them working their relationship out. I find the route that was taken to be an entertaining one to an extent. Its not always I get to see a seasonal or light novel be ballsy enough to not force in a romantic relationship that is weak and underdeveloped or not have it happen by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason the story still gets a low score is because despite its premise. The love rectangle(?) is the only thing tying the story together. They go to the beach, there's like a one episode long light novel writing tournament, the plot isn't weaved together very well after episode 6...\\n\\n\r\nThe drama of the show is kind of forced. For example, Sagiri should cry when opening up to Masa about her mother as she's never let it all out before. Its a sympathetic backstory that justifies why Sagiri lives with Masamune and why she's so shut in and emotionally reserved. It's not handled that well though.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say since its a comedy and comedies stories shouldn't always be the breaking point but it's all very cliche in how it plays out and how Masamune rejects other girls and says he loves another. It's not just a comedy, it's still a story and the plot doesn't really have a statement, the story arcs are usually episode length, the pacing is too fast, and gets side tracked a lot. The finale could've also easily have been the story of Sagiri and Masmune's meeting online or could've been the resolution to the climax which was their meeting but the build up falls to nothing and dents the story very heavily. Feeling empty and giving the story no conclusion. With fanservice filler being disappointing finale. It is just an episode of the girls playing lewd twister for Sagiri and them trying to unclothe Masamune. Like I said this show cannot escape the purgatory of mediocrity. And it is because of the botched final episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe palette is a very pastel. It's pretty. The art is important to the comedy as the facial animation on the comedic contortion is executed well so the quick sharpness of the visual reaction is funny. The animation is good and it's very clearly made by A1.\\n\\n\r\nA1 is a double edged blade though. As the direction for the scenes and the art sometimes gets cringe worthy. Some of it just being BORINGLY simple. And some of it making me scared someone was gonna walk in. Of course even though I have not fully read the source material, I know these scenes were there so by adapting some of these I cannot blame A1. To get to it... there are several angles that do nothing but show of the bodies of the characters. They sacrifice legitimate scene direction WHICH THEY ARE CAPABLE OF for a nice shot of a girls ass. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fan service I guess. I'm not gonna not bring it up too much because even though it is a problem, its clearly intentional. Sometimes the direction is unintentionally lacking too but it's not gonna put you to sleep. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all distinct and some give you a bit of a look into the character's persona. Such as Sagiri herself and Elf Yamada. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were surprisingly good. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka the voice for characters like Kirito , Otau from Galko, and Hanazawa from Mob Psycho shows how good he is at leading. His acting is great, he's emotive and fun to hear. Akane Fujita despite not having too much experience does great in this role and I'm glad to see her career is only growing. Minami Takahashi is really good to hear again. She's a great actress and I'm glad to see her as a lead in more seasonals. Saori Oonishi was good as Muramasa. (Man its so weird how like all the leads were characters in Galko)\\n\\n\r\nNow to the music:\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has a great op and ed. The Op has good direction, good animation, charm, and is very catchy. The ed while not being directed that well and is just Sagiri dancing is a very high energy, cute, and is honestly a catchy song. Like even if I hated this show I'd still dig the music of the opening and closing. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the the soundtrack of the show... it's kind of forgettable and repetitive. They have this same song that they always play when it gets \"wacky\" and it is not enjoyable the 100th time ( and after ) you hear it. \\n\r\nIt's played sometimes twice an episode. It doesn't help that the other slower pieces aren't half as memorable as this. There's no flavor to the slower energy tracks. It's very standard for the most part. There are exceptions but stick to the op and ed if you wanna listen to music from this show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nEvery good comedy depends on its characters so I feel like this could have broke Eromanga Sensei's back. The main male lead, Masamune is irritatingly dense and it leads to the plot solely being changed from its route because of his irrational ignorance. His dynamic of not wanting a lover but a family is pivotal for the show and makes Sagiri desire to be more sisterly and put her crush on him to the side to make him happy. We understand he wants a family after he believes he is rejected by Sagiri because of his brother status. He sees how unimportant a sweetheart really is to him in this period of loneliness in his life. Although this makes his motivations very confusing and contrary. As he continues saying there's already a girl he loves to characters like Muramasa and Elf Yamada, referring clearly to Sagiri. But I just came to accept that he wants a step sister who is a sister more than a girlfriend. \\n\r\nMasamune himself does have an arc but he begins to stagnate after this and is used more as an outlet for other characters development rather than being his own fully fleshed out lead. It's good the other characters are always more enjoyable than him outside of a comedic situation plus the other characters were also my motivation for continuing the show anyway . \\n\r\nSagiri Izumi, the female lead, is a good character. Nothing truly groundbreaking but her character does have depth. She's lonely and she's had a crush on Masamune since discovering his self insert story when she was young. She hit up Masamune with fan art and he asked for more. She found the positive reassurance in her art from someone she liked to be very motivational. The conflicts in Eromanga Sensei are handled well when they're not forced in cheap drama. Like Sagiri's mom being dead and her lack of an emotional reaction (like tears) when opening up to Masamune about it. Also I guess Sagiri's perversion is entertaining because you wouldn't expect this young girl to be so hardcore about the woman's body and know nothing about the males. Sagiri also does try to improve herself as an artist for her step brother after seeing he needed an illustration of a voluptuous girl. Since didn't want to lose Masamune, she worked hard on illustrations for him. Therefore in her own mind she won Masamune back. \\n\r\nSagiri has a few conflicts with Masamune. She hates death because the person she likes isn't around anymore and she'll never see them again. This is clearly because of the loss of her mother. Though never directly stated. To relate this she spites Masamune for killing off one of her favorite characters in his novel. She learns to accept the character won't come back but it encourages Masamune to strive to make a happier ending for the characters. Because in the end death does not mean permanent unhappiness. \\n\r\nShe also shames him every time she feels his affection for her is based off physical appearance as her love for him is personal. Sagiri is also immature, she gets jealous and insecure when she's scared Masamune will leave her alone again or move on from her. So her calling out her step brother and wanting his attention may be irritating but it's an understandable and an established part of her character.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sagiri and Masamune are significantly more likable leads than Kirino and Kyousuke. As they are less tedious to watch, less selfish and less destructive to the more likable characters around them (like Kyousuke was to Kuroneko). Sagiri also on her own is a likable character. I literally have not met a person online who didn't love seeing Kirino get punched. \\n\r\nThe most irritating aspects of the Izumi's characters is that Sagiri is easily made jealous but it is justified as she is an insecure 12 year old and Masamune is a contradictory dumbass. A dumbass you understand and sympathize with but still a dumbass. The relationship here is less awkward as they are basically just roommates. But even though Kirino and Kyousukes relationship was poorly written, the sacrifice of blood relation basically makes the only point of the story to be Masamune waiting to get a gf/family.\\n\r\n I want to reiterate while it's on topic... It doesn't have a statement or a controversial theme like Oreimo. Which makes this whole anime blend in to everything else and just feel like there's really no point. \\n\\n\r\nTime for the other leads:\\n\r\nElf Yamada is the pretentious, eccentric writer of this show and she was incredibly enjoyable. She rarely opens up to people and has developed a crush on Masamune even though he's the one who looks up to her. She is very supportive of him and even though she will still compete for affection she wants Masamune to be happy. Even if it means she loses the love race. She's a character that wants to show her love but will go with the flow if she's losing the race. Despite being rich she really isn't selfish.\\n\\n\r\nMuramasa Senju is secretly a huge fan of Masamune and is introduced during the Light Novel Tenkaichi Budokai. Unlike Masamune and Elf who write for their fans, she writes for herself. The lack of pandering is likely why she has the biggest following of all the main characters. She insensitively intimidates and riles up Masamune in order to get him to write a novel she wants to see him write. She apologized and gives up the competition despite having the bigger following as she understands how much the competition meant to Masamune. She had developed a crush on Masamune and competes for his affection. While she was a cute character she was not as layered as Elf or Sagiri. She didn't get as much exploration either. She has her role in the plot but shes the least fleshed out. Or at least she would've been...\\n\\n\r\nNothing about this character is likable. She could easily be written out entirely. Megumi is the worst part of this show. She has an incredibly poor introduction that I wish I never saw and she wants to manipulate Sagiri just because she wants more popularity. She acts like she is a whore for popularity sake and talks about how much she loves dick. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up the last problem and segment of this show and my review.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is really trashy. Joking about pornography, and penises, and boobs. And since all the characters are teenagers and Sagiri is a preteen it makes it even more wilder of a ride. This could turn peopple off or since the characters subvert the creepy old male pervert trope in a very basic way it will not effect you. Girls and boys get stripped by a 12 year old pervert girl. This shit gets intense. Now the voice actors make the reactions to a lot of different scenarios funny but the amount of raunchy humor is overwhelming. Like to the extent where you just strap in for the ride. When in the incredibly sexualized situations you'll feel  awkward or aroused if that's your thing, I'm judging the anime not you. At least it only happens like once or twice in a single 22 minute episode though. So that's a relief. the voice acting makes the other jokes very entertaining though. It's not all just dirty. But when it wants to be dirty it gets rough. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment didn't matter in this review. Maybe you'll be more adamant with your dislike of something and it'll ruin the show for you. But personally I enjoyed it sometimes. I like some of the characters, music, character designs\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel like this is probably the most fair and in depth review of Eromanga Sensei you can get. I'm not saying other reviews are invalidated by mine. I'm simply saying I don't feel like anyone has cared enough about the show to write this thorough a dissection. The shows not good but it's not half as bad as people act like it is. I wanna see it get better. It's a perfectly mediocre show. It could've potentially been one of the best of the season or one of the worst. Beneath the lack luster of the show it has some solid characterization, concepts, art, and amazing voice actors. That's about it though. So even though it was flawed it was nice talking about it. Let's all hope that inevitable season 2 gets even more depth or gets even more memorably raunchier. \\n",

            "content": "Now listen up. Eromanga is no Akira and I want to be clear on that. This is not a new or original anime. But ask yourself this: Why in hell would you expect from a light novel adaptation to be the second coming of Hayao Miyazaki? What drove people in this community to the point where they can't genuinely enjoy anime for what it always was: perverted and weirdly funny?\r\nLet me back up there and start over. You watched Chobits didn't you? You watched Chobits and Gurren Lagann and lots and lots of over top shows with lots of 'plot' in them didn't you? Didit not occur even once to you that it's over-sexualized? That's one of the things that divides anime from western cartoons: it's liberal approach to show sexual content. They even have a genre for it: hentai. And it's fine. You watch it if you want, if you don't like it, you don't watch it. However there's no denying anime always included more 'plot' than was necessary. And we loved it for it. In the minds of conscious people, there is a barrier between fantasy and reality. You don't expect or want the two to mix. You don't expect naked girls jumping on you in real life, because it would be messed up? Why are they doing it? Are they crazy? Is this a prank? Am I being recorded? Those would be things you would be asking yourself in those situations. In fantasy, it makes complete sense. That's how the story is set up and you suspend your disbelief - you roll with it.\\n\\n\r\nLet me back up even further. Let's talk about this fake-sister incest bullshit that has been going around in anime and light novels too. Did you actually ever consider why this is a thing? And why people are attracted to this trope? Do you think people desperately want to fuck their relatives? Do you want to fuck your relatives? The reason why this pops up is Freudian. Simply put, from a story perspective as an author you want to set up an already intimate scenario between two young people. That's not something that normally just occurs in nature. You want them to trust each other and have a strong bond. So you leverage something that you know provides that bond. Family. It's an easy explanation that a human mind accepts casually for an answer to 'why are they comfortable around each other'. Why do they care about each other deeply? Why at all?\\n\\n\r\nThen you want to make that a romantic scenario and that's the difficult part, because normally this is not romantic at all. Is it romantic that a father cares about his son? Is it romantic that a mother tucks her daughter in at night before going to sleep? Is it romantic that two young siblings bathe together? Or is it just practical? Not making it a 'weird thing' to have siblings bathe together as otherwise you would have to pay two tubs worth of water. Listen, I know this may sound difficult to comprehend, but men and women aren't ALWAYS sexually attracted to each other. So this is where the 'cheapness' of Eromanga comes in: it pretends just by not being blood related this can be romantic. It dismisses the point: you either focus on a brother sister relationship and build on that, which is difficult to show as romantic, or you drop that plot and say 'they have loved each other for years and lived together as well' and then it becomes plain bullshit. You have to force your characters not to destroy this scenario. Two young people living together for years and loving one another, with no supervision whatsoever - and not having sex like every day? We all know that's bullshit. So that's why the brother-sister thing is introduced. To RESTRAIN it, not to ENHANCE it. However subconsciously people tie the two stories together, the love and being related and they end up with this guilty of being attracted to a relative. And they enjoy it, never realising that it wasn't the relatives part that they were attracted to in the first place. By itself, that doesn't mean anything.\\n\\n\r\nThey were attracted to love and caring for each other. And I think Eromanga delivers when it comes to this. There's great attention on the Kirito (sorry I had to) and Rei (again, sorry) being shown as actually discussing things. Things that aren't always their relationship (I'm looking at you every other slice of life bullshit). They speak about work, other people, their past. It's actually really believable at that too.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's also really important to emphasise: people in Eromanga seem to be attracted to each other for realistic and right reasons. They love each other because they impressed them with their writing, with their motivational speeches, with their enthusiasm for their passion (writing or drawing) and so on. They are not empty sexual objects, they all have their reasons for liking either the protagonist or others. The protagonist isn't empty either: he puts a lot of effort into preserving his way of life and following his dreams. He also cares deeply about others and interacts with them well: he does not shy away from criticising people but nor from taking advice.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sad to see we got so posh and elitist in this community, that we don't accept who we originally all started of as: obnoxious, masturbating Naruto and DBZ fans. We obviously progressed from there, however we don't acknowledge that the genre didn't change fundamentally: we did. Anime like Eromanga is and always was a big part of Anime. We just stopped saying we liked it. We started watching YouTube videos with self-proclaimed critics cutting our passion and interest apart and criticising anime like it was the fucking Mona Lisa. Anime never was just about having a deep message or excellent drawing or philosophical story. It was about having fun too. There's always the disclaimer at the beginning and the end of those reviews; if you like it - good for you. But that's bullshit too, isn't it. If you like, 'good for you' but 'feel ashamed, because you're just not ready for higher quality'. I like this series because it reminds me of times when we had smaller problems and weren't so self-conscious. I can have fun watching this and so can you. Stop feeling ashamed for liking a show and start trying to understand why you like it in the first place. You might realise that your reasons aren't always as dark as they first seem. Hopefully these reviewers will also arrive to a point where they start to explore their own taboos and prejudices and understand what they are afraid of. Then, we can criticise Eromanga for what it truly does wrong.",

            "content": "A show from the mind of the author behind Oreimo, obviously we are going to have some \"wincest\" style romance. Eromanga Sensei is about a high school student who lives with his non-blood related little sister whom is also Hikikomori (for reasons that haven't been fully explained). One day after finishing one of his light novels (he makes money as an author) he decides to watch the stream of the person who creates the illustrations for his novels and finds out that it is in fact his 11 year old sister; romantic hi-jinks ensue.\r\nI have never had an issue with the idea of romance betweensiblings in anime. While its certainly not my favorite subject matter nor is it really all that realistic, I still believe that it has its own place and if done correctly can be ok. I do, however, have a problem with the fact that the sister is 11 years old and she wants to be romantically involved with her brother.\\n\\n\r\nThis may seem controversial but objectifying and sexualizing young girls is a bad thing. I had the same issue with Oreimo; the sister was only about 13 to 14 years old (a girl who was still in middle school) and most of her friends couldn't have been much older. I figured that perhaps they would just play this show as a slightly sweet, bro-con, sis-con style show but that is clearly not what they are trying to do here. In the second episode it is highly implied that the sister wants to be romantically involved with the brother. Also, her classmate consistently makes sexual advances on him (I doubt she is much older then the sister considering they are in the same class). This made me really sick to my stomach.\\n\\n\r\nI am aware that in Japan the age of consent is officially 13. In Tokyo however, (where this show is presumably set) the age of consent is 18. In fact, many prefectures in japan have statures that raise the local age of consent well past 13 to at least 16 or 18. I am not being a prude here, younger kids can and do have sex and sexual thoughts in real life. There is a distinct difference between promoting an extremely young girl as a sexual object and displaying something more grounded in reality. To give credit where credit is due, thus far this show has not objectified the Sister but, they are treading towards that territory. Also, the show seems to play much more loose with the side characters such as the classmate.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously guys, do not support this type of trash. Romance between siblings is one thing, but romance with extremely young girls is something else entirely.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei is an interesting anime, but not because of the plot or characters, rather, this is an anime that is widely hated by many people and is also a scapegoat for this season. It's cool to not like Eromanga-sensei. While I may not think it was as bad as the community makes it out to be, it is certainly not a masterpiece by any means. However, if you are able to turn your brain off and just watch, you might have some fun. Be warned though, there are far better things to be doing than watching this show.\r\nStory - 3\r\nI am not going to lie,the story of Eromanga-sensei actually grabbed my attention before I watched the show, and was one of the major reasons that I even started the show to begin with. The description talked about how an aspiring light novel author manages to find out that his little sister drew lewd pictures for him. This sounded like it had the opportunity to be funny, and so I watched. While technically following the description, the show only uses this plot as a way to further relations between the two main characters. The story rapidly became very predictable and existed only to further the relationship aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nI love the art in Eromanga-sensei. However, only for one character: Sagiri. It is painfully obvious that the entire show is tailored around making Sagiri look as cute as possible to sell merchandise later on, and they actually succeed in many ways, at least as far as my opinion goes. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say this: Claris sure knows how to make openings for trashy shows (see Oreimo). The background music is nothing special by any means. No tracks in this show stand out to me besides the opening, which I did actually enjoy watching. While the music may be nothing to write home about, sometimes it fits, and sometimes it doesn't. Also, characters that always speak like they are doing an ASMR video appeal to me, so props to Sagiri's voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\\n\r\nNext to the story, the characters are the worst part about Eromanga-sensei. If not cut and pasted (see Masamune), they are utterly unbelievable at best, and painful at worst. The characters behave in extremely warped ways, and are annoying to watch in general. In one scene, a twelve year old girl expresses her love for dicks. Twelve years old. While she may have been \"joking\", this is the level of sophistication one can expect from this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\n(Factored in from the listed elements as well as subjective things)\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Eromanga-sensei deserve the hate that it gets? Almost certainly. I would be lying if I said I hated the show, as I actually did have some fun while watching it, and it even managed to have a good moment or two at times. If you really want to watch this show, I would say do it. Otherwise, avoid it and try to forget it exists. Eromanga-sensei, while utterly failing in everything it attempts, can still manage to be enjoyable, and certainly watchable.",

            "content": "Is there really a NEED to go into a long review of this series? I mean really, is it worth the frustration? Yes, because this series was a CHORE to watch every week with my \"if you start it, you finish it\" mentality I have.\r\nEromanga-sensei was by far the ABSOLUTE worst series I have seen anime wise in quite sometime. I mean, horrendously bad, to the point where I wanted to just throw my PC out the window because of the absolute cringe-worthy material it brought to the drafting table.\r\nEromanga-sensei is the story about a little step sister named Sagiri Izumi who meets Masamune Izumiand basically they develop a thing for each other and you see loli-panties every episode. Simple as that, there is really nothing more at all. Oh wait, they also write Light Novels, but that was completely irrelevant due to the fact it was just a way to develop feelings for the 2 siblings.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup for Eromanga basically used the same shit the author of Oreimo and wait for it.... HOLY SHIT BOTH OREIMO AND EROMANGA-SENSEI HAVE THE SAME F****** AUTHOR! if you didn't know this by now and didnt read  all the higher rated reviews above this one, well now you know.\\n\\n\r\nAll Eromanga is, is a revenge like series for the author to finally get his sister fetish some solidification, if you saw the ending of Oreimo, and were disappointed like the author of it was, he wanted to prove that you can date your sister, however all he proves is that they still don't tolerate this incestual shit from oreimo so instead he makes it step sister so now its okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Eromanga sensei are literally garbage, for example dick-girl or whoever the hell was that preppy retarded kid who was trying to get Sagiri to go to school, was a complete wasted character had absolutely no need, Bookkeeper girl, only sold books and went otaku nerd rage that was it, completely useless, Elf the hands down best girl was made irrelevant after her whole episode about herself, and Muramasa or whatever the stupid author is who just wants Masamune to keep writing because she rips him off and sells more then he does and makes him get called a copycat artist only the fact she is the copycat artist, is also fucking useless. Reaction-kun was also useless and had no purpose in the story besides showing his mini pc. Sagiris mom was shown quite a bit throughout this show and I always wondered why instead of making her daughter go to fucking school she decided to teach her how to draw NSFW shit and not have her daughter have an education, and Izumis dad was actually ok and seemed responsible, wish it went in depth with how they came to be a thing but unfortunately never happened. \\n\\n\r\nif you really cant understand how bad the characters are by the fact i dont remember half their names, and after watching all 12 episodes, I think it shows the proof of how shit of a job it was.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay style wise but the animation was shit and they had the worst stills i've ever seen and the most fanservice shots that could make me seem like a guy into little 12 year old girls.\\n\\n\r\nthe enjoyment was overall at a 1 due to absolute cringe-content that was on display every episode and how none of the characters improved at all, and wasted my time for 24 minutes every Saturday. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is terrible and not worth the watch. Oreimo was at LEAST dealable, where as this is pure trash that shouldn't even be a thing.",

I\u2019m sure you already have your preconceived notions about shows like these, and that\u2019s fine, but as someone who likes things like this I thought I would offer a bit of perspective as to why.\r\nFor most people, the whole \u201cincest\u201d fantasy thing is appealing to them not because they have a desire to bone their relatives, but because they like the idea of forbidden love. There\u2019s something thrilling in doing something that\u2019s not allowed, right? So for me, and I\u2019d assume for the vast majority ofpeople, the interest comes more from the \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u201d aspect than the \u201cblast my ass onii-chan!\u201d meme that circulates the Internet ad nauseum. And if your quarrel is more the fact that they are underage than the fact that they are related (though not by blood this time), it\u2019s the same thing; forbidden = interesting = sexy. Plus, most anime happens to be focused on high/middle school aged people, so that\u2019s just a byproduct of the industry. And if you have a problem with underage people being displayed as romantically inclined in any way, then you might as well toss out 90% of the romance genre in general.\\n\\n\r\nBut, if we can just move past all the lolis and the imotous for a second and just talk about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes with these characters, I\u2019d appreciate it. Tsukasa Fushimi is actually a decent writer and makes sure all of his characters have depth and unique personalities, even the side characters. You know there\u2019s a good harem when it is blindingly obvious who is going to win but there are still people who support the other girls. That\u2019s only possible via skillful writing. And the main characters are just as fleshed out with their own problems and concerns. Sagiri is scared of leaving her house, and Izumi copes with the loss of his birth mother by throwing himself into his work almost mindlessly.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still a trashy anime and I\u2019m not going to tell you that it\u2019s not. But if you can just take yourself a little less seriously for a little while and just be entertained, you might find that there\u2019s something a little deeper hidden underneath.\\n\\n\r\nMy MAL Score: 8/10.",

            "content": "Tsukasa Fushimi is a man who truly knows what he is passionate about, and he wants to share that passion with the whole world. After being denied the incestuous romance he craved (and presumably the biggest orgasm of his life) by the publishers of his last series, \"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute,\" Fushimi-San set out to write another sibling-love story, this time utilizing the \"they're not biologically related, so it's okay\" loophole. As many of us know, publisher restrictions can be quite a brother... I mean bother.\r\nAnd so, Eromanga-sensei was born and was released to thousands of otaku, some of whom seemingly gotoffended that a show would have the nerve to exist without trying to appeal to them in particular and went onto the internet to complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the show explores many similar themes to Oreimo (aka, the aforementioned \"little sister\" series). So many in fact, that one might consider it a sister-series of sorts. The main difference between the two (other than the \"not related\" loophole) being that Eromanga-sensei truly raises the bar for self-insert characters. The main character is a light-novelist who desperately wants to publish his new work: a book about a cute little sister. Not only does the show refrain from any attempt to hide its liberal use of this trope, it seems to bask in it to the point where the series itself almost becomes a big self-referential inside-joke.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that any of this is a bad thing, by the way. The goofiness of the show's plot makes for an enjoyable watch, and there are more than a few heartfelt moments mixed in to lend some emotional appeal to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should also mention the biggest draw of the show: yes, it's full of cute lolis. Yes, it's very perverted and full of fan-service. And no, I haven't yet made peace with my God. If by chance I die tonight, I shall pass on to the afterlife bloated with sin as black as the scorched ashen remains of a burnt church and far more foul. Last night I drank antibacterial dish soap in hopes to cleanse my system of impure thoughts about dick-loving 12-year-olds and ended up vomiting dark, dreadful bile over the tile floor of my bathroom. I laid there next to the slowly-spreading puddle of vomit for what seemed like an eternity, shivering and whispering desperate words of prayer.\\n\\n\r\nDear God, I'm so sorry.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. That's enough about me. What you should know is that if you enjoy romantic comedies and you're not too much of a sissy to stomach the semi-incestuous themes, you'll probably end up enjoying this series quite a bit. As a writer myself, I find this show quite inspirational, and it has really assistered me in my writing process as of late.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fantastic, the music is fun and catchy, and the characters are all fairly likable. In fact, by the end of the series, they might even feel like family to you... cute, yet strangely sexy family.\\n\\n\r\n9/10.",

By the way, I really like Moe in animes and I'm not disturbed by incest. The chara-design is very good and the OST is okay.\r\nBut why this anime was a big disappointement for me?\r\nFirstly, Sagiri, one of the main characters, is absolutely unbearable. She has nothing cute or funny in her. She's boring, her reactions doesn't make any sense and she's angry all the time, for nothing. Moe animes need cute characters but I find any cutenessin her.\\n\\n\r\nThen, \"Eromanga-sensei \" includes lots of fanservice. The humor is based on panty shots and cute girls who say and do dirty things. But the point is, in the anime, the female characters are between 12 and 14 years-old! Making fanservice scenes with children is very disturbing. I don't really like the way some animes have to sexualize children like althought Japanese culture is different from ours.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I expected to see an anime which show use how light novels are written and edited. But...This aspect is very negliged, whereas it could makes the anime more interesting. If you want to watch a good anime explaining how animes are made, I advice you to stop watching Eromanga-sensi and Shirobako instead.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is not that bad and it can be pretty enjoyable though I had high expectations for this anime. I wanted a cute and fun moe anime with an original plot. I saw a boring serie with lots of problematic aspects.\\n",

No, this is the MOST trashy, disgusting garbage ever to exist. I may be wrong. There\u2019s probably worse. But I never want to be unfortunate enough to stumble upon it.\r\nI, like everybody else, came because of the memes. I expected a bad comedy, but what I got was much, much worse.\r\nThe story is as follows: Our main character writes Light Novels. One day, he finds out that the person who does the cover illustrations for his novelsis his 12-year old sister, whom he hadn\u2019t seen face-to-face since she moved in with him. Now, all of a sudden, he wants to, and please excuse my vulgarity, fuck his sister. Who is 12. And also his sister. As far as plots go, this is about as dumb as they get.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the best thing about this show, and it\u2019s mediocre and stereotypical. \\n\\n\r\nI was too busy being appalled by the disgusting premise of this show to really notice the sound, so it gets a 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all easy to hate at worst, and dislikable at best. Also, the age cap for females seems to be 12. Adding on to that, all prominent female characters seem to be over-sexualized far too often.

In case you couldn\u2019t tell, I hate this main character especially.\\n\\n\r\nI was genuinely disturbed by the ever-present romantic feelings the main character has towards all these 12 year olds and exclusively 12 year olds. In fact, I was so disturbed by the common humor and over-sexualization of the characters that any of the rare humor that didn\u2019t try to sexualize the 12 year olds didn\u2019t help to improve the quality of the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: Please don\u2019t watch Eromanga Sensei, for your own sake.",

It's only there to make the show as uncomfortable and as shocking as possible, but more on that later. The writing's also riddled with plot holes and backpedaling, and they just nag at you as the show goes along. It makes you question how the characters were able to be there in the first place. It's made worse when none of them act like people. I mean there's a difference between hiding romantic intent after making a romantic gesture due to embarrassment and hesitance, and intentionally saying something that only leads to further misunderstanding. \\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they're unlikeable, all of them... Okay, not all of them, only one of them was tolerable. But yeah, they're terrible, and that goes ten fold for both the male and female lead. The male lead being so bland at best, and downright sinister at worst. With the female lead being an amalgam of multiple personalities rolled into one out of convenience to make her as cute as possible. There are two other vital characters, but they're just really bland and have mentalities that just don't sit well with me. The rest are just bland and only serve one purpose before being immediately cast to the side. The tolerable one, the bookstore worker, was barely even around, which was unfortunate. \\n\r\nWhen I said that the concepts in this show only serve to make the show as shocking and uncomfortable as possible, the characters also have to do with it. It seems as if the characters have these creepy and/or unlikeable mentalities, so that they can be set up for those shocking scenarios. Then they either join the male lead's harem or get thrown to the side. If that's the whole point of the show, then I'm not laughing. It's just not my thing, in fact, it's something I detest. \\n\r\nMoving on, the animation is just awful. The art style may have some potential, but it's ultimately ruined by the inconsistent drawing and mediocre animation. Characters are sometimes drawn poorly and the animation has this weird flow that can be just as inconsistent as the drawing. The music is also bad. It has these tracks that, I think, try to capture the feel of 'Ore no Imouto' but it's just annoying to listen to. Then there's the music that's meant to be quirky, but only adds to the creepiness when played in those creepy scenes. Plus, they too are annoying. The only good thing about it is the tracks that are meant to be relaxing or emotional. They actually do that job correctly, even though I got taken out of the scene due to the show's awful writing. The directing doesn't help either, since it's mostly really flat with nothing special to add unless it wants to sacrifice consistency. \\n\r\nIn the end, I had some hopes for this show going in, but ended up coming out completely resentful towards it once it was over. Now I consider it to be one of the worst anime I've seen thus far. I don't recommend it to anyone, even in an ironic sense. It's just awful on every aspect, with all of the effort being put in the wrong places. I'm glad to be done with this show and I don't have any interest in going back to it again.",

            "content": "Shit wrapped differently will still be shit when unwrapped.  \r\nEcchi harem rom-coms have been littered in pretty much every season of anime recently, and sometimes all it takes is a different pretext to get peoples' attention. The mangaka of the hit series Oreimo returns with another series, Eromanga sensei, which definitely doesn't let up on the gas on incestuous undertones once again.  Despite how sketchy the anime is, it somehow was one of the more popular anime last season, most likely riding on the success of Oreimo.  \r\nStory (3/10):\r\nThe plot revolves around a cookie-cutter main character named Masamune Izumi, who works asa light novel author.  His works are illustrated by the mysterious eromanga sensei, who he finds out is his NEET little sister, Sagiri (what a coincidence!).  The two siblings, after finding out their professional connection, team up to tackle the world of light novels, all the while deepening their relationship with each other and making friends and rivals along the way.  Although the theme of the anime is supposed to be light novels and their creation, this is just a pretext to produce another generic rom-com/ecchi harem, as the light novel author job is mostly used to lure girls into Masamune's harem.  Sagiri's preference on drawing ecchi pictures is also used to put the girls into many scandalous situations, which can be somewhat uncomfortable/creepy as most of the girls in the show aren't even in high school yet!!!  Simply put, the story does little to guide viewers in the world of light novels and just uses it as a pretext.  You can compare this anime to a disappointing birthday present, but wrapped in a different gift box.  No matter what kind of gift box the present in,  it will always be disappointing when unwrapped.  No matter what kind of pretext is given, an ecchi rom-com harem will always be an ecchi rom-com harem.  Although some of the embarrassing and silly moments gave me a chuckle or two, the sheer unoriginality of the show makes for a predictable and boring experience.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by A-1 pictures, the art and animation of this show is quite good, but not particularly stand out.  The series uses attractive bright colours for the clothing/costumes of the characters, outlining their varying personalities.  The various settings of the show are drawn with much attention to detail and many vibrant colours, making for a \"clean\" looking show.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the OST of the show was quite fitting.  Many of the cheerful melodies fit the comedic and silly moments of the show.  I particularly enjoyed the opening song, \"Hitorigoto\", as I am a longtime fan of ClariS.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the main character Masamune is a cut and paste harem main character.  Hopelessly dense and unreasonably lenient with his sister who lacks pretty much every life skill, he is as cliche as it gets.  I did however enjoy his gradual attempts to change his sister's habits and lifestyle for the better.  Sagiri, the titular eromanga sensei, is one of the more enjoyable characters to watch throughout the show, because of the amount of development she gets.  She starts off as hardcore NEET, who almost never leaves her room, even stomping the floor to get her brother to bring  trays of food at her doorstep.  As a result, she lacks any basic social/life skills.  As she meets more people in the same field however, she gradually gains life skills, gains confidence, and interacts with the world outside her room.  It was truly a joy to watch this development.  Other supporting characters include Elf Yamada, a self-confident, whimsical, and bratty best selling author, and Muramasa Senju, a cold yet timid best selling author.  Both of these characters are initially introduced as rivals to Masamune, but inevitably get sucked into his harem and receive brief backstories, but not much character development.  An honourable mention goes to middle schooler Megumi Jinno, who uttered the meme-worthy quote, \"Dicks. I love them!\".  Overall, although the development of Sagiri is noteworthy, most of the characters have unoriginal personalities.  They are basically cardboard cutouts of other harem anime characters, but with titles related to light novels.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic moments of the show did give me a few laughs, but for about 70% of the show I was either cringing from discomfort or forcing myself to continue watching.  I decided to commit to finishing the show because I loved reading the post episode threads on reddit, but after finishing, I have decided that it was not worth it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nIf you're actually a fan of the generic ecchi harem rom-coms that I've criticized throughout this review, this show is probably for you.  But if you want something more original and wholesome, I'd definitely avoid this.  The short comedic moments are not worth having to witness the cringe-worthy underage lewding and bland/unoriginal plot and characters.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show was like a try not to cringe challenge for me. It did start off in a very sincere way in it's narration. It felt like it wanted to be taken seriously, and it could have been better. An MC with a backstory of trying to move on from his mother's passing by working hard to become a professional author, it was all good. But very soon it went downhill, forming a clich\u00e9 of an harem with some exhausting characters, an awkward sibling relationship and some frustrating storytelling.\r\nIt has very few moments that might make you laugh or feel like there was some thoughtput into it but overall Eromanga sensei is a very uninspired slice of life. Forcing a lot of bad comedy and over-saturating the viewer with some annoying cuteness and fanservice. When a show does that you can tell how lazy the script is and it's terrible attempt to try and be a commercial success. Usually I don't care to talk about a show like this in this manner, but like I said earlier, Eromanga sensei is different because it actually wants to be taken seriously, and A-1 Pictures is a studio that I have a lot of respect for.\\n\\n\r\nBut I gotta talk about the cringe in this anime, It was just too much and too bad. There were times when i needed to pause and take my time to recover from the cringe I was hit with. A lot of the character's actions and movements were cringy, The awkward comedy and dialogues were cringy, even the voice acting made me cringe sometimes, especially Sagiri's. Her forced squeaky voice acting to make it seem cute had me cringing in all types of ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty solid, This was a very colorful and detailed anime, expect no less from A-1 pictures, solid and consistent from start to finish. The music was pretty meh though. The OP and ED were okayish and the soundtracks were nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, for anyone, you are not really missing out on anything if you don't watch this show and we can do without a second season.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating - 1/10",

            "content": "So this anime was chosen to be the scapegoat for this anime list to be hated just for the sake of being hated on by normies\\idiots. Now saying you must like eromanga sensei or give it a good score you can do whatever but most idiots\\keyboard warriors here give it a 1\\10 because they do not know what slice of life is\\bandwagon of hate for no reason and other idiotic reason. All  I can do is give you a non biased, accurate review\r\nStory 5\\10\r\nMC writes light novels for a living and wants to make it out there in the world as an author. Hehas a NON BLOOD RELATED sister who is age 12 while he is 15 and the series is a slice of life that goes through while adding extra characters and random fanservice etc. His sister draws lewd art for a living and is a neet. Typical slice of life stuff here but a bit like bakuman which I liked but not much more then that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8.5\\10\\n\r\nProduction was superb for this anime, everything was smooth and looked great. Lots of use of vibrant colors with the illustrations. Most 1'10 reviews here do  not know how to review at all so do not take in account of anything else besides the show not being what they like but this was one of the best animated shows for the season it came out for.\\n\r\nSound 7\\10\\n\r\nOP was cute and a great listen, everything else does its job but nothing too memorable.\\n\r\nCharacters 6\\10\\n\r\nNow most characters were the generic tropes done right that you have seen countless of times for the most part. The main character was while generic had some depth and you see him work on his craft of being an author, having morals of exactly what relationship he wants with his step sister and how he wants to stay as just that while fighting the idea it could be more. Not too bad of an MC but nothing ground breaking what so ever but I give credit where its due. Elf sensei going through character development and learning her decent backstory along with her being fleshed out well but thats where it ends. Most other characters get either no time or just generic but one of the girls pulled through I guess.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6\\10 \\n\r\nI enjoyed this series just like other slice of lifes since it was funny at times etc etc. Not digging the fanservice at all since they were 12 but keep in mind they were close to the MC age. \\n\r\nOverall thoughts\\n\r\nI give this show a 7\\10 but would like to point out something important. People hated the pedo vibes of this show but keep in mind the fanservice was either for comedy or the MC who was almost their age and was not  very excessive compared to others anime of similar nature. a 12 year old and 14\\15 year old is fine for them and I can assure you that if this series was the opposite and was milf city and the MC was 15 this show would be praised yet become actual pedophilia. In other series, we have so called 1000 year old women who look like they are in ELEMENTARY school but since they are claimed to be \"1000 years old\" or some legal aged loli its fine and people fap to that which is disgusting yet the anime community lets that slide and chooses this normal slice  of life thats only at best good by some standards nothing profound or a classic of its genre by any means. If you like slice of life comedy, you will like this and if not, do not watch this show simple as that. I actually might give this series an extra point for pity just because the reviews\\scores do  not do this series justice at all.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of those anime that isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's one of those that is meant to make you relate to the characters and/or give you satisfaction. A very similar anime to this is Himouto! Umaru-chan. \r\nPlot: 5/10\r\nThe plot of it is that the MC has been writing a light novel where the illustrator is some unknown person that goes by the name 'Eromanga'. He doesn't realize that Eromanga is actually his little sister (which is not his biological sister). I won't be talking about what happens later because it's kinda spoiler filled. The story focuses on a couple ofcharacters who are all either otakus, authors, publishers or illustrators. Honestly the concept of having a story focused on an otaku character has been done before and is slowly becoming more common. The story is easy to understand (at least for anime fans and/or manga fans) but that's cause it's not complex. I do feel like it has been done before but not in this way (???). I would also like to mention the fat guy that runs between the transitions each episode, I thought that was a nice thing they keep. I gave it a 5 (mediocre) due to it not being something unbelievably original but still not something that's overdone.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this is actually very well done. Although due to the art and story most of the time when I was watching this (especially at the scenes when one of the authors is bragging) I kept thinking how the animators felt. I mean they did have to animate this series which makes publishing a work and drawing seem so easy (I mean Eromanga is like 12 and can draw that in like 5 minutes) while the animators probably can't see their family most of the time and almost never get recognition.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a musician but I do have to admit that the music is quite good. I know it's not Yuri on Ice levels or Your Lie in April levels but is quite fitting for the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5/10\\n\r\nThe series has quite good characters. Their biggest fault is usually that they are unoriginal or simply unrealistic. When reviewing anime you have to realize that it is animation, so they make everything quite extra (face expressions, emotions, voice acting ect.) to make stuff entertaining. But seriously Eromanga is 12 and can draw that well?! Elf-Yamada is like 14 and is one of the most successful authors in upcoming light novels ?! And how does the MC keep his writing on check and his school life on and manages to have friends?? I feel like this is due to the writers of the show being too old to understand the stuff you can and can't do at a young age. I'm around the age of the characters and I do feel like this is too extra. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10\\n\r\nIf it was any other anime I would of dropped it already. But their is after all something pulling me to watch one more episode if you know what I mean. I honestly think it's the hangcliffs at the ends of most of the episodes. BUT HOW? I don't feel attached to the story nor the characters. How is this possible?\\n\\n\r\nBRIEF HISTORY:\\n\\n\r\npros:\\n\r\n-you might relate to the characters if you're a writer or any type of artist\\n\r\n-the animation is great\\n\r\n-the music is fine\\n\r\n-you get attached to the series somehow\\n\r\n-if you want to get to know anime and manga this might be good for you\\n\r\n-overall it seems like a weird concept but it is pretty relateble to some people\\n\\n\r\ncons:\\n\r\n-the story is pretty boring for the first few episodes\\n\r\n-characters are bland\\n\r\n-honestly if half of the characters weren't lolis this would be such a flop\\n\\n",

But I don't think people watching this show come into it expecting a interesting plot with unique characters.\r\nI read CoquiEnthusiast review of the show in which he/she wanted to vent his/her anger regarding the show and I get that most of the points he made are fair but to be fair to theshow-\\n\\n\r\n-The animation is not that bad.(Relative to some of the other shows that have come out this season it's quite good. Eg: Clockwork planet, Alice to Zouruko etc)\\n\r\n-The soundtrack gets a passing grade too.\\n\r\n-I too fell the displeasure experienced by CoquiEnthusiast due to the unnecessary sexualization of the characters of the show, but at this point the anime industry is in such a place that most of the shows based in the harem/ecchi genre all share this common theme and also most shows based out of highschool also share this theme.\\n\r\n-Despite all this, if you just want to shut your brain and watch some stupid shit then this show itself is not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nI also understand the comparison to Oreimo and it's blatantly obvious where this plot is going but I think the people who watch this shows every week already know this.\\n\r\nAs a anime fan, I do expect much better from the anime industry, I myself also hope that shows like Ping pong, Code Geass, Haikyuu S1,S2 ,Berserk 1997-98, Parasite are produced every season and that I can take pleasure in watching them.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not here to say that Eromanga-sensei is great anime in fact I don't even think it's a good anime and i'm sure everyone will forget about it by the end of the season. I myself won't be watching this anime anymore. But If some one wants to enjoy Eromanga-sensei I have nothing against them. After all if people can watch tentacle hentai why can't they watch this.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading all this the reader may be wondering what I wanted to convey through this. To be honest nothing much really, I just wanted to put forward my thoughts on this show.\\n\r\nBTW I really like the OP of the show.\\n\r\nP.S: Sorry for mentioning CoquiEnthusiast review again and aging in the above text. I understand that most of the readers may not have read his/her review. His/Her review of Eromanga-sensei should be up on the MAL page of Eromanga-sensei.",

            "content": "The comedic adventures of a young light novel author and his \"shut in\" hopelessly bashful sister. On the surface, this claims to be a slice of life story about sibling bonding, but most of us know better than that. If you're familiar with the Oreimo series by the same author, you probably have no doubt where this is heading. For the rest of you, this is a normal high schooler SoL with an \"adult life\" twist and a whole lot of cuteness. There are deeper serious undertones and meaningful emotional scenes in this one, but the show rarely budges from a shameless, relaxing, adventurous moodwith tons of laughs along the way. If I had to say something good about this show it would be the very likable cast. From the very start character premises are very easy to accept and like, with a wide variety of cute, bizarre and seriously funny personalities. Animation flows beautifully, with plenty of realistic detail in movements, gestures, and dancing that at times can seem one-of-a-kind. Art is magnificent with stunning effort put into the smallest of details in backgrounds and on characters with ample use of great colors. Character art is very pleasing to the eye and filled well thought out and impressive details from head to toe. Dialogue in scenes is very informal and relatable, it can be repetitive at times though. If I had to say something bad about this show it would the weak plot. Not much screentime is put into seriously working toward the plot, with hours and hours of goofing off and antics that may seem childish to many. The plot is repetitive any doesn't seem to head in any interesting or surprising direction. The imaginary world of Eromananga Sensei is quite small and has very few details, it can make the show feel monotonous. \\n\r\nFair Warning however: if shameless fan service bothers you, don't bother watching. if dirty sibling stories enfuriate you, immediately contact your local police department and ask to have them ban this show in your country (or just don't watch it). Favorite characters: Elf, Sagiri. I give it a 7.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR Version: Goofy, very funny, cute, warm, SoL with a lot of smiles and sexiness. Don't watch if you hate fan service. Great visuals. Bone-dry, repetitive plot.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nYou know, I do love these straightforward and bright pseudo-romance series with small twists in them. And in this particular Anime the twist was that most female cast were young girls, who were ero artist in nutshell. A joyful adventure of young lewd minds, who actually are still inexperienced and pure. That twist alone made this anime fun for me. Bless art of eros.\r\nNow, as usual these type of shows are extremely minimal in story adventure. As they function as usual as advertisement for the source material.Basically, once you finish the Anime it pretty much gives you general gist of the world, characters, setting and so on. A big prologue in Animated form. \"If you want to know more, read the LN\" basically this type of thing. I'm fine and used to it, but obviously I won't touch the LN as I cannot be bothered to read in general. Although I do hope all young lewd minds will find their vanilla soulmate and be lewd together until death them parts. Being lewd is fine as long you stay true to love and intimacy and won't become a ***t.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, to sum it up. Story is presented in straightforward and bright manner as usual with these kinds of Anime. For what it is, I found it entertaining as it had fun setting and really cute characters. Do not expect story progressing too far, as mentioned these types of Anime are basically introductory to their source material and likelihood seeing them fully adapted is quite minimal.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nSimple, fun, colorful and straightforward. I have nothing else to add.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nWe have a bunch of cute stereotypes that also have their \"annoying\" side. An extreme shut-in, who is as well quite lewd and jealous. A tsundere ojou-sama, who is a bit tad too tiring. Not my perfect tsundere. And a bit quiet, sadistic, selfish and oddly angry kimono girl. Nevertheless, all of the female cast pretty much has absolutely adorable side as well.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters also were pretty fun stereotypes and the main guy was, well the usual \"good guy, but a bit awkward\" stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed them all.\\n\r\nAnd I do ship main character with Tomoe. Loved their minimal moments.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI did mention already everything that is needed. It is a straightforward, pseudo-romance, harem with a little twist to it. Why I call it \"pseudo\" is simply it doesn't really progress anywhere relationships'wise as this Anime is pretty much introduction to the world\\n\r\nService was as well nice. It wasn't visually too lewd, but rather it gave more to imagination. Which in this Anime was a superb balance.\\n\\n\r\nJoyful, bright, fun. Bless art of eros. \\n\\n",

            "content": "My first feeling when I was watching this show was really different from what I think now.\r\nYou know, Eromanga-sensei is one of these show that is so incredibly horrible that it actually becomes entertaining. However, that kind of feeling doesn't last long. That's why I went from totally amazed and wondering how far the show would go with the awkward suggestive scenes and the absolutely not sane brother-sister relationship to bored as hell.\r\nBut I had to finish it. I needed to write this review, and I it wouldn't be honest to write a review without finishing it beforehand.\r\nSo Eromanga-sensei is about a highschool guy whois also a siscon who discovers that his cute shut-in little sister (they're not blood-related, keep that in mind, it's important) is the one who actually draws the erotic art for his light-novels. As a good main character for a show like this, this young boy has the charisma of a cup of cold coffee, while being irritatingly dense, of course. And the show is supposed to be about the evolution of the little sister (they do not have any biological bood whatsoever, keep that in mind) and her opening to the world, except she doesn't ! Of course, you'd remove 50% of the jokes otherwise. \\n\r\nSo this lucky bastard encounters a few girls during the 12 episodes, going from the clich\u00e9 tsundere, who actually tells him \"I-it's not like I like you or anything b-baka !\" for f*cking real to the twelve year-old girl who tells him she loves dicks, and he is regularly put in embarassing situations.\\n\r\nAnd, that's, it.\\n\r\nThen you have the festival episode, the field trip episode, the tournament episoode and so on. The only thing missing is a final episode actually. Even though the first few episodes let us think there would be some evolutions in the relations of the characters or in the characters themselves, nothing came.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, at first it was fun, I even told a few of my friends \"go for it dude, you're seriously in for a treat with this show\". Because I'll be honest, the otherworldly scenes like a little girl playing piano in an abandonned mansion totally naked without a freaking reason, the fact that THEY AREN'T RELATED BY BLOOD IF YOU FORGOT, or the simple fact that it's an anime about a little girl drawing porn unironically amazed me... In the first 6 episodes. After that, even though the show  continues to do better (I should say worse) every episode, you're just bored. The hype for a shitty show can't possibly last long. Thus, I've had huge troubles getting myself to watch the three last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a conclusion, if you're fine with dense characters, stupid jokes, a buttload of dumb clich\u00e9s and an MC who is a fully assumed siscon, then go, this show is exactly what you were looking for. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure everybody here has something better to do. Not me though, I wouldn't be here writting reviews otherwise.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not entirely sure what exactly compelled me to start Eromanga sensei. Perhaps I wanted to know why exactly were people completely shocked about how explicit the show was (when the writer and studio are the exact same as OreImo). Perhaps I wanted to see if OreImo\u2019s writer fixed his craft. Perhaps I just wanted something to rage on. Whatever the case is, it succeeded in delivering on most of my expectations and is easily one of the worst TV anime to air in recent memory.\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to discuss Eromanga without discussing OreImo, so I\u2019ll be spoiling major parts of OreImo. Not like any saneperson would care, but spoilers ahoy.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is basically the fusion of the worst aspects of OreImo (not like that show was any good, but it at least took time to become complete garbage), combined with the pervertedness and general stupidity of your standard incest doujin/hentai. Unlike most of those, Eromanga-sensei also caters to lolicons, which makes it appeal to the lowest common denominator in basically every single way.\\n\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s entire existence is to shove fanservice down the viewer\u2019s throat at literally every single opportunity. The cast largely consists of girls who aren\u2019t even teenagers, but you\u2019d never guess if you saw how shamelessly parades various clothing items\u2026to put it mildly. Sex jokes are in every corner, and while I like my sex jokes as much as the next guy (for\u2026reasons) they\u2019re all tasteless and incredibly unoriginal here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a rehash of OreImo with sprinkles of other shows in between. Not like that taking influence from other works is necessarily an issue, but this is OreImo we\u2019re talking about. You know, the story that ended literally with a sister and brother getting married and the main character shooting down every girl who likes him to bang his sister. I can give it the smallest of credit since I think it\u2019s actually more honest about its incest shenanigans, unlike OreImo which had the first half of season 1 being wildly different in tone from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rehashes of OreImo\u2019s cast with absolutely nothing to make them distinct from their counterparts there. The cast even has characters that feel like a combination of characters from that show, which might have worked out for less intelligent minds if it weren\u2019t for the fact that OreImo\u2019s cast literally walks by and it cements in the mind of the viewer that we\u2019re basically staring at almost the same cast. What I\u2019m trying to say is that these characters are garbage; they act in illogical and ridiculous ways and make fuck all sense.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is decent but nothing exceptional, looking almost exactly like OreImo did (Seeing a pattern here?) and the character designs looking the same, with the added benefit of the A-1 Pictures same-face syndrome and even Claris singing the opening\u2026*sigh* This is just season 3 of OreImo, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nSo Eromanga sensei, is for the lack of a better phrase, complete garbage. It\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d recommend to make ISIS members watch to torture them into submission, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend to any remotely ordinary person and is a pile of trash that should be buried in the lowest pits of hell.",

For example, you give me a sibling romantic comedy, (even though I dislike such story lines) I will give it a good score as long as it has good, solid character development and a steady pace with nothing rushed going into it. Hell, I might even suggest it to people.\r\nHowever, this anime is, to me, highly infuriating. People might critisize me for this review because I gave it a low score, however, allow me to explain. \r\nOriginally, I liked the anime's opening song. I liked it\u2019s art, animation and character design. Let me remind you,the protagonist, eromanga sensei [Masamune\u2019s little sister] is a cutesy character and most people liked her because of her design. I admit, I did too.  But, after watching this anime, I kinda pity her and don't like her as much as I did before starting this show.\\n\\n\r\nI have no problems with cutesy characters \u2014 although, I prefer badass characters\u2014 so that isn't my main reason for disliking this show. I have several reasons as to why I hate this show, so much. Firstly, let's start with the abundance of adults in the anime. Middle Schoolers and highschooler\u2019s don't have their parents taking care of their child. I mean, fine I can handle the sibling's situation. But, what about the teenager living next door to them? She lives alone, throughout the anime, there's not a even a hint of her siblings or parents or relatives taking care of her, by any sorts. Yes, she has a brother, but what kind of brother let's his sister (who BTW is of thirteen years old) live alone in a huge house, and live separately without him? \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, these girls willingly lift their skirts up and let Sagiri draw their facial expressions, panties and etc. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the quote&; sibling romantic comedy &quote; is no where to be found. The brother hasn't seen his sister for years and once she opens the door, they talk and after a few days he confesses his feelings for her?\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the probably the thing I hate most, is the fact that thirteen year olds talk about dicks, ask people to strip and the sister draws a hentai manga with a fucked-up dick. \\n\\n\r\nEven though, this anime is supposed to be about Sagiri, she gets less screen time then supporting characters. We never see any character relationship build and don't see how anything progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I hate this anime. I don't recommend anyone to watch this, it sucks.",

            "content": "There\u2019s only one anime that managed to get my blood boiling more than Sword Art Online, and that anime is Eromanga Sensei. Going into it, I had a feeling that this anime wasn\u2019t going to be anything revolutionary, but I didn\u2019t expect to find nothing but bad writing, cliched, beaten to death scenarios, and above all else, this overwhelming feeling like you\u2019re being disgustingly predatory. I\u2019ve never been one to turn down good fanservice; if anything, I encourage it (as long as it\u2019s done well), and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this uncomfortable watching a fanservice show. Showing me the panties of some 16year old high school girl? Okay, fine. But 12 year olds? Where do we draw the line with this shit?\\n\\n\r\nIs this what we\u2019ve come to? Eating up the most bland, badly written, and pandery piece of shit that we can find all for a couple of cute girls- who are, by the way, DISGUSTINGLY underage? Like, I\u2019m talking creepy upshirt shots for no reason at all aside from \u201cWow, don\u2019t you want to fuck this 12 year old?\u201d Loli jokes were funny for a little bit I guess, but when we\u2019re at a point as a community where lewding girls that literally look straight outta the womb is a really funny joke, yeah fuck that. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t believe how much this show is banking on the success of Oreimo. But, unlike Oreimo, this show feels totally and completely hollow. While Oreimo definitely had its flaws, it had consistent and- for the most part- well written characters. This anime is nothing but an excuse to animate some young girls with their panties out and sell as many dakimakuras and figures of Elf and Sagiri as they possibly can. Every calculated joke screams \u201cTurn me into a reaction gif!! Make me this seasons Big Meme!!\u201d and it all just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nStarting out this show, it\u2019s made clear right off the bat that both Masamune and Sagiri want to fuck each other and, even though it\u2019s presented as a harem, Sagiri and Masamune are going to end up together. What follows is 12 episodes of this anime jerking us back and forth through stupid misunderstandings meant to fill this anime out with as much fanservice-y bulk as they can. All for a final episode that wraps up absolutely nothing and attempts to provide absolutely no closure, instead leaving me feeling like the show actually spat in my face. This show is all around badly written, sometimes changing character\u2019s personalities and motivations for no reason except to move the plot along to the next part (which is always just another excuse for fanservice), especially during the beach trip arc. And worst of all, with such a generic, fanservice-centered plot, this show is a chore to watch. It\u2019s just so bland. Everything that you could possibly want out of this show has been done before in better, way less predatory ways.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do think that Eromanga looks alright, for a show centered around how sexy and cute their loli characters are, I found myself thinking constantly that the characters were badly designed. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a pedophile looking to watch an anime about 12 year olds with my dick in my hand, but even Sagiri, who was animated by someone whose entire job was to make her look sexy, was not attractive. Elf, who wears poofy lolita dresses and elf ears, (and is very obviously supposed to be the Kuroneko of this show) looks stupid, and I don\u2019t remember ever thinking while watching this show that she was cute. The majority of the smoother animation was used for creepy upshirt shots of Sagiri drawing or high detailed shots- down to the BABY FAT ON HER BODY- of her changing into a sexy outfit for her brother. When I tell people about how disgusted I am by the fanservice in this show, I show them the very beginning of episode 5, because that\u2019s all you need to see to know that this show is just trying to cash in on pedophiles who use the excuse that \u201cWell, it\u2019s just fiction!\u201d to justify their behavior. Being into 12 year old girls with baby fat still on their body, and animating long scenes of her rolling around on her bed like a toddler with cutesy mobile music that sounds like it was recorded on a toy piano is downright gross. It does nothing but normalize wanting to fuck underage girls. I\u2019m not trying to be preachy, but when is enough enough? When do we sit back and realize that the anime community harbors pedophiles and normalizes wanting to have sex with young girls? There is a huge problem with pedophilia in Japan, and shows like this, that make and sell sexy merch of their extremely underage characters, just normalize and send the message that there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to fuck 10 year olds. And anime studios that see the success that this show brought them and all the money that they got from it\u2019s creation? It just makes other anime studios think that loli fanservice is what we want now, and it\u2019s just gross. Give me some huge honking Babonkers any day, but leave the underdeveloped babies out of it. It\u2019s just super gross. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox now. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about this. Nothing to write home about here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and skip this show. I guess if you want to watch a boring Oreimo clone with predatory fanservice and shitty plot, have at it, but if you\u2019re looking for anything with just a bit of substance, this is a show to avoid. If you like watching train wrecks and then bitching about how shitty they are, hey, maybe you\u2019ll get something out of this one, but I promise that it\u2019s not worth watching the whole show. Instead, go watch Koi Kaze, an incest anime that actually has interesting things to say about how society views incestual relationships and well written characters to make you 10x more invested than this show ever could. \\n",

            "content": "The 'imouto genre' is a very peculiar sub-genre to the whole moe craze that we have in anime today.  Mostly relying on the forbidden fruit of romantic sibling relationships, most of these shows tend to have ankle-deep plotlines with heavy reliance on fanservice and your typical misunderstanding plots in order to fill out its runtime.  If I may be honest here, Eromanga-sensei really is no different.\r\nStory: Masamune Izumi is an LN author in high school.  Due to familial circumstances, he must now support himself and his little stepsister, Sagiri, so that the two of them may continue living together.  With Sagirishutting herself in her room 24/7, Masamune has a hard time connecting with her until he finds out one day that his little sister is actually the illustrator for his books, Eromanga-sensei.  And thus, hilarity (I guess) ensues.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story for Eromanga-sensei relies primarily on two things: the on-going plot of our protagonist trying to make a new book, and a harem comprised of entirely middle school girls.  When combined together, the show creates a decently meshed story, but is ultimately nothing too special as a lot of the dialogue repeating similar lines to each other to boast the audience's appeal to root for the main characters and their dreams, and many of the scenes and episodes are repeated ecchi gags like the beach episode, unnecessary challenges, and the girls hiding their true feelings for a greater portion of the series.  Not only that, but the show puts in far too many attempts at creating dramatic or interesting character introductions that are honestly more cringe-inducing than welcome to see.  (Looking at you, Muramasa.)  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show is at face value, a cheap rehash of many of what would considered to be the norm in anime, the show does have several genuinely cute moments with the second to last episode in particular being the highlight of the entire series as it explains a backstory that I guess we never really asked for.  (Was still nice to see.)  On top of that, the show's overall playful nature with its character interactions and lighter storyline leans it more towards a piece of fluff entertainment, so expecting more than what's on the cover is asking for too much.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever I'm not really keen on the ending since all they did to finish the series off was to chuck in a throwaway episode that had no handling on the main story.  If anything, they probably should've just left episode 12 to be an OVA or something cause comparatively, it follows it own storyline, and it's just weird for the audience to expect some kind of conclusion when really you just leave it on some kind of weird cliffhanger that doesn't make anyone at all very happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Actually nice backstory that caps everything off\\n\r\n+/-  Pretty much what'd you expect for a little sister/harem series\\n\r\n-  Last episode is worthless in terms of continuity\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As expected with a harem-based series, the cast or Eromanga-sensei consists primarily of the main, dense protagonist, the girls who he trails behind, and a bunch of side characters whose only purpose is to add to the story in a minimal way.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, Masamune Izumi is your typical run of the mill harem protagonist.  Well, not so much 'run of the mill', just not particularly all that interesting.  With his dream being to have one of his works get turned into an anime and getting the chance to watch said anime with his little sister, Masamune ends up being less of your typical dense harem protag, but more of one that is aware of each of the girls' feelings, but doesn't really act on them.  He wants his little sister to be able to comfortably step out of her room, but does so without changing much of the status quo of things with any sort of foreseeable impact later on down the line.  Ultimately, he does have several aspects of him that make him more interesting than some other harem protags, but not enough to make him not only his own character or anyone really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sagiri, or Eromanga-sensei (an alias that she refuses to acknowledge despite the fact that she came up with it herself), Sagiri plays the role of the cute little sister who secretly loves her brother but is too shy and scared to say or do anything despite getting jealous of all the attention her brother gets cause literally everyone he hangs out with on a daily basis is female.  Despite being a 'main character', Sagiri's existence really is more of a glorified supporting character.  Because of her shut-in nature, she never leaves the house, and as such relies mostly on video calls to give her a majority of her interactions with other characters in the series.  As a result, Sagiri's screentime is severely lacking for a 'main character', so it feels very strange to even call her that.  I do however find her closet pervert antics quite amusing.  It's just funny to see seeing this 13 year old girl act like an old man half the time because of her fascination of women's underwear and the like.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the harem, Elf and Muramasa, actually have a much bigger role in the series than the supposed heroine.  Playing the loud, aggressive narc and the more soft-spoken chuuni, the duo of these two authors create the rest of Masamune's harem and act as comrades in arms to our main character, thus giving them more screentime.  While the series provides us with some backstory and explanation to how these girls become authors, their characters similar to the rest of the cast, don't really change all that much.  The comedic nature of the series leaves their characters stagnant in order to keep their appeal, really only cropping up new aspects of them at the end when Ithere's nothing related to the plot of writing a book happening.  \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the rest of the cast doesn't really do much.  Consisting of a middle school girl who outright says she loves dick, various editors, the guy author who pretty much only shows up at the end and barely does anything, and other characters of similar importance, the side cast is there to enrich the cast, and nothing else.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Main cast (and harem) each have some interesting aspect to them\\n\r\n-  Stagnant characters\\n\r\n-  Side cast practically does nothing\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by A-1, Eromanga-sensei looks bright, is quite clean, and is general standard fare for the company.  Using a heavy moe-stylized appearance, the whole point of the artstyle is to look cute and appealing to the audience.  Nothing really outstanding about it, but nothing really that bad.  \\n\\n\r\nI do want to fact that because the show literally has 'ero' in its name, Eromanga-sensei is indeed a fanservice show.  With many gratuitous shots of underage girls, from beach scenes to underwear, thigh shots, etc...it's pretty much impossible to avoid any kind of blatant fanservice when the word 'erotic' is written on the box.  So if you're not a fan of fanservice, probably not something for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Clean, consistent quality\\n\r\n+/- Quite a lot of fanservice (Depends on your opinion of fanservice)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST for Eromanga-sensei isn't all that special.  Both its OP \"Hitorigoto\" and ED \"adrenaline!!!\" are cheery pop songs that sound nice, but are ultimately quite generic in the end.  The ED is a little more poppy than the OP, but they're still the same kind of song.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: If I were to describe Eromanga-sensei, I'd say it's 'enjoyable'.  Nothing about it is spectacular, ground-breaking, or really all that special.  It's the show of the season that people devote the season's memes to because of just how painfully average it is.  Personally, I don't really have anything directed towards it: no vendetta, no appreciation, just an entirely average \"meh\" to the whole thing.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?  \\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I find Elf, amusing.  She was always my favorite of the three girls because while her bold and brazen attitude can be annoying, she was the most consistent character and was more honest than the others.  I also like Sagiri's 'old man' antics.  Her being a perverted 13 year old was always amusing for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the last episode being a throwaway, Muramasa's introduction was one of the shoddiest character introductions I've ever seen.  Especially when you learn why things played out the way they did, it just boggles the mind with how or why things turned out that way.  (Also a certain cameo at the end of episode 11 is just...no.  Why do you remind me of that?)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something kinda trashy and not expecting much from it, Eromanga-sensei fits the bill quite well.  Again, the show is really more of a piece of entertainment than any kind of impressive story or overarching plot, so don't really expect much when watching it.  Personally, I don't think it's bad enough to be panned, but it's not really good enough to be worth anything but a timekiller, so my standing on its merit is that it's something that's ok for when you have the downtime for it.",

            "content": "siblings\r\na word used to describe the beautiful relationship shared by two people , who are bound the mutual feeling of love and respect. But can this unconditional love develop into something past this sibling bond? Perhaps not ... in real life.. but hey its an anime .. that too a one written by Tsukasa Fushimi( yes, the one who wrote oreimo) so we  can expect somthing out of the oridinary... right?\r\nSo, Eromanga sensei is an anime based on a Light novel of the same name  written by, as i mentioned before, Tsukasa fushimi. Now you must have known bout this guy because ofhis previous work, Oreimo... and don't get me wrong , I am a Big fan of Oreimo, its one of my favorite Light novels of all time. But even I am not sure why would\\n\r\nhe write such a trash for his next work.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story follows Isumi masamune, a high schooler who is also secretly a Light novel author. He lives alone with his 12 year old S-T-E-P sister, who is a hikikomori doesn't come out of her room. The illustrations for his novels are done by a artist named \"Eromanga Sensei\", and as his nme suggests.. he is famous for drawing erotic illustrations.. tho refuses to acknowledge the fact. So one day , through one of his live streams , Eromanga sensei's identity was revealed to Masamune.. and guess who was it ... It was his little sister Sagiri( woo.. i would've never guessed that). He also meets various other light novel authors and, surprisingly all of them are  High schoolers (because... anime). We then follow a story which seems to go nowhere and has all the cute girls falling for masamune for no reason but he still want his sister..( because ...anime)\\n\\n\r\nNow,  I think that that characters are the best... or rather the least worst thing in the anime. The main protagonist, Masamune is a part time light novel author and a full time siscon and wishes to go full time on both. Jokes aside, he is one of the generic dense characters with no personality at all but he has a talent for  writing.. tho most of his work gets rejected. Thus he has very low self esteem but has a believe that one day he will make money out of writing and can support his sister  independently .He really isn't a bad character and also has a strong sense of responsibility in him tho he still is dense as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri..... Now this character was quite popular for being extremely cute and moe... but fuck.. i don't like her.She is one the worst female leads i have ever seen. Besides being cute, i can't think of a many  good thing about her.. she is somewhat of a tsundere and has a brat like personality.. she knows that masamune loves her but still acts this way towards him ( but i guess thats how tsundere are) . She is good at drawing erotic illustrations ( hmm.. a 12 year old loli drawing lewd illustrations... seems legit) and she also has a weird fetish for looking at other at other girl's panties.. but she can't leave her room so orders her Nii-san to do it.She speaks really soft and needs to use a mike for speaking to people.And tho both she was even confessed by masamune... she rejected him for some reason and now .. when she actually starts to like him.. she wants him to confess to her  and doesn't want to say it herself. Trust me i Can't ship them.. i just can't.\\n\\n\r\nYamada elf was a really interesting character and TBH my favorite in the entire anime. She is a famous light novel author who started living next door to masamune. At first she was bit brat like... but later her attitude changed when she befriends masamune and they start spending a lot of time togather. She is really passionate when it comes to writing and often gives tips to masamune too. She eventually falls for him and even confesses to him in episode 9...(watch that episode.. you'll love her .. trust me)\\n\r\nTho masamune really likes her but he says he is in love with sagiri so he can't reciprocate her feelings. Muramasa is another light novel author who has sold around 10 million copies. She says that she was inspired by masamune for writing and doesn't care about her sales and just wants to write for fun. She also loves masamune and had confessed to him.... ho was rejected.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the series is really good.( as expected of A1) . But they really got lazy when it came to character design. most of the characters seem like a cheap copy of the ones in oreimo (might be because the illustrator was same for both series). The sound track is pretty OK with really nothing to praise or complain about.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end... Eromanga sensei is really a crappy series with little to no good points. The story is just shit.. most of the characters are too. TBH i was a big fan of Oreimo and had a lot of expectations from this series and it turned out to be like this. I would not really recommend this series to anyone unless you are really big fan of moe.. but still i don't think you will like anyways. But hey.. at least its STEP sister this time.\\n\\n",

Well maybe it is but seriously. From the guy who made OreImo, what else did you fucking expect? A kid friendly show, oh wait that won't even be anime anymore.\r\nThat aside, one should watch it solely for the comedy. Don't expect too much as since this is from the guy who made OreImo, we already know what's going to fucking happen.

Because a 12ish girl dating her not-blood-related-brother (emphasiize that part) would kind of seem wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah...just watch it for the comedy. It actually turned out not so bad but the imouto could kind of be more...I don't know...appealing? She just looks like your typical cute girl with a little bit of tsundere being mixed in. And the male MC could be a tad bit less neutral because I HONESTLY DON\"T KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH THIS DUDE. You'll see what I mean when you watch Eromanga Sensei. You'll see.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the anime wasn't so disgusting like some reviewers have said. I came to realize that these people over exaggerate a lot of stuff about Eromanga like the male MC being obsessed with his sister which that is not true. He just cares for her in his own way. So don't let those people influence your decision on watching the anime and don't feel like enjoying the anime is a bad thing because it certainly isn't. Everyone has their own taste. Well, see you!",

            "content": "This is my first review I have ever written, and I wanted my first review to be about something special, so I chose Eromanga Sensei. It was the black sheep of 2017, and for good reasons. This show is trash, but I mean real trash. There are so many jokes that cross the line that people went insane, including me! I find this show incredibly trashy.... but as you guessed by my score I gave this anime, I also really, really liked it. My enjoyment was a absolute 10. Why, you may ask. Is it because I am a sick bastard or because this showmay actually be good? Well, let's take a look at Eromanga Sensei.  \\n\\n\nStory: 7/10  \\n\nThe story despite being the most controversial aspect of this show is the least interesting aspect. Masamune gets a new step-sister (called Sagiri), but she stays all day in her room. Izumi is also a Masamune writes light novels and works with the mysterious ''Eromanga Sensei'' who makes lewd erotica. ''Eromanga Sensei'' turns out to be Sagiri, which changes the relationship between Sagiri in more then one way  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Then story goes all over the place, from rivalry between Masamune and Elf to love triangles and sofort.  \\n\\n\nThe story is not really that special, besides that a 13-year old girl is in love with her brother who is 16. That part is also why a lot of people don't like this anime: It feels wrong. And it is also wrong, but I will get into later why this actually helps the anime. But overal, not a special story, but it does it job.  \\n\\n\nArt: 8/10  \\n\nThe animations are smooth and the drawings Sagiri draws look fantastic (NO NO NOT THAT WAY). The colors of the whole anime are laid-back. The art of this anime is not really that special, but it still looks good.  \\n\\n\nSound: 8/10  \\n\nThe sound is not really anything worth talking about, but the OP and the ED are so good. Especially the ED. It is so lively and happy. It also reminds me a lot of ''Walking On Sunshine'' by Katrina & The Waves. Maybe that's why I like it so much.  \\n\\n\nThe Enjoyment: 10/10  \\n\nThe first half of the anime I constantly screamed of disgust. It was trashy, it was disgusting, it didn't felt good. But you know what I also did throughout the whole anime?  \\n\\n\nI laughed. Oh boy I laughed.  \\n\\n\nThis is, no joke, the funniest anime I have ever seen (besides the Ghost Stories dub). And the trash helpt with it. Because I screamed of disgust a lot, I became sensitive to my other emotions, which in this case lead me to laugh a lot. The selfaware humor mixed with the ridiculous and disgusting fanservice made for some memorable and hilarious scenes. After the first half, I didn't care about the trash anymore. All I did was laugh.  \\n\\n\nOveral: 9/10  \\n\nI enjoyed my time with this anime more then I should.  \\n\\n\nSo the question is, do I recommend it?  \\n\\n\nThis is tough, because the biggest drawback of this anime is the trash (this does not aply to me). You will get disgusted. You will be shocked. But if you can look past all of that, you have a hilarious show. So I would recommend it if you can endure the trash.\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nAnother siscon work from the author that gave us OreImo, surely this one must be as good and hopefully with a satisfying ending.\r\nWho knows? Because I don't see how anyone could in good faith call this a good anime and hate themselves so much to endure watching it to the end.\r\nLet's knock off the easy things first; starting with:\r\nSound and music: To be honest there's nothing spectacular here, the OP/ED are quite nice however. 1/2 points.\r\nArt and animation: The art is quite nice and the illustrations drawn by the characters are fairly gorgeous, however the animation is lackluster in certain episodes such as #6where 2 of the characters are shown moving to a new area through a series of stills as they continue their conversation, rather lazy coming from A-1 Pictures. And let's be honest, the age of consent in Japan might be 13, but sexualizing teenagers should not be praised. 1/2 points.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: Okay so what do we have here, brother living alone with his sister, classic siscon plot... but wait! They're not even blood related, how original indeed. Except it's really easy to figure out that this was an attempt to bypass the same publishing regulations that prevented the author from making a good ending to OreImo.\\n\\n\r\nLet's continue that later, let's look at the characters. Generic big brother who writes light novels for a living, shut-in little sister that draws lewd art, tsundere love interest that's the MC's rival, overly energetic and happy school girl that loves dicks... WAIT WHAT?!\\n\r\nYes you read that right, in the start of episode 2 we're properly introduced to Megumi, the little sister's class mate (or would be if she actually went to school instead of being a shut-in). And she insists that she not only loves dicks, but that every girl her age loves them! This being said with a smile while uncomfortably invading the MC's personal space and staring at his crotch, only to be played off as a joke?! Okay let's be real here, you're a 13 year old schoolgirl, you come to a stranger's home, you ring their doorbell and then proclaim with a big smile right in their face that you love dicks. I'm sorry but, are you an underage prostitute? What in the name of all that is holy is wrong with you? This isn't something you say as a joke even to your best friend of several years, let alone a complete stranger. Even the MC himself asks \"What's happened to Japan?\" upon hearing this, and let me tell you it's nothing good. This scene alone should've made me (and everyone else) stop watching and drop the show for good, but I was foolish enough to give it a second chance.\\n\\n\r\nThis foolish behavior lasted until episode 6 where the MC signs up for a rookie tournament in order to secure a publishing opportunity for his upcoming novel. But oh no, a new rival appears and she's going to stop him from attaining this spot... for some reason. Said rival is the highly praised author Masamune who's produced a bestseller spanning 11 volumes and a 2 season anime adaption. Except that due to her status as a bestselling author she has no problems securing publishing opportunities for her work meaning she has no motive for entering this tournament, the tournament is also strictly for no-name rookies (the MC only being allowed in due to his editor pulling some strings), something she definitely isn't. Is this the kind of writing that passes for a plot these days? Normally I'd give both of these categories a point each but due to these 2 outrageous insults to human intelligence and societal norms I'm going to deduct a point each, leaving them: 0/4 points\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, did I enjoy this show? To be honest, what IS there to enjoy? The bad plot? The sexualized underaged characters? I imagine the only reason people watch this is because of the latter as they're somehow incapable of just watching a loli hentai instead, something that deserves a sudden visit from the authorities. Don't get me wrong, I like cute girls, I like lewd stuff, but this show should not be allowed to air on TV, I don't ever recall feeling disgusted from watching an anime. Admittedly I somehow endured watching it halfway through so I guess that's worth a bonus point for masochistic pleasure. 1/2 points.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now with some advanced math we total that up to an amazing: 3/10, the worst score I've ever given. Do humanity a favor and go watch something that isn't hebephilia.",

I loved you from the first moments I saw you getting carried in mother's arms, I loved the way you smile, I loved you so much that I always hide in your closet so I can smell all your clothes, each has your beautiful scent!\" \"Bro, what the f***?\"\r\nWell, if that doesn't convince your sisters to love you, neither will this anime. Eromanga-sensei is an anime about a young boy named Masamune who is an aspiring author, writing lightnovels to provide for him and his sister named Sagiri who is secretly an illustrator for several light novels including Masamune's work, however most of her prized illustrations are lewd girls. Yes, smell that plot real good.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not half bad, but it's not that good either, to put it simply, it's an upgrade of OreImo. To put it in detail, it's surprisingly a bit in depth than from what it's supposed to portray. From the several perspectives of the anime community, it's the same as OreImo, 'a siscon falling in love with his sister', but most of them didn't take into account was the story of them writing and drawing for their books, which was a good storyline of its own. Yes, that's right, it's not just about making a harem and then reject them all for your little sister. (even though it was kinda....portrayed like that.)\\n\\n\r\nYes, music is subjective to every ears, but even I, who am not much of a fan for songs so generic such as Eromanga-sensei's Opening and Ending theme, seemed to enjoy it even just a bit, it's cheerful, upbeat and colorful. It's to prepare your eyes and souls getting destroyed before an episode starts.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is drawn to be quite polished and with vibrant colors, much likely expected for a slice of life at this age, I would say it's average compared to the competitors of the genre, though it was pleasing to my eyes. The animation is quite mundane to say the least, which was also expected from a slice of life romantic comedy, it wasn't anything special since they exaggerated facial expressions and body languages, this might have been fitting a few years back, but after seeing anime within this genre that uses realistic facial expressions and body languages, Eromanga-sensei looked as it was outdated in terms of visual capabilities. But you're here to watch a big brother and a little sister getting nervous with each other in more ways than one, so I can see you don't really care, weirdos.\\n\\n\r\nEvery existing characters are just the 'heroines' of Masamune, as expected, however, they were at least much more interesting than I had thought initially. Muramasa who was also a light novel author, with a slight elegant appearance, and by that I mean she wears a kimono most of the time. Yamada, a playful light novel author who procrastinate a lot but is considered a prodigy at writing, to be frank, she might be the most memorable character throughout the anime, probably due to her personality. (and she's nuts) Finally, Shidou, who might be homophobic and was misled to believe that Masamune is homosexual. Everyone were a part of the anime, and not one of them lacked anything since they were introduced, as Masamune's slaves.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I personally enjoyed Eromanga-sensei but I do not highly regard it as an anime, it was filled with cliches, dumb cringe-worthy moments, plots that contradicted itself and a premise that makes me want to kill myself. Despite all of that, I enjoyed it for being itself, a romantic comedy shitpost, and with that I say, Anime is trash and so are we!\\n\\n\r\nI swear if they don't make a season 2 or at least a special episode where they realised fully that they both love each other and go on a date, I will....uh..... forget about I guess...\\n\\n",

            "content": "***NO SPOILERS HERE***\r\nEromanga-sensei  definitely deserves more love. While not an absolutely incredible anime or unique concept, it is quite entertaining - in quite some time, since I watched SAO, I found myself waiting eagerly for a new episode, even when I couldn't explain exactly why I like it so much.\r\nI'll separate this in parts:\r\nStory (7/10) - Many people complain about this anime merely because of the theme (incest? even though it's not really incestuous?) however I find the story very charming. I have some criticism on some areas though - like many harems, all the characters are inexplicably attracted to the protagonist, which hasno outstanding personality (i.e. the script writing makes it seem that Masamune blinds himself to avoid situations, in an attempt to create comical relief, but weakening the chances of anybody bonding with the character in the process).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - The art is pretty good. For an anime about artists and story-writers, it does it's job very well. It's not outstanding - but it's very good. I'm not an art specialist in any way, but the anime's artstyle was easy and appealing for my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) - I loved the intro song, and I have no complaints about the sound. There isn't much to talk about this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) - As I stated in Story, the main character is retarded, which is common for harems. The contrast of the personalities between the three main female characters (Sagiri, Elf and Muramasa) makes up much about the protagonist's flaws, and allows the viewer to bond with them. \\n\r\nSide note: Why are the Oreimo characters listed in this anime when they appear for 5 seconds? lul\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - I'm a little bit biased in this one. This is my favorite genre, and I had a lot of fun watching Eromanga-sensei. I recommend it to everybody reading this review, it's worth your while.",

            "content": "By this point, so much has been said about this series that it's hard to tell what to actually think. Is it merely a raunchy comedy series that accidentally attracted a larger audience than intended? Or is it something far worse? To phrase the question simply, is Eromanga-sensei really that bad?\r\n...Yes.\r\nEromanga-sensei is an anime that is broken to its very core. Its first issue is the most basic issue any show can have: the premise is bad. It attempts (poorly) to tell the story of Masamune Izumi, a successful teenage light novel author with a remarkable ability for causing sexy things to inexplicably happen aroundhim. Joining him in his lascivious endeavors is his loli sister Sagiri, a child who makes a living drawing porn (something something FBI\u2026). Incidentally, she also happens to draw the illustrations for Masamune\u2019s novels; although, through a contrivance of cosmic proportions, he remains unaware of this fact\u2026 even though they live in the same house.\\n\\n\r\nThe sheer poorness of this premise is frankly staggering.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, it lifts the aspiring light novel author plot directly out of Oreimo\u2019s first season. I was no fan of the idea there, and certainly am no fan of it here. The notion that the fifteen-year-old Kirino could get a light novel published with such ease always struck me as a bizarre deviation from the relatively grounded nature of Oreimo's first season up to that point, and it strikes me as far worse in Eromanga-sensei, where the characters are all several years younger.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the fact that Masamune has somehow remained unknowing of his sister\u2019s profession despite her living in the same house as him is downright asinine. It\u2019s bad enough that I have to believe that an unremarkable teenager could get a series of successful novels published, but now I\u2019m also supposed to accept that his kawaii imouto does the illustrations and he never suspected a thing? No thanks\u2014I don\u2019t buy it.\\n\\n\r\nI should mention that my intention here is not to suggest that realism is particularly important in anime; rather, I expect a slice of life series about otaku culture to have some grounding in the reality of otaku culture. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point? There\u2019s simply no reason for the show to even incorporate elements of a real phenomenon like otaku culture if it only plans to skew them beyond recognition anyway. For all of its shortcomings, this was something that Oreimo did well. It painted a pretty shady picture of otaku culture, but (excluding the light novel section) it showed characters interacting with this culture in a very real and relatable way. They formed communities of fans, attended events, and even had heated discussions about their favorite anime. It was played comically, but there was a definite sense that these events came from a place of experience and passion for the world of otaku on the part of the author. None of this is the case in Eromanga-sensei. The characters of this show live in a distant fantasy world where teenagers write light novels and children create hentai. Being an otaku here means nothing more than enjoying lewd light novels with lewder drawings. This is not the reality of otaku culture\u2014not to most people, at any rate\u2014and the show gains nothing from portraying it in this way.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I\u2019ve written about its premise alone, you\u2019re probably expecting me to write an almighty diatribe against the rest of Eromanga-sensei, but actually, past its premise the show is barely worth discussing. Things progress exactly how anyone would expect them to. More unremarkable characters are introduced, more absurd situations occur, and the show settles into a routine of raunchy mediocrity punctuated only by the occasional scene offensive enough to warrant a reaction. I honestly think the show would have been forgotten almost immediately, lost in a slew of other sexual anime comedies, if not for these extra offensive moments. Thanks, however, to delightful scenes like the one where a twelve-year-old girl says \u201cI love dicks\u2014all girls my age do,\u201d this show began an unfortunate ascension to the status of a meme. The good old anime memesters began crawling out of the woodwork, and eventually big figures in the community like Gigguk started paying the series some attention. Now, I love Gigguk\u2019s videos about Eromanga-sensei as much as any other self-respecting weeb, but I do suspect that without them and the related memes, this series would have been quickly sentenced to a well-deserved eternity of obscurity.\\n\\n\r\nI bring this up because this meme-ability represents my other main problem with this series: it tries too hard to be offensive. This is speculation upon my part, but I believe that Eromanga-sensei\u2019s writer knew that his brand of imouto-themed otaku comedies had waning relevance, so he deliberately used these shocking moments as a last ditch effort at increasing publicity for his work. And\u2026 I guess it worked. These moments became memes and the memes became a form of free marketing for the show. I would call it ingenious if it didn\u2019t cause me and countless other hapless weebs to waste five hours of our time watching a terrible anime. To clarify, none of this is to say that I have any inherent problem with Eromanga-sensei\u2019s nature as a offensive show. Being bawdy is an excellent and time-honored way of approaching humor, and Eromanga-sensei\u2026 sometimes does it well. The dick-lover scene is bad, but it\u2019s bad not because there is any inherent problem with twelve-year-olds who love dicks; rather, it fails because it does nothing particularly humorous with this idea. This is the core of the problem: instead of using offensive elements as a means to create humor, these elements are played as though they are intrinsically humorous.\\n\\n\r\nWhat seems oddest about this situation is that the writer occasionally uses bawdy elements to make actual jokes, so it\u2019s clear that he understands how to do this, he just fails to do it most of the time. For instance, compare the dick-lover scene to a later scene in episode twelve where Sagiri tries to draw some good ole hentai but can\u2019t seem to correctly identify the location of the male genitals. This scene is also rather lewd, but it\u2019s much funnier than the dick-lover scene because it manages to go beyond being superficially raunchy and makes a real joke (namely that Sagiri pretends to be experienced about sex but is really laughably na\u00efve). Being the sort of tasteless person I am, I think I would have earnestly enjoyed this series if it were able to keep to the obscene-but-funny standard set by this last scene. Instead, however, Eromanga-sensei\u2019s humor falls as flat as its premise, leaving us with a series that is worthless from almost any viewpoint\u2014a series, in other words, that is not only trashy but trash as well.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I used the phrase \"dick-lover scene\" three times in this review without even meaning to. I feel like that says something about the kind of anime Eromanga-sensei is...",

            "content": "Final Thoughts: This anime is a true garbage pile with no reason for people to watch. Nothing about this show is stand out or is interesting. I would say pass this show if you're looking for a show that is intriguing or fun. If you're looking for a show with awful writing that will make you feel uncomfortable then this is the show for you.\r\nStory: The story is literally OreImo but worse. Which makes a lot of sense considering they are from the same author. This story is nothing but incest and pedophilia which only made me feel uncomfortable and disgusted with myself from watchingthis. The writing is cliche and uncomfortable giving us a lot of moments to joke about how the writing is awful.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: The art and animation was pretty solid coming from A-1 pictures. Though the character designs are pretty generic I like the presentation. The animation was good, but not stand out. The music was forgettable with not many stand out pieces except for the fun OP. The voice actors did a okay job at playing the characters,but nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cast is nothing but cliches we've seen before in other better shows. The shy tsundere little sister, chuunibyou that thinks she's a princess, calm and collected girl, and the dense main lead. The worst part is the other two girls in this ''romantic'' plot are much better then the little sister who literally sexually harasses other people. All characters are genuinely annoying with no real reason to like or root for the cast. \\n\r\n watched this show to simply understand what the buzz was all about, and now I know this show is garbage with nothing to make it different or interesting from other bad ecchi shows.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m not sure how anyone would react when if they ever found out their little sister is a famous artist in the light novel industry but has the penname \u201ceromanga sensei\u201d. This is the story of the step-siblings Sagiri Izumi and Masamune Izumi who are a light novel duo with Sagiri being the artist and Masamune being the writer. It should be noted that the siblings are in love with each other so its basically Oreimo version 2 but this time its legal since they\u2019re not blood related so that means they can get married.\r\nThe anime starts out with the 2 siblings living alone ayear after their parents died. Due to the loss, Sagiri refuses to go to school much less come out of her room and Masamune understands what she\u2019s going through ever since he lost his 1st mom, so he takes care of her by doing the cooking, laundry, and other chores. He doesn\u2019t force her to go to school and all he really wants is for her to go out of her room so he can see her face. Masamune is just a high school student but he is also a semi-famous light novel author that just finished his debut series. The high school kid is the one who brings the bacon.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t take him long to find out that his NEET little sister is also the one who does the ecchi illustrations for his light novel. Chaos ensues and some ecchi remarks were said but the two managed to come to an understanding. While Masamune-sensei tries to create his 2nd publicized series he encounters a more prominent author that becomes an obstacle to his works and later on another author who\u2019s even more famous that tries to destroy his dreams.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it may seem like its about Masamune-sensei\u2019s journey to fame as a light novel author, the anime is actually about how he can have a normal relationship with his sister. Masamune is a good brother, he does what he can to support his sister\u2019s current lifestyle, and is just happy to see her smiling genuinely like when she\u2019s streaming her drawings to her pervy fans. Though he confesses to her that he is genuinely in love with her, he follows up by saying that he wants to be her brother most of all and is just satisfied with that.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of confessions, this romantic comedy shake things up a bit with nearly all of the harem characters confessing to the MC at different points in the anime with one of the confessions being incredibly romantic and actually heavier than a normal confession. The anime is also very perverse with the imouto actually acting like a pervy old man and living up to her penname of eromanga sensei. There was even a character who\u2019s only in middle school, just openly say she loves dicks. I gotta give props though to the level of detail the pantsus have with one of them even having that tag you see in the back with details like size or material used.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also nice to see that there was no problem with copyright issues where we can actually some real titles of light novels like Toradora, Sword Art Online, Shakugan no Shana, and many more. This was probably only the 2nd anime I\u2019ve personally seen that does that (the 1st to my memory is Bakuman). This anime is also probably the closest one that portrays the light novel industry though very lightly. The other ones that portray the industry are Bakuman for manga, Shirobako for anime, New Game! for video game development, and Sore ga Seiyuu! for Voice Acting.\\n\\n\r\nI was also shocked that it took me 11 episodes to realize that the author and illustrator of the source material are the very same ones of Oreimo. It was also great seeing the Oreimo cast make cameo appearances including the Gokou sisters. While I did enjoy Eromanga Sensei, it felt lacking when compared to how I enjoyed Oreimo but it was still enjoyable in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei is a solid anime that\u2019s good just to have some laughs and chill out. I actually found it quite enjoyable. It was pretty good seeing Sagiri slowly coming out of her shell and go out of her comfort zone (her room) and even try to make friends with others. Her transformation to becoming a normal person is a sight to see throughout the anime, though sometimes its out of jealousy for the other girls that interact with her brother and they even had a great backstory episode that really fleshes out the siblings before they became siblings.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

Hitorigoto had this upbeat vibe to it and the first part of the the OP was undeniably cute. The ending also gave off a fast rhythm feeling like I would be able to play 8.17 star maps on osu! again.\r\nNow onto the story.. o damn...\r\nI feel like it wasa bit fast paced because the people who are watching are seeing Sagiri coming out of her room in the 1st or 2nd episode. There was also some perverted ass parts, as where Masamune (is this Masamune-kun no Revenge?) looks at Sagiri's string panties. There's also Elf Yamada, who is a little 14 year old bitch who thinks she is the best in light novel writing and that just made the anime a lot less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also unnecessary parts, like where we saw a close up of Elf's ass...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, the characters are arguably cute, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really want to see another anime like this only because there's FUCKIN cute girls, go watch cancerous anime like Oriemo or start reading shounen manga and watching shounen anime as well. Shoujo, Harem, or Ecchi are not my strong suites, so I'm unfamiliar with these kinds of light novel horror adaptations. I only have info on shounen ai and yaoi.",

I think it's so cool that at a young age he was able to write novels, his sister draw illustrations, and meet strict deadlines.\r\nAlso the fact that they lived under the same roof but didn't know that they were working together is really funny and creative. \r\nThere have been a lot of negative reviews on this, but they were probably all written by people who have no appreciation for this sort of humor and how hard it is to write light novels, overcominghikikomori tendencies, and deep appreciation of the otaku culture. (really boring people tbh)\\n\\n\r\nFirst off--this was written by the same person (tsukasa fushimi )who made Ore no imouto ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai...so you have to understand the genre to appreciate it, living with a sister who likes ero stuff, and having an awkward relationship.The brother in this is more similar-minded (likes otaku culture from the start) and the sister is shy but still has tsundere attributes. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people complained that a 12 year old was joking about chinchin and probably most people who reviewed this dropped it at the 2nd episode...\\n\r\nEven 5 year olds will say the word chinchin to joke around in Japan, so what if the author made a 12 year old say that she likes chinchin. It's nothing to get offended about. I've personally met 12 year olds that were doing it when I was in middle school...and it's true for Japan too.. I'm sure it was just a joke though. \\n\r\nThere are similar jokes in ore no imouto as well (maybe slightly different but indeed shimoneta (sexual joke) \\n\r\nIt fits with the genre, the characters are working on ero stuff...it wouldn't make sense for them to all be boring and never use shimoneta. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes awkward but funny situations, young brilliant people (I think they are pretty amazing to get famous at their age),likes hikikomori, wants to understand Japanese shimoneta more or otaku culture.wants to see some more slice of life elements than say a fighting anime or something in a fantasy world.\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to those who watch anime very casually or do not get a kick out of this kind of genre/dislikes shimoneta.

The stuffiest fustian of verbose Victorian vapidity I trudged through in high school pressed less distressingly on my attention span.  The most deranged demonstration of depravity and the most grotesque glorification of gore unstomached by Takashi Miike would feel less inimical to my sense of basic human decency.  The most flagrantly fetid farce of a one-man basement black metal demo exudes more respect for its medium and a more professional grasp of its own capabilities.  No first-year art student on a deconstructive Dadaist bender could alchemically assemble something so calculated and hateful in its diametrical opposition to the very concept of artistic quality.  Had Caligula, Gilles de Rais, and Albert Fish spent a weekend torturing their way through the red light districts of Sodom and then hired Zhu Yu and Eli Roth to document their exploits with a soundtrack from GG Allin, the resulting film would have been less overt in its moral repugnance than Eromanga Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the studio that muddled through Sword Art Online and the author who inexplicably kept paper and pen together long enough to write Oreimo comes an abominable affair of misery, woe, incest, sexual misconduct, and insulting levels of inanity and incompetence.  This is a pathetic and pedophilic tragedy, an akratic assault on thousands of years of ethical development, the medium of animation, and the intellect, conscience, and aesthetic sensibilities of any viewer possessing the mental capacity to open up Crunchyroll and run a search for \u201cEromanga Sensei.\u201d  Talents such as Yui Ishikawa and ClariS were wasted on this show as a Stradivarius would be wasted on Kotomi Ichinose; talents never showed up to fill most of the other important roles.  Aside from that catchy OP and the solid ED, there is nothing redeeming about this show.  Not one clever bit of directing, not one unexpected gag that lands, not one moving swell of emotion; even the fan service is completely incompetent, and thank goodness for that.\\n\\n\r\nForced memes, forced drama, forced humor, and characters forced into uncomfortable encounters of a sexual nature (either by the script or by each other).  A setting completely devoid of respect for the physical constraints that surround productivity in writing, publishing, and selling.  Supposedly god-tier erotic art that bears more resemblance to perfectly average light novel insert pages.  Shallow characters, shallow conflicts, shallow backgrounds, and shallow...  themes?  Are there any?  Hollow and glib misrepresentations of the life of a hikikomori so off the mark that the premise gets bungled before you can say, \u201cThis looks like trauma-induced agoraphobia and she should probably see a doctor.\u201d  A protagonist so milquetoast and devoid of personality that he makes the standard harem anime hero look like the singular and nuanced love child of Charles Foster Kane and Motoko Kusanagi.  Relationships so unhealthy, manipulative, and downright abusive that 50 Shades of Grey looks like the world's greatest G-rated romantic comedy by comparison.  This show is a cesspit of anime tropes reduced to their basest, least interesting, and most offensive levels.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that you have seen enough anime to understand what Eromanga Sensei is doing; after all, the harem structure, brother/sister complex, and the sexualization of underage characters are hardly uncharted territory for anime.  Frankly, the most standard and innocuous elements of Eromanga Sensei are already in themselves lazy tropes that we shouldn't have to tolerate in our entertainment, but the things that this show does it does almost exclusively worse than anyone else.  The way these characters act is only ever monumentally stupid or completely inappropriate for normal, functioning humans or both.\\n\\n\r\nI close by recalling the immortal interjection with which T.E. Lawrence opened The Mint:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGod, this is awful.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "You know those kind of animes where the quality of the anime is directly proportional to the screentime that one character gets?\r\nyeah me too\r\nAnyways, Eromanga Sensei is that kind of anime. It has its moments, but I just thought of it as another Oreimo with an illegal loli as the main \"love\" interest.\r\nStory: Story? There wasn't much. I mean, it did try to focus on Masamune improving his relationship with his shut-in sister, but he accomplished that pretty quickly. After that, he was trying to create novels that would do well. Storywise, Eromanga Sensei is basic, with enough plot to pass as a normal SoLanime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Eromanga Sensei is alright. Nothing really stuck out to me, except maybe the lewd scenes. Those always stick out, though. The animation in this anime is a bit choppy at some points, but I've been through worse. However, I did enjoy the animation during the \"camp\" part. And speaking of that part, it's also the best part in the anime, and the part with the least amount of screentime from Sagiri! Such a coincidence!\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting in this anime is actually one of the better parts of the anime. The voice actors did a nice job, in my opinion, of bringing out the \"characters\". I'll explain why that's in quotes later. Other than the VA, the opening and ending fits the anime well. The ending fits especially, since the upbeat song fits nicely with the mood and style of Eromanga Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this anime are kind of shallow. Masamune just comes out to be another Kyousuke, with the added element of him being an author. Sagiri, on the other hand, really doesn't have much character aside from the shy younger sister who draws lewd art better than I ever could, and is a bit of a closet pervert. The only person that I felt was a good character was best girl Elf. Just don't say I'm picking favourites.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although underwhelming in half the categories that I described, I still enjoyed this throughout the 12 episode series. It's slightly stupid, which my \"fun\" side enjoys, and has its moments where it deals with completely different topics, as seen in the camp episodes when Elf and Masamune have a moment together. So, in my opinion, Eromanga Sensei wasn't particularly great, but it also wasn't bad. If you can watch an anime more for the jokes and randomness, but also are fine with a slight bit of romance in the middle (particularly with Masamune x Elf), I'd say that you could go for it. \\n\\n\r\n(edit: animation probably smooth, but my wifi sucks)",

            "content": "I have no moral gripe with this series, i'd like to get that out of the way. A series can still flourish with all sorts of controversy such as Loli and Incest, Monogatari is one of my favorite shows. But this show is completely filled with abhorrent (((QUALITY))) animation, cringy reused tropes, episodes with no plot progression, lazy writing and more. One of my major problems with it is that the fan service scenarios are so unbelievable that it breaks your immersion. This could be solved if it were a self aware comedy but the most humor you'll get out of these scenarios is \"xdshe isnt wearing panties\". Almost every girl in the series that loves Masamune (almost all of them) has nearly no reason to and makes every confession look out of place and forced. I have watched my fair share of Harem and Ecchi but this series laughs at their attempts to create unjustified love for the main character. The fanservice in this series isn't limited to sexual imagery, the fan service comes in the form of watching Mary Sue 12 year old billionaires fall in love with the main character for NO reason so the watcher can project their pathetic life onto the main character and feel that one day it may happen to them. My MAL rating of a 4 is almost completely based on my enjoyment due to the cringe and shock of watching this series. This series is terrible but I would still watch it again just to see how trash a story can become. The only redeemable quality besides that is the studio's ability to put in Screenshottable and Gifable moments into the series. If I was judging this series based on that it would probably be the best one i've ever seen. Their voice acting was also pretty decent and the OP/ED were well done. If you've read this far, thanks for reading the ramblings of some teenager on the internet.",

            "content": "Ok, so another incest themed anime has just ended, so what gives about my thought about this 12 episode anime? Here's my ratings:\r\nMediocre 5, Story:\r\nThe story was pretty much a spin off of Oreimo, considering that they both have one creator, Tsukasa Fushimi and one original illustrator, Hiro Kanzaki, in all aspects the anime's creator as usual rely on the usual incest kind of relationship, where the guy goes for his sister in a sort of way, but doesn't make any attempts to go for the others girls, wouldn't be surprise that for Tsukasa Fushimi's next piece would still be in this kind of genreor nearly.\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5, Art:\\n\\n\r\nWell there is nothing much for me to say around here, since illustrator Hiro Kanzaki can't seem to go for the ecchi all the way, in fact the only panchira we see was in ep 11 with Sagiri, but it wasn't much since she's in a swim suit.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, sound: \\n\\n\r\nOk, I really love the inflection of the seiyuu who did Sagiri's voice, and so as the seiyuu who did Yamada Elf's voice, they have the right intonation and enunciation with their emotional responses, but I really hate that Masamune's seiyuu sounded like a 30 year old than a young man, in fact his voice would have been better off being done by Kaji Yuki, since he still maintains that boyish tone.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Character:\\n\\n\r\nI basically have some mixed emotions about the character personalities, around here, cu'z of the fact that the main characters themselves were pretty much a complicated double standard , Like Masamune, whom we can't tell if he has some siscon with Sagiri or just being a caring brother, the point is that he takes care of Sagiri as if he is spoiler her like a queen and yet he makes no attempts to get him out of the outside world.....as if he is encouraging that Sagiri stay's that way, also he keeps denying that he has no siscon.......to say the least, but he also makes no attempts, to get into a relationship neither with Elf or with Muramasa for that matter. Now Sagiri is also a complicated character at one point she disses her brother for thinking that he has some lewd thoughts about her, but she seems to like it anyways, also how the two came to be as step siblings was not disclose, we can't tell if both parents of both parties were still living or is only one of them still around. Now about the other girls like Elf, Muramasa, Megumi and Tomoe, they were pretty straight forward and I like that, but, alas, we probably would never see any relationship develop outside of Masamune X Sagiri arc.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIMAO, they should have just ended at episode 11, since the 12 episode was a bummer, the only consolation was seeing Elf and Muramasa in their bikini bodies.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nIt does have a funny side to say the least, but it still was a bit annoying when them Aniplex guys can't seem to go much with the fanservices , so at one point you may laugh , but it get's dampen with the last episode, so I hope they don't think about making another season.\\n\\n\r\nBOOM!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "Edited 6/24/17 after seeing Ep. 12\r\nThe reason I'm picking this seemingly generic anime as my first review is because it generates exceeding amounts of controversy and controversy is fun. Most reviews of this show lie within the binary of \"literally the worst garbage I've ever seen\" and \"pretty good because cute girls\" and most of the remaining reviews cite moral arguments against the ages of the characters. While none of these opinions are blatantly wrong, there is merit in sometimes having middling opinions so that not every anime discussion devolves into a SAO war, AoT war, or US presidential election. \r\nSo what is this middlingopinion I have on Eromanga-sensei? It sucks. By \"sucks\" I don't mean the kind of suck that generic self-insert self-validation fantasy LN adaptations bring to the table, instead it comes close to being downright terrible. Yet I found enough enjoyment in this anime to marathon it and not for the expected reason of laughing at a trainwreck. There was something genuinely enjoyable about this show but I'll get to that later. As for the\\n\\n\r\nStory (2/10):\\n\\n\r\n, the most noticeable problem with it is that everything about it is so mind-bogglingly contrived that it's just not possible to achieve the suspension of disbelief needed to self-insert as the generic male LN protagonist. Though I have to credit them slightly for making the protagonist earn his position by having him be a workaholic instead of some underappreciated genius with overpowered abilities, it's his surroundings that are messed up. The MC's 12 year old adoptive sister Sagiri happens to be a professional-level artist who he happened to meet over the Internet a few years prior and she happened to like his stories despite no connections back then, both of their sets of parents happened to die near the same time, she happens to be a NEET who finds the act of walking inside her own house debilitating, she also happens to be incredibly lewd for her age. And that's just the contrivances for one character. Other characters include a girl who happens to be living next door after finding out they are rivals and a girl who happens to obsessively love the MC's writing despite being incredibly successful. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these contrivances exist to create the \"ideal\" OTP imouto character and to throw in a harem at the same time, but these ideas cannot coexist and trying to find the best of both worlds will lead to inevitable failure, a mistake made by the trainwreck that is Oreimo S2. A-1 Pictures clearly did not learn their lesson as Eromanga-sensei fails in a similar fashion. An example of Eromanga butchering its writing to rake in the easy harem bucks while keeping the main couple intact is the beach arc. The arc itself is awful in the first place and shouldn't exist; nothing gets done and the fanservice is somehow *lacking* compared to the rest of the show despite beach episodes being a prime opportunity to show half naked girls. But the main problem is the inconsistency in Sagiri's character in order to make this arc even happen. Why the hell would a bossy, possessive, and needy girl like Sagiri be okay and even excited with the brother she's madly in love with being taken by two chicks he wants to bone to the wet, steamy island of Letsfuckallnight? The anime makes a lamebrained excuse of a bribe or some shit but it's still incredibly out of character. Other excuses to maintain the harem include Sagiri refusing to confess when the MC repeatedly tells her he loves her romantically (a rare occurrence in these things) and the MC being the usual LN/harem dimwit when it comes to romance and ignoring obvious hints. By the end of episode 4 you will probably be mildly to incredibly pissed off and find yourself telling them to just fuck already.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of LNs, I find it bothersome that Eromanga-sensei pats itself in the back by following every LN trend and referencing other LNs while there are no attempts to subvert tropes, create self-deprecating jokes, or have the characters discuss ways to improve the medium in a meaningful way despite the series being about writing LNs. But let's be honest, this series isn't about writing LNs so much as it is about wanting to bone your sister, so it's time to move on to the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read my name, it's clear that this show is so deep in my strike zone that I'd need a blindfold to not hit a home run. Unfortunately, Eromanga-sensei is at least one and a half eyepatches and my bat is more like a melted popsicle. While Sagiri posing at various angles to draw her own lewd pictures at different perspective makes sense, just about everything else doesn't. Shots of Sagiri's wiggling ass during scenes of normal conversation throw the entire mood off for the viewer. Why does Sagiri want to take pantyshots of literally every girl she meets when there are plenty of generic pantyshots online? Why does she put on her swimsuit in an unrelated episode and not the beach episode when she's clearly been shown to follow the yukata costumes during that event? And while I said I'd avoid moralfagging, why is there naked fanservice of Sagiri in an elementary school flashback? I say this because episode 11 in its entirety was a mess; it hypes the viewer up for Akihabara then spends 15 minutes laboriously detailing their past circumstance with a story that could have been explained in 5. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, while I admit to chuckling about once or twice per episode, it isn't particularly funny for something with Comedy in its genres. Then again, nearly everything has Comedy thrown in its genres for some reason so it gets a pass. Also the repetition of the same joke (door slamming in MC's face, Sagiri saying she doesn't know anyone named Eromanga-sensei) is done shamelessly and with no variation so seeing them in the later episodes was irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: All those things said, it seems like they spent half the budget in the final episode; despite it being entirely a fanservice slice of life episode where Sagiri gets exposed to hentai and turns into a full-on perv, it had nearly all the comedic moments of the show that were actually funny. There was even a bit more character development for Sagiri in a few ways. Though there's no conclusive ending which will piss off shippers, it probably means a second season, whether that's a good thing or not. But this is exactly the kind of finale this season needed after unnecessary melodrama in the last ep.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point I've continuously been bitching about the flaws of Eromanga-sensei despite promising a middling review so where are the good points? In the Art and Character sections.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are noticeable budget cuts with still/cheap frames being scattered throughout the show, it does a decent job keeping itself looking consistent with its cutesy Oreimo style. The main selling point of this series is its character design, with female characters who are visually memorable and outfits which look great and are consistent with the (lack of) character each of these girls have. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nNo real flaws, forgettable ED, great decision in getting ClariS back from Oreimo because the OP is pretty damn catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nAn easy comparison for these characters is the cast of Oreimo, since the premise and structure are so similar. And to put it lightly, every character is noticeably worse than their Oreimo counterpart. That said, I'm still giving this show's characters a higher rating than Oreimo's because Kirino is the shittiest, most nightmarish cunt ever devised in any medium and Sagiri is just kind of boring.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the mob kills me, let me explain. Sagiri along with her previously mentioned contrivances is a mashup of every trait a lolicon would find cute that goes nowhere because she has her NEET status to fall back on. It's like adding lobster and caviar to tomato soup; it doesn't change anything because the base of tomato paste is overpowering. Her NEET status is used as an excuse to make her shy and her shyness is used as an excuse to keep the plot moving like a go-kart on a highway. The start of the series is noticeably slow because nothing meaningful happens in MC-Sagiri interactions, only ass shots and the occasional tsundere slap. She is admittedly the *one* character who gets character development in slowly growing out of her shut-in phase, though the reason for her being a shut-in (parents' death) and how it traumatizes her is never explored and she seems to get along fine in that regard. The only motivation she seems to have for anything is the MC's dick.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune, the MC, isn't any better. His best selling point is that he puts in the damn work to make his dreams a reality unlike the many trailer trash LN protags who are overpowered prodigies. Besides that, he's the generic bumbling idiot when it comes to girls, he has no likable traits other than being a hard worker, and there is a distinct lack of development or internal monologue when he himself presents the moral dilemma of wanting to bang his little sister, but needing to act as an adult figure. Instead he seems to instantly shift gears with no acknowledgement from the story that this problem even exists.\\n\\n\r\nSenju is Kuroneko minus everything that made Kuroneko good. She tries to clone the \"shy badass\" appeal but the badass part rarely comes out and at all the wrong times. Her (second) confession to Masamune is not only pointless, but the exact opposite of badass because wanting to quit writing after accomplishing her goal is both weak and stupid. There is also zero explanation of her writing style besides \"wow shes rly good lol\" when there are bandages on her hand and her whole backstory is about seeing Masamune's writing and being so inspired by it that she wrote her own stuff. Huge missed opportunity there.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi was one of two characters (three counting the MC's boss) who actually moved the story along, and while she was characterized as an annoying normie at first, she started to get engrossed in LNs and had a budding relationship with Sagiri that was potentially interesting. And then she vanished from the story entirely because harem! She could've actually gone somewhere and yet Eromanga-sensei refuses because it can't write character development for shit.\\n\\n\r\nShidou is a walking gay joke and the librarian girl is cute and obsessed with LNs. Not much else to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nElf is said to be the most inconsistent character in this series. Yet this inconsistency is the show's saving grace, as she is one of very few things that actually get the story moving in some meaningful direction. The inconsistencies aren't even annoying like Sagiri's because real people are not coherent characters in nature. They can be immature brats in one second and wise in the next; they can be lazy and fun-seeking while simultaneously wanting to be productive. These are all characteristics of Elf and they all fit in the persona of a hyperactive, hormonal teenager. The characteristics are all used to their best extent (relative to what Eromanga-sensei can manage) to create someone who I would realistically want to hang out with if I can look past her air of childish overconfidence. It's no wonder that Masamune ditched his dick's wet dream so he could crack open a cold one with Elf and chill for long enough that it got the plot ball moving. Eromanga-sensei managed to write *one* character who is both beneficial to the plot and has a cute personality that isn't just \"tappable loli ass\", a rare feat for the show. That's why Elf is least bad girl. (I'd say best girl but that's an honor for shows that are at least decent..)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nHoly shit this is getting long. Start was slow and boring. Picked up in the middle then got boring again. Then got even more boring after the story promised otherwise. Entertaining last episode. +2 for hot loli asses. -1 for way too many hot loli asses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show if you want to sexualize lolis, were a huge fan of Oreimo, or think Sagiri is the cutest thing ever. Otherwise all the memes and gifs are already in anime communities everywhere and you can get a good idea of what to expect from those.\\n\\n\\n",

Unlike most animes that have a fighting plot this one is a more casual everyday life anime which makes it understandable and easier to know what is happening. It's perfect for younger and older audiences since both audiences can be well entertained so I would highly recommend this anime to anyone wanting to watch a great anime. Now the manga I haven't tried yet so I will betrying it very soon but I'm sure it's just as good as the anime so I would recommend if you do want to watch this anime I would suggest reading the manga first so it would make more sense but you don't *have* to read the manga first just a suggestion but I'm sure you will enjoy this anime happy watching.",

I mean I like the idea of it, but it does take shape of many other romance stories in anime I have seen before. But I do think it's unique in its own right, but what I think is the problem is that it needs unique things and twists to really make it a compelling story (Keep in mind this is my opinion).\r\nSound\r\nI think the sound/ost is alright,I mean it does not differ that much from other animes, but that is not meant to be negative in any way at all. The sound/ost blends in fine with the anime, but what I think it lacks is something outstanding music, for example like the game Life is Strange, where they really make the music and actions intertwined.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNow I don't think the characters is bad in any way, but I also don't feel they are that unique before. One could argue the sister is very, unique in the way she acts, but I personally don't think it's that interesting. Overall the characters are fine but could get more in depth and unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is where people might criticize me harshly, but I think the best about this anime is how enjoyable it is. I think it's not interesting, but it's like what family guy is for me. It's a show you can watch and relax looking it. Not necessarily the most compelling, but very enjoyable in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI decided to give it 9 out of 10 and you can see the reasons provided above.",

            "content": "I had no intention of watching Eromanga-sensei. When it first aired, I saw the fan reaction, which was largely mixed but clearly indicated it wasn't for me. While I enjoyed the first season of Oreimo, the second season and the OVAs turned into a form of quicksand that sucked vulnerable viewers into bad writing and a bad ending. (There's a good reason why there are multiple GIFs of people destroying their computers/TVs after finishing Oreimo.)\r\nNot wanting to put myself through anything close to that, I put it on my \"to never watch\" list. However, upon joining the MAL Discord, I found a regular user whocontinuously brought up Sagiri as the best anime girl and Eromanga-sensei as one of the greatest anime of all time. It didn't matter what we were talking about\u2014Sagiri ended up in the conversation. As such, I became curious about Eromanga-sensei - maybe even if it's trash, it could actually have a decent story/be a guilty pleasure like, say, Citrus?\\n\\n\r\nI made the proposal on Discord: \"50 reacts and I'll watch Eromanga-sensei.\" I got those 50 reacts pretty fast, and I'm a man of my word. As such, I watched the story of Eromanga-sensei unfold over a long weekend.\\n\\n\r\nI want my long weekend back.\\n\\n\r\nRather than be a humorous guilty pleasure, Eromanga-sensei is a cheap imitation of what already wasn't great to begin with, with a bit more of a smut push stretching MAL's \"PG-13\" rating as far as it will go. (Even still, I'm pretty sure no parent would want their thirteen-year-old watching this.) Eromanga-sensei isn't even the Great Value version of Oreimo; it's the Always Save version of Oreimo. That bright yellow logo always assures you're in for a cheap disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nA good place to start breaking down what exactly makes this series so bad would be the characters. After all, characters can really make or break a story, rather the premise is fantastic or not that exciting. (Why do you think so many people watched a series about girls in a high school music club who more often than not end up not practicing and eating cake?) Eromanga-sensei has a bland male protagonist who for reasons of plot has fallen madly in love with his ear-grating, bipolar wench of a sister. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the entirety of Eromanga-sensei, I couldn't figure out what the true purpose of Sagiri was. Was she a self-insert character for hikikomori who fantasize about lolis? Are some people so into little sisters they'll take even the most insufferable little sister imaginable? Or is this series self-aware of how bad Sagiri is and rubbing it in our faces? \"Screw you, we don't even have to try, we'll make money selling otaku this garbage.\"\\n\\n\r\nSagiri and her brother aren't the only characters in this series. In fact, her brother builds himself a bit of a harem. However, this series has completely stripped any sort of fun out of the harem genre by making it obvious who's going to win just by the camera angles. No other girl gets as much attention from the camera as Sagiri. She's shot like a model for an especially skeevy company that's convinced her she's going to be a star as they take intimate photos of her naughty bits. \\n\\n\r\nThe best characters\u2014a bookshop worker who defends LNs with all her heart and Elf Yamada-sensei's brother\u2014are sadly minor characters. I did appreciate how Elf Yamada-sensei grew less annoying from her introduction and became the character I was rooting for...unfortunately, things obviously aren't going to go my (or her) way if a season 2 ever occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe show suffers from a ridiculous plot hole in that Sagiri bares her legs, clearly feminine figure, and her voice to her livestream in the very first episode, yet there are still people in her chat calling her \"old man\" for the rest of the series. There's no way a leak like that wouldn't be all over the Internet. Within 24 hours, someone would have been able to identify who the true Eromanga-sensei was. This may be a minor thing, but it pissed me off and affected several aspects of the series. \"Oh, who is this Eromanga-sensei?\" Well, that should be obvious!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you can enjoy a can of Always Save pork and beans for dinner, maybe you have the bar set low enough to enjoy Eromanga-sensei. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",

            "content": "This is honestly one of the most boring shows of the season. Just by  watching the first 4 episodes, I think it's safe to say that this is shit for these reasons.\r\nFirst of all, the characters are fucking boring. The male MC does practically nothing to make us like him and is basically just there for the male MC position. He's so empty that you can literally self insert yourself as him and imagine a 12 year old girl wanting your D. Okay that came off too much but seriously. What's the point of this dude? I mean he doesn't do anything entirely badbut that's what makes him bad. Because he doesn't do jack shit. He also sometimes annoys me whenever he talks like he's a siscon which in fact he is. Well that's just great. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the female MC. She's just as boring as the male MC. Yes. If you were going to watch this for her (which I expect 99% of people have done) then expect to be severely disappointed unless you like 12 year old girls crushing on a dude who's her brother. Oh wait. No, they're not \"blood related\". We'll talk about that bullshit later. \\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, this character is like Emilia, the waifu you've always wanted, except she's your sister. If you want a sister having a romantic interest in you then congrats because the male MC is a freaking self-insert. Like, this girl is so dull. What makes it worse is that she's a tsundere. Sometimes, she seems to love her brother then the next day she doesn't. She's so annoying. The only distinguishable and decent aspect about her is that her character design's pretty cute and I can unfortunately relate to her at times but a great character design for a character who's that uninteresting doesn't seem worth it. Another thing to add is that whenever there's fanservice about her, it never fails to make me feel uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, lets get back to the \"not blood related part\". So what happens is that the siblings are not blood related. Wow. What an excuse for the impending romance between the 2. Seriously, did the creators just put that in just so the anime (or the light novel for this matter) would not seem wrong? Because that's what it looks like to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I hated was the fact that this anime seemed like it took no effort to make. Don't get me wrong, i'm pretty sure the cost for animation is extremely high and probably more than what i'll ever get in life especially due to the fact this is A-1 Pictures for god sake but the main thing that was supposed to entertain me ended up with me wanting to go look at a tree for 10 minutes straight and that would still be more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back, I found out that this anime is tagged as \"comedy\" but in no way did it make me laugh. All the times I did laugh was me forcing myself to laugh at what's supposed to be funny. Yes, I actually do that and it actually works. Not for this one though.\\n\\n\r\nI also found out the same creator who made OreImo is making this. So lets compare the 2. Although I haven't watched OreImo (forgive me), I would say from peoples comments about it that it still had a reasonably good plot and likable characters. And it actually had a PURPOSE. Eromanga Sensei, on the other hand, just looks like a 2.0 rip off version with a younger and cuter girl. Guess what that's for? Attracting more people and getting that cash.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I actually thought the art was really beautiful and nice. The OP was also pretty catchy and made me break into a smile.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this seemed more of a rant than an actual review and i'm extremely sorry but I just wanted to vent my anger that I actually wasted my time watching this. I'm not gonna drop EroManga yet because i'm somewhat of a completionist but when I get the chance to do it, i'm probably going to hate myself (not that I don't already). Obviously, there's still a chance for Eromanga to redeem itself and if that ever happens then i'll definitely take a look and see. If you're a fan of EroManga Sensei, then I won't get mad at you or anything and i'm not trying to insult anyone so once again, i'm sorry. But it is what it is, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Overall score was previously a 3 but I felt that was too harsh as I gave the art and sound a 7 and 6. So now it's a 4/10. Lucky you, Eromanga Sensei",

Shenanigans happen and he ends up meeting new authors who happen to be girls and high-level writers!

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers \r\nFirst impressions, so I didn't really now what to expect,\r\nThis being written by the some person who did Oreimo.\r\nI didn't have the most high of standards for this.\r\nBased on the premise I expected it to be more incest baity.\r\nWhich don't get me wrong it still is,\r\nIt just less incest baity than it's predecessor.\r\nBut that isn't exactly saying much,\r\nWhen take into account the whole  step brother and sister making erotic story's thing.\r\nStory, 5/10\r\nSo in latest incest bait of the season.\r\nAre story begins with Main character masamune  a high school student,\r\nwho is above average erotic  light novel writter.\r\nWhowrites not just As a hobby but also to take care of his step sister sagiri who is a hikikomori.\\n\r\nBut things  are not looking great for masamune as he is currently in the middle of  writers  block.\\n\r\nWhich is preventing him from coming up with the next flaptastic  idea for a light novel.\\n\r\nBut not all things are grim as masamune mysterious illustrator ero manga sensei still stands by him even though they never met before.\\n\r\nOne day he decides to watch a live stream done by ero manga sensei for the first time ever. \\n\r\nOnly to find out that ero manga sensei is actually his step sister.\\n\r\nSo after he goes up to  her room to confirm it.\\n\r\nThe two decide to work together more closely in order to make a great light novel series, Which  I expect more than  just creative juices flowing I order to make it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo the storyline line is pretty much them working together as a team.\\n\r\nTo make the next big hit in the light novel world.\\n\\n\r\nat first glance it looks like a very vanilla, copy and paste ,seen it done before multiple times  kind of story.\\n\r\nWhich don't get me wrong it is exactly  as i described.\\n\r\nBecause a story about two siblings who where kind of distance from each other and then they slowly start developing a closer bond with one another though a hobby or etc.\\n\r\nIs not original or thought provoking in the slightest.\\n\r\nIn fact I can list off at lest 10 shows I have seen with a similar concept.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if I am being completely honest I don't think that this show as the ability or writing behind it to push it beyond  a vanilla story, at lest for me.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it doesn't have the maturity like for example koi kaze dose or the sexualized over the top nature like kissxsis dose.\\n\r\nIt pretty much dips it toes in the water with out making much a splash.\\n\\n\r\nWhich on the plus or negative  side Depending on your preference.\\n\r\nwe probably won't get a incest is wincest ending,\\n\r\nWhich I couldn't care less about if  they go down that route or not.\\n\r\nBut being a brain child from the person who oreimo, I won't hold my breath.\\n\r\nIf they do.\\n\r\nBut enough an there relationship together we will dive into later.\\n\\n\r\nI think the whole light novel industry backdrop is interesting and it cool the see some of the work that goes behind making light novels.\\n\r\nKinda like bakuman  except in this context it was  for manga.\\n\r\nBut unlike bakuman which did some  sort of a criticism on the manga industry,\\n\r\nEro manga sensei doesn't want to even though it could.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact it kinda praises it a bit to much, Which I feel is a little dishonest.\\n\r\nConsidering some of the Shade that happens from  time to time.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know I kinda Been bitching  about what this story could have been instead of talking about what it is and how dose it fair with others of it kind.\\n\r\nAnd for what it is its very average.\\n\r\nSo it's a vanilla show,\\n\r\nthe whole brother and sister team making a light novel together  is cute and slightly endearing. \\n\r\nAnd a whole lot better to watch than Oreimo sibling duo being assholes to One another. Because that shit becomes a boring  very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's not exactly braking any new ground in any way,\\n\r\nBut at the same time it's not done in a way where my critic  side would rip it to sunder and send it to review hell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think my positives story wise is that.\\n\r\nIt's simple and straightforward, and it honest with what it is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also pretty tame fan service wise,\\n\r\nWell tame for me I guess because from what I have heard though the grapevine that some people think the fan service is a little to much.\\n\\n\r\nBut for me personally watching the likes of high school dxd and hentai has pretty much made me mostly immune to most levels of  fan service to the point it's doesn't seem the phase me much any more.\\n\r\nSo take the fan service thing with a grain of salt.\\n\r\nIt's a positive and a negative for me.\\n\r\nBut this is just word to the wise.\\n\\n\r\nBut the big negative I have with the story is that it has elements that could make it a little better,\\n\r\nIf it wanted to use them.\\n\r\nIt's one of those cases where a show on it own it fine but has ideas and elements that could make it a whole lot better than it already is.\\n\r\nWhich is the main  problem I have  with quite a few slice of life series in general.\\n\\n\r\nMost slice of life series on paper have some interesting ideas ,\\n\r\nbut in practice  is very lack laster at best.\\n\\n\r\nBecause most of the time they relay on the common tropes for there plot beat. instead of going outside the box a little.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo Eromamga sensei for me is It's like meat lovers pizza but it forgot the meat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMain character masamune is very cookie cutter personality wise,\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a personality there.\\n\r\nFrom what I seen he seems like a normal high schooler who has a passion for writing light novels.\\n\r\nhis passion for light novels gives him a little depth, but he still cardboard cutout character who I have seen many times before.\\n\r\nBut he's a lot better than the main character from oreimo I say the lest.\\n\r\nWhich isn't really saying much, but when it comes to basic characters like him there not much to work with.\\n\\n\r\nHis step sister sagiri is a lot better than I thought she would be,\\n\r\nPersonally wise she just the shy girl who stays inside way to much for her own good.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is something I have seen meay times before, so I wasn't exactly hyped for her character type.\\n\\n\r\nBut I thought her whole ero manga sensei was slightly interesting.\\n\r\nBecause at first look you wouldn't exactly picture her as a person who would be involved in ecchi and hentai related things.\\n\r\nIt's funny to see this shy girl drew erotic art work.\\n\r\nAnd I find that  difference between her real life and online life really interesting and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nBecause everyone has a online and real life persona that are slightly different form each other and i think that pretty relatable especially for the younger generations who are online quite a bit and have these online personas.\\n\r\nWhich I am just a sucker for.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I talk about the side characters, \\n\r\nI would like to mention that the relationship between masamune and sagiri is way better than the relationship in oreimo,\\n\r\nBecause there actually good reasons for why  masamune actually give a shit or care about his step sister. \\n\r\nUnlike in oreimo where they just  live  together  and they slightly share common interests and for most part have this love/hate relationship and the main character just gets involved in shit because he has nothing else better to do.\\n\\n\r\nBut in Eromamga for example,\\n\r\nMain character parents are dead so he doesn't have much of family except his step sister.\\n\r\nSome one needs to pay those bills and they  share a common interest together.\\n\\n\r\nSo they have a better reason to have this closer relationship together and it actually has a objective which is to make light novels together.\\n\r\nUnlike oreimo which was mostly episodic crap.\\n\\n\r\nSo side character are also kinda cookie cutter was well.\\n\r\nThere also cardboard cutouts as well.\\n\r\nBut there not as bland as I expected them to be.\\n\r\nThey have some slight quirks  about them which makes them stand out a bit more,\\n\r\nBut it still feels very one note.\\n\r\nLike for example there a girl who dresses up like a elf and plays piano naked and another girl who's in middle school who likes dick or something along those lines.\\n\r\nIf you take away those quirks they become the usual tsudare and genki girl.\\n\\n\r\nOne character that slightly broke this mold was another character who writes light novels like are main character dose,\\n\r\nExcept she more extreme  in her passion of reading and writing than are main character is.\\n\r\nIn fact when they first meet she kinda comes off like she hates the main character guts and they kind of come into conflict.\\n\r\nBut it turns out she like a super fan of the main character light novel series and wishes it would continue.\\n\r\nBecause it was a book series that she enjoyed to her very core.\\n\\n\r\nI thought that was interesting,\\n\r\nIt didn't last for long though and it didn't have much build up.\\n\r\nBut I thought it was nice to have this.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I want to meanion that some of the characters seem a little to innocent especially those who are involved in erotic shit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation  is alright it's very smooth and well polished.\\n\r\nBackgrounds are Average at best, some scenes they look like they been painted on. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork looks good, lots of pretty colors which I liked.\\n\r\nBecause it not in your face about it.\\n\r\nEven though in some scene it was a little to bright.\\n\r\nThey could tone down on the color filters a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is generic light novel shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are fine.\\n\\n\r\nThere less sexualized than I thought they would be,\\n\r\nBut it would just be that the person who did these character designs hasn't got much of an idea for erotic art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound,6/10\\n\\n\r\nShockingly I actually like both the opening and ending song,\\n\r\nThere very happy go lucky tunes.\\n\r\nWhich go well with the show and I enjoy listening to them.\\n\r\nBut there not music that I would look for or download on my computer to listen to them bye themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSadly there not much of an ost.\\n\r\nIn fact the ost is the opting and ending sougs.\\n\\n\r\nSo probably not worth mentioning who did it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for sub  was fine for the most part.\\n\r\nDon't have anything positive or negative to say about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the whole idea behind it and some of the characters are slightly funny.\\n\r\nAnd some scenes made me lol a bit.\\n\r\nBut it didn't really go beyond just a time passer for me.\\n\\n\r\nI will probably forget it in a week after finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that all she wrote.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked oreimo you will probably like this.\\n\r\nBecause it pretty similar to it in almost every way except it isn't trying to go for the lets  Not label  all otaku culture as a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nAny well experienced anime fan will probably forget it in a week,\\n\r\nBecause at the end of the day it isn't do much that hasn't been done before.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, \r\nSome people like to expect way too much from simple unambitious shows like Eromanga-sensei.\r\nI think every anime should be judged by it's quality but also by it's genre. Eromanga-sensei is a Romantic dramatic comedy anime with fan service. \r\nIt's the story of Masamune Izumi and his little sister, they have both been living together in their house ever since their parents passed out.

            "content": "I'm going to state this right off the bat, this is not the anime for everyone.  Its draws are the cute-girl moe archetype and its target audience is a mixure of ecchi loves, lolicons, and shoujo manga readers.  People who enjoyed OreImo can easily enjoy this anime as well, but here's the review thus far.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story is an interesting premise.  A light novelist is working with an insert art illustrator whom of which he has never met in person.  Said illustrator turns out to be the shut-in little step sister who he has been living with for years.  \r\nTheauthor takes a similar approach as Netoge where he forces the main protagonists together in a very obvious 'coincidence' in order to tell the story in a proactive way: 'face to face'.  \\n\r\nEX.  of non proactive: in different cities and communicating only via email/skype/phone.\\n\r\nAside from that, the story boils down to the main protagonist, Masamune, trying to get his sister to abandon her shut-in ways, all while working together to write and illustrate light novels with their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nA1-Pictures.  Expect great quality, get great quality.  Not as beautiful as an anime such as Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (I highly recommend).  but definitely better character design than OreImo.  Cute moe girls are undoubtedly cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nPretty average.  Sound track isn't super memorable.  Gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 thus far\\n\r\nI see so many other reviews bashing the characters.  I will honestly defend them and say that the characters have a very human traits MANY of which are idiosyncratic and niche traits that only certain people will relate to and understand.  CHARACTERS ARE NOT STATIC AND BORING.  The 2 main protagonists are clearly growing and changing which I cannot understand where other people come from when they say that the characters feel 2 dimensional or static.  Are they genuine?  Yes.  Are they interesting?  Depends on what kind of people you find interesting to be perfectly honest.  \\n\r\nIzumi Masamune:  Hard working onii-chan who has trouble catching breakthroughs with his works.  Writes from the soul.  Has a massive thing for his beautiful imouto.\\n\r\nIzumi Sagiri:  Became a shut-in after grief stricken by the passing of her mother (birth mother).\\n\r\nYamada Elf:  Overly eccentric popular writer.  Writes for fun, profit, and marketability rather than work.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is a personal score as I'm bound to enjoy this series more than the average viewer as it resonates with me at the personal level as an amateur writer and artist too.  A lot of the laughs i get from the series come from how human the characters feel.  Can't say nor generalize all of the series, but it definitely has a situational comedy style to its humor (the best kind of comedy imo btw).  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nDefinitely not a 'must see,' but I definitely recommend it to people looking to get a good growth story of two step siblings trying to build a bridge between one another.",

The little sister barely develops at all throughout the series. Despite all that, I really enjoyed it. I have no idea why either. In the grand scheme of things, it sucks.

            "content": "This anime is Oreimo, except there's no airs about anything deeper and Saigiri isn't a bitch.  Well, there's some other differences I guess.  This show is more lighthearted in comparison, and it honestly works in its favour.  The drama was the worst part of Oreimo, and without it in this series a constant feeling of bemusement always persists.  Honestly it is skippable, but if you allow yourself to get on, Fushimi's wild ride never disappoints.\r\nStory wise it's like Oreimo, but he clearly wants to bang his sister and she clearly reciprocates.  Hence the conflict present in Oreimo isn't really herein this one, and so it's not the driving force of the story.  Instead, the driving force is the two siblings trying to write a really good light novel, and trying to get the sister out of the room I assume eventually.  It works, and what goes on in an episode is typically more focused on interactions between characters with the pot taking a backseat.  Works in the series favour, creating a light-hearted and more consistently entertaining tone.  Dude wants to get it in his step-sis.  10/fucking10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is probably the weakest part of the show, just because it's standard A-1 pictures fare.  There's not much to say about it really, because it's never jarringly bad enough to notice and it's not the type of series that really needs it in the first place.  The characters are all cute as hell and the colour pallet is appropriately bubbly.  My eyes are never bleeding when watching this show.  Negatively, there are two things worth mentioning.  One, some (not all) of the fanservice scenes are just bizarre - one time the MC accidentally peeps on a naked girl, but it's just flat loli ass sitting on a piano stool, another time a bit of chest gets exposed by a button becoming undone, but it's only the sternum, literally no breast.  Regardless, it as funny to me.  Two, the art done by Eromanga Sensei is just average.  That's really the only thing that genuinely bothers me since her art is supposedly super erotic, and to that end it's definitely not thicc or provocative enough.  6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound, it's styled similarly to Oreimo.  OP is nice, ED is nice, and like Oreimo I actually do like the bullshit tooting BGM.  Not much to say, it's good.  7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not the same as Oremo, but they do fill similar roles in the story.  Comparably, the ones in this show are much more tolerable, and much more entertaining as a result.  Brother guy is just as dumb as Kyousuke, but boy does he love his sister from the start.  Saigiri is very cute and demure, and she has a decent if typical quiet girl shtick, mixed with some quirky NEET aspects.  Megumi also has a decent shtick, she's exists to try and mug the camera, but the show is aware of it and her humour rests on the audience and the show both not acknowledging it.  Elf is where the show really shines, imperfect ojou-sama characters are always funny and she's always done well.  However one thing with her is that a couple of times she acts chuunibyou, but it really just felt like a rip off of Kuroneko and not an organic part of her character.  Regardless she brings enough to stand on her own.  A colourful and entertaining cast at the end of the day, I like how they all interact.  9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike a hacker hiding behind 27 proxies, maybe my enjoyment may be hidden between 27 layers of irony.  Maybe I genuinely enjoy it.  All I can really say is that Eromanga Sensei is enjoyable in the way only something by a guy who's written nothing but little sister incest light novels for almost a decade can be.  As a result, no matter how flawed, there's just some really bemusing meta and internal aspects at work if you're willing to relish in them.  What is Eromanga Sensei at the end of the day?  Eromanga Sensei is meme, and I can't help but love it.  And as meme, it is only appropriate that this average A-1 LN-adaptation incest show gets a 10/10.  Fushimi is art, and he's done it again.",

LN author is trying to make it big, and unbeknownst to him his illustrator is his sister.

Did I mention she's 12?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art doesn't disappoint. Characters are very rarely, if at all, disproportionate or drawn awkwardly. The colour pallet works well. I really like that they use actual unfinished sketches and timelapses of sketches in progress for the sister.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nAs of episode 4 we only have three actual characters who have extended screen time so this is subject to change, but I can't see the characters getting any deeper than the typical tropes.

With them finding out it becomes a story of breaking her shell to come out whilst working on their projects. The art and sound is great (9), it catches your eyes and ears and captivates you into the story. It is truly amazing. The characters are also great (9) both protagonists aretruly heartwarming. A brother trying to get her out of the room but not pushing her too much. The little sister who is a shut-in after \"something happened in the past\". Since she loves her brother acting like a tsundere she gets jelous when he talks to the other female characters. It makes it more interesting when it's obvious he loves her too but tries to put the brother act above all else. Overall, I my enjoyment was great and I rate this a 9. I would've given a 10 but having ecchi scenes even for the little sister can get wierd considering she is quite young. But hey there's probably some wierdos who may love that. \\n\\n\r\n(9)",

What it is (so far) is pure comedy with some of the most impressive (IMO) visuals and character animation from A1 yet. Perfectly timed jokes, twisted characters and music that sets the joke perfectly. Much more then erotic jokes I may add. This is in response to the 1 star reviews asking why it is good, as it is still airing this is by no means a conclusive review and I reserve the right to change my mind.\r\nP.S. If cute characters were enough to keep my attention I wouldhave liked Dragon Maid. Kanna is cute, I admit, however that doesn't make up for bad jokes about horny dragons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the last episode my opinion still stands (with a few side notes). The last few episodes have some scenes i can only descride as gross and in bad taste. Fan service of a child just strikes me as creepy. I still recomend this show if you want some good laughs but be warned there are some scenes that may cross a line.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nIn case you were unaware, Eromanga Sensei features an incestuous relationship between an older brother, named Masamune, and a younger sister, named Sagiri. The show likes to constantly display erotic panty-shots of the younger sister of the story who is fourteen years old. That alone should be able to tell you whether you\u2019ll like the show or not. However, I think there are some good points to bring up about this show.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t bad. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s entirely interesting, but it isn\u2019t terrible. Basically, the story follows the life of Masamune who hasn\u2019t seen his shut-in sister, Sagiri, for years.Eventually, they both find out about each other\u2019s hobby and the story progresses forward as Masamune tries to get Sagiri to come out of her shell. While the concept of the story isn\u2019t terrible, the transitions between the scenes are. You\u2019ll find that some scenes just end sooner than they should or you\u2019ll find that scenes usually end with a pity-laughable joke. The sub-plot on the relationships between Masamune and some of the girls who find an interest in him feels tacked on and ends inconclusively. The relationships practically find a \"resolution\" almost immediately after being introduced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAt first, it seems like every character is an archetype, and that\u2019s exactly right. The side characters are pretty forgettable. The main characters, Masamune and Sagiri, are\u2026 okay. They aren\u2019t particularly interesting, so there isn\u2019t much to like or dislike about them.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound:\\n\r\nFor as clunky as this show is, the music direction isn\u2019t bad. The OP and ED are both really nice to listen to and even some of the background music can help establish a comedic atmosphere. The sound effects themselves are pretty effectively used, at times, to convey the silliness of a comedic scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nI thought I would like the animation and art throughout the whole show, but I was surprised to find that I didn\u2019t. Sometimes, it feels like certain movements are stiffly animated. The lack of movement in some scenes is also noticeable and takes away from the immersion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI know I didn\u2019t exactly rip this show to shreds, but aside from it making me extremely uncomfortable with all of its fan service, the show itself doesn\u2019t try to be incredibly unique. Sometimes, you\u2019ll find instances where the show is trying to be unique only to be met by a panty-shot five minutes later. I can\u2019t rate this show any lower than I have. Its music and sound design is good. Its voice acting is serviceable and the animation wasn't awful. While I personally didn't like the premise and while it made me pretty uncomfortable at times, I think this show is objectively (slightly) below average, even if you do like this particular kind of fan service.\\n",

However if you are looking for a fun, enjoyable and fun anime then I recommend this.\r\nSome problems that people have with Eromanga-sensei are that \r\n1. People don't like the incestuous vibes within the anime (despite it being very minor comparing to other anime's \r\n2. They are uncomfortable with oneof the main characters being 12 years of age and having some fan-service moments\\n\\n\r\n3. The plot isn't 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow to address these:\\n\\n\r\n1. I don't understand why people have such a big problem with this one as they are not related by blood and they don't fully look at each other as siblings (see synopsis) \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that the amount of other anime that have much worse than this is insane yet this still gets so much hate even for this one point.\\n\\n\r\n2. While this one is understandable people who watch anime seem to feel like if she looks young(ish) but her age isn't actually uncomfortably young then its fine. This just doesn't make sense \\n\\n\r\nAlso the fan-service isn't anything compared to other anime's with similar stories.\\n\\n\r\n3. This anime is fun and enjoyable, its not plot-heavy, that's all I can really say\\n\\n\r\nLike I have said this anime got so much hate even though there is much worse than it and its not uncommon, I feel like people really just jumped on the bandwaggon with this anime and man it was a big bandwagon \\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime because of the good art, great sound (music), half-decent characters and the overall enjoyable atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this is my first review and I have been watching anime semi-regularly for... eh well more than a year and a half at least, and been watching anime occasionally for a bit longer than that\\n\\n\r\nForgive me if my review isn't 100% but I just wanted to state why I think this anime doesn't deserve as much hate as it got, I realize I made a few mistakes in writing this review like repeating myself too much and perhaps not writing in enough depth but i'll save that for later reviews.",

When I started, I expected the whole show to be an extremely perverse sis-con, and it was never as perverse as I had expected it to be despite some moments being questionable at best. Sadly about half-way through, plot holes started springing up everywhere. As I continued watching i was just left thinking how and why. When disregarding the plot, or lack thereof, it is stripped down toa show that's fun to watch for what it's worth, a rom-com with a harem and a sis-con. In the end it became a sinking ship I couldn't stop laughing at.",

It will contain SPOILERs so just beware.\r\n1st off: They aren't related. \r\n2nd off: They have barely ever spoken to each other,how could they have possibly ever formed a brother/sister relationship?\r\n3rd: Sagiri explicitly states that she DOESNT see him as a brother from the very beginning.\r\nIn episode 8 we find out that both of these characters issues have been created from unsolved trauma from their parents dying. Izumi craves a family because he is afraid of being alone and she WANTS to be alone butfinds people she wants to spend time with anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTheir two stories intertwine and turn into a pure and genuine loving relationship between 2 UNRELATED people who both need each other to deal with the loss of their parents.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet people hate the show simply because they're step siblings?\\n\\n\r\nWant to note: I dated a girl for 2 years (who then later became my legal step sister). Does her later becoming my sister make me dating her wrong? of course not! The irony is, the only reason our parents met and got married WAS BECAUSE ME AND HER DATED IN THE FIRST PLACE!\\n\\n\r\nIf our relationship had worked out I could be married to my step sister. Weird? yeah, sure.\\n\r\nA sister complex? NO, 100% NO!\\n\\n\r\nThe show is okay, it has its issues. Similar issues to Oreimo too, but the reason for the show getting so much hate is stupid and narrow minded. \"ew they're step siblings, how dare they comfort each other and fall in love\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's almost like the shows hate comes directly from the fact the author also wrote Oreimo.I feel like if he never wrote Oreimo this show would be considered a fantastic romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like simple romance anime with a little bit of fan-service then you'll love this. Ignore the hate, it comes from ignorance.",

This anime has lolis, fan service, brother/sister sexuality, comedy, cute panties, basically pretty much everything I love combined into one amazing anime. I'm only half-way through the series though so far I've found it constantly entertaining and fun to watch. I'd describe it as a cute erotic sitcom. If you don't like the show for what it is that's totally fine there are otheranimes that might be more to your liking. Sure it doesn't have much of a plot or character development but I don't watch a show like this expecting to be amazed by a profound story, to immerse myself in deep rich believable characters, or to learn new insights into the human condition or wisdom about the nature of the universe. No, I watch an anime like this to have a good laugh, look at cute lolis, and be entertained, and if you're like me you will love this show and find it very entertaining! :)",

Have you ever seen a 12 year old talking so clearly to a 16 year old about dicks? NO! and It's hilarious! I don't get why people hate this anime.. to be honest It's one of the greatest I watched.. It's not meant to be a bad anime but makes itself look like It's meant to be.. and that's what Eromanga is all about.",

            "content": "Eromanga-sensei, phew, that was definitely a fun time. I know by many it is considered a trashy fanservice show, and yeah, it is a trashy fanservice show. But I still had a good time. I think overall, I didn't think the show was about the whole \"Sibling Bonding\" thing as it was more about Light Novels in general. I dunno, I kinda just gained an interest in how light novels are made because of this show. \r\nI think that's what I liked most, the passion that is expressed through the entirety of the show. The passion to write, the passion to draw, all of itis pretty well expressed in my honest opinion, and even if that's not the primary focus of the show, that's what I took from it. \\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice was well... fanservice. I don't really mind it that much, though I don't think the fanservice was 100% necessary for this show. I think the only drawback would be the forced \"Sibling Bonding\". While I get that it is what the creator of the show is most known for, I just don't think it really sticks out to me as much as the light novel creation and passion part does. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, they're alright. Not anything to really make note of, I mean you've got a token loli, a not innocent (but is still completely innocent) school girl, an elf girl, and a traditional Japanese woman. They're kinda just... there. I didn't care too much for them. The same goes for Masamune himself, though I do like his passion. \\n\\n\r\nFor a final verdict, I give this show an 8. I enjoyed this show, and I liked the underlying message about light novel creation, but the characters and story weren't really of much note. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh Heavens, were we worthy of such a stunning exemplar of superhuman artistic expression? Have we ever obliged any such wonderful creation? How could it come to pass that beings as pitiful as we may witness this endlessly glorious masterpiece?\r\nOr more straight to my point, WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS???\r\nThis show is great. It's...fantastic. It's amazing.\r\nI watched it with my friend. We both kept agreeing, that it was amazing. Super amazing. Hyper amazing.\r\nHYPER AMAZINGLY SHIT!!!\r\nNo seriously, really, no joke, watch this. Watch this and let your world and any sense that your animu loving self held any kind of dignity crumble to dustand get swiped away to the trash.\\n\\n\r\nHow is this bad? It's not \"how\", it's \"why\".\\n\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei has the basic premise that Blandy McMopface, 15 or 16, lives in (alone of course) with his 12 year old little sister. Mopface has a little sister fetish. He makes hentai scenarios based on his fetishes. He works online with a masked manga artist who draws what he writes. One day, he realises that the manga artist is actually his little sister.\\n\\n\r\nThen, they start not having sex. They never have sex. The little (non blood related of course!!!) sister outright tells him that she wants to have sex. And they don't.\\n\\n\r\nThen, they have another girl of about 12 too who shows up at the door and says she loves dicks. No really. I'm not simplifying. She rings the bell. Mopface opens. They have a short conversation. During which she says literally : \"Ochinchin? Daisuki desu kedo!\" aka \"peepees? I love them too much!\".\\n\\n\r\nThen, the neighboring house has a new inhabiter. Due to bullshit reason #6709834754642353427058347523601837235, Mopface intrudes into the house and finds the tenant to be a naked (of course naked) 12 year old.\\n\\n\r\nThen the spiral of 12 year old dick loving girls keeps swirling around him until they form a Maelstrom of underage sex adventures including panty stealing and sex invitations at every episode, and something akin to commanded cheating, and pretty much everything you can do.\\n\\n\r\nLook, if this were porn, I'd have zero problems with it. I wouldn't care one second.\\n\\n\r\nBut Eromanga washes itself away from being the show where the oldest girl is 14 years old by never having sex. Just underpants thievery, peeping, sexual talks at every line, very borderline pedophilia, touching, innuendos all the time, and every freaking scenario you could find in hentai all together in one show.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say that's like washing away the blood on the blade by smearing your face with it.\\n\\n\r\nEven beyond the really really shitty romance/unassuming porn side of this, it's just pure shit. If I were to compare this utter piece of crap to anything, let's take Keijo: on one hand you have a serious sports anime with a ton of butts and asses and it's silly as hell but also takes itself seriously and makes effort both in its parody side and its sports anime side, and on the other hand you have a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"romance\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" show that fails so hard at character relationship because every line is about sex, fails so hard at being porn because it's got this policy of \"do and say every pervy thing, but sex is a no no\", and fails so hard at any kind of thing, even its basic premise works only if you have a really, really really wierd fetish that I've never in my life seen outside of hentai, that there's just no salvation. Everything in this is pure crap.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you one last thing, the friend I watched this with and I did a thing when we watched: every time something was said, or was done, that made the show even worse than it already was, we told each other \"it just got worse didn't it\" and we agreed every time.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the 12 episodes, we told ourselves that 11 times. There is one episode, 6 or 7, that isn't making the show even worse than prior. Every other single episode just made you dig deeper inside a mountain of 100% A grade pure shit.\\n\\n\r\nIt's atrociously bad.\\n\\n\r\nSo why a 10?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it's amazingly terribad. Watch it and hate the world.\\n\\n\r\nElse it's a 1, let's be serious.",

Overall, I will give this show a 2, for I really liked the opening and ending songs. Other than that, this show was just loli bait.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story here is that Izumi Masamune, wants to write a light novel that will be better than every other light novel. That's it. The story never goes anywhere, and by the end, nothing has changed. He wrote a light novel, but in the course of the story, it never getsfinished, and the story is left open ended for a possible season two (which I really do not want.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is typical A1 pictures art, with the same face syndrome. It's not the greatest but it's not the worst I've seen by far. The art gets a pass, although it's nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat voice acting, I must say however. The voice actors sound like they're having fun. The voice acting, along with the opening and ending themes, made the show just a tiny bit more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nGod awful characters, all of them are annoying or cliche. Izumi is boring, Sagiri is annoying, Senju is bland, and Elf Yamada is god awful, and annoying. None of these characters are unique in the slightest, and I hated every single one of them. The side characters are also boring and unmemorable, but at least they were less annoying than our main cast. Out of the main cast, the only one I can tolerate is Senju, because she doesn't appear near as much, and doesn't have an annoying personality. She's still boring, and not really that memorable however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI found myself bored 90% of the time when watching this show. I enjoyed the opening and ending sequences, but everything else was just super dull, and none of the jokes were funny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time on this show. It's boring, unfunny, and the characters are annoying.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review, and I'm going to be writing this under the assumption that the reader hasn't already watched Eromanga-sensei, and is trying to figure out if they should watch it or not. (I've watched it twice.)\r\nFirst, if you're turned off by the incest genre, you probably won't appreciate this anime. They make it very clear that not only are they not blood-related, but the relationship as step-siblings is tenuous at best, to the point where they can barely say they know each other. If that's still too close to incest for you, then you'll probably want to look elsewhere for entertainment.\r\nSecond,yes, the characters are young. If you aren't into anime that deals with romance between kids that have just entered puberty, you probably won't appreciate this anime. To be clear, I would consider this show just a bit too risque to be family friendly, but I definitely wouldn't consider it obscene. It gets a bit sexy at times, but it's not porn.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you can get past those two points, then I highly recommend this anime. It's beautiful, fun, emotional, exciting, adorable...it's practically a beacon of all things positive.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to the ratings. It doesn't feel right giving something 10s across the board, but I can't justify giving it anything less, so I'll try to explain each category as best I can.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story is wonderful, and I absolutely love it. Keep in mind that this show is meant to be felt, not analyzed. It's no literary masterpiece that will be watched and studied centuries from now, and the story certainly borrows heavily from other works, but the execution is flawless. If you're looking for originality, you won't find much of it here. If you're a fan of the genre(s) and want to see it done right, I suggest watching this as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the art is one of the selling points of the show, so you're probably already aware of this, but it is outstandingly beautiful. Eromanga-sensei's drawings are particularly gorgeous, but the entire show is just a treat to watch. It's vibrant, beautiful, cute, and a little sexy, and I can't get enough of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice actors are about as amazing as it gets, and the intro/outro songs are very upbeat and happy, and suit the show perfectly. Both the OP and ED are at least in my top 5 anime songs. I can't say much about background music, because I almost never notice it. If background music is important to you, you'll have to read another review for that. Sorry!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI love every single character in this show. They're all fun, cute, hard-working, and determined individuals...in their own way. I'm pretty terrible with people, so it's hard for me to convey what makes them so great, but all of the main characters made me cry at least once, usually because I was proud of them or happy for them. If that doesn't get my point across, then I guess you'll have to read another review, or watch the show and find out yourself :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is what the show is about. If you read any of the negative reviews, they're all trying really hard to point out every flaw they can find, but that's completely missing the point. This show was made to be felt, and enjoyed, not analyzed. That's not to say that it was designed to be flawed, it was just designed to be fun, not perfect. And that's plain as day, because the love that the creators had for this story oozes out of it at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIf it wasn't clear, I love everything about this anime. If enjoyment is entertainment with emotion, then this show is enjoyment in its purest form. I literally could not recommend this show more. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)",

            "content": "Made by the same light novel writer behind Oreimo, Eromanga Sensei is another otaku-themed romantic comedy focused on teenage light novel writer Masamune Izumi trying to bond with his younger stepsister Sagiri, a hikikomori who he later learns is an acclaimed online illustrator named Eromanga Sensei known for drawing erotic female artwork.\r\nCompared to Oreimo that at least believably explored public perception to life as an otaku, Eromanga Sensei opts to go into more conventional territory for its storytelling with all the cliches and pandering you can expect out of many modern anime titles. All the female characters are shown to be cute and following whatevertypical characters types hammered to death from many conventional titles with Sagiri a tsundere, Megumi the genki girl, Elf the ojou, and Muramasa the traditional girl. Masamune mostly follows the doormat nice guy character type typical of rom-com titles and, not surprisingly, develops a small harem of girls that develop romantic interest in him that consist of Sagiri, Elf, and Muramasa. While these four do have some dimension to their personalities, there is little growth they face nor much depth throughout the span of Eromanga Sensei's run as they are still stuck with the same character types they were introduced with when first introduced.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga Sensei's two particular areas of focus in this series are the light novel industry that Masamune is part of and his relationship with Sagiri. For the former case, Eromanga Series doesn't really offer anything too poignant in exploring the light novel industry as it felt mostly like a backdrop to Masamune's complicated harem situation when Elf and Muramasa eventually take interest in him. For the latter case, the series goes for the same siscon vibe that Oreimo gave off with exploring Kyosuke and Kirino's relationship with both the mentioned siblings implied to have romantic interest in one another. Eromanga Sensei is much more direct and blatant with expressing Masamune and Sagiri's relationship here, yet goes the typical \"wussed out\" route with making the two stepsiblings so the relationship is more palatable for its audience considering the controversy faced with Oreimo's ending a few years earlier.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most uneasy thing for me with watching through this series has to do with the sexualization of middle school girls that pop up at points throughout Eromanga Sensei. Sagiri is only 12-years old within the series and shown to have an obsession with having girls undress and show off their undergarments to use as models for her erotic drawings. In one rather uneasy scene for this reviewer, Sagiri undresses to put on a thong with the intent to use herself as a model for her latest piece of artwork. Even the obligatory beach episodes came off making me feel a bit squicky with Elf and Muramasa donning some fairly skimpy swimsuits. While the series does go about with depicting all this tastefully enough to not make it a full-blown ecchi title, it's still likely to turn away some anime fans who offend easily.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the tiresome anime cliches, the incestual attraction between Masamune and Sagiri, and the rather squicky casual sexualization of middle school girls found within Eromanga Sensei, this easily stands out as one of the worst titles I've seen for 2017 thus far. Unless the typical otaku pandering schlock milked to death in recent years grabs your interest, avoid Eromanga Sensei like the plague.",

Bad moeblob\r\nEromanga-sensei is a garbage show that was not garbage enough to be actually enjoyable.\r\nit is the most mediocre over hyped anime of the summer.\r\n1.\r\nWhat is NBR you might ask? it is short for 'Not blood related'\r\nYup, that's right\r\nthe guy who made Oreimo made another series about sister loving and thoughtbeing blood related was too hardcore afterall.\\n\r\nfor one thing, apparently the dating games say Kirino was actually not blood related but the manga and light novel do\\n\r\nso what is up with that? it isn't gonna make his sister talk with him again.\\n\r\ndid i mention that apparently the authors sister stopped talking with him after he made eromanga? apparently that happened?\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\r\nThe show constantly tells you how these characters are like 13 or 12 but, they all look like they are somewhere between 16-18 years old, even Elf\\n\r\nthen again, i watch alot of anime where the loli is even smaller than a normal child and 10 so what do i know, but if they hadn't mentioned the fact that Sagiri is a middle schooler over and over i probably would have forgotten that\\n\r\nwe get it, you want the Lolicon crowd to spend their money on you\\n\r\ngeez\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\r\nBad moeblob? does that mean i do not enjoy moeblob?\\n\r\nno, in fact i like it\\n\r\nPripara + Idol time, anyamaru, Hanayamata and even Kemono friends are on my favorite list. i like cute girls or cute boys or cute anything doing cute things, but i want it to be y'know\\n\r\nACTUALLY CUTE\\n\r\nNone, not one of these girls were cute or adorable or even sexy to me, everytime some sort of fanservice scene i felt nothing, it was like putting peanuts in peanut butter, it did not change anything but they did it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last thing, the very last thing i hate\\n\r\nIs people liking it 'ironically'\\n\r\nAre you kidding me? are you shitting my dick my right now?\\n\r\nyou bought merchandise with your own money for this shit ironically?\\n\\n\r\nI honestly cannot understand how people can enjoy this, i watch my fair share of garbage and i find them to be ok, sometimes it even gets a chuckle out of me because the fanservice is so over the top all the time\\n\r\nbut in this show? it was so tame, it felt like someone brushing a pencil on a hair comb and asking \"did you find this sexy\" and i am just like \"???\"\\n\\n\r\nJust bad, go watch Oreimo if you want a little sister show, you already watched it?\\n\r\nwatch litereally anything else, ANYTHING BUT THIS.\\n\\n\r\nOh and the person who likes this and thinks that everything i just said was wrong.\\n\r\nfight me.",

What you don't know, this anime is what you call as \"The Magnum Opus of Trash\". (It's not the real deal of the season. I assure you) I don't hate this anime. (Heck, I even watch it without cringing all the time. Well, sometimes I cringe but not every time). If you are a fan of OreImo in hiding, this one will satiate your thirst for sister-banging anime. The story is decent even though it's a trash according to what other say. This isa simple version of OreImo, so to speak. Everything is the same but it's simplified. The art is pretty good since it was made by A-1 Studio. The OP was good too since it was ClariS. (If you watch OreImo, you must be familiar with this singer group) The character is a bit........ underdeveloped at some region. There's plenty of character yet they only develop, like 4 of them. It's a waste of character for me. You can enjoy this IF you can overlook the very premise of the story. It may be a trash because it promotes all kind of anime stereotype into one story but, It's pretty decent in my opinion. There's a cast of cute girls and a story you can be disappointed in (if you really despise the premise of the story). \\n\\n\r\nConclusion :\\n\r\nLove OreImo? Watch this\\n\r\nLove OreImo but hate picking up the best girl? Watch this\\n\r\nHate OreImo? Just go somewhere else, this is basically OreImo 2.1\\n\r\nNew to trash genre? You just witnessed the modern masterpiece of Trash and I assure you, all trash will never look the same in your eye again\\n\r\nJust curious about this? If you have nothing again Incest, here you go.

The art style is absolutely gorgeous, it is super bright and vibrant and makes the anime feel just that much more amusing. The story, even with the sense of incest, was extremely good. I loved the idea of two friends being reunited in the form of working with each other to make the most interesting manga. As suspected, it is pretty lewd. The lewd parts in this anime is actually one of the reason I like it. It isvery innocent in a way. Now the characters, they are pretty stale, at least in the beginning. Towards the end though you really feel connected to each of them after hearing their stories about why they want to become and author or what drives them to draw. Overall this was an extremely well-made anime and everyone should give it a shot.",

Don't get into anime because of anime\r\nThe story was okay.. episode 9-11 kind of pissed me off, and a 12 year old that's absolutely obsessed with dick was just baffling to me. It was like oh, let's go and do the very typical fan service that we always do. That'll show those nerds.\r\nArt was pretty good. I loved Elf Yamada's character design most of all. One of the things I saw this anime do was cater very slightly tofoot fetishes. About every 5 minutes in most episodes it'll go and pan to someone's feet. I guess gotta hit that broader audience, right?\\n\r\nSound was what I'd expect from an anime. I'm not a sound whore, so I can't exactly go into very much detail here, other to say that \"The music was kinda catchy.\"\\n\r\nCharacter was kinda okay. The protagonist of the series kind of had some character, but he kinda felt dull, mostly with the freaking out that Eromanga makes illustrations for an erotic novel he's making. Like what. There was a character for pretty much everyone. One for the big boobs, one for the small boobs, and one for pedophiles.\\n\r\nThis anime kinda felt like a drag. I think I once took a long week off of this anime so I could get away from it\\n\r\nOverall, this anime hasn't completely hit the floor for me. I'd probably watch another season if it came out.\\n\\n\\n",

Though some episodes lacks for some weird character development, which wasn't really anything.\r\nPlot/story - theres like nothing.\r\nCharacter: well they did their job at the tropes they're are carrying. I loved the whole cast. Mc is likeable, have a clear purpose instead of being too attached to the main heroine. The main heroine iscute, and the highlight of the show most of the time. The art bringing them all together worked well, along with the music and such.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: my biggest gripe with the series. Unclear, have bad pacing, sometimes hurt the whole episode by making it confusing.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, as a tryhard ecchi fan I extremely enjoyed the series. Binging them have huge value. However looking back, some episodes have weird drama or plot progression they are trying to make which doesn't seem too coherent with the overall series. I wish the characters were more developed, I still loved them for the period of the show, however nowhere near as impactful as other series and makes them sadly easily forgotten if not for the extreme acts they've made throughout the show.\\n",

A far mile better than the likes of Suguha, which feels terribly forced. There's also the lolicon issue but again, if you've been watching anime for long you should already get used to the trope.\r\nSagir's relationship with his brother is the strong point of the show, I think. There's also theLN industry part which can get amusing at parts, albeit obviously exaggerated for comedy effect.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think it's good, but it's decent enough to provide some entertainment. Unlike some other shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hey, it gives a lot of cute artwork of Sagiri on Pixiv, so there's that benefit too.",

            "content": "Inasmuch as my favorite mecha shows are formulaic and entirely an excuse to show big ass robots beating the crap out of each other, Eromanga Sensei largely exists only to provide the audience with provocative moe scenarios and a harem of tsundere girls. This is not a bad thing, but it took some getting used to since this is far from my normal fare.\r\nTo give you an idea of what I was prepared for, I discovered this show from H fan art on danbooru. It's probably a good thing this show is not what I expected, because that would just be superbly uncomfortable for everyone.We're treated to frequent scenes of our MC saying something that somehow flusters any given member of his harem, all punctuated with a prolonged \"Baaakaaaa!!\" At the end of every episode I found myself wondering why I was still watching this show, and before I could ever figure it out the next episode was playing.\\n\\n\r\nIt features well the types of internet culture to which many of us belong. Our main girl live streams her drawing sessions and interacts with her audience, and our main guy got his start writing by publishing novels for free online and building a fan base on message boards and comment sections. It also feels very modern. Every character has a smartphone, laptop hybrid, or drawing tablet. This one checks the \"Modern technology showcased in anime\" box.\\n\\n\r\nWhen investigating this show to decide if I should watch it, the inclusion of a publishing industry competition element reminded me of one of my favorite series--Bakuman, the manga about dudes who make manga--and was the tipping point that told me I should. Unfortunately, this is really more of a side plot and not very fleshed out. Every competitor they meet just ends up becoming a friend/harem member, effectively eliminating any tension. The backstory about our two mains and their life before each other was pretty heartwarming, and something that I probably would have cried at in high school\\n\\n\r\nAs wholeheartedly as I love my mindless mecha action, I can't bash anyone who likes this show. If scandalous moe madness is what you're after, this will feed you exactly what you want.",

            "content": "Not being able to see a loved one for a long period of time, especially family bound by blood or being siblings, will surely bring pain to someone currently having a situation like that. That is a universal fact. Not being in our parent's side obviously has a same effect. Some may suffer ftom trauma, some will get shocked and hate the world and some, will lock themselves in, not being able to get out.\r\nThe story of Eromanga-sensei revolves around Sagiri Izumi, a shut-in who haven't got out of her room since the untimely death of her parents. Because of this, her relationship with herstepbrother, Masamune Izumi, became horribly complicated. Wishing to see the face of his beloved sister, Masamune tries all ways in order to make Sagiri come out of her room once amd for all.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to sustain their near-broken family, Masamune writes erotic light novels and make them published. However, he faces time-to-time problems such as rejections and that he is barely known by the public. He, however, has a very famous illustrator named Eromanga-sensei that can draw really lewd and erotic arts which is one of the factors he barely passes by. The only thing is, he had never met Eromanga-sensei yet and he thinks of him (?) as a pervy old man. Until a very shocking revelation happened.\\n\\n\r\nIt was around January when I read about this anime in the upcoming series at KissAnime. When I read the sypnosis, I was instantaneously impressed and started to wait for April for its airing. And I did not regret my choice. I watched it, and found another masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was outstanding, great, and somehow hilarious to the point I kept rewinding some of the funny scenes. The story was also unique that I can't stop watching it. I think I watched it straight for 8-11 hours, including rewindings and not skipping the themes. It was also well-executed and well-played that I will keep saying that IT IS EXCELLENT.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, mostly the illustrations made by Eromanga-sensei which were lewd were (I'll be honest with this one) stimulating. They were excellent it kind of stimulated me. I don't know why. Maybe I have a lolita complex? Now that would be the wrongest of all wrongs. It is wrong. Truly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs is one of the things about this anime that truly stood out of all things there is. The arts for each character was truly excellent as well as super satisfactory. The designs for Sagiri, Masamune, Mu****sa, Sh***u and last but not the least, the most pulchritudinous of all designs, E*f (here goes my biased review again) were, again, excellent and great. I. CANT. GET. OVER. IT. Why? Because I'm a fan. A fan that can't get over easily to types of anime like this. One more of its type is OreImo.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, OSTs and soundtracks (they seem to be synonyms) and especially the opening and closing themes was also something I can't get over with. Especialy 'adrenaline!!' which was performed by TrySail, one of my favorite bands that create anime music, albeit I don't know any of their faces nor members. I also liked the opening theme 'Hitorigoto' by ClariS so well that I already an earworm. (Earworm is the condition in which you just cannot stop listening to a certain song.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. They were utterly great. Need I say any less?\\n\\n\r\nSagiri was kind of a TsunYanKuuDandere if you ask me. (Mix of all for basic types of anime personality stereotypes.) That is one of the most interesting factors you can get from a single character in a single series. Masamune was kind, and caring for his sister, like what normal families must do. The other characters was also unique including thad d*ck-loving orange-haired girl, the weird yellow-haired girl with chuunibyou (Eighth Grade Syndrome. Not a real disease) with elven ears and the most popular light novelist in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever read the review, you wouldn't ask if I had enjoyed it. Me writing this was a long-cut of saying \"This anime is so f***ing great that I enjoyed it thoroughly. You should watch it too. Just watch out for e***i scenes that will stimulate if you have XY as the last pair of chromosomes.\" No, I won't explain what I just said.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you ever read the review, you wouldn't be asking how will I rate it. Overall, the anime was supercalifragilisticexpialidociously interesting and should be honorificiabilititudinitatibus enough not be the subject of anyone's floccinaucinihilipilifications as an anime. Great story, great art, excellent music and excellent characters. I should also note that this inspired me to create a novel right after watching. To be honest, whilst writing this review, I was also writing it. Are you curious? Please be curious. Hehehe.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'll write more about my novel. It is romantic. Good day! (Night if night.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, I won't explain the long words I used. It's too hard to. Impossible maybe.",

Eromanga-sensei is obviously made to please their target audience with questionable (by some people) fanservice and such. And if your sucked in to the Art then you would like the other aspects of the anime much better (obviously).\r\nIf your against loli or incest and such then you will not like Eromanga-sensei. And that is totally ok. But if you are one of those people but you still end up watching the series then youwill be rewarded with some good characters and a decent story. Basically not worth the time if your not 'enhanced' by the Art.\\n\\n\r\nI personally like the loli and incest (But I like almost everything so take it with a grain of salt).\\n\\n\r\nStory = 6\\n\r\nThe story was REALLY interesting in the beginning. I guess reading and hearing about this controversial anime called 'Eromanga-sensei' makes me really interested at first. But the feelings of lost family and getting a second chance was well done. But the story lost its mustard after like episode 9 or 10. No conflict and all awkward Romance and fanservice. If the girls was competing then there would be conflict but there all accepting of each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt = 10\\n\r\nBest aspect hands down. The environment is very warm and friendly and most importantly not hard to look at. Girls are perfect. Their features are definitely cute (and for some people, sexy).\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8\\n\r\nVoice acting is really good. Especially the voice of Sagiri. The soft and tender voice acting on her is awesome. Music is eh. Sound effects like stomping the floor is also eh. But the voice acting tho. Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 8\\n\r\nSagiri = 10, The most developed character is obviously a 10.\\n\r\nMasamune = 6, I read a review and somebody said he was braindead. I sorta agree. But overall he is a cool and relatable dude.\\n\r\nElf Yamada = 8, Your typical loli brat. But typical is a bad word. Whats a word for 'having the same qualities but just better and more enjoyable in every way?'\\n\r\nEveryone else = 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. Its the kind of anime that I look forward to watching on Saturday even tho its Sunday or something.",

At first, I thought the anime setting had a pretty big objective but nope, it disappoints me. 3/10.\r\nArt - I have to say, it's pretty good. The animation's a bit above average. Not bad for an anime that has bad plot. 7/10.\r\nSound - Wow. Surprisingly good music. I was addicted to the OP and ED. I didn't expect it to be this addicting. 9/10.\r\nCharacter - Alright, so we have a novelist, and a perverted artist. Sagiri's way beyond Tsundere and I donot like it, even as a Tsundere lover. Remove the Tsundere side, we should've had a perfect perverted imouto. I liked the supporting characters though. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I enjoyed it quite a bit. Good comedy and sometimes there are romantic scenes that make me giggle like a school girl. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10. Not good, not bad. A perfect time-killer.",

Nevertheless, there was always enough content to fill the episodes, and neither did they ever seem to drag on, something common in anime of this cute/slice of life genre.\r\nThe art is well-done through the whole thing. It's fairly typical for a modern well-funded series, but it's still impressive particularly the way the characters are animated, they are very emotive and fluid. Each character has a unique and interesting design that separates them in more ways thanjust having distinct hair colors as might be the case in a more low-budget series.\\n\\n\r\nThis series isn't life changing and it isn't spectacular, but it is very enjoyable. It's a quick watch which never gets boring through its first season, relying on cute girls for much of its content, but that's a valid strategy which I thought worked very well here.",

This is not a good thing though.\r\nJokes suppose to be funny if it used well, on right places and stages, from what it shows in this anime, I clearly seen how inconsistent jokes are flung around your face, and it scream to be meme anime rather than unique and funny anime. \r\nOf course we should not take it seriously based on theme and plots, but there`s something wrong with it. It was an alternative timeline for OreImo, a love letter for OreImo fans because they ****up the ending. The character just basicly swapped from sister to non-blood related sister, basicly trying to make a real love comedy siscon show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is very cliche. Same preset characters, except NEET loli girl which is really new. Nothing special. Its like you have watch too many anime and you expect something new but there`s none.\\n\\n\r\nOnly I could praise is the art design, which is like you know, \"A-1 Pictures\" done right moment. And the show is exactly portraying the real life world.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, the jokes aren`t interesting. All jokes were basicly for Otaku perverted people. Nothing more. Nothing less.\\n\r\nShow wasn`t that bad, I don`t really hate the show, but its mediocre at the best. Just hope the sequel wasn`t bad.\\n\\n\r\n5/10.\\n",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Meme Value\r\nLet's be honest here, many of the people watching the show during its Spring 2017 season did so because of its controversial nature and the spread of memes that came from itspopularity. Eromanga-Sensei has prime meme material; It's no better summed up than the moment in the show that a random girl shows up and declares that she, amongst all other girls her age, \"love dicks\". It's ridiculous, even for the scenario; A completely random, \"what the hell is going on\" kind of statement. That is Eromanga-Sensei: The \"What the hell is going on\" anime.\\n\\n\r\n- Rubbernecking\\n\r\nDo you ever look up videos of large disasters, and while they are horrifying to watch, there's something magical about them that keeps you glued to the screen? You get a feeling that it's so captivating because you can't believe it's happening. That, and that alone, is what brought me back to Eromanga-Sensei each week this season. They can't possibly dig any lower. They can't possibly be more ridiculous. They can't possibly sexualize these poor girls more. They can't possibly... repeat ad nauseum. It's fascinatingly terrible, in a way I cannot properly describe (although I will describe what I believe makes it \"terrible\" below).\\n\\n\r\n- Moe Factor\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei should not be taken lightly; The show lewds the crap out of underage characters. That can't be said enough. But it would also be remiss to leave out the fact that the show does a decent job of actually making the characters cute (when they're not being bent over or thrown into a skimpy bikini). The art style is clean, fun, and colourful, which works fantastically for making the characters emote in wonderful different ways.\\n\\n\r\n- OP/ED\\n\r\nBoth the OP and the ED were very fun to listen to, as well as watch. There were some very cute dances in both, and I sat through them each time!\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Ravioli Ravioli Do Not Lewd The Underage Loli\\n\r\nI've previously defended anime's exhausting obsession with sexualizing underage characters, due to some legitimate character design questions. For example: Is it wrong to be attracted to, and view suggestive material of, characters that have the bodies of, fully-formed personality of, and perform the roles of otherwise incredibly adult-like characters? Anime often takes incredibly \"mature\" or adult-like characters, and subtracts some number between 2 and 8 years off their age for no other reason than to put them in an environment of their choosing, or to pawn it off as \"relatable\" to a teenage audience. Eromanga-Sensei has some elements of this: Elf, Muramasa, and Masamune all are incredibly adult. They run their own independent businesses, do not attend school, live on their own... you name it. However, the show is completely shameless (and arguably revels) in its insistence of lolifying its cast. It shoves their extreme under-agedness in your face, and seems proud to flaunt it. It cackles as it pulls the characters back and forth between adult and child-like tendencies, seemingly enjoying its audiences exasperation and confusion. And the main character's love interest, his younger sister, has absolutely no excuse for this outright sexualization. She's clearly 12, they want you to know she's twelve, and other than her propensity towards lewd drawings, does absolutely nothing to stray from that point. It doesn't stop the show from shoving her into compromising positions, or undressing her for the audience. It's shameless, even from someone who is happy to take up legitimate arguments for/against stereotypical anime sexualization.\\n\\n\r\n- Failed Chemistry\\n\r\nOnce again, Eromanga-Sensei succeeds in its subtle goal of completely trolling anyone who watches it. The cast of characters around the MC form somewhat of a harem, which is neither atypical nor particularly noteworthy. What is noteworthy is the absolute glee at which the show builds up the characters to being somewhat interesting, likeable characters, only to rip it away from you. The creator behind the story is Tsukasa Fushimi; We all know where this is going. The MC is going to end up with the sister, as he always does. And in Eromanga-Sensei, you're given a sister character so unlikeable that it cannot be anything but a very carefully planned out troll, specifically made to make audiences groan and roll their eyes. Sagiri is a completely irredeemable character, with no chemistry or traits besides \"cuteness\" that make any amount of sense to why she exists. Unless, of course, we're talking bra and panty shots. Suddenly it all make sense.\\n\\n\r\n- Fumbling Storyline\\n\r\nThis story for the 12-episode season was kind of all over the place. There's 2 arcs that seem to be somewhat disjointed from each other; The 11th and 12th episode are completely randomly thrown in to round it out. There's small bits of progression for each of the characters, but it's either 0 or 100 mph with the show. Either confess your undying love for a character, or just sit back and do nothing. No in between.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nI have a hard time finding a word for what Eromanga-Sensei is. It is endlessly debateable, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. It's got the memes, but it's also got the underage-sister-romance-lewdness. It's got a irredeemably weird cast, and yet I can't look away. It's endlessly entertaining, but I can't help feel dirty after watching each episode. It's.... provocative. Yes, perhaps that's the best word to use. Specifically, the definition that states \"to cause annoyance, anger, or another strong reaction, especially deliberately.\"\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-Sensei exemplifies and exacerbates so much of what anime viewers are tired of, yet each week I happily watched the episode and marveled at the ridiculousness of the anime as a whole. It's an incredibly complicated thing to review this show because of it. One side of me rolls my eyes and wants to strangle the author, while the other side reaches for another handful of popcorn and smiles while watching the mess.\\n\\n\r\nThis review feels all over the place, and it's for a reason. The show is so provocative, I feel I could write several essays on it, or at least the themes it exemplifies. But I will stop here, as I think doing so is all some sort of master plan by the author. Well played, Fushimi. Well played.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". This one was incredibly hard to review and rate, so I'm going to try my best to answer it, but perhaps this is something to decide on your own.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of ridiculous anime, especially ones that centre around \"meme value\", Eromanga-Sensei is there for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't stand anime's obsession with underage sexuality, or believe that anime in general has a few select things that are \"ruining anime as a serious medium\", steer clear. Way clear.",

But if you want dept you're out of luck.\r\nThere really isn't anything more to it. There's no plot, just a series of randoms events. There's no characters, just a bunch of vessels for poor fan-service and even the \"protagonist\" is your classical bland/glorified avatar, whose sole purpose is to move theplot forward.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion it truly is as bad as a lot of people say it is.

            "content": "I'm one of those people who are hyped when this series comes this Spring 2017. Don't mind me but Sagiri is the first attraction in this series and she is a pure and innocent little sister but I don't care. I wonder so many watchers liked this series at the bottom of their heart. Feels like some lolicon will really like this anime and that is the reason why this anime is the most disappointing series in this season. \r\nEromanga-sensei is really good. Honestly really good. A good for nothing anime. For me the title is just a perfume to attract the watchers. It doesn'treally do something good except for the earlier episodes. Earlier episodes are really catchy and will hook you up to the story. Ever wonder two siblings are making Light novels and will do their best so that their work will be publish in the public and their names will scatter into the world of Otaku culture. That's good at that extent but as soon as the episode goes, it is nothing but a killing time for me. The story changed like it was nothing. Confession? Heartaches? Data collection? They are just making some excuse to extend the time. Especially the Elf Yamada episode. I feel that it doesn't do something good in the whole series. It is just full of fanservice and non-sense. \\n\\n\r\nA little sister that has a fetish to panties? I don't mind my little sister is that ugly as long as they don't have fetish to their own wearings. We know it just for some \"data collection\" but would you accept especially to Masamune to have a little sister like that? Good grief and it doesn't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nI wonder why I did expect some Bakuman-like anime. I thought it was it. So far so good but it just disappoints me as long as the story goes. I feel like I know what will happen in the story. Another Brother-sister relationship again. Good for something but I wonder what is that something. The anime has always ups and downs. Sometimes on up but always on down. I hope something good will happen in the future of this series because I like it but not in the sense of not serious of what they are doing. \\n\\n\r\nFinal: Thank you for reading my review. I'll update as long as I have time. I'll take some rest for now. This is my opinion to the series. Who know maybe a good thing will happen in the future. Let's just wait for something.",

(Its not true.)\r\n#Lovers reviews 2017: Cute = Best\r\n@Crated True review:\r\nThis anime is great. It's packed with loads of events, its unusual and its adorable. Due to its unusual appearance, people don't understand the charm of this anime. This is the true view of the new generation kids that's being grown into this planet.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe events are well-planned, the anime is running smooth and I found that mostly amusing.\r\nThe only \"minor\" issue is that the anime is very slow-paced, that doesn't mean it's bad. Its just that it recordstoo much of everyday events and extends some events too much, otherwise i'll give it a good 7!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nWell-made art, the character design and the enviroment truly blends in together really well, the characters got really well-made designs with smooth motion.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"only\" issue: Some characters seemed a little bit off in some scenes. Especially sagiri which looked diffrent in some scenes which made it feel kind of akward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is nicely made, I it blended in quite nicely, nothing to say! Kudos to you!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is quite intresting, the characters were well scripted, you can see their behaivors quite clearly!\\n\\n\r\nI do have a complaint from other's perspective: Sagiri has a very unusual personality which is probably confusing alot of people, it might be very clear in my mind because she kinda reminds of me, but for some if not \"many\", it could cause major confusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nYes I did enjoy it alot, It was fun and nice, those cringey echii & comic moments was quite nicely planned.\\n\\n\r\nI could however find a lack of non-echii entertainment which bugs me alot. If  there's gonna be a second season I'd love to see that add-on!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nCongratulations A1-Pictures, you defeated my hate against you, this series were well deserved to watch! I wish you keep making these nice animes, just  don't forget to fix these flaws I mentioned then I'll be increasing my rating!",

            "content": "To me, this anime in particular is one of those 'guilty pleasure' anime. You know, the anime that most people think is bad but you would consider great. Well, in my case, I actually quite like this show and it's a good way to spend 25 minutes of your time.\r\nStory:\r\nI feel that it does have a flow to it. Not that it's perfect, but it's definitely there.\r\nArt:\r\nThis anime looks quite visually appealing. There's something about it that makes it look cutesy and happy, which I find quite nice.\r\nSound:\r\nThe opening and the ending for this anime are probably one of the highlights of Eromanga-sensei. I neverskip them, and I usually skip over openings and especially endings. They're upbeat and give me the good vibes. The seiyuus have done a very nice job in this show, and I have to give them credit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMasamune Izumi is an author who has been turned down many times, but has hit it lucky a couple of times. He is also a good brother to Sagiri, his sister. Speaking of Sagiri, she is where I think people start to hate Eromanga-sensei. She is a hikikomori (a shut-in) who is also an artist. She has been a shut-in for a year, and why she is like that is revealed in the anime. I like her because I think she's cute, and some of the stuff she says and does actually makes me laugh every once in a while, which is actually quite hard to do. She is VERY lewd however, and this lewdness will turn some people off. Whilst not very memorable, the supporting cast do help the story along and they have their moments where they do shine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI found this series to surpass my expectations quite a bit. I wasn't going to watch it at first, but when I saw people talking about it. I just had to see for myself. I would like to own this series on DVD or something of the sort. I'd say I would remember this show for quite some time before I forget about it (mostly because of the memes this show has spawned)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI see why people dislike this show, and I get that. But this is a show that hooked me, and I'm glad that I took the time to stop and watch it. If you can look past the fanservice and see the show for what it really is, then I can safely say you may like this show. Overall, I'd rate it an 8 and would recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

The one I liked the most was Sagiri but not because she is a Tier One loli. She and I share a flaw of character, which is that we both care more about our own selves than the ones that care for us. This selfish behaviour doesn't always show and she can very much be a generous soul. But she has a need for something that demands attention.\r\nStorywise, this anime is very boring and wouldn't interesta puppy bribed with affection. I'd say it has one redeemable mark. It's fairly easy to put oneself in the main male character, Masamune, shoes IF you are a writer yourself. They bring up fairly usual struggles with that profession which every writer faces. I know all too well how it is, trying to climb a ladder with no promise of success. You might too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they show the flaws of Sagiri and her struggle with them, I enjoy it. When they show the work and effort in Masamune's work, I enjoy it. You might have something shared with these characters as I do. Give it a try.",

            "content": "this anime is like a bag of unflavored chips. Sure I'll eat it, but only because i am board and have nothing else to do. \r\nThis anime is also garbage. but like most garbage there is some value in it, but only a little, and its the same thing that you have seen over and over. \r\nIs the art good. Sure it is its by A-1 pictures, but the anime is running at sometimes a really slow frame rate due to the budget. Also A-1 pictures is known for having the same animation and feel for each show that they make. so it is averagefor A-1 Pictures. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is like a story that a 15 year old would post on Fan-fiction.net if they had a hard on for there sister (no offense to the author). The premiss is that a light novel author lives alone with his shut in sister who has never came out of her room once. Turns out that the sister is the illustrator for the light novel that the brother is making. Hence the story of the show. Nothing to special its just kind of bland because you have seen this story a million times. \\n\\n\r\nthe sound is average. Obviously you have your overused stale J-Pop intro with cutesy animation. The Ending is bad and overly average which is what this show feels like. BAD AND OVERLY AVERAGE. The music during the show is fine, and it is made by Tomoki who's made music for a lot of shows such as Nisekoi so he has experience. but its not like I'll listen to it like other sound tracks like JOJO part 4 or Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. so yeah the music is stale and unimaginative. \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why this show is stale could be because of the director who is Takeshita, Ryouhei. Now no one would know about this guy because this is the first show that he is directing so he doesn't have to much experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are fine, but unoriginal and follow the tsundare archetype. many characters follow many archetypes such as the main character who is the generic light novel protagonist who always cares for those around him. then you have the little sister archetype, the tsundare archetype which we have a lot of. So the characters are again stale and unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nOk lets end this review. So did i enjoy this anime. Kind of, but I would have watched something else if i wasn't so naive. I think this anime is an overrated unsalted cracker that people just eat because they have nothing else to do. maybe you enjoyed it a lot more then I did if so good for you. I don't care. But one thing to keep in mind is to not watch stale garbage like this",

            "content": "This anime is not for everyone. If you have issues with a high school MC having feelings towards his 12 year old non-blood related sister and vice versa then you shouldn't watch this. \r\nIt starts off pretty mild, MC meets imouto for the first time and since then he hasn't seen her in a year. He is a LN author and little does he know that his little sister was the illustrator for his artworks; she also conveniently named herself Eromanga sensei but does not respond whenever he asks her if she is (I think it's supposed to be some sort of running joke betweenthem). \\n\\n\r\nFrom there onwards, they decide to work together on his new LN project, and a new neighbour who is a hit maker (Yamada elf) moves right across the street from him. Random coincidence? She's arrogant, tsundere and she likes procrastinating on her deadlines. She teases Masamune a lot and originally kicked up a fuss at his publishing company because she wanted Eromanga sensei to draw illustrations for her new project. Initially an annoying character but becomes quite endearing and bearable after ep 3? \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters include Tamago bookstore worker who is also his classmate and Megumin (who is Sagiri's classmate and class rep who tries to get her to go to school. Magumin is pretty much there for comic relief and fanservice. In ep 6, she goes over to Masamune's place to borrow LNs from Sagiri in order to befriend her. Sagiri then starts drawing her in lewd poses while she is blindfolded and restricted. She even takes her panties off. \\n\\n\r\nFanservice levels aren't extremely high but you'll feel like you're going to get arrested at any point in time while watching this as the girls are like.... under 15?  \\n\\n\r\nGood humour, I like the interactions and don't mind all the girls. I really like the OP and ED is cute as well. \\n\\n\r\nStay far far away if you dislike loli fanservice and imouto animes. Watch it for the humour and super cute girls. Cliche, but not too bad. Art is very good, I love how they drew Sagiri.",

Eromanga-Sensei is a trashy show that appeals to the lowest common denominator, only rivalled by Keijo, Monster Musume, and Highschool DxD. The only people who would genuinely love Eromanga-Sensei are mouth breathing otakus who are into lolis and anything moe. \r\nOne would think I absolutely hatedthe show. But that's very wrong. I went into Eromanga wanting to hate it. I absolutely abhorred Oreimo and I expected Eromanga to do the same. The only reason I started watching it was because I needed to watch a bad show after finishing the masterpiece that is Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. And let me tell you, I'm loving every second of this shit. It's so absolutely garbage that I enjoy it, I think I've gone too far into anime if I'm watching a story about a guy trying to bang his sister.\\n\\n\r\nYou read that properly by the way. The plot is about a dude trying to bang his sister.

It's not good because it's bad, but instead it's bad because it's good.

            "content": "(This can be changed since it's made after watching 5 episodes. But I hopefully think I would only do about new characters.)\r\nWARNING: LOONNNG REVIEW!\r\nTL;DR It's an alternative style of Oreimo that I have expected that it would gain half loves and half hates. I.E., it's fun for some and boring and stupid for others. However, they've got a cool production making it one of the should-consider-trying animes this season (and Anime of the Season just for me... Alright, no more self-ish opinions).\r\nAlright, let me get this straight. This review, while I am one of those guys that think Sagiri is cute, will NOT be influencedby her cuteness but rather, her personalities and every other aspects of the anime. This review is also influenced by the original novel in terms of comparisons and contrasts.\\n\\n\r\nSo, most of you should have already known that Eromanga Sensei is similar to Oreimo. In fact, except the story and Seiyuus of course, everything else is the same. Fushimi Tsukasa, check. A-1 Pictures, check. ClariS and TrySail, check. The main idea is close to Oreimo as well. So mark that on because comparisons will happen in the next paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nI'll skip the storytelling in 3, 2, 1, ...(Go read description)... There you go. So, in my opinion, this looks like they took an Oreimo main idea (Siblings interaction + extra girls and supporting characters) and recycled it, adding probably untrue novel creators' behind-the-scene idea to it (I mean, I don't really want to believe that most author and illustrator characters' personalities would exist in real-life light novel creators, except for Masamune that I approved his work cycle LOL.) But for some reason, I feel like the story and comedy aspects feel brighter than Oreimo. Like Eromanga Sensei is a 'light side' Slice of Life Comedy while Oreimo is a 'dark side' one. Anyway, I like the comedy in this. But again, because of falls the same page as Oreimo, most Oreimo watchers would at least like this anime while Oreimo haters would hate it so...\\n\\n\r\nI forgot to mention that, like Oreimo, they respect the novel storylines very well. While some moments and aspects have been tweaked to speed up and maintain the flow, this is a good adaption from the novel. They follow the story really well and scene additions add good new point of views to the story. In fact, it did way better than this season's DAT one anime Xebec crapped the novel's script entirely... (You know the name.)\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, A-1 Pictures made a comeback after destroying Qualidea Code (which I think they used the budget on songs rather than the anime itself) and some other animes. Look at that, a good quality artwork. Although it might not be #1 this season but at least it's on the top of the list, at least I'm sure it beat DAT one anime from Xebec. I do like the illustrations of Eromanga Sensei and the details of the story art as well. It really gave me a good picture when I turn back to the novel. All in all, great job A-1! But let's hope they won't let us down in the second half of the season! (Oh, and yeah, the joystick!)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds? Catchy. I can't still get that 'rush' tune (or something? I don't know, the one with trumpet) out of my head. Other tunes quite passed on making their appearances. The OP and ED, by ClariS and TrySail respectively (the same set as Oreimo!), are awesome. Hitorigoto express Sagiri's theme quite well while adrenaline!!! feels very fresh and happy. And both of them are catchy too. Maybe next Tsukasa-san's anime adaption could use these two acts again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we go, let's go with the character. Again, while Sagiri is cute, I won't be judging by the fact that Sagiri is cute even that Sagiri is cute. First, Sagiri is a shut-in Hikkikomori who is a bit tsundere to her brother (I swear that I didn't know this while I was reading the novel, really! No, I actually had a little hint.). She's super annoying at sometimes, too. She appears to be super pervert too (she's 'Ero'manga Sensei, by the way!) Oh, she's a Grade 7, huh. Masamune is... eh... A crazy MC. He took Kyosuke's personality, but added way too much of sister obeying trait. He's even... I think I can say this, right guys? He's in love with Sagiri. He actually... Now it's a spoiler, so go watch it. Lrt's not forget he's a high-schooler and a novel writer (whose novels are illustrated by Eromanga Sensei/Sagiri) as well. Yamada Elf is a crazy Kuroneko. Megumi is a super-straightfoward Grade 7 class leader who... likes dicks. Tomoe, the bookstore girl is an... upgraded Manami. At least she's more attractive than Manami. And there's another girl who I can't mention until around episode 7-8 I think? I'll get back to this at the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, again, it's a carbon copy of Oreimo, except for the MCs which, I think it's still close to Oreimo's. And I don't know if the characters goes well for the story. I 75%-ly think so, but you judge. At least, I found someone I like and hate (in a good manner). And the puns and comedy's are expressed well by the characters. The VAs did a great job, too. Sagiri's voice is awesome, although it's a bit shocking for me comparing to when she voices another character I knew.\\n\\n\r\nPS. I see some character development coming. There's something behind the two MCs' current life. No more spoilers.\\n\r\nPPS. To avoid shit ending, Tsukasa decided to say that the two MCs are NOT BLOOD RELATED. So take the word 'incest' away from your head because that's not it. This didn't affect my review anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the Enjoyment rating. I was an Oreimo fan (until the awful ending) and I had a great time watching this. It makes you smile and annoyed sometimes (in a positive way). While I don't think this surpasses Oreimo, a bit better but not much, but I still enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Oreimo.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Oreimo, watch it.\\n\r\nIf you're a hate of Oreimo, don't watch it.\\n\r\nIf you're neither, watch the first four episodes and judge.",

            "content": "This is a good BroSis RomCom anime, i enjoy watching it so far. But i'don't understand why there's so many people hate this anime. If i compared it with OreImo, OreImo it's a good anime, but like many people, i don't like the ending too, i mean it's just wrong, you know? but if there's people that actually like that, that's a whole new level of siscon i tell ya, haha... But, what can i say? in this world with many personalities, taste, i can't judge them. Anime is where all of our imagination takes form, you know? with so many variations, it even becomesa culture in Japan. That's why i like anime. We just need to draw the line, got it?\\n\r\nAnyway, as you watch Eromanga, it's constantly trying to tell us \" Hey, it's okay, it's not blood related\". Not like OreImo though, if OreImo is a hardcore, then eromanga is a softcore. but it's still ongoing and i don't know where the story will be headed. The brother, has a good self awareness, he's trying really hard not to cross the line, you know? Especially against a kawaii imouto like that, who's in love with him. (you can tell from watching the first episode) But, if it's me, i can't never hold it, i mean who can? hahaha... Love will come if someone care to you, makes you comfortable when you beside her/him, whoever they are, can't blame it. especially the sister, she's still a pure and otome=maiden, like a simpleton. people like that can fall in love easily with a little kindness, caring and attention. \\n\r\nMoving on, the characters, it's still ongoing, but there's one that i didn't like, that orange hair girl, ughh... i can't take it with people like that, an annoying personality. The graphic is amazing, and the sound too and especially i like the sister' seiyuu, very kawaii, especially when the tsundere lines comes up. Oh yeah, the brother is voiced by kirito in SAO, there's no animefan that didn't know him.\\n\r\nOh yeah, one more thing that i didn't like is what the fu** is the creator thinking? Showing the sister almost naked a few times, they treated the sister so cheap showing the skin here and there... don't treat her like a bi***. Ughh... i hate it, fanservice is a cheap commercial, market strategy. Appreciate the character more, don't waste such a kawaii character like that, PLEASE. \\n\r\nThere you go, give it a try. BroSis RomCom. oh yeah, this is my first review, thank you. sorry for the languange",

            "content": "I started this anime a couple of days ago. And today finished the whole serie + OVA. But for now i'm gonna review this serie. Its was a good serie to watch and did enjoy it alot.\r\nStory: Well...the story was easy and good enough to follow. Story in short, its all about Masamune and Sagiri aka miss. Eromanga. And the everyday struggle between them. Miss. Eromanga is a little bit a neet. And her brother Masamune is writer for a manga serie. And takes control of the household. They are not blood related and well...they are getting close and learning from eachother.\r\nArt: Art is goodenough and watch easy. The characters are well detailed. Just standard anime art for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Opening and ending are catchie. Not to bad to listen (even I got the opening on my youtube playlist). The sound in the serie is just good. Nothing to say more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ok...now the fun part: Masamune the male protoganist is really a nice guy. Carefull and a die hard manga writer. He's one of the girls favorite (cough...no harem?). I did enjoy him alot. Not one of those greedy or anoying boys.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri otherwise is a young girl and is a neet. Very shy person and cant really talk with people face to face. But...I was a little bit thinking...maby she is a little bit autistic. And why i'm saying this? Because first if got autism by myself. And i'm seeing some part wich can be related to it. And well she is passionate about one thing. Wich is a little bit awkard. But I like this person also. She is a great girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe Support characters were fine to. There were no one very anoying. And much of funny thing happens between the main and support. Great work from the makers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ok if watched in a few days. But it was fun to watch. Easy story to follow and not much boring stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Shall I recommend it to you people? Yes!!! If you like to watch comedy with a little bit brother sister love. (They are not blood related!!!!). You will enjoy it. Maby for the people who wants to see drama. I think its not the great one in the genre. But if you like to watch a chill anime. And where you can put your mind to 0%. Then this anime is for you.",

In fact, I quite enjoyed the characters especially since the secondary characters really stole the show. Strongly fulfilling the 'entertainment' part of the show.\r\nThe story is alright, mostly serving as a means to watch the characters at their most interesting.

            "content": "Yeah, I actually liked this quite a bit, at least it made me keep wanting to watch it and know what comes next without feeling like dropping it after one episode. I liked the relationship between the characters and there was very little that I hated about it. It wasn't the most amazing thing out there, but it was truly good in my opinion. Oh, and I prefer this over oreimo, not that I care much since I never liked that show much from the start.\r\nSo, I feel like this is actually getting a lot of undeserved hatred, it might not be deserving of apublic score of 8+, but it certainly easily hits the mark for a 7+ score, yet it's at below even 7, even average shows gets more than this show but offers so much less. It just seems like this show easily offends certain viewers who shouldn't be here in the first place yet somehow decided to watch it just to bitch about it. Complaints about things like it being full of lolis, the often lewd humor, that it's not as good as oreimo or that it's the same/very similar(surprise, surprise) and thus shouldn't be allowed to exist or perhaps people who dislike the general idea of pseudo-incest or incest relationships, many also dislikes how it's kinda clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what I wonder about is what the actual f*ck these people are even doing watching this? Is it purely out of a desire to hate on something they didn't want to watch in the first place? I mean, these things are EASILY discernible with just a quick glimpse at the summary, the title, the cover image and the author, so why bother watching it if you're not into that kind of stuff? That'd be like someone hating shoujo manga going out of their way to read them just so they can say how much they hate it, stupidity at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nWell, whatever. This anime has a pretty cute, innocent relationship between all the characters, almost every character that was introduced was also likable. It's not that deep, but that's what I expected when I started watching a lighthearted romcom. I found the setting and story to be interesting, nothing truly exceptional but it still made me enjoy it a lot. The art was good, as usual with modern anime, the sound was so-so, the characters each felt alive and full of energy instead of feeling like one dimensional robots. I recommend watching this, truly enjoyable. Not sure if it could keep up the same quality for a second season as many novels/manga/anime tends to get way worse when the story progresses and there's many changes happening. It's a solid 8/10 for me and that's pretty good from someone who is strict about trying to give a fair score and would never give a 10/10 or 1/10 unless something is utterly flawless or horrible beyond words unlike so many other people who give 10/10 if they like it a lot and 1/10 if they dislike it a lot without actually caring about if it's TRULY deserving of that score.",

            "content": "From the man and studio who brought you Oreimo, here comes... yet another love story between siblings. Except this time... THEY. ARE. LEGAL. Lol.\r\nSTORY\r\nEromanga-sensei is about Sagiri and her big brother Masamune, who she completely ignores (just like a certain Kirino...). They both live in the same house, alone (they do have guardians but they don't live with them). Masamune is a professionnal author, he works hard to earn a living for him and his sister (despite her ignoring him). The illustrations of his books are drawn by a certain Eromanga-sensei, and as the name suggests... the pics are hot.\r\nOne day Masamune realizes that thisEromanga-sensei is none other than Sagiri, his little sister. Then starts an adventure that will improve their relationship (just like a certain pair of siblings...). They will quickly fall in love with each other but their being siblings will make things complicated (again... just like in Oreimo). Aside from those two, a lot of feminine characters are here and will, of course, fall in love one after another with Masamuna (a harem, just like... you got it, Oreimo).\\n\\n\r\nEnough suspense. Eromanga-sensei is a complete rehash of Oreimo. But when Oreimo had much more than a love story to tell (Oreimo is about tolerance and society pressure), this story has nothing else but a romance between a siscon and his perverted sister. The main pitch may make you believe it will be about writing... and to some extent, it does show the life of a Light Novel author in Japan.\\n\r\nNow, the story itself isn't necessarily bad. The romance is assumed from the beginning, and the harem isn't that much annoying. It could be worse.\\n\r\nBut really, the fact remains that it is just an empty remake of Oreimo. For a romantic comedy, it may be enough. Personnally, I only watched this for the comedy, so I don't really care about the story. I do find it's a shame that the story doesn't tell much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nOn that point, there is nothing to say. Eromanga-sensei has the same style as Oreimo, except it's much better (because it is more recent, obviously). It is a candy in the eye, and the chara-design is cool. Sagiri is so cute! I also like the fact that Elf is actually a real-life elf (with pointy ears and a bow xD).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nJust like Oreimo, the songs are made by ClariS, so it is catchy. As for the OST itself, it does the job, although I don't keep any music in mind. It doesn't ruin the show, so that's fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nJust like Oreimo, the characters have strong traits. They are quite clich\u00e9, but for a romantic comedy that's ok.\\n\r\nI don't really like Masamune, he's a pure siscon and has no particular quality. He reminds me of Kyousuke in Oreimo season 2. As a big brother myself, I don't really respect Masamune. He let his own sister shut herself in for (at least) a year! And once he's met her, he quickly becomes a lolicon...\\n\r\nSagiri, on the other hand, is really nice. The character has been created as the exact opposite of Kirino : whereas Kirino seems perverted but is actually innocent, Sagiri looks innocent but is actually a huge perv'. I'm not fan of loli stuff, especially when it involves sexual content (although it is quite implicit on that case). But despite that, Sagiri is cute and her progression is interesting to follow.\\n\r\nAs for the secondary characters, Elf and her brother are fun (probably the funniest in the show imo). But the rest is nothing really memorable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is basically Oreimo but with a legal romance and without any deep message. It is funny to watch for its embarrassing situations, its funny characters and other anime references, just like Oreimo. But it will also not make you think as much as Oreimo.\\n\r\nAlso, just like Oreimo, I feel like it should have ended before the actual end. The 11th episode would have been perfect to stop. The last episode isn't bad, it just doesn't fit as an end.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the ONE thing I really regret, is the lack of realism. Oreimo was impressive on that part : the characters really felt real. IRL I know much more Kirinos or Ayases than I do Sagiris or Megumis. I mean, let's be frank, girls aren't as cute once they've become teens. Sagiri is 13 in this anime, but she looks much more like a 7/8 years old, which kind of breaks the immersion in the story and makes the romance creepy when it's actually not (in this case, this is a love story between a 13-years old girl and a 16-years old boy, and thety're not blood-related).\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that they're all PROFESSIONNAL whereas they aren't even 18, it's just too much. In Oreimo, they were mannequin, and teen mannequins do exist IRL. But 16 years-old who sell millions of her book? Nah.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this anime is worth a try. If you know Oreimo, don't expect too much.",

I can't even spoil you because it's non-existent. It's kinda a slice of life, with no evolution or whatsoever  and all the clich\u00e9 that you can think of.  But we all know that it's now practically impossible to have an ecchi with unique trope.Well,honestly who watch that's kind of thing for the scenario, anyway. All we can say it's that the job is done, not more, not less.\r\nArt & Sound.Great. Voices and graphics are cute. I don't remember the ost, so it's neither awful nor outstanding.

I am not defending this show nor am I defending SAO ,but I think that people should watch a show before they give their opinion on it. Now onto the review, Eromanga Sensei is kind of like what happens when some pervy japanese guy's sick fantasy becomes a major anime. Now Eromanga Sensei is bad there isn' t any way of going around it, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Why? Well because the characters werevery lively and something was always going on. And honestly  think the worst thing that an anime can do to a person is bore them. Like for example there is always some sort of relationship that is being built throughout each episode and thus something is always being accomplished by watching each episode. And because of this even for those that hated the show it always remains in their mind because a good deal of things managed to happen in those 12 episodes. I'm not going to spoil them, but shit happens. And I think that's something other slice of life anime needs to learn from. None of that holding hands bullshit, I want to see characters entering REAL relationships. In this Kyo- Ani controlled era of slice of life, we need to have less of hand holding and more kissing. I'm not asking for a sex scene I just think that after several hours worth of character development characters need to have something to show for it. And in turn the watchers have something to feel accomplished.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nNames are a vital part to our day-to-day lives.\r\nMostly because they allow us to identify others. Take myself on the Internet. I go by the name \u201cBanjo\u201d and have done so since I first started taking part in the community. But it\u2019s not just for people. We name pets. We name foods in the wild. We name tracks on a music album.\r\nWithout names, we\u2019d be left with describing something without really pinpointing the thing in question. \u201cThe dog the Johnsons\u2019 got.\u201d \u201cThat one red, rounded fruit.\u201d \u201cThat goofball anime writer that always starts his reviewswith a prologue and an anecdote.\u201d Clearly possible to do so, but names make it easy to quickly and accurately specify what we encounter.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for Eromanga-sensei. Its name (formally a title) instantly selects which anime a person is talking about in a conversation. Coincidentally, the name also makes it a simple method of determining which show to chuck farther away than a poison apple.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn Eromanga-sensei, a middle-school boy named Masamune lives with his younger sister Sagiri. Having lost their parents, he works as a light-novel author to support the two of them, and she locks herself in her room almost without a peep. However, Masamune soon learns something surprising: that Sagiri is the famous, perverted online artist named Eromanga-sensei. The same person who draws the illustrations for his own very own works.\\n\\n\r\nThis revelation begins the anime on the right foot, thawing the awkwardness of their relationship. Unfortunately, the follow-up melts onto the floor as a bunch of unwelcome puddles that the show gladly stumbles into with each subsequent step.\\n\\n\r\nIt muddies its feet first by stepping in blandness. Uneventful competitions and the light-novel approach in general decline the plot\u2019s desire to give the audience appreciable content. For example, the show doesn\u2019t share the details of the stories the characters compose despite how important they are to those reading and writing them. While the process behind their creation (sitting down at a table and clacking on a keyboard) may not have excitement, the story\u2019s decision to ignore the embodiment of the characters\u2019 thoughts and feelings only serves to raise an eyebrow.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the constant, weak dialogue about creating something \u201csuper-interesting.\u201d They have means. They have skill. They have reasons. So, trading in their penchant for prose and replacing it with the most vague, non-descriptive way to explain the passion behind their projects only further dirties the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFailed drama also swamps the ground, causing Eromanga-sensei to slip and fall some more. Take episode three. Masamune talks with Elf on her mansion\u2019s balcony about why he became a fan of hers to begin with. How her novels let him laugh, staving off melancholy that took over his mind after his parents\u2019 (his dad and step-mom\u2019s) deaths and Sagiri\u2019s reclusion.\\n\\n\r\nA potentially touching scene \u2013 but it lacks weight. The anime does not emphasize his loss as a conflict or even something important to the plot. Indeed, it\u2019s rarely brought up at all (especially in the mid-to-later portion of the season), seeming more like an excuse to have Masamune and Sagiri alone together in the same house than a source of drama.\\n\\n\r\nOr take episode four. On that same balcony, Masamune jumps from it to Sagiri\u2019s own balcony in a demonstration of happiness. Again, such a scene should make for a dramatic or at least standalone moment. But instead, the outcome is the \u201cclassic\u201d guy-falls-on-top-of-girl scenario, killing any momentum such a moment may have carried in his action.\\n\\n\r\nNow, roughly ten paragraphs in, people may be saying to themselves, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point of the show. The writing premise doesn\u2019t matter, and the drama isn\u2019t the focus. Who cares about these details in this rom-com, anyway?\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then the \u201cpoint\u201d must be somewhere else. Namely in either part of that hyphenated word: romance or comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWith Eromanga-sensei\u2019s romance, the puddles only grow larger. Quite quickly, the anime makes it apparent that it will tackle a taboo topic: incest. That\u2019s not anywhere near an issue; stories exist to explore any and all subject manners. No, what is an issue is the fact that the anime remains ambiguous in its delivery. And it happens a bunch throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re actually step-siblings \u2013 but they call each other \u201clittle sister\u201d and \u201cBig Brother\u201d to reinforce their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune will say, in episode two, \u201cStop with the impossible misunderstanding. Just because we live together doesn\u2019t mean brother and sister have a romantic relationship.\u201d But then, in the same episode, he is stunned to learn that Sagiri will not let him wash her underwear anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri deserves blame as well. In episode eight, she first says, \u201cI\u2019ll pretend to be your little sister for a bit,\u201d but then later says (to herself), \u201cI\u2019ve gotten much further away.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe harem aspect also doesn\u2019t work. Every girl either implies or straight up tells Masamune that they will for sure be married one day despite his and the show\u2019s clear intentions.\\n\\n\r\nTo the anime, either say it is or it isn\u2019t, for there cannot be any in-between here. Even disregarding the wishy-washiness, a topic this controversial, portrayed with such realism, requires a certain level of tact. But the anime does not provide that. Instead, it showcases indecent scenes with Sagiri (and the other characters) that have no purpose or place in a narrative attempting for believable romance and grounded drama.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHold on, bub. The \u2018romance\u2019 is all memes. It\u2019s whatever, too.\u201d All right, fine. Excusing the drama and the romance, that still leaves the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the comedy does manage to shake off some of the residue from all the puddles it has waded through thus far. A scene like Sagiri frantically slamming her foot on the ground to signal her hunger to an under-time-duress, can\u2019t-hear-her Masamune incorporates the premise in a funny way. The male side character author, who joins their party before the festival, brings a couple laughs when he gives the audience a somewhat outside perspective of the crazy people that they have grown accustomed to and he has now befriended.\\n\\n\r\nIt dries off with more funnies, too. Its ecchi jokes about penises. The running gag with Sagiri\u2019s door always swinging open and smashing Masamune\u2019s face. The show \u201crewinding the tape\u201d as Elf double checks that he is really her next-door neighbor. None of these scenes are downright hilarious or extremely clever, but, all told, Eromanga-sensei finally has a net positive on its hands with the comedy it touts.\\n\\n\r\nYet when so much of the show (the drama and the romance) must be excused to make way for one passable part (the comedy), it\u2019s tough to justify its merit when it would otherwise be hard to find at the bottom of those puddles. And so, ultimately, it stays soaked from head to toe.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIn general, Eromanga-sensei does not skimp out on movement, giving Masamune and the other characters the reactions and charges they require.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in episode eight, Elf flicks Masamune\u2019s head with her finger to knock some sense into him, and his momentum pushes him backwards while his hands swiftly cover his face. In episode five, Elf rolls around in a sporadic manner to highlight her expressiveness. And Sagiri\u2019s temper tantrum in the second episode is another quick example of the show\u2019s strong animation.\\n\\n\r\nOn occasion, though, the anime elevates the fluidity even more. These short segments stand out as both a big positive and a big negative. On the positive side, the noticeable increase in animation gives the show a sharper, skillful look, like when Sagiri stands on her tippy toes while wearing her slippers at the beginning of episode eleven.\\n\\n\r\nOn the negative side, these scenes often exploit the situation to an unnerving degree. In episode six, the camera hangs low, aiming at Megumi for a peek at her crotch as she lifts herself up from her bed. Or how, in episode four, Sagiri tries on risqu\u00e9 pink lingerie to model a new pose for her art. In short, these scenes are uncomfortable and unnecessary no matter how much the strict animation flows.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of movement, the anime includes other moments or techniques that improve the artistry. Cute dances from Sagiri in the opening track and the ending track give those songs a fun backdrop. Certain camera cuts capture the comedy, such as when, in episode eight, Masamune\u2019s editor is one extra shot over, forcing the field of view to swing across one more time. The background changing from Sagiri\u2019s room to the hallway without a transition in episode three as Sagiri kicks Masamune out also improves the direction of that scene.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of backgrounds, Eromanga-sensei doesn\u2019t change its location often, so it doesn\u2019t have very many (if any) chances to showcase its setting and the art itself. While that may explain the extra attention given to the animation, the show still has to appeal elsewhere. Particularly in the characters\u2019 designs.\\n\\n\r\nSaid designs are not too shabby. Masamune\u2019s dark-green, spiky hair and plain style are boring, but Muramasa\u2019s yukatas and bandaged fingers give her a mature and skillful vibe (respectively) that fits her character. Sagiri\u2019s colors (teal, silver, pink) meld nicely together, and Elf\u2019s golden locks, frilly dress, and actual (never noticed) elf ears give her the most interesting design of the group.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the art and the animation are usually above average in their execution, but those overly exploitive scenes really take away from what the visuals present.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIn some regards, the best part in all of Eromanga-sensei is Sagiri\u2019s arc and her gradual change to a (slightly) sociable person.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the season begins, the show characterizes Sagiri as a talented artist with a knack for lewd drawings. A characteristic that often spills over into her actual life where she cannot repress her need for artistic inspiration from other girls. However, the most important detail about her is the reclusion she sticks to.\\n\\n\r\nThe loss of her mother and step-father pushes her into a dark hole. Therein, the only solace she finds is in connecting with people across the world through the Internet under the guise of her famous online persona: Eromanga-sensei. But she cannot even talk to Masamune face-to-face let alone leave her room. In essence, she needs help.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Masamune learns of her secret identity, he provides just that, doing what he can to slowly ease her out of her reclusion. He invites over Megumi and Elf who share common interests with the girl and who help her out in their own, supportive ways. He teams up with Sagiri again on a brand new light novel so that they can collaborate together. And, in general, his kind words and sincerity in wanting her to face her fears gently lead her out of her room.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach works, but, again, it\u2019s all very slow. She starts to open her door more regularly, and she even starts talking to more people besides just her fans and Masamune (albeit with her signature mask still on). It culminates into an important scene for her character in episode seven. Muramasa wants to defeat Masamune in their writing competition, but Sagiri, having none of that, not only walks down the steps of her own free will but also yells at Muramasa for trying to wreck the dream they pursue.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei tries to make such dreams an important part of each character, but they don\u2019t contain much in the way of a thematic presence. They relate to the characters, and they voice them at one point or another, but they are not a source of exploration or top-tier focus within the show.\\n\\n\r\nStill, they are at least consistent. Masamune wishes to watch an anime adaptation of his collaboration with Sagiri. Elf strives to create the most interesting novel in the entire world. Muramasa desires to read Masamune\u2019s genre-specific works.\\n\\n\r\nWith dreams in mind, Sagiri works hard to make Masamune\u2019s a reality as he does the same while away at the retreat. She doesn\u2019t follow through on greeting him home at the entrance to their house when he returns, but the two reminisce about their early days while \u201cwalking\u201d through the city. How they (unknowingly) spurred each other on to become the artist and writer that they are today after so many years (with another trip down the stairs too).\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, Sagiri willingly \u201cinvites\u201d Elf and Muramasa to \u201cplay\u201d in her room. Without a mask on at that. She even opens her window to say \u201cSee you!\u201d to her newfound friends as they say goodbye as well. A metaphor of sorts for her finally opening up and overcoming the troubles that have clouded her mind.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, talking to people, walking down some steps, and opening a window may not seem like much. People do all that and more within a few minutes in a single day on a regular basis. But, for someone like Sagiri, who has battled with trauma for a while now, these incremental changes make for a noticeable, healthy improvement to her character and a welcome sight to see.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, beyond Sagiri\u2019s character, the rest of the cast falters. Masamune may be there to encourage his sister, but he doesn\u2019t receive as much individual progress, existing more so to let the other characters play off him instead. Elf is loud and somewhat arrogant, but the anime\u2019s attempts to expound further on her person amount to spilling her thoughts in a confession at a firefly-lit pond. Muramasa does the same during her second or so encounter with Masamune, giving the audience backstory, motive, and a resolution in one fell swoop to make room for her secondary seat on the train to nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei also juggles with too many extraneous characters: Masamune\u2019s editor Ayame, Elf\u2019s older brother Chris, the other male light-novel author Kunimitsu, the bookstore girl Tomoe.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are technically relevant in their tangential relation to either the main cast or the fields in which they work, but they do not do enough to warrant their place within the anime. They slightly vary up the situations presented, but their inclusion rarely (if ever) impacts much of what happens in the show, taking valuable time away from Sagiri and especially the lackluster remainder of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Sagiri is the only character in the story who ends up at least worthwhile. And amidst how much the anime gets wrong otherwise, her arc demonstrates that the show can do something right without needing justifications.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the sound work within Eromanga-sensei reaches an average middle ground.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack demonstrates this argument easily enough. In most cases, it has a hard time supporting its various scenes \u2013 particularly its comedic ones. When events become slightly more hectic or otherwise sillier than normal, circus-esque tunes kick in, overbearing the interactions with their loudness and their unfitting nature. Yet the OST can prove its worth. A lighter piano-and-flute melody appears every so often, accentuating the sincerity of the show\u2019s scenes whenever it plays.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar words apply to the voice acting. Akane Fujita as Sagiri hasn\u2019t had very many main roles as of yet, but her cute responses and soft-spoken manner let her thrive as the little sister. Minami Takahashi as Elf also does well with sarcastic phrasing and a holier-than-thou attitude.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, a veteran among veterans, lends his talent to the anime, but the slight higher-pitched tone for the male teen annoys rather than works. And, for everyone in the VA process, some of the screams out of joy and anger miss the mark.\\n\\n\r\nThat initial argument also applies to the opening track and the ending track. Titled \u201cHitorigoto,\u201d the OP blares its trumpets before mixing in dainty instrumentals, a catchier beat, and harmonized singing. This combination creates a simple first half and an involved second half that results in a passable piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, \u201cadrenaline!!\u201d, includes trumpets too, but they take on more of a supportive role than stealing center stage. Plus, the rising and falling in the sounds, the bass and guitar playing, the enthusiastic \u201cYeah!\u201d shouts, the fun atmosphere of the song itself. Again, nothing special, but it remains much more consistent in its appeal.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the OST, the VA performances, the OP, and the ED have parts worth praising, parts that pass, and parts worth criticizing. A combo that places the whole music-and-sound package squarely along that middle ground.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn past reviews of mine, I have brought up my indifference to the loli archetype and how I tune out or laugh off the absurdity of the perversion this medium sometimes tags along with it in the shows I happen to pick up. I tried to do the same here. While I partially succeeded, the problem is its prevalence. It\u2019s around all the time rather than as a one-time thing. The suggestive poses, the deliberate camera angles, the constant reminders of how young they are. Each time it\u2019s ignored, the elephant in the room only grows larger.\\n\\n\r\nThat elephant gets in the way of everything else, and that \u201celse\u201d could actually be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI like Elf. Her boisterous personality and her teasing behavior made her a nice addition to the cast. I like Muramasa. Her shy, ecstatic reaction when Masamune called her on the phone got the romantic in me cheering. And I like Sagiri. Her \u201cEuaghh!\u201d at the mention of Megumi\u2019s impending arrival and her \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody by that name!\u201d deflection whenever her penname surfaced brought a smile out of me.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, if the anime ditched the underage perversion, it would not automatically fix the lack of basic execution in its different areas. Even so, it would have at least given the comedic moments and the characters a chance to shine. To revel in their fun and their cuteness. Instead, that elephant overshadows their chances.\\n\\n\r\nI have one last nitpick, and it really is a nitpick. In episode ten, the characters play a card game, but the illogical rule to always let Sagiri be the leader makes no sense. If Sagiri cannot physically select a card, just give her the last one available. Done. Because otherwise (and as what happens), the scene feels forced and eliminates different opportunities for shenanigans between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSuch an inconsequential detail shouldn\u2019t have bothered me so much, but all the ignoring I was doing made me extra attentive elsewhere in the anime. And what I found was, as the show might put it, \u201csuper-uninteresting.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei doesn\u2019t have much going for it, and even what is there doesn\u2019t hold up. The weak structure to its story. The mixed artistry. The lackluster cast. The ill-fitting music. The lost chances. No name drops here. Just chucking it, name and all, very far away.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, passable comedy cannot justify the bland events, the failed drama, the wishy-washy romance, the lack of tact, and other negative details\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, fluid animation, noticeable techniques in the artistry, and a couple of nice character designs hide the boring backgrounds, but the overly exploitive shots do not sit well\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Sagiri\u2019s battle against reclusion sees incremental, welcome changes to her person, but the faulty rest of the cast, from lackluster mains to extraneous sides, either do not receive the same dividends or contribute very little\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, with strengths and weaknesses aplenty, the OP, the ED, the OST, and the VA performances find middle ground\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, could be funny and could be cute, but the elephant in the room overshadows\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Oh god where do I even start for such an anime. Eromanga-sensei is the spiritual successor to Oreimo by the same author and it doesn't even succeed with that either. Many people bash this anime for the constant \"Fan service\" if you even wanna call it that but my biggest problem with this anime is the god awful story progression. Eromanga-Sensei is about a aspiring light novel writer who finds out his shut in sister is the artist for his stories. The concept is really cool actually it shows is the struggles light novel authors have and it could've made a really good anime butthat's not the focus of the anime its sort of the theme. The real focus is the cringey relationship between Masamune and his little sister Sagiri. Starting from I think episode four they already made it concrete that Izumi is a siscon and wants Sagiri to be his girlfriend not his sister. The story doesn't know where its going because they start introducing many characters that Izumi/Masamune starts turning down I guess Tsukasa was trying to fix the issues from Oreimo where he built up all these girls and made Kyousuke turn them all down. But why even have him turn down the girls just make the girls apart of the friend group or something, its like Tsukasa knew how much people hated that about Oreimo and just made it worse! Also the worst part that gave me a concrete rating on this anime is the ending it was like an ending of every other episode! Were they that confident that this shitshow would get them any bank? Well I guess they were right because an OVA is coming out soon and if we're following the pattern of Oreimo then they would make a season 2 and piss of the community once more. This is actually the first anime that got me GENUINELY angry, just spare your time and don't watch this anime it doesn't know what it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn short don't watch this anime there is literally no reason too watch it, not even for the meme purposes, even if your a fan of Oreimo it would likely piss you off even more because the characters from the show appear in the anime as a cameo as like rubbing salt in the wound. The only redeeming quality this anime had was Sagiri is funny at times,and can even be considered relatable, and I guess cute.",

Yet I wasn't expecting it to be half as bad as it turned out to be. I was expecting to at least get a good laugh about how bad it was but me and my friend ended up chatting more about other things during most of the episodes than actually watching the series.\r\nAnd the simple reason for that is that it's not even \"so bad it's good\".\r\nIt's boring.\r\nWhat I hated the most wasn't the whole incest plotline oreven how sexualized these 12-14 -year old characters were. What I absolutely despised was how it was claiming so hard to be a portrayal of a writer and an artist and failing so utterly badly at what it set out to do with that setup. The so called \"writer's everyday\" in the anime is shown as unrealistically as it could have been - Masamune has an all-nighter writing his novel and the next morning he's cooking breakfast for his sister and walking to school as chipper as always, after... what was it, just one energy drink?\\n\\n\r\nI call bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for Sagiri and her art. The anime does little to get into the progress of her craft, only using it as a reason for a gag or two every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nMy only question here is: why would this anime build a setup of a writer and an artist as the basis of it if they were not going to do anything at all with it?\\n\\n\r\nThere was a damn tournament arc set up on one episode and I got excited because maybe they would FINALLY shed some light into what writing is like as a creative process, perhaps show Elf and Masamune bouncing ideas off of each other and working together to better their writings.\\n\\n\r\nThe tournament arc was barely an episode long because eh, who cares about that.\\n\\n\r\nI would have far more respect for this anime as a whole if it didn't try to be anything else than what it is - an incest fanservice loli romcom. But it claims to be deeper or more meaningful by tackling the subject of being an artist without actually ever tackling it and it pisses me off.",

The art style was similar to No Game No Life which give a more vibrant color and better color contrast than any other anime making it more lively. The voice acting are nothing special too. The humor are just above right and what I find mostly facisnating is the way they delivered their love or romance. It touched me a little despitethe heavy lewd and fanservice on this anime. Just to make clear, I'm old as Masamune so it wasn't weird for me to watch this (kinda) and in fact marrying or fall in love a 6 years younger than you isn't strange at all, it pretty much like 25 years old with 31 years old which roughly the same as 10 years old and 16 years old.

So it actually looks like real life, but the only difference is that the manga drawer is a little girl here, but I like the story that there is a little girl who is good in drawing and is famous but doesn't show her face, so no one does know her in real life, which is in some aspects a bit the same as in reallife, where you don't the all the faces of the writers/drawers.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters, especially Yamada Elf, because she looks cute with her outfit and has a nice voice actor. Sagiri is cute too, but I don't like it about her that she is so distant with her brother. Her brother seems a big collector of all the manga there is and can write scripts like almost no one else can, since he is actually considered really good in the anime in comparison to all the other characters who write scripts.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a bit basic I think, so I wouldn't overreact about it and that is why I gave it an 7. So in overall I gave it an 7 too, because the anime was good, but it doesn't really have a big story and it doesn't have many soundtracks. The characters were fun and the enjoyment was good too for me so I gave both of them an 8.",

If you know Oreimo then you should probably give this a try, because it is extremely similar on how Oreimo presented itself to the world.\r\nApparently, this anime existed in a world where everyone is somewhat underage. Well, I know that this is between little sister x big brother romance. But, the only thing I can see is a 16-year-old guy getting all those 12-14-year-old cats. So, what's good for this anime?\r\nLet's look at, one thing\u2014it's artwork. Wait, A1-Pictures made this, right? The one who made Sword ArtOnline and such? Right. The artwork for Eromanga-sensei is almost perfectly polished, smooth, subtle motions and great camera movements (if you know what I am saying).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters... Izumi Sagiri herself is a perfect waifu, but if you look at her greatly with a menacing glance\u2014she's, somewhat annoying to her brother. Her personality is extremely chaotic. At first, she becomes nice to her brother, then the second she treats her brother like shit. Well, I know that it's just jealousy or not, but if you want a girl with that personality. I don't think it's not a good idea to have one yourself. It's all just personal preference, hm?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character\u2014Masamune Izumi is an example of a person with great independence and a strong sense of responsibility. Also, he has a fetish for little sisters (God, what happened to Japan...). He's kind towards anyone and is submissive, granting the demands to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, I can't put this greatly. I didn't pick up any important morals in the ending. Well, I ain't gonna spoil you or anything. Find out yourself and let me know what you truly think. So, let me put this\u2014an ambitious high school student who wants to be a great author founds out the one who makes his lewd drawings is actually his sister. A plot that you will more likely not see in real life, hm? Yes. That's the story. Oh, also he meets underage authors, etc.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating and enjoyment are at least 7.5/10. I like the humor the anime has brought, yet I fairly like the story and its ending. The thing is, this just reminds me of Oreimo. I think that it deserves its 7/10 rating.",

I found myself laughing out loud with this quite a few times and that rarely happens with me when watching some anime. Each character is given a decent amount of backstory and time to develop so that when something serious is going on with a certain character I actually feel for them. Take for example Sagiri, Sagiri is shown at the start to be a stubborn introvert that has no interest in speaking to any other people.However as time progresses we see Sagiri grow as a character to a point where she will actually socialize and help the other characters. So this is certainly not the worst anime I have ever seen but it's not the best either.",

Eitherway because of the 'siblinglove' aspect, I couldn't help but constantly feel weirded out, it was creepy.

            "content": "This was a cute, very humorous, and enjoyable story about a high school boy Masamune whose father remarries and brings a junior-high school girl named Sagiri into the home as his step-sister.  However, the parents soon leave the picture and the two are left alone in the home to more-or-less fend for themselves.  Sagiri becomes a shut-in \"hikikomori\" and Masamune is left to provide for her without actually ever seeing and talking to her directly.\r\nYou can read the plot details elsewhere but eventually the two siblings begin speaking and interacting together.  It turns out they have actually been working together all alongon-line on the internet without realizing it in the light romance novel industry, a theme that recurs several times over the course of the story.  Eventually other story writers find them and they all begin interacting together in a variety of comical encounters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story could be compared directly to its predecessor Oreimo as a \"Harem\" style anime, and is definitely PG-13 due to the subject matter being toward the more mature end of the anime spectrum, there is nothing inappropriate about any of it.  Accusations of incest either direct or implied are completely off-base as there is never any hint or intimation of that kind of relationship in this story.  There is at times expressions of familial love between brother and sister, but it never moves beyond the realm of propriety.  While it is true that Oreimo did move much further into exploring this topic, THIS anime does not.\\n\\n\r\nTwo final things:  there were a couple of \"cameos\" of Oreimo characters making appearances in this anime.  It is clear that the timeline of this story was coincident with the Oreimo storyline.  Also, the story was not ended at all, I would say that it is likely that there will be another season of Eromanga Sensei.  If so, it is my hope that they do encounter the Oreimo characters again, possibly in a more direct way in the next season.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line:  Enjoyed the series, even if the story was highly concocted and unlikely in the real world.  That's what anime is for.",

For a character focusing anime that doesn't really have a plot, it is important for the production group to be able to highlight the character that the author wanted, in this case, sagiri. The production group did a pretty good jobdisplaying the unsocialble  sagiri as the way that the author tried to portrait her in the novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe CV of the characters also did a good job with sound, being able to clearly convey the tone and feelings of the characters have during the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is just another  himouto umaru chan that is getting attention due to the cuteness of its main heroine.

First I will point out all the pros\r\nPros\r\n1. The art style was actually really good. While it looked generic, when showing Sagiri's art, they made it seem original.\r\n2. The story line wasn't a generic one. It followed the life's of two step-siblings, one artist and one's an author. I won't get into too much detail, but it had a special element to it\r\n3.Sagiri's character development was actually good. They slowly eased usinto her character, instead of rushing her, like I've seen a lot of anime's do.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\n1. The relationship between the brother and sister was a little weird. While there wasn't really much incest going on, I still felt a little uneasy about it. Even if they are step-siblings, I still find it odd to fall in love with them.\\n\\n\r\n2. There wasn't really an ending. I would say the last episode was more like a rushed ending, if you catch my drift. It didn't close out the season, some people argue that there will be a second season, but who knows for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the anime a score of 7. It wasn't a bad anime, but it did have it's negative aspects. Most anime do anyway. But don't take my word for it. Watch it yourself, and see if you enjoy it or not ~",

Which makes a lot of sense considering they are from the same author. This story is nothing but incest and pedophilia which only made me feel uncomfortable and disgusted with myself from watching this. The writing is cliche and uncomfortable giving us a lot of moments to joke about how the writingis awful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cast is nothing but cliches we've seen before in other better shows. The shy tsundere little sister, chuunibyou that thinks she's a princess, calm and collected girl, and the dense main lead. The worst part is the other two girls in this ''romantic'' plot are much better then the little sister who literally sexually harasses other people. All characters are genuinely annoying with no real reason to like or root for the cast. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: The art and animation was pretty solid coming from A-1 pictures. Though the character designs are pretty generic I like the presentation. The animation was good, but not stand out. The music was forgettable with not many stand out pieces except for the fun OP. The voice actors did a okay job at playing the characters,but nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: This anime is a true garbage pile with no reason for people to watch. Nothing about this show is stand out or is interesting. I would say pass this show if you're looking for a show that is intriguing or fun. If you're looking for a show with awful writing that will make you feel uncomfortable then this is the show for you.",

            "content": "Overall : 5/5\r\nTo summarise this review, this anime was just a bland bowl of flavourless diarrhoea from the back slot of a cow. Just a forgettable piece of garbage that I would only bother watching in that fever dream stage of the night where you just need pretty images to flash before your eyes.\r\nStory : 2/10\r\nHonestly I think the show could've gone well if it didn't go cramming so many god damn premises down your throat. I went into the anime knowing nothing about it honestly, I saw some art of the girl drawing I chose to use for my Desktop wallpaper and chrome themesince I'm quite into art myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe first bit of the story is a nice little thing of two people who've lost a close family member being forced to live under the same roof and becoming brother and sister. It's an almost interesting premise, the writer with a one-hit-wonder series stuck in a rut and his sister who refuses to leave her room and uses art as a way of therapy. My initial thoughts were that the anime was going to go into a story line where they were going to help each other recover from their grief and end up gaining friends along the way.\\n\r\nThen it got... Confusing.\\n\\n\r\nIt started shoving story lines that could've been down your throat, from the confusing harems and glimpses of what could've been the main premise and then the incest but wanting to just be brother and sister then wanting to hook up with her was just... Confusing! In the end it just turned out to be this pile of gloopy slime that didn't have... Anything! I just sat there through the twelve arrogantly long episodes not knowing where it was going. It had potential from the first episode, it could've been great and about how they were healing but it was just fan service, a bunch of characters defined only by how Tsundere they are with no plot whatsoever apart from the 'Let's all achieve our meaningless dreams with no point' cliche.  \\n\r\nAbsolute dull, painful garbage.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how I feel about this anime, the most credit I can give is the art. It's stunning visually and that was the only thing keeping me going through it all, the beautiful colours and linework that was happening before me when there weren't 13-year-old panties flashing before my eyes.\\n\r\nI stumbled across this anime because of an artsy image, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't anything really. Just forgettable and not really my taste. I couldn't really take away points because of how it wasn't my type but I couldn't add any for how forgettable and dull it seemed to me. You can go ahead and judge for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 2/10\\n\\n\r\nJust... I hate these characters. The main character could've been cool but turned out to just be blank and overall uninteresting, so I don't really have much to say about him.\\n\\n\r\nHis sister is alright, annoying how she changes her mind constantly and is so stubborn but I've seen the same character type in other animes I've watched so I didn't hate her.\\n\\n\r\nPeople think people hate the anime just because of the incest and fanservice over 13 year olds and think this is absurd because of No Game No Life being the same thing, but it's not. Shiro clearly has a crush but it's one sided, but it makes sense as younger siblings sometimes do develop crushes on their older ones before understanding how sex works, but it's entirely one sided and that makes it kind of endearing at times. Don't get me wrong, Incest is nasty business in my book but how their fear of being separated is shown is amazing, how their world seems grey when they're 'alone' and how they can only really trust each other through the trauma they had is actually kind of beautiful and an almost rare thing to be played out so nicely in anime today without it being incest like in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n In this show it's just the incest and fanservice with no real character development in between, they love each other but want to be siblings then want to hook up and it makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the princess who we see playing the piano naked. \\n\r\nI hate her. I see characters like her that are just as unbearable but this character.. This... Human being or... Elf... Is just so... Mind-numbingly frustrating. She does nothing but fit the stereotypical Tsundere algerithm and has the audacity to even be considered a character. She wants to marry the main guy but the motivation towards this from the beginning is just so out of order to me. She hasn't got a reason, she just suddenly does.\\n\r\nIn the first scene of the first episode we see Masa and Sag acknowledge each other with an almost cute scene where it's more like 'love at first sight'. Elf just yells at him in the first seen with Masa, that's it and that's all she ever does for the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSenju gave me an aneurysm. SHE IS THE WORST CHARACTER I'VE EVER SEEN. EVER. She is even worse at being a Tsundere than Elf. I can't stress my absolute hatred for this completely disjointed character. She's ridiculous, has motivations beyond reason, and could've been some kind of plot device BUT NO. She at first seems to be the shy and emotionally numbed type but then turns out to be just another Tsundere CHILD in love with Masa. She wants to crush is dream for her own dream, but her dream is to write an interesting story and read it so... What? Then she explains how bland she finds all novels apart from his ones and how annoyed she is at him. The only shot I like with her is when she's leaving and says 'If it's not interesting I'll kill you'. I honestly thought there might be a plot there, she might actually be that insane type that causes the problem in the plot but... No. Just another annoying Tsundere in the harem.\\n\\n\r\nJinno is just there saying she likes d***s for most of the anime. That's all she is really. A wonderful human being who collects friends as a hobby and celebrates the male form for a job.\\n\r\nThe rest are nothing really. Just bland oats.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the pretty colours that flashed across my screen. I didn't liked the rest. It was just bland and forgettable really with good art.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In my opinion Eromanga-sensei is simply awful and it somehow gets worse every episode. To start off the show has really generic and boring characters that go through almost no development and don't grow or change throughout the \"story\" of the show. I would say more about them except I can't remember a damn thing about any of them that's how forgettable they are. The story is basically nonexistent as it really just focuses on the competition between the dull characters' light novels and has no resolution or ending. The show ends on what is essentially a filler episode which is really jarring and itmade it feel like the show just didn't end. The show is also dependent on a bunch of really bad and intrusive fanservice that adds nothing to the characters or the story. From a visual standpoint this show looks awful. Sure there may be some interesting color choice on some of the characters occasionally but that's about it, the show feels like an abridged series there are a lot of shots with just lip flaps and no animation on the characters themselves and overall the show just feels lifeless in the animation like it was phoned in. The sound is almost as bad as the visuals the songs are really unfitting and just come out of nowhere they do nothing to enhance the scenes they are in and are really forced and distracting. I originally was going to put my enjoyment higher because I watched this show with friends in a \"so bad its good\" way, but to be honest the scenes where any of us were genuinely surprised by and laughing were few and far between since much of the show was just boring conversations and we ended up bored for most of it so I wouldn't even recommend watching this ironically. Just stay as far away from this show as you possibly can",

            "content": "There is a common theme among anime where a controversial show will get utterly destroyed by those who disliked it, and showered with unadulterated praise by those who enjoyed it. This leads, on this site anyway, to the lovers and haters blasting 1s and 10s - both of which are just wrong and uncalled for. Let me explain.\r\nThis show is not a 1; there are a few redeeming qualities the show possesses and it is far from the worst anime out there. It isn't a 10 either - the characters are mostly bland, the story is barebones with some poor arcs, and the art isflawed at times. I can't be \"objective\" as such because a review is subjective personal opinion, but I won't be hyperbolic either, so let me give my take.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Story and Characters. To my mind, the main cast of characters are mostly a pick-n-mix of reasonably well-put-together but standard tropes, doing nothing innovative but not really ruining the show either... rather than the horrid, insulting, instantly dislikable cast I was led to believe going into this. Masamune is alright as a struggling but motivated young author, driving what little plot there is with gusto; Elf Yamada is a decent rival, and friend, tsundere character who gets some surprisingly emotional moments at times. Muramasa arrives later but became my favourite character with a good background and well-paced story arc.\\n\\n\r\nThen come the bland and underdeveloped characters... Sagiri is a cute,quiet girl who loves drawing and her step brother... and that's basically her entire character, unfortunately; Ayame gets almost no screen time and just as little development; Megumin is a middle schooler who \"loves dicks\" and hates Sagiri being a shut-in. The characters are a mixed bag with some decent flavours and some bland and some outright crappy ones, but most of them didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth and I did enjoy several of the character arcs and the primary story arc of Masamune's efforts to publish his works., but the story is so barebones it doesn't push anything, and there are several arcs that fall flat completely.\\n\\n\r\nSomething important to acklowledge: I feel like I must point out two things regarding the so called \"incest\". One, they are not blood related - doesn't matter how you slice it, they aren't incestuous. So the romance here does not bother me at all. If it bothers you a lot, well this show is not for you, but it does not bother me so it does not factor into my view of the characters. Two, there's fanservice aplenty but there is zero nudity or lovemaking. The aforementoned fanservice is actually far less graphic and much less frequent than I was led to believe too, although it does get considerably more audacious towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation is fine, with a few highlights and some flawed works here and there. There's not a huge amount of sakuga in a show like this of course, but the environments and characters are mostly well-drawn; there's some awkward bits every so often, like Sagiri's calves being drawn really off in the opening title, but it's never obnoxiously bad enough to cringe, and some of the later episodes' environments and character animation are pretty enough to make up for the lapses in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design and animation was the highlight for me. The voice actors do their parts very well to my ear - although I do not speak Japanese so take that with a grain of salt - and the opening and ending themes are both catchy, upbeat and enjoyable. There is some great sound design with odd elements too, like commercials, although it never has enough brilliant detail or quality to dazzle me. It's very good overall though and the opening theme in particular is a new favourite of mine.\\n\\n\r\nBasically this anime was, to me, very simple to summarise. A sometimes funny, somewhat awkward little series with some great sound and voice acting, some nice but flawed animation, hit and miss characters and a servicable but barely-there story. It's not nearly the creepy fetish-fest you may have been informed of, but there's nothing particularly memorable either, opening song aside. I enjoyed this anime more than I disliked it, but I also doubt I'd ever bother watching it again. Give it a shot and see what you make of it.",

            "content": "Spoiler-free review.\r\nHow to start about this... this is one of those shows you must watch alone and try not to think about how sad your life is because you are watching and enjoying it. If this was a live action show it would be banned world-wide, we are talking about a harem show full of 12 years old, with mild nudity and fucked up characters. But lets go step by step.\r\nArt: 8/10. Very good and polished animation quality, movements and facial expressions are good. Opening and ending are cute, specially the dance parts. VO is also well done if it wasn't because the characters theyportray are crap, but still good. There were a few reused scenes and weirdly-drawn characters on some frames.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10. Not sure if it can even be called an story, a crappy light novel writer is working on climbing on the light novel scene and finds out the artist that was drawing his illustrations is his 12 year old little sister, which is a perverted hikikomori that draws erotic illustrations for a living. From there, more 12 years old show up to try to claim the main character's dick in a ridiculous, cringy and unrealistic way. Basically the author sexualizes the shit out of them all, sometimes during the show I almost forgot I was seeing 12 years old because of that, and then felt disgusted about myself and the creator of this. From there on is just your typical harem show, there is the fireworks episode, the beach episode, the TOURNAMENT ARC episode, and many other meaningless shit, because the main story seems to time-jump randomly to their milestones without really showing what happened (episode 11). That and the amount of coincidences that made me facepalm multiple times, specially on the relationship between the 2 main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10. Probably the worst part of it all. Let's remember again that we are talking about 12 year old girls, alright, now give them the most plain and predictable personalities ever (the tsundere imouto, the foreign blond ojou-sama, the traditional and shy ninja-girl, the genki classmate who tries to look older than she is), and now make them disgusting (the imouto is actually a perverted hikikomori that sexually harrases the other 12yo girls, the ojou-sama is actually an exhibitionist with an 8th grade syndrome, the samurai-girl loves the main character's crappy novels for no reason at all, the genki girl says she loves dicks and tries to act perverted). Alright, now think of the most stupid and plain main character you could ever think of (works hard, is kind to everyone, a bit shy, is good doing the chores, is clueless about love stuff) and make it also disgusting (basically he sexualizes 12 yo girls and is trying to fuck his little sister). And finally, make every character love the main character  for no reason at all. Yep, we got everything in one place. That's pretty much the cancer of the show, every character is ridiculously plain with stupid or unexplained motivations, and disgusting personalities for their age, BUUUTT!!!...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. I am ashamed to say I enjoyed the show. Despite the awful story and characters, the show hooks you and you find yourself wanting more, because we all are awful beings inside, and this show plays with it. I found myself smiling at many scenes, I wanted to see more, it's like a morbid feeling, like being near an accident and peeking over the crowd to see the dismembered bodies. You are aware it is disgusting, you feel like you are disgusting, but you just can't stop watching. This is the reason I gave this show a 7, because despite of everything I said above, not many shows with such huge flaws make you keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. You won't obtain anything from watching this other than plain entertainment, and feeling bad about yourself enjoying it. This is not art, this is like a kebab, you eat it, its delicious, you know its not healthy, but you keep eating, sauce keeps oozing from the kebab, your hands, your legs, your face, you are all covered in disgusting sauce, but you enjoy it a lot and you keep munching the goddamn piece of meat, because you don't think about what you are eating, but how good it makes you feel. When you are done the regrets come, but you know you will be ordering another one as soon as you get the chance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, WATCH IT ALONE.",

            "content": "What do you expect out an anime from A-1 Pictures? Interesting characters, well qualified art design, or a good plot? With their infamous hit Sword Art Online and other well known shows Blue Excorist and Erased, they have been making average shows for us to enjoy, right? Unfortuantly, I couldn't believe this is the best work they could pull off after earning so much profit to this day.\r\nEromanga Sensei is suppose to be a Romantic, Comedy, Slice of Life, and Lewd show about a Older Brother living alone with his Little Step-Sister. Before discussing the story, let's talk about how their genre was impulsive forthis show.\\n\\n\r\nRomance, it's a complicated word, but once you put into a story, you could either agree or disagree of how people could love one another. This show doesn't define that very well, rather, they try to make lewd jokes to have the characters have some sort of bonding moment, but it's quite ridiculous if that's how you think this could be satisfying to watch when all you could think about is, \"Is the Brother even going to fall in with this one? How about this one?\" What's with all the girl characters loving the main boy character? Is it his looks, passion, kindness, or his strength? We never got to know, they just say \"I love you because of this reason only.\" And that reason wouldn't exactly relate to his character. Finally, you would immediately realize in this show, the sister has a crush on the Brother, for whatever reason. Seriously, what is it? Is it the time spending together? No, because the sister is a shut in and never talked to her brother till now. What's even worse is that The Brother also does have a crush on her, WHY?!? Is it her... you know what, it doesn't matter, this show tried to think this is acceptable, but really, it's just ludicrous\\n\\n\r\nComedy, it can be funny if this were your type of humor. If you're into embrassing moments, you'll laugh your butt off, because that's the comedy. \"Is it, that can't true... I watched Oriemo from A-1 and I laugh so hard, milk started squirting out of my nose!\" Shamefully enough this is the best they can come up with, and it's not quite entertaining when you feel like it's forcing the characters to do interapproriate activities to get the audiences attention. I didn't get a laugh out of it once, because it was too bashful. Especially when you make a joke about a ten year old loving a penis.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life is just an excuse to make people think, \"Man, if this could happen in real life, I want to be part of that!\" Guess what, overall this show shouldn't even exist compared to reality. It refuses to take any of it serious if it were to even try. I think I've said enough about this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want Lewd, go watch a show about teenagers, not middle schoolers. Oreimo wasn't too much on the lewd side until it reached Season 2, which was acceptable. This isn't Oriemo, this is about middle schoolers. You could see that this show loves to show the girls bottoms as it makes its camera angles in each shot, i turn my head away because I was looking at a 10 year olds ass. I don't know why people thought it was a good idea to show lewd animations about little girls taking showers while showing off their bodies. It's disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is plain simple, The brother wants to become a successful novelist, in order to do that, he needs to publish another title for his career. You don't get to see how they do it, or why they thought that the ideas of making one (thank god), because the story was an excuse just so you can see the sister draw lewd pictures, see girls hanging out with the main character to flirt around, and excuse after excuse... \\n\\n\r\nI compare this show to Oriemo, because it copies the relationship with the characters, their interest, how they made friends, and involving a twist with the little sister revealing a suprsing secret. I don't want this to feel like a rip off of Oriemo because Oriemo actually had an idea, it didn't turned out good until the end, but it's entertainment was enjoyable to watch. Eromanga Sensei didn't make anything original, rather, it was a whole clich\u00e9 just so you can fantasize being in a relationship with these characters, it's disturbing to think about. \\n\\n\r\nThis show deserves a 4, I didn't ask for more, but I did ask for a better plot.",

            "content": "This show is unfortunately suffering from a less than desirable premise, but doesn't really deserve the treatment it gets. I went into Eromanga Sensei hearing only terrible things from my die-hard anime-loving friends, and from the general consensus on twitter and various social media websites. Allow me to preface this review by saying I watched this anime, much like I watched Oreimo years prior, going with a clear mind. I knew nothing of Oreimo's premise, but knew of Eromanga's going in. I may make comparisons with Oreimo throughout this review, which is to be expected considering the two anime share a creator.\r\nWith that being said,lets get into things. Eromanga Sensei is essentially another story of a brother who really cares for his younger sister, even though on the outside it doesn't seem like she cares much for him. Right off the bat, you can tell the dynamic you'll have between your two main characters, and just where the story will go from there. The younger sister is distant and gives her caring brother a hard time, but this of course changes as the story progresses. We learn that these two are step siblings, the mother in the equation having died prior to the start of the series. Our brother character is 15, and our sister is 12. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really attracted me to Oreimo 2 when it came out, of course a while after I'd seen Oreimo and figured out I was in for an \"Incest\" plot, was to see just how the writer could justify to his audience why they should get behind a brother and sister getting together. I may have absolutely hated Kirino as a character and rooted on as Kyousuke dated Kuroneko hoping against hope that we'd get the later pairing. Of course, we didn't, and I along with thousands of other viewers were left unsatisfied with the ending and a bit upset, so I kept that in mind while starting Eromanga Sensei. I didn't want to go in thinking there was a chance that everything could go perfectly right from a viewer's stand point...but I was shockingly shown otherwise. I wanted to be challenged, I wanted my views on incest challenged. I wanted the creator of the show to give me what I desperately seeked in Oreimo - a story that was able to justify one of the most taboo things our species identifies.\\n\\n\r\nWith Oreimo he failed, but with Eromanga Sensei, he succeeded. Now, I don't per se accept incest among blood related family members, but when it's among two people with no relation to one another except for growing up together in the same home and being around one another's parent, I can open myself up to acceptance if a story is told well enough, and the story in Eromanga Sensei did that. I didn't find myself angered over a tsundere lead that didn't deserve what she got while a cast of much nicer characters were thrown to the side. Oreimo felt wrong, and Eromanga Sensei felt oh-so-right.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune could end up with Sagiri, Megumi, Elf, or Muramasa, and it would feel like an appropriate ending in this story. It doesn't hinge upon the 'incest is wincest' ending like Oreimo did, but it would be great if that is where they went or if they went in any other direction. I will openly admit that I marathoned the show 24 hours before the writing of this review, and before that, I knew nothing of this story. I don't know how it ends in the light novels and manga, I am just going squarely off of what the anime showed. I didn't think I was going to be in for something that I enjoyed more than Oreimo, but was very glad that I did. This show took the \"sibling romance\" genre and finally gave it the story it deserved, all while sprinkling a great amount of humor, character development, fan service, and art throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThis show looked a lot better than I expected it to, had great voice acting and good use of sound effects, and some of my favorite characters in quite sometime. The show ended too abruptly for some, but I really understood the conclusion they went for. Sagiri allowed Elf and Muramasa into her room, effectively joined them in an intimate setting, and finally made friends. It wasn't Eromanga Sensei who they became friends with, it was Sagiri herself. The very last few moments of the show had Sagiri leaning out her window to say goodbye to Elf and Muramasa herself, showing she'd grown as a character and was able to take a step to help get past tragedy in her life. I think this easily set up a second series, and was the perfect close to her current character arc.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend that if you're on the fence about Eromanga Sensei, you give it a try. Don't listen to what other people have to say about it, negative or positive, just dive right in. It'll be an enjoyable experience if you keep your mind open and expect to have your preconceived notions challenged. That's what you should want from your media, something compelling that makes you really question what you believe is right.",

            "content": "My opinion, of course.\r\nEromanga-sensei - one of the most popular non-sequels during the season of Spring 2017. The light novel was by the same author as the popular series OreImo, and both share the fact that there is a relationship between a brother and a sister. It has gained a lot of supporters, and also a lot of haters.\r\nLet me get this straight: Masamune and Sagiri are not actual siblings. They're step-siblings, as their parents (Masamune's father and Sagiri's mother) got married many years after giving birth to both of them. So you don't really have to worry about the incest, or you can ignoreit.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is meant to be a comedy anime, and it does that well. But in terms of actual plot, it fails at that. Some of the decisions made by the production seem really hard to understand, it can get a little nonsensical. It does go in a bit on how to write a story and gain ideas, however. The story seems a little hard to believe with many coincidences and the fact that all the major characters are teenagers, and they are all light novel writers and an artist. The backstory may be interesting because of this. I disliked the overall execution as it didn't feel smooth to me, with sudden breaks to fanservice episodes and then backstories...\\n\\n\r\nConsistent art and good animation, have to give it to A-1. It is very colourful and pleasing to the eye. Character designs are easy to distinguish from each other and nicely designed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great, with theme songs by ClariS and TrySail, and nice background music as well. The voice actors are also really good at expressing their character, with distinguishable voices that suit their character very well. Their voices add on to the comedic power of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the different characters all have their own personalities, I do not think I found much character development as the story progressed. The relationships between these characters aren't all that complex, with pretty much all the female characters harbouring crushes on Masamune. This anime does not go very in-depth on the characters and nor does it make you think.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere is very light-hearted at all times, and I don't think there is ever a time where you feel any drama or seriousness going on. Tons of fanservice, most things that were started failed to be resolved. You may be able to find it cute or sweet about how Masamune confesses to Sagiri and how some of the characters are not afraid to come out about their feelings. It may be a bit of a downer as well to some about how they are step-siblings, either because you wish they were actual siblings, or feel like it is still a taboo subject regardless of whether they are actually blood-related or not. It might be a bit strange or awkward to some. How they came to fall for each other was probably the worst done part, it felt rushed and hard to believe.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this is the worst show that you should all hate on, which some people are doing probably to jump on some bandwagon, but it is also not a very great show, and should only be watched if you like lewd and/or imouto themes, want a laugh, or enjoy lots of fanservice and different character tropes.",

            "content": "To be completely honest, this is garbage. However, I'm being incredibly lenient on this anime because it does something well. I enjoyed it. Why would someone not enjoy this anime in the first place? It's unethical with incest relationship. How did I enjoy this anime, then? I shut my fucking brain and watched it with my dick. You see, Sagiri is not MY sister and therefore I am allowed to masturbate to her without being bullied. Ok, on a more serious note, what went wrong and what was done well?\r\nStory 2/10:\r\nThis is easily the worst aspect of this series. Why? Because this director clearly forgotto create a damned script. I'm pretty sure that one day, he woke up and got a call saying that Eromanga-sensei is going to air on TV tomorrow, and he was like - \"What the fuck bro, i'm fucking my sister, call me later.\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't have a purpose. You see, it is actually a story about a horny sister who wants to get hyperfucked by her brother. The brother also wants to insert his machine inside of her. The only saving grace is that she's adopted, which was conveniently done to avoid backlash, which actually failed. Now, another thing which makes this fine is that it's fiction and not real life. This, though, is apparently only agreed with by a few people.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise can look incredibly promising with a sister moving in and an aspiring author. There could've been an actual sister & brother relationship that focused on important things that siblings go through, but there's that unnecessary romance tag. The show decided something on the spot and decided to make every girl want the main character's \"PP\" (727). Because of this, the story centers around every girl trying to do something for Masamune (MC) or them being tsunderes and cursing at him, instead of being productive.\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying part is the main story. Masamune is an aspiring author who wants to make good stories for the world to enjoy. First of all, he got fanletters \"first\" from two different people, which didn't declare which one of was actually first. Not to mention, they're conveniently a part of the growing harem. This is actually vital, because this indicates that the show is ONLY about Masamune and his harem and NO ONE else. As shown in masterpieces such as Bakuman, writers make groups of friends, haters and heated rivals. None of that is apparent and it really feels empty. In this anime, other people do not even exist. His \"rival\" turns out to be a tsundere who wanted to bring him down because his recent works are total garbage, which i wholeheartedly agree with. Or i would, but there's absolutely not any preview of the contents of the stories any of them write. Really, for viewers like myself to appreciate what Masamune has done, i should get some insight about his works.\\n\\n\r\nThe horny siblings create manga together and guess what they're about? An amazing fighting series with great character development? No, you idiot. As you can see, writing is an entire different language used to communicate with each other. It's clearly got to be about a brother's feelings for his sister. Guess fucking what? GUESS! Masamune uses this shitty story that he made to confess to his sister. Bro, weren't you going to make an amazing series and not confess your love with a professionally licensed light novel?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has two locations. Their home and a beach. Guess what this prevents. World building. The world feels so secluded and only their home area feels a part of the world map. Because Sagiri is a NEET, she doesn't go to a lot of places, her slave of brother doesn't either and we get absolutely no new locations visited.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the anime brings us a lot of confessions and conflicts, but not a single one of them gets solved. They're brought up and left alone for the days to come. Problems such as having a fucking NEET at home, which doesn't even show signs of letting up by the end of this trash. Which makes me wonder what the fuck the point of Masamune's struggle was. At one point, he admits to stop giving a shit about her staying inside at home and having her face touch fresh air, like a normal human being. What kind of a douchebag of a brother is that?\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, every girl wants his \"PP\" (727), there is only one other guy who barely gets screentime, and the amazing potential is turned into a harem collection.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nYou know, there's always redeeming qualities of modern works. The art is fairly average, but gets the job done. The colors are incredibly bright and fit the tone of the anime and does reflect the situation they're in. During a romantic scene, the skies are beautifully colored and the usually average animation, turns fluid and captures the scene. The best part would be the  character designs which are fairly unique. Although it is fairly common designed, they're relatively memorable and have their unique design in comparison to other series. When looking at the characters, identifying them will be easy.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is nice. It does catch the once again, upbeat tone of the series. I've forgotten every single soundtrack inside the show itself, because they left no impact at all. I doubt that anyone remembers anything as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good as most other anime, because of how the emotions are depicted. This section is irrelevant, so let's move on to a more negative part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10:\\n\\n\r\nAnime has always followed a trend of characters and this is the case here. The most stereotypical characters are here and they are not memorable through their personality at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is so small, yet so big that it's bad. There are many characters introduced, but only the harem get screen time. The supporting characters could definitely be given roles where they help the storyline proceed by doing something memorable, but it feels like they're just waste of space who barely have any role at all. They just sit there as extras and watch the main girls fawn upon Masamune and ask him to penetrate them from one end to another.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no character development at all. They just stay like bricks and don't change or are given any insight at all. The same applies for relationships, where they get held-up and remain underdeveloped. One character starts off with a NEET problem, which starts off by trying to get fixed. Her tsundere nature also lessens and she turns differently. Guess what happens next? She reverts back to her completely NEET and tsundere state out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl characters feel like machines that are attracted to the male lead for no apparent reason. They don't show any individual traits and can only be described through means like \"Masamune's tsundere teaser\" or \"The girl who tried to bring down Masamune but loved him instead\". Everything is connected to him and that brings down their personality.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune feels so unserious and stupid. He doesn't seem to be serious with his work. To maintain a life alone with his fuck-buddy, he's been told to earn money. What would be the most efficient way to do that? To write stories that bring in sales; good ones. That's why his stupid confession contradicted his need of money.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6.5/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis show was enjoyable. Because of the slice of life nature with a lot of events (although incoherent), the episodes passed fast, there were some funny moments and it was nice seeing everything that happened. The romantic scenes that were not incest, were well done and left an anticipation dwelling inside of me, later to be crushed. Obviously, some moments were cringe, such as many exchanges between Sagiri and Masamune. A lot of the pointless dialogues were boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4.5/10:\\n\\n\r\nSo, what went wrong? This anime lacked correct guidance. The premise had so much potential, but took the wrong direction and ended up becoming a harem anime. There wasn't any development at all and everything was random. Everything was pointless and no conflicts were solved. The characters remained the same and the events were too conveniently based around them. \\n\\n\r\nTo enjoy this, smash the contents of your heads, open your zipper and be ready for some amazing \"PP\".",

For those who don't know LA's beliefs about incest in anime it's that the incest shown in anime either needs to be taken utterly seriouslywhen dealing with incest (such as Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai and Yosuga no Sora) or take it to the comedic nature and \"play\" around with it (like Oniichan dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne!) but to NEVER merge or go in both the extremes of the spectrum LA just stated (like Big Order for the serious motivation as a major plotline and one of the worst cases of incest being abused like this in a comedic degree Oniichan no Koto nanka Zenzen Suki ja Nai n da kara ne!!). So where does Eromanga-sensei lie?...well considering all the factors LA just noted this anime's topic of incest lies in the borderline comedic nature (from it's rampant loli fanservice) of it but takes it's family roots (such as Masamune and Sagiri not being blood siblings and Masamune caring for Sagiri as a guardian and at the same time being utterly dense about Sagiri's romantic feelings for him)...see Eromanga-sensei if anything is dangerously skirting to be on LA's bad side of incest anime but strangely it KNOWS when to keep it away from it's controversial subject matter due to it's comedic nature but at the same time, it's comedic nature gets risque in the name of both Masamune and Sagiri's \"work\".\\n\\n\r\nOk, changing subjects.............please. For characters, it does feel like Tsukasa Fushimi easily took inspiration from his previous work Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. From Sagiri Izumi voiced by Akane Fujita essentially being a less tsundere yet more lewd Kirino, Elf Yamada voiced by Minami Takahashi a more self-aware Kuroneko and Muramasa Senju voiced by Saori Oonishi a more restrained Ayase to finally Masamune Izumi voiced by Yoshitsugu Mastsuoka being a near carbon copy of Kyousuke...denseness and all. LA's favourite character would easily go to Elf Yamada as even though she at first was very annoying, once she opens up to Masamune, she became much easier to deal with and her many schemes to trip up Muramasa was amusing to say the least. Now Sagiri is one of the sources of shameless fanservice in many ways (from how the camera pans at her to just her reactions) and even some of the risque stuff she wants the other harem members to get into is in the level of absurdity (as LA said a more lewd Kirino) and her being a little sister archetype. Yeah....Sagiri easily skirts the lines between sophomoric shameless fanservice and annoying little sister.\\n\\n\r\nNow changing back to the author Tsukasa Fushimi again, but it seems that once again he essentially \"writes what he knows\" but in the light novel department and although the reality of something like this is slim at times, it is kinda interesting that Tsukasa Fushimi DOES know the reality of light novel creations and the processes to the trials and tribulations it takes (very much so for Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai's anime creation during the first season)...now mix that in to the little sister archetype plot and tons of fanservice can easily put all this down the drain but LA thinks it was saved in both ways (from it's psuedo-incest and the light novel plot altogether) by looking at writing, illustrating and creation of a light novel.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by A1-Pictures, the character designs pops out quite well and with all the characters having exotic looks strikes out in making these characters noticeable. The animation direction is too obviously moe and it runs with it along with it's rampant fanservice, but nonetheless the animation even for this kind of anime is remarkably well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well once again Akane Fujita is in the limelight and well LA as much as Eromanga-sensei as a whole, LA thought she dangerously skirted the line between annoyingly tsun and deredere when she needed to. Akane is tolerable as Sagiri but this role is more or less on thin ice and NOT Akane's worst role for Spring 2017...no there's a role she's done that is ten times as worse as Sagiri. As for the rest of the cast, LA quite enjoyed Minami Takahashi as Elf Yamada and her chunni vocals very much and she nearly got LA's favourite, but the best voice actor for this anime went to Saori Oonishi as Muramasa.\\n\\n\r\nEromanga-sensei is a rare oddity for LA, from it's rampant loli fanservice and it's constant teasing of incest (to the blatant advances Sagiri has for Masamune and Masamune being the dense main protagonist he is not noticing) but also being a bit serious when dealing with family matters in the form of creating light novels in order for Sagiri and Masamune to continue to be together and although it's not as controversial as Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, Eromanga-sensei has it's own controversial moments that does feel like it's own thing, but for LA, it couldn't overshadow Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai presences but nonetheless Tsukasa Fushimi has \"done it\" again in a ways. LA still has major problems with Eromanga-sensei especially when it concerns Sagiri, it's rampant fanservice and the entire incest topic being teased time and again but LA can clearly say from all this that Eromanga-sensei is not a bad incest anime...but it's not great either, enjoy it for it's absurdity the characters go through but roll your eyes away when it goes into obvious incest territories.",

            "content": "***A mostly spoiler free review***\r\nI should not of finished this show. Week after week (save ONE episode which was decent) I sat through this show hoping and praying it would show me something...anything that resembled a decent watch. The show seemingly adds elements in only to waste them later on.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThis is the first time that I have rated the story element so low. The show's pacing is so horrid that for some arcs they last multiple episodes with almost no progress while others are introduced and completed inside one episode. Also, please tell me there is more to this entire story than male MChopefully getting it in his head that yes his stepsister also wants his genitalia? \\n\\n\r\nI understand that this is a trash romcom comedy (very light on the actual comedy) but there are so many shows that follow the same formula yet seem to have such amazing story elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTo start off with; art. This show's artstyle is pretty meh. The characters look cute but their personalities and how they present themselves really ruin it. Also they (the studio) are sexualizing minors. Besides the male MC, all these MCs are under the age of 15. Idc where you are from that is some creepy shit. The show goes out of its way to place the camera in such dirty, awful spots even when it's a character alone on a phone. There is no comedic effect with that, it's just raw fanservice of a 12 year old. The coloring scheme is also really generic. Nothing stands out. This show looks like it was thrown together in an afternoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so barebones. There are maybe 5 or so scenes where there is a framerate buff but other than that it is below the standard of what I would expect from a trashy romcom show. It's sad that when they (the studio) try to make a sexy shot of someone's boobs swaying look like a 2 drawing flip book.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs were decent. They sounded good and somehow got some personality across to their characters (but the lines were stale and not fitting). The music however is some of the worst I have ever heard. The music is trying so fucking hard to invoke an emotional response on the viewer since what is happening on screen is so meaningless. There are great soundtracks/scores that ever so slightly help what is going on screen (and these are the great ones). Then there are ones that put a little more work into directing (not forcing) the audience to feel more emotion. This can be an effective tool (like in Hans Zimmer films) but this show goes too far and has an awful effect on the experience since it is trying to do all the heavy lifting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing. There was absolutely nothing I liked about the characters. The show doesn't help the characters spread their wings out either. Some characters (like dick girl and the bookstore attendant) just straight up disappear for multiple episodes. Was dick girl's only job to say weird, memy shit and have her panties taken off? I'm sorry but if you introduce an element (like say a character) they have to have a purpose. If that purpose is just to be a fanservice character, fuck you. \\n\\n\r\nThere is very little meaningful character development in this anime. Poor komono girl gets told to fuck off then gets strung around. What's the point of actually finishing her confession arc to just have her stick around later being dragged around and played like a fool? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.3/10\\n\\n\r\nI do not wish to offend anyone but my god please go watch...ANYTHING ELSE. There are so many more romcoms out there that do a much better job at making you interested in the show. If you want to watch this show due to the cuteness of the characters, just go watch clips of it on YouTube and/or look up gifs/screenshots online. You do not have to watch the show in order to get that enjoyment out of them. This show is one of the reasons that I am genuinely worried about anime. The fact that this show has such high ratings and retention in both the West and the East shows that the average watcher just doesn't care about well crafted works anymore. We will continue to get this half assed garbage and see less more fulfilling shows. Please if you can do not contribute to this trash. There are so many other shows/films that are more worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "(Usually I don't write reviews for ongoing animes. This will be an exception since imao its development would not change much my opinion towards it. I will make modifications to this review as the show progresses. )\r\nGeneral: It is in my assumption that almost anyone who picks up this anime has probably watched Oreimo already. Indeed they come from the same author and both have 'incest' tags, but I think this two shows are not quite as similar as people would expect. This show, especially its character interaction, is more similar to animes like Saekano (Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata) than to Oreimo, at least inmy opinion. \\n\r\nIn recent years, I have the impression that there is a boom of animes describing otaku lives and jobs. Just to name a few we have Oreimo, Umaru, Saekano, Shirobako, Sore ga Seiyuu, New Game!, Girlish Number, etc. So far Eromanga Sensei fails to distinguish itself from the multitude, relying on largely generic characters and plots. \\n\\n\r\nStory: skipped since there really isn't too much to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Most of the characters here feel very cliche, with a few exceptions. So far the MC has pretty much behaved the same way as Kyousuke in Oreimo first season. On the other hand, the heroine Sagiri (MC's sister) is fairly different from Kirino in Oreimo. I would say she is much less 'belligerent' and much gentler towards his brother, even though she could occasionally be unappreciative to her brother's care about her daily lives. In any case she appears to 'deserving' her brother's love and care much more than Kirino or say Umaru, for that matter. It is noticeable that so far there is no equivalent of Kuroneko or Ayase (though the girl with long black hair in the manga store could be an otaku-ish version of Manami) who has the potential to 'steal' her brother. Looks like the author (Fushimi Tsukasa) is determined to write a true brother-sister light romance this time. \\n\r\nAmong the other supporting characters I want to mention the small girl with orange hair, who seems to absorb all the 'bitchiness' to herself. She once said directly to MC that she loves dicks, for example. Dislikable as she is, I have to admit that she is in some sense unique, although not necessarily in a good way. \\n\r\nI won't mention other characters because they have not shown any interesting parts enough to be talked about. \\n\\n\r\nSound: ClariS (Oreimo, Madoka, Nisekoi) performed the opening, and TrySail (High School Fleet) performed the ending. Being established singer groups (especially ClariS) their songs are stable, if not particular catchy. \\n\r\nFor voice acting, Matsuoka as a veteran voice actor, especially of otaku characters (Sora@NGNL, Aki Tomoya@Saekano) and elder brothers (Sora, Kirito@SAO), is of course adept in performing here. The heroine is done by a relatively less known voice actress, who nevertheless handled very well a variety of different voices. Other voice acting seems also decent to me. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 5.5-6/10 Fairly made for a mediocre show",

            "content": "like i've said on my profile page, I usually only rate an anime that is at least a 9/10, for me, but i felt obligated to write one since it is one of my first completed seasonal anime. \r\nThus, let me sum up this anime with two words: \"Overrated\" and \"Over-hyped\". To be honest I came into this with low expectations since i usually don't watch these types of anime, but even then i was quite disappointed. \r\nOh, and I didn't factor the art or the sound into the overall score. because i usually have very very low standards for those, and its a newanime so it should have good art and sound. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nits just a story that isn't great, but it isn't that bad either. the basic premise is that a relationship is supposed to start between two step-siblings who are also connected through their collaboration on lewd manga. Yes this is a major oversimplification of the plot, but even then it failed at that. Progression wise, there was none. Romance wise there was little. a big part of it was comedy, but even then the comedy wasn't funny. but like I pointed out before, progression wise there is none. and thats where it really fails for me. I don't particularly enjoy incest, but i did go into this with an open mind to the romance of it, but even then I was disappointed. The entire series might as well be an intro and filler episodes. Nothing of importance happens, nothing of any real substance happens either. no progression of any sort of romance. No progression of any semblance of a relationship beyond platonic friends. no progression of any story. So a plot-less story that doesn't really do anything wrong, but also excels at nothing. It's pretty much below average, a painfully realistic incest story. which is another reason why it sucks because in the realm of anime it should be able to explore themes that are generally forbidden or taboo in society (such as incest), but in this one it doesn't even do that properly. Anime pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable in society, but this anime with it's obvious incest undertones did not even dip a toe into those waters. So overall, its not funny, its not dramatic, nor is it romantic. quite sad. As for good parts, uhm... there is a good goal i guess of being a manga writer but even then, goal not entirely realized. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWell art is crisp and animation is fluid. its what you would expect from an anime that is new and just finished airing. Character designs were probably the only redeeming part of it, as the character designs I could actually appreciate. However it does fall into the MCHWCH trap (Main Character Has Weird Colored Hair) as almost all of the girls have hair colors that are not considered \"realistic\" but thats just a preferential thing for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI gave it a 7, but mostly for the animation within the songs, in particular the Closing song. a cute, short, and lively dance from Sagiri was the only thing I looked forward to in this anime, and thats saying quite a bit, as I hate almost every opening/closing song (to me its a waste of time). But they did take that out in the last few episodes so... Uhm anyways the voice actors were great, they matched the character's personalities well, but that is also kinda expected for an anime of this day and age.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBasically trash. little to no character progression. They basically go through the same motions for 12 episodes, or whenever they decide to appear. And on top of that the characters are all the same. Each girl that enters first dislikes the MC, but later on wants to get it on with him. the MC on the other hand, is just the same as any generic dense harem MC who either doesn't know or doesn't give  any craps about it. Not only that, but none of the girls become clear frontrunners, they all are too shy to admit that they like the MC, basically a bunch of tsuns around a dense MC who doesn't see the harem forming around him because the characters are tsuns. so a boring story for something labeled a romance. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nyou can probably already tell. I didn't enjoy this much. 3 points basically adds up as \"character design\" + \"decent VAs\" + \"Sagiri dance\" = 3. which is literally that. \\\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nits 1 episode of set up and 11 episodes of filler. its Over-hyped and overrated. It has nice character designs and thats about it. If theres one thing about it that's good, its that it is consistent. Consistently bad that is. Its predictable, and doesn't tackle any sort of real problems, and on top of that there isn't any good ecchi to reedeem itself. So yea I guess this is going to be the shortest math equation to my overall score that I've ever given so here goes: 1 for character design + 1 for sound = 2 overall. \\n\\n\r\nIt just does nothing right other than that.",

Just to suffer?\"\r\nWhat can I say. It is not really possible to spoil Eromanga-sensei, because there really is nothing in the story that a regular fan of anime has not already seen a thousand times over. This show is one of those things you creep out people who haven't seen anything like it- lolicon, siscon, domination. Unlike Domestic na Kanojo (which I would contend was making its point about legitimising sexual relationships between step-siblingsand between a student and a teacher to an extent where it gets almost political, since most of the major characters don't have a problem with it), the parents in Eromanga-sensei are absent, making it no different from the pseudo-incest hentai that portray such relationships. Of course, while the hentai features the siblings having sex with each other, the absence here is used to portray characters who recreate yet another harem around the pathetic male-character who just can't seem to say or do anything wrong in front of the ever-increasing coterie of girls who like him.\\n\\n\r\nI have never felt true despair like I did while watching this show. Pigeon Blood was at least offensive. This is just stuffed to the throat with time-tested tropes that will never offend enough to anyone who has seen enough anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen enough anime. \\n\\n\r\nOh no.",

            "content": "TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.\r\nEromanga-sensei is trash... and so am I.\r\nIn the great words of gigguk, this show is a \"modern masterpiece... of trash.\" The entire idealization of OreImo is a story on it's own, but Eromanga has found yet another way to make \"incest in wincest\" really cruel to watch. With the age cap being at 12, the whole basis of the show is to weed out the people who need to go to jail for the rest of their life. \r\nThe plot of the story is that young Masamune Izumi hasbeen trying to get his younger sister (who's not related by blood) out of her room because he hasn't seen her since the day they met. As the story progresses you learn that he really wants to be a good big brother, and she really loves him and wishes he would love her back (because they aren't blood related). You can see where this is going at this point. Beyond that, you have three other twelve year-old girls who all like Masamune as well (some of them even confess!). This is the premise for a new \"dark imouto wars of 2013\" but it surprisingly doesn't really pass this point, as they sell out the fact that Sagiri (the younger sister) is supposed to be the best *because* she likes and draws ecchi. Woo. I don't think I've ever felt more disgraceful as a human being up until watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there's more to say about the art, animation, soundtrack, in the end, none of that really matters. It all comes down to the story, and whether or not you enjoyed it. If not, congrats! You belong in the group that didn't like it. You can proudly throw out your chest and say \"This show is trash!\"\\n\\n\r\nBut if you liked it? You can shamelessly throw out your chest and exclaim \"This show is trash... and so am I!\"",

            "content": "So I jumped in to this anime with neutral opinions and hoping for a show with at least a sub par plot with decent char development.\r\nYeah... Turns out you get that with 3 minute out of a 20+ per episode. Then followed up by more \"Nii-san no baaakaa!\"\r\nThe plot is intriguing at start, and char was a mystery and something to make me wonder and want to know more about them. But by ep3 thing's get stale as the plot is as common as sand is in the Caribbean. And the characters just gradually gets stale along with their development for me to personally careor want to know. I can't say more about it as I do not want to proceed with the next episode wasting my weekend of trying to finish this series. \\n\\n\r\nThough we do get good songs out of it by Claris. And praises to A1 pictures with their beautiful artstyle is a given so kudos for the sound and art.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, I was warned about this anime. I was warned.",
