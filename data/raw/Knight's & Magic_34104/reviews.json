            "content": "So, Isekai, Monster Hunter, and early day Iron-Blooded Orphans, and combining all of these parts together, you get...a terribly mediocre show! That\u2019s right, ladies and gentlemen, this show is a somewhat fun, mechanical, mess! An entertaining but very badly written Isekai show that had a ton of passion for the art of giant robots. That means despite not being very good (to the point where mediocre is giving it a bit too much credit), I can respect and enjoy it to some degree. So, why is it still mediocre, and what about all this really gets me to enjoy it aside from its spirit? Well,let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThere are...a ton of problems unfortunately with the narrative. For one, a ton of stuff is basically the narrator I explaining story beats or skipping stuff and saying what happened in between. It gives me Gundam Wing flashbacks and that is not ok. For a civilization about creating mechs to fend off beasts, knowing that they haven't made any remote innovation in the past century is rather disconcerting, especially when you consider the nature of a typical mecha show. When Ernesti (back then known as Kurata) dies in that original life, he just died without fanfare and we don't see what happened to him, let alone how he became reborn into this world. It also implies that he just basically hijacked the body of the boy he became; that's kinda fucked up. There are some real asspulls too, like how Ernesti used magic to pilot the Guair out of nowhere and how he was strong enough to pull the controls out despite other characters tugging on them quite hard just to move. I get that these run on magic, but again, this came out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other errors and dumb moments too, like when Kerhild had a chance to slay Edgar, whose Knight mech had been disabled, she (according to the visual damage since that was offscreen) simply slammed her sword into the cockpit and left instead of thrusting the sword through it to finish him. A potentially cool battle in episode 5 is skipped and given that there is some sort of war that gets ignited, the amount of time skips in development while nothing happens is disconcerting. I do like how they spend a lot of time on the building process and the camaraderie that comes of it though, even if they sorta still gloss over it. Not helping anything is the fact that Ernesti kinda dances near Gary Stu territory, nor is the fact that the pacing is a bit out of whack thanks to the obscene SAO level time skips.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are some moments that are actually pretty good, like with the king and his random duking it out for a flashy mech and showing that they're both the same basically, except one has withered a bit with age. I'm not going to really spoil too much here though despite the overall lukewarm opinion I have on the show. Even still, they can't save this pretty ravaged script that somehow gets crazier and more ludicrous in the second half. The final 5 episodes in particular are far too fast-paced given the contents within, and thus come off as disjointed that they introduce a bunch of holes and errors. I feel like they should've been their own cour to work at all, so that doesn't help matters either.\\n\\n\r\nErnesti is really OP. This kinda cuts both ways. It's nice to see that he takes his skills from his world to this one, so of course he\u2019s knowledgeable about giant robots, but to know that with all this, he also becomes a top tier magic expert who innovates there too, is a stretch. He\u2019s basically a spunky skid, and that's fun enough to see, but he does become unreasonably OP overall despite there being a good reason for some of what he can do. Unfortunately, he comes dangerously close to Gary Stu territory, always making so many advances with mainly his ideas and little outside input, having most of everything revolve around him (and I'll explain those ramifications in a bit), and being the only one to come up with crazy new  innovations, as well as some of the other aforementioned things. What\u2019s saving him a bit is his enthusiasm and passion for robots, the fact that some of what he is capable of is understandable right out the get-go, and the fact that even his stuff notably needs work, leading to himself other people being able to modify his ideas. The fact that he is a mecha enthusiast gives me some bias towards him though. The dude has fucking orgasms over this shit.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure many of us can agree that Shirley from Code Geass is not a good character, right? I mean, she\u2019s basically there to kiss up to the MC and always devote everything about her character to him, to some extent at least. Well, Adeltrud aka \u201cAddy\u201d is some next level shit! The only thing separating her from being Miyuki tier shit here is the fact they there is no incest love at all, but it is still a one-sided crush. Thankfully it sometimes gets played to admittedly humorous degrees but this is largely her character. \\n\\n\r\nThis, in particular, brings us to that whole Gary Stu issue. You see, since so much of this show is focused on Ernesti, his energy, and how awesome he is, we don't really get to see the other characters shine, a common symptom of a Gary Stu character. I'm not even gonna try to list the characterizations of the other character for this reason. I'm just thankful they don't come off as horrendous character archetypes, and some that come close, like the old man rival engineer, do get somewhat subverted (that way he isn't just a senile and jealous old coot character, he\u2019s one that eventually finds passion again, thanks to you know who) or otherwise have something to safe then from being just a bad archetype. Doesn't mean that the cast isn't bad, because it most certainly is, though again, biases to some characters like Ernesti, and the absolutely gorgeous Helvi, even though they're not actually good characters. Besides, I don't even wanna get started in the villain characters, especially the ones from the final arc, which are all terrible and generic. There are some attempts to show some character relationships but they all fall flat too, and when we are often missing useful characters, that's a problem too for an already bloated but lacking cast.\\n\\n\r\nStudio 8-Bit was in charge of this show's creation and I must say, they did a good job in the visual department. It seems I'm lucky enough to only see the works of theirs that have CGI because theirs is actually not half bad. The Silhouette Knights do have choppy frame rates in episode 1 and there is a mecha dragon that suffers from bad CGI and frame rates too, and up close, most of these don't always look very good, but the coloring and way it's done here somewhat helps remedy that, and once the kinks are ironed out, they become fun to watch in battle, both in swarming an enemy or in one on one mech combat. Those sequences are insanely fast paced and done very well, especially when we see how they take advantage of the new equipment. They're based on knight armor so they definitely don't look as appealing or potentially iconic as say, a typical Gundam, but these designs are nice enough that I can see decent toy sales of them. Those swords look especially cool. The CGI demon beasts look even better, especially that giant beast that looks like a gigantic blue Avalugg. The giant magic rods don't look nearly as good, unfortunately. Still, the CGI, on the whole, is actually pretty decent, though most kept inconsistent and certainly not great.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual art is pretty nice too, not just for the characters (just look at the way they did Ernesti\u2019s hair, that looks sick af) but especially for the magic. I especially love what they did with the eyes. The shading for the magic fire attacks looks splendid, really selling how much of a spectacle magic can be, even though it becomes a bit overused and therefore lose its luster. The animation is overall pretty decent too, even with a few minor errors like having one scene show 3 explosion dots towards the center and the moment afterwards having those dots much farther away, but it all looks good, especially coupled with the luckily very kinetic action. Sometimes we even see beasts in 2D and they look ok. Characters don't always blend well though, so that's a fault. Overall, this show looks nice. The reused animation is also very minor, so that's alright, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't as noteworthy, unfortunately. For one, I don't care for the OPs. I don't think they entirely fit the tone or setting here this series presents overall and they're ok at best songs on their own. The OST is pretty decent though. There are some decent if unmemorable tracks that often fit the scenarios well, especially in most of the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha battles were pretty fun for most part and so were the big battles against some of the demon beasts. This show's attitude towards mechs also greatly appealed to me. That being said, the crypt kind of annoyed me at times and on the whole, it wasn't as fun as it could've been thanks to that, especially in the final five episodes which left me woefully disappointed. I still had enough enjoyment with this one, more than I should have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are the makings of a good show here. Give it two cours and tidy up all the errors and the show would've been fine. I admire the spunk this show has and as a mecha nerd, this spoke to me somewhat, but it's inner workings are really on the fritz, like a loose Gunpla Kit. Shame since for a while, I probably would've recommended this series despite its faults but boy are they too many for me to safely recommend to anyone who isn't either highly interested in the concept of high fantasy crossing with mecha, a total mech nerd like myself, or really into overpowered protagonists. There are plenty of better mech shows with even better action, but this is at least one of the better Isekai shows I've seen, which speaks to the low quality of these kinds of shows. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic seemed designed for one purpose and one purpose only: showing off mechs and the battles between them. So in order to fulfil that purpose Knight's & Magic had the brilliant idea of cutting out all the unnecessary \"filler\" that isn't that. And in the process that made the show devoid to of any real weight in it.\r\nKnight's & Magic is one of the many light novel adaptations that have decided to make up for their limited advertising time by speeding up their show. It's really a bad idea. Light Novel Adaptations are designed to sell and while I understand the want toget to the biggest events so they can really sell the show it doesn't make for a good story to rush to those events. Not only does it take away from the plot and character development but it just makes the show feel that much more hallow. Important points are just glossed over. They more often summarize things that happen than they do actually show it happening. And while it at least sets up what is needed to know for what happens later, it fails at being an entertaining work. It's just like history class. Things got a lot more interesting when it was made into a story, and a lot less interesting when it was simplified down to facts. Knight's & Magic try to reduce it down to facts and it makes it less interesting. I'm not sure how making it less interesting is going to end up selling more light novels, but it's what they decided to go with.\\n\\n\r\nEvery scene that they rush through feels so hallow and unconvincing. It doesn't feel like the narrative being played out, it feels like a poorly done summary play. The character's hearts don't feel in the actions that we see, and they're grazed through so fast that it's impossible to really get a feel or the character's emotions or feel along with them. It also makes things get tied up way too easily or reduces too many lines down to catch-all lines that don't feel natural in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the lack of character development. It's really hard to develop characters when their screen time is so minimal. And when all they do while they're on screen is go with the one trait they've been allowed to express they aren't very interesting. It's hard to care about any of the characters when they're that flat, and when one doesn't care about the characters it does kill a lot of the tension of wanting a certain victor. I mean if the audience doesn't care, then where's the weight behind the battles? Only Ernie is able to have time to shine, and at the very least he's distinct. Although he happens to be a typical isekai protagonist who can do nothing wrong. He's unrealistically overpowered and seems to be able to do everything that he ever needs to. And he's still the best character in the show. That's just how bland and one note the whole cast is as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the true problem with Knight's & Magic. The audience needs to somehow find some reason to care about bland flat characters that get very little screentime. It basically relies on Ernie and his charisma to carry the show, and if you're not on board with that, then what drives the tension of the show. What makes all of that summary with it. It basically becomes mech battles and summary. And personally, I don't find that to be a very entertaining. Now if you like mech battles, then you might enjoy Mech Battles & Summary, but if you don't there's really nothing to latch onto here. The mech battles are well done, and at the very least they do pace the action a lot better. Although without caring about the fights this can leave one even more bored. They spend so much more time on battles, it does get tiring and uninteresting after a while if one is not a fan of action. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values are not bad, and that does make it enjoyable if one likes action, but if someone wants something that stands up on its own or has something to it, Knight's & Magic just doesn't. Poor characters and summarization do not make for a good anime, and that's pretty much what Knight's & Magic is. While there are good ideas in the show they're so poorly executed and so rushed through that it just doesn't work. It's one of the worst adaptations I've seen due to this skipping. It could have fleshed out itself so much more. I could have gave life to its characters. But it decided not to, and because of that, it ended up just a hallow shell of what could have been. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Like the others that have reviewed this Anime I'll preface my review by saying its too soon to see where this anime is going.\r\nIf you really like stories with weight and intrigue you're in the wrong place.\r\nThe story is very upbeat the entire time and there is nothing wrong with that, not every story needs to have a suckerpunch grim dark twist to be enjoyable. I think one of my favorite things about this 'light novel-esque' anime is it doesn't fall into the trap of trying to be as edgy as possible for appeal (looking at you sword art).\r\nOne plot point specifically so far iswhen a pilot flees from a fight for fear of death. It seems like he is going to be demonized for it, however when the protagonist praises him and points out that he was useful for other reasons he finds renewed vigor.\\n\\n\r\nIt's great because before the incident the guy seemed cocky, then turned out a coward, but now is a pretty great character who I love to see on screen. Suddenly he is determined and working hard. GOOD DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DARK OR GRITTY TO BE GOOD DEVELOPMENT.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what this show really excels at is being a passionate R&D mecha anime. Maybe I missed the predecesor but in my experience this is the first mech anime that has shown so much of the inner working of the machines in its world.\\n\\n\r\nI was really on the fence since the characters are bleh and not much happens in the first episode. Then the second episode captivates you with its CG mecha sequences.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things the show does so well is keeping the mecha CG. It keeps it from giving the gross switch to CG from hand drawn that has always upset me in so many other anime. The detail put into the models, and I'll use this word again, the passion you can see that goes into the CG animation is outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nI was still however on the fence, since as others have mentioned the characters are cliched and forced tropes. Outside of the Dwarves who are just developing cool gadgets and mantaining the mecha, everyone is meh. Speaking of lets talk about episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 3 the protag is challenged in proving his worth so that he can continue on his path of building a custom mecha. So he begins suggesting upgrades to the current mecha in assembly. Well the entire episode is just the development of this new style of mecha and its such a joy to watch!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the show might not be the next big thing that breaks from the mold. It is however worthy in my eyes to stand with the other giants of mecha (Excluding evangalion from the list because their bots are monsters), Gundam [Iron Blooded Orphans], Gurren Lagann, Code geass.",

            "content": "Anime have brought as a variety of shows that base on real life situations. Along with it are life lessons, curiosity, romance and other things that are related to the human world. But also, anime have brought as fictional things or scientific possibility that could be possible on real life like mechas, time travel, monsters, impossible stories, superpowers and fictional characters.\r\nThis Summer 2017 season line-up of anime have been pretty simple. There's the common romance genre, isekai genre everywhere, action/fighting , Game with psychological and crazy stuffs, and comedy of course. Hidden beneath the sides of it are the ''Mecha'' genre. A genre that focuseson fictional (but soon to be non-fictional on the real world) things called ''Robots''. I welcome you the anime called ''Knight's & Magic''. An anime that is actually an ''in another world'' or isekai but when you watch it to the fullest, you may forget that it's an isekai for some reason and it's all focus on the production of weapons of mass destruction, Robots.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nPretty simple intro into the anime. A mecha otaku died then got revived as a cute looking child that looks like a girl but its actually a boy then he got used to the new place he lives because there are robots there and then started his dream to make one for himself and ride it. What makes the story interesting is how we actually see it happened. How we see the robots and the MC do the job among with other characters to build the newly improved robots and convinced the king.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art on this anime, especially on the mechas, is amazing. I'm not a fan of robots/mecha that much but I can see how much effort the artist did on the art of the anime. Not only the mechas but also the character designs as well..\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWe can hear the mecha's fighting very clearly with it's extravagant art. Along it, is the sound. The sound really defines how mechas smash to each other. Because of this sound is not an issue on this anime. Some animes that focuses on robots, have cracky/faulty sounds and thats what makes this anime (if you are a mecha fan, or u just want a good anime) to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nWhat's lacking this anime are character developments. So far only the MC like 80% of the story is about his development. Sure, in some of the few episodes, we can seee the struggle and determination of other characters but the fact still remains that the MC is always stealing the ''developing'' part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty much enjoyable in the fields of enjoyment. You know I'm a simple guy who loves anime if the story is simple and understandable (I also love complicated and twisted stories) and the fights were fine and all. You don't need very well-written story for an anime to get some attention to the viewers. In fact, it's like ''click bait'' and all, though this click bait is enjoyable at it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I would give this anime a good ol' 7/10. The story is lacking some expression though it was a nice story-telling anime where the characters are simple introduced.\\n",

            "content": "Knight\u2019s & Magic is pure escapism for the kind of people that find giant robots cool.\r\nThe easiest way to know if the show is the kind the viewer will enjoy is to have them watch the first 3 episodes, they are designed in a way to go through all the appealing aspect the show has and will get as it goes on.\r\nThe first episode establishes the world it\u2019s set in: although a fairly standard one, it heavily goes into pushing the robots and how magic is involved when it comes to piloting them but keeps the specifcs regarding the engine as such a surprise forlater. The way it eventually builds on it\u2019s pretty underwhelming though.  The other kingdoms are very poorly defined, they\u2019re either good or bad relative to Ernesti\u2019s and the threat that were the\t behemoths just become something the main character kills to make engines. Ultimately this aspect of the show is probably the weakest in terms of the appeals.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd one has him pilot a Silhouette Knight for the first time, it\u2019s a genuinely moving moment for those the show is aimed at because it pays off what is a dozen years of the main character working as hard as he could to get better with the glee Ernesti feels when riding it, jumping around like no other Knight Runner could and taking down the giant behemoth all on his own. That giddy feeling is basically what is supposed to carry the viewer through the show. Ernesti is represents the mecha fandom arguably pretty well: obsessed with how a mech looks and its firepower regardless of whether or not the mere concept of mechas is practical or not. The show has no qualms about being a pure escapism fantasy for mecha fans which makes it so much easier to ingest: when Ernesti is faced with robots that are based off his designs, he doesn\u2019t mentally break down and realize war is bad, he just claims those machines as his own and salvages them when he defeats them. His disgust towards using units as turrets for a warship is probably one of the most relatable points of the show, his sense of aesthetic which is shared among many of the people having been expressed and challenged might seem like a pretty petty thing to get hyped over, but in the context of this show being for the people who obsess over this, it comes off as an incredibly powerful moment. Ernesti\u2019s wanting to destroy the warships near the end so that they never become popular and eventually the norm is the best sign to tell who this is for: the boy\u2019s effectively trying to hold humanity back for his selfish desire of making mechas look even cooler, if the viewer can not only accept it, but truly get behind it and support it, they\u2019ll know this anime\u2019s for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd episode goes into how it\u2019s going to distinguish itself from other Isekai anime: the conception of new Silhouette. The episode is spent on trying to make the Silhouette Knights more efficient and also find more efficient ways to build them, an aspect that is criminally underexplored in the genre. Seeing the different ways he finds to innovate already existing models and what he builds from scratch put at the forefront instead of something you find out more of by looking up the wikis is one of the most entertaining aspects of the anime. The moment ernesti reveals Ikaruga is incredibly cathartic, his dream and ideal that he thought was unachievable in front of him after a dozen years of non-stop hard work and research. The machine before he conceived Ikaruga was conceptually very interesting too, the Toy-box. It was basically a prototype machine that he tried putting any kind of idea that came to his mind, him using everything he learned into making it felt like him getting really close to the finishing line, a very rewarding feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThis show really isn\u2019t the nuanced and complex military war drama that it seems some people want it to be, it\u2019s a wish fulfillment show for those who care about plastic models and how cool and powerful humanoid robots are. In that sense, I don\u2019t think the fandom would be offended by its honest and faithful portrayal of them, if anything, they\u2019d be happy for any and all the times Ernesti gets closer to his goals and finds a new one at the end.",

I'm not tired of them and I love them but you may be. ill give it a 7 because i like it but for critics review a 5 because its really not special\\n\\n",

Well I didn\u2019t hate this anime, but I didn\u2019t like it either and I am not going to watch it again to make up my mind!\r\nAnyway, here it goes; the anime starts strong with a cool setup of Mechs run by magic and ridden by humans in a Fantasy-esque world. Add in a nice world building aspect filled with strategies and politics, you are bound to expect a hit, yet the Story and Characters hinder the overall feels of the anime. I didn\u2019t mind the narrative styleof storytelling but when they added plot jumps to that just for convenience, I suddenly wasn\u2019t a fan of it anymore! Early on it becomes apparent a lot of stuff are being cut out, so a lot of info delivered feels unnecessary which takes away the fun from the show as more time was needed for viewers to settle in with its story. Add in the fast-paced plotline to an already weak story and you have a show with very little depth to it! Plus, it didn\u2019t even make sense because for a world where science has advanced to such a degree where giant manmade robots are created and can be ridden to battle, yet they can\u2019t manage to solve their monster problem? They could have at least invented something to help give them a chance against those beasts. And our MC here gets reincarnated into this world, but they never really show how or why this happens. So, I am assuming he took someone\u2019s life which is wrong right?? Plus, the fact that the MC is a powerful person with a Mega brain of a genius & loads and loads of magic within him just cause he\u2019s the MC didn\u2019t sit well with me! I wanted more explanations and logic to this! Which is the same reaction I had with the concept of this world\u2019s science and I blame it all on those damn time skips! The final arc is set to a ridiculous pace where the anime is desperately trying to wrap everything up, thus leaving such a giant mess of plot holes that has you questioning \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d All of this leads to the show failing to connect with you since there is no real weight to it, so the sad or triumphal moments feel empty and hollow, the character motivations and emotions feel and look unreal, as if you are watching a bad play on stage! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as one-dimensional as it\u2019s story with little or no development despite having a huge cast. Ernesti is our MC who\u2019s unrealistic in every sense! He looks like a girl yet he\u2019s a boy! (Or so we are told\u2026\u2026\ud83d\ude09) I found this very distracting because it was hard for me to take this guy/girl seriously! I did like fact that the anime pokes fun at this issue by pointing it out. Anyway, he is blessed with plot armour and seems to never make any mistakes which automatically takes away all tension from the situation. He was just too good at everything which made him boring. In other words, he was too OP for my liking because he always seems to be ahead of everybody else. Even though I found his hyper and charismatic nature funny due to his reprising habit of talking nonstop about Mechs, but I didn\u2019t like the fact he wasn\u2019t developed more than a smart nerd. He does have his moments to shine and they mostly come with his obsessive nerdiness to robots! (I think he secretly gets off to it!) This however turned out to be a double-edged sword since the entire show only focuses on Ernesti. So, if you don\u2019t like him, then you probably are going to be bored here. Also, it\u2019s not just the focus of the show, rather the entire anime is arranged from Ernesti\u2019s point of view which does more bad than good in my opinion. Cause while the MC\u2019s ambitions and passion for machines were nice to behold, he is completely oblivious to everything else around him. Meaning when people die, the anime never takes it seriously just cause Ernesti never took it seriously which is a big mistake. The rest of the cast were kept to a minimum and only allowed one type of personality, so they come across bland, making it harder to care about them as the focus of the show is on the MC only. The evil scientist turned out to be a good villain in some respects, (his pokerfaced delivery with some lines were hilarious!) I particularly enjoyed how the fight between him and the MC was really about their ideals, thus they focused only on trying to one up each other! Though I didn\u2019t like the clich\u00e9d ending to the last arc and the comedic tone with which the villains were presented. \\n\\n\r\nThe one area where this anime delivers hard is its art style and animation, both of which were terrific! The CG for the mechs weren\u2019t ground-breaking but they were better than I asked for. I appreciated the efforts put in by the team in giving us one great mech fight after another. I was at awe at the handiwork of all the little details with design, clearly indicating the artist love for Mechs. Now the animation isn\u2019t perfect as some CGI just falls flat and the lagging framerate in some places are noticeable, but the rest of the animation is pulled off in such a fun and frenzy flair, that you can\u2019t help but forgive the errors! Same deduction with its art as well which is well-done, especially the magic portrayed here with all its vibrant colours and shades. And while props to the anime for doing a great job with their Sound Mixing which successfully sucks you in by bringing the action closer to you, the same cannot be said for the rest. Both the OP and ED failed to deliver, I found them very bad as they didn\u2019t fit with the tone of the anime! \\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn\u2019t a bad anime, it sets a standard for itself from the beginning and just never rises over it, rather sticks to it the whole time. First time I am seeing an anime where it clearly starts off on a Fantasy element, yet ends as a Mech! But this anime needs a Redo because there are chunks of good stuff in it, it just needs to be organized in a better way. If you enjoy Mech battles then you will find this very entertaining but outside of this, there isn\u2019t much present in the anime as nothing else stands out, so you can\u2019t recommend it to others. The show brings about good ideas but implements them poorly and they bring about many interesting characters but barely give them a chance to make an impact and that is why most of the show feels empty. It\u2019s a good one-time watch if you can get past 3 episodes, otherwise this one isn\u2019t for you.",

Although the main character is reborn into another world of his dreams, his past skill and knowledge were only briefly mentioned in the first few episodes before being lost. The amount of content feels worthy of a 25 episode full season anime, however,was compressed by focusing on pretty much the highlights of the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: B\\n\r\n8Bit does a great job with art and has a fair bit of mecha in it with Infinite Stratos and Busou Shinki, however, Knight's and Magic has a quality of art that competes with Gundams. The characters are all very well drawn and the animations feel clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: B\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime where I enjoyed the opening enough to watch it more than twice. The music fit both the mecha and isekai magical theme perfectly. The up-beat music does get you into the anime, especially during action scenes. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6-8: D-B\\n\r\nCharacters are completely down to personal preference. You either like them or you don't. I personally loved the main character's of Knight's and Magic. It does have the feel of a all-ages or kid-friendly anime, however, the well voiced, well animated characters are something I really enjoyed watching. Even though everyone seemed like they weren't aging in the span a few years worth of time-skips.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: A\\n\r\nIf you enjoy Mecha and a isekai theme where the MC introduces new technology this is an amazing anime. I enjoyed this much more than anime like Gundam or Evangelion where advanced mecha's are a standard. A intelligent, otaku like main character that astonishes the world with his knowledge from before being reborn is something I'm a complete sucker for. Cough, Isekai Smartphone, NGNL, Youjo Senki.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were many time skips and a lot of lost focus on development and character building, the most important part of any anime is how entertaining it is, and I'd say Knight's and Magic passed amazingly.",

            "content": "So far, a lot of my friends have really disliked this anime for its Plot and generic idea, but I wanna give my perspective, and why I really like this anime despite it's apparent flaws\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story is pretty generic isekai with mecha. That's really all there is to it. My friends say the story is pretty generic for the genre, and honestly, it's true. But one thing that really makes me like it so much is that, there aren't very many Isekai mecha anime that's as straightforward as this. There's no grand scheme. There's no amazing, impending danger. There's no reason to band togetheragainst a super threat. The plot doesn't pick up either. So if your looking for an action packed anime, with a plot that leaves you breathless, this anime might not fit your agenda. What makes it unique in my eyes is that, for once, it's actually an Isekai mecha genre without any of the gritty, complicated, dramatic, and passionate plot. This anime is straightforward. As Ern would describe it, it's literally a hobby. And I enjoy it. The story in itself is pretty boring, but the characters make it really something to watch. I give it an 8 not because it's amazing, but I give it an 8 simply because it's easy on the eyes to watch. It's like a light-hearted story, but with mecha. That said, the story does suffer for being not too original. There's not much world building beyond the kingdoms, and there's nothing grand about their objective. What makes it nice and good, is that it's light hearted and straightforward. I'd appreciate it if the plot picked up too, but I really like the unique theme the anime has to mecha anime that normally has a cynical view\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe character art is good. It's not too amazing, but it's easy on the eyes. It's pretty much average, but the animation is pretty fluid anyways. It's not osmething I'd give praise it for all day long, but I'd appreciate the cute character designs anyday. The visuals are also really nice to look at. Not too color heavy, and the mecha movement is pretty fluid anyways. Sometimes it looks weird though, but I'll be honest, Looking at Ern is all I really care about\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nThe opening is LIT. Fhana openings are really nice. The voice actors are really good too. The cast are really good. I don't have much complaints to this one. The opening and ending are catchy and nice, (especially he OP, I Really love it). The voice actors do a great job, and the mecha sounds and visuals are really nice\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I get from watching this anime is really unexpected. I don't really sing its praises as if its the best of the season, but it's something to watch. I enjoy the characters. But let's be honest, Ern is the best thing this show has to offer. Ernesti's character design, voice, and how the story revolves around him is what really makes me enjoy this anime more than it should make me. Ern is really cute (and here people keep praising Astolfo. Ern's my fave trap of the season), his passion for mecha is enjoyable, especially for someone like me who can also be quite the Mecha fan. The story isn't deep, it doesn't expand a lot, but how it focuses on mecha designing, Ern's hobbies of how he makes them, really comes through to me. It's straightforward, it's cute, it's light-hearted. I like it the way it is, whether the plot does pick up from here or not\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI for one, won't be giving this anime a bad score. Just cuz my friends think it's bad for its generic nature. Just cuz it's not action packed. I give it praise for what it is. And it does  a good job of doing it. Mecha is a hobby. Nothing more, nothing less. The anime really shows that message in every aspect. The enthusiasm of the Ernesti, his mecha designs, everything. It really comes through for what it wants to be, the hobby of a young boy for robots. If it started having convoluted, complicated and cynical plotline beyond his hobbies, then I'd give it a lower score since there are far better anime in general that can do better than Knights and Magic when it comes to storytelling. Some say the plot is rushed and stuff, while I agree that there are moments that it can be quite rushed, the story doesn't get boring, even during info dump segments, sicne there's enthusiasm in every line. Credit to Takahashi Rie for doing a really good job at showing that enthusiasm too",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic has shaped up to be one of the most fun and entertaining anime I've ever seen in my life, (and I've seen over 100). \r\nKnight's & Magic is very different than your typical mecha anime which focuses on convoluted stories, wars in space, politics and all that jazz. Instead, more like the Gundam Build Fighters' series, Knight's & Magic focuses on the mecha themselves. Designing and improving them, building them, upgrading them, and then of course, battling them. \r\nThe show has a very simple standard anime plot, about an Otaku who is hit by a car, likely thrown into a coma andforced to live within his mind - or was actually somehow reborn in another world while retaining his memories. Regardless, in this world, giant robots, much like the gunpla he loved to build in his world exist, and using his knowledge of robots and models, he becomes the first person in over a century to design a new mecha for the military, and soon becomes the lead mecha designer in the kingdom.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series so insanely fun and addicting, is how much it focuses on exactly what we want to see, while cutting out all the other BS. In typical Shounen fashion, Knight's & Magic feels very much like Boku No Hero Academia in the sense that all you really want is to see the characters get stronger and improve and for everyone to recognize them - and ultimately, to watch them to badass things -- and that's what you get in Knight's & Magic. Ernesti, our protaganist is a genius mech designer, he makes the coolest mechs, surprises everyone, every time, and you get a 24 minute episode watching awesome mechs be created, in detail, and then seeing them battle with fantastic choreography. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series to any fans of the battle and creation aspects of mecha anime. Fans of mecha anime like Gundam Unicorn or Iron Blooded Orphans may not like this anime, as it focuses on the mecha, not the characters or the world.",

            "content": "As an engineer, this is like some kind of fantasy porn - the idea that I could show up in a new place and get shitloads of R&D done in the here & now AND have it work on the first try was oddly satisfying, not to mention having the stuff go into limited-production without a hitch or the part where I'm beloved by an entire kingdom.\r\nI was watching this with a group of friends who read the LN; they were a little less than pleased with how much the plot is excised. Even as someone with no knowledge of the show, I was alittle peeved at how often they went with the \"exposition dump\" to speed through large chunks, and that leads into my major criticism of the show: the lack of character development. Ernesti shows up. Ernesti does good works. Ernesti is beloved. Anything and everything in between is just there to remind us of those three things - Addy's dialogue is basically \"GEE ERNIE! YOU'RE THE BEST!\" The only two characters who get anything resembling development are Archid and Edgar and it's a shame, because what glimpses we get from these two would make for a much better story. \\n\\n\r\nKnight's and Magic (why is the apostrophe there?) somewhat redeems itself in the final arc. It gives us some semblance of character development, but more importantly, it gives Ernesti a challenge requiring more just drawing up some machine and handing the drawings off to the elves. Again, it's a shame we didn't get more of this during the series; it really would have made the show a lot more fun. At least Ernesti is likable.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I will say that it's at least unique. Sure, it's \"Yet Another Isekai\" but it's not everyday we get a series which delves into the engineering aspects of building a giant fighting robot. And, for the most part, it works. The universe has consistent rules and laws of physics and very real consequences.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say it's a solid 7 (out of 10). A fun and unique concept, but it falls short on execution.",

Another thing I like is how they incorporated his old life into his new life like how he still remembers things about robots.\r\nMy last reason is that the action scenes are so cool especially when in the robots.\r\nBut even though the story is not the best I would still watch it.",

The anime glosses over details and worldbuilding in its attempt to fit as much mecha action in as possible, and, of all things, uses a narrator - a disembodied voice - to give whatever small bits of exposition they might have considered important. In this kind of anime.\r\nAs for the rest, they seem to be relatively good in comparison. The art isn't anything special, but it works well enough and delivers on the premise. Sound is okay, even if....... Characters aren't that well explained, either, due to the continued skipping of actual worldbuilding in favor of more battle scenes...\\n\r\nIn all, it's a fun series, like the LN, but this anime adaptation skips so much content it's pretty much impossible to really get into it.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nBy the time I had started watching Knights and Magic, it had been a while since I saw a mecha anime, especially one that was set in a medieval fantasy, with an MC that seemed like the Tony Stark of building Mecha's. \r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story begins a lot like Youjo Senki, where our MC dies and is reborn in another world, the only difference is that one is set in an alternate world war, while this anime is set in a medieval fantasy.\r\nOur MC Ernesti basically wants to build the greatest Silhouette Knight ever, so with the help of his friends and manyother people he manages to impress, he tries to achieve this dream.\\n\r\nThe first half of the story has our characters overcoming a few obstacles, which gets them noticed allowing Ernesti to try and build a new Silhouette Knight to impress the King, there's a lot of focus on the building and testing of these new knights, which is one of the stories major strong points, because you don't see many mecha anime's showing the development of how their built, plus there were a few good fights mixed in between all of the development of the silhouette knights.\\n\r\nHowever the second half of the show decided to go down a war route, where a opposing nation decided to attack the nation our characters live in, this is where the story gets a little meh to be honest, because we've seen this before plenty of times, Code Geass being a very good example, it made me feel like the anime had lost the reason for why it existed and wanted to just be another normal mecha anime. Luckily it was still entertaining despite this cliched direction, plus the ending made it seem like it wasn't finished yet, like there's still more to tell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty mixed for me, considering only a few characters, if not just one of the characters was still in my memory by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nErnesti the male MC is pretty much the main reason why you stick around, because this guy is like the mecha version of Midoriya from Hero Academia, he's smart and really loves to make Silhouette Knights, however unlike Midoriya he doesn't tremble or fear danger, in fact he's more willing to sacrifice himself to make sure his friends survive. He was also pretty funny, because he never really knew when to shut up really and it was funny how this able to defeat some opponents he went up against.\\n\r\nAdeltrud and Archid are twins and they are Ernesti's best friends, however their roles in this show was not as impactful as I was expecting, Adeltrud's role is mainly to either hug Ernesti a lot or just get jealous whenever another female character takes an interest in him, however her playful nature does make her a fun character to have around.\\n\r\nArchid is actually even more forgettable, mainly because he doesn't do anything memorable other than when a plot device was literally made for his character, that's pretty much it for him other than being the generic secondary male character.\\n\r\nThere is also the Silhouette Knight drivers, who are Helvi, Edgar and Dietrich, they do provide some entertainment, since they love to bicker and mess around with each other in between the fighting moments, however they can be pretty damn badass during the fighting sequences.\\n\r\nOther than these guys, the rest of the characters in the show are pretty much forgettable and don't really do all that much.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the Silhouette Knights and monsters being CGI, it actually wasn't too bad, considering that the design of the Knights and monsters were very well done especially the Knights, they had a lot of variation and looked pretty damn badass in a fight. The characters weren't too bad either and I liked the way the world was set out with the whole medieval look, but having futuristic mechs at the same time, yet despite having mechs, the way they looked to me made it look like they were suited for this world.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op actually wasn't that bad, it was kinda catchy, however after a certain point they started adding in sound effects to the op which just made it annoying to listen to, luckily the ed didn't have this problem and was pretty good too, yet I feel like there was a hidden message in there that the show didn't take advantage of, then again Romance isn't really in the genres sadly.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nDespite School being in the genres, there really wasn't much for this genre to be there, when only 3 or 4 scenes had the characters in a classroom and usually it only showed Ernesti so really the school genre shouldn't be there.\\n\r\nThe action however was done quite well, it was definitely more enjoyable than Infinite Strato's action scenes, but that's the furthest I'm going to go, because even though it was fun seeing two giant mecha's going at it with each other or giant monsters, other mecha's like Gurren Lagann or Code Geass have done it miles better and the second half of the action scenes felt like they were trying to hard to be as good as Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven though the characters and story had some problems, most of the show was pretty good and for a mecha it's worth checking out, however there are better ones out there, but if you're looking for an anime that focuses more on the CGI aspect then this might be alright for you.",

            "content": "The single absolute worst thing about this entire anime is that it's named \"Knight's & Magic\" instead of \"Knights & Magic\". Mecha is typically nothing but dull over powered high tech robots that conveniently happen to have some random function to make them win when it counts and everything else in such animes is usually pooped out as a sloppy package just credible enough to impress immature boys. This one however doesn't stop at redefining robots by replacing much of their technological nature with magic, it shows off much of how they are built and how the protagonist tries to remain one step ahead ofthe eventual opposing forces by tweaking how the robots work and developing clever equipment.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest deviations from the standard mecha trash is that the characters while having a somewhat smaller roll than usual are roughly a thousand times more believable than usual. Their traits are well defined and often collide in hilarious ways that can be hard for non adults to fully appreciate. The older you are and the more you love big robots the more likely it is you'll enjoy this anime, however younger viewers with lukewarm interest in robots may still find it quite amusing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story isn't anything special it's still very enjoyable, I'd rather stories do like this one and stick to things that work than try to be unique and just end up as an incoherent mess. The art is beautiful and the sound is lovely, the only issue with the characters is that they don't get as much focus as some viewers probably want but their screen time is incredibly well spent which more than makes up for it in my book.",

            "content": "I am not sure why there are the horrible reviews with under a total score of 7, maybe because the anime wasn't for them but writen then reviews to make this anime bad is inaccaptable, however here is my review of this anime:\r\nHint: Spoilers maybe in this review, even if I try to avoid them but a review can not be out of them so it maybe the best to activated an include the Spoiler-BBCode.\r\nThe beginning was a bit wired because you are thrown in while he was at work and after that, while it was raining (waht is sometimes in most animes a badpoint so smth. bad will happen) he was in a shop to buy robots (note: he is an otaku and loves them). Then the accidant happened to him and *wooooosh* we are now in the world of Knight's and Magic and this isn't still enough; they also shown those Shilouette Knigths rigth at the beginning which isn't that bad but maybe a bit to early for now since the soul from our protagonist just arrived in his new body.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rly a bid wired because it happends that fast. Would be better if this where splitted into two or maybe three episodes if the LN allows this.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, he has seen the SKs and he fastle remembered where he was rly and this means that the fun begins because he hasn't only his knowledge about programming, he has also his knowledge about robots and that he is an otaku of it. At this point I wondered which direction will it follow since all other chars which are real childrens, are out of his age (to remember: he is 30).\\n\\n\r\nWell, a few episodes later I think that his otaku side was a bit to much for this anime, since on the kids seems to have emotins for him but he did not shown any reactions to this maybe because he knewed that he was in real 30 and not smth. arround 12 or 14 but on the other side it is fine for me since we have then not that much edgy like in other animes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, b2S:\\n\\n\r\nI think that there is a bit more stuff which has fit from the NL into the anime because most things are not in it but for this rly nice fights. But I miss the \"Magic\" in this anime. Well, there are Magic speels and also this secreat reactor uses magic and all those scripts are using magical words or phrases but it is less then what is shown from all those SKs.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the thruster engine reminds me on Gundam 00 a bit because of those green particel effects but since it isn't that much overused it is fine for me.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what was also an interesting point? Mabye the time whil he should normaly been in school but what he made there destroyes that for what a school noramly stands so here is one point which I'll remove from 10. It isn't the problem that he skipped some classes ... it is the problem that the hole school time or most of it where left out (I did not made any compares to the NL for now so I dunno what is going on in the NL while he was in school). It would be better if they have spend a bit more in this time.\\n\\n\r\nNext thing is that he not rly gets any loses in any fight for now. Well, other ones may now think \"wait, but there are a few points which you can count as a lose ...\" - No, definitly NO! A lose in such an anime should be a bit more pain as for now. The only point which I would acknowledge as loos will be that one where some SKs get stolen but thats all. And this is the 2nd point which I remove from 10 points to the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also has been rly nice is a bit more telling about those monsters. I mean that it seems that there are classifications like smaller ones but also hugh and rly dangerous ones like the behemoth class. But only two or three episodes where made arround it so those monsters hasn't have much todo in this anime which is a bit bad but only a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end we have 8/10 points for the Story. Maybe we will get a 2nd Season of it which will have a few more episodes and a detailed story as for now.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what is to say over the Art? Nothing! Why? Because I don't see anything what should be wrong with it. At the beginning we have a normal city, with buildings and streets and so on. Modern technic as well and all other stuff from the world.\\n\\n\r\nAt the place where the hole story rly happends we have all things known from the kingdome age. Castles, Coaches, paths and also the clothes are not like real world clothes for our world time. Well, that we have in there modern machines which are used for figths/defensive against those monsters seems not rly to fit into the covered age but since whe have magic used in them it is ok and also they ave a nice look.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end no point removel: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, music and all other things related to it there is nothing bad to say. Effects well known like in most other animes have gotten there correct sound effects and also the music for the intro and for the outro are nice.\\n\\n\r\nMakes 10/10 for Sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chars in this anime are sometimes wired. Well, it is fine for me that our protagonist looks a bit like a girl but what is with his friends? They have had a task todo for there father which they have done so I assumed smth. bad would happend but nothing bad happend. Was this intented? Because they where not rly happy todo this task. A question which will not rly find an answere.\\n\\n\r\nAlso they are not going to growth. Means they earn knowledge but compared to the years which they are passing they are looking like at the beginning of the story and this is one point where I cutoff one out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I haven't had any problems whith the fact that some of them got merried. Since there are many hints that emotions are shown from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe scound point out of 10 goes to the Chars which are playing the evil guys in the war because they are coming out of nothing. I mean many animes have evil guys but from what I know they are not coming out of nothing. Normaly they are slightly revaled while they are planning there thing so I wondered why there was a spy in our group from our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe in a 2nd season it will be better.\\n\\n\r\nWell, even if I have removed a few points from a few categories I enjoed the anime. For me it was knew to combine magic with machines and maybe some ideas are coming from gundam 00 but not sure since there is for me only this particle things compared to it.\\n\\n\r\nWith only 13 episods it is one of the shorter animes but it's fine so that I can say in total 9/10 for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWaiting for another season :)",

            "content": "Should Knight's & Magic be even called an isekai show?\r\nKnight's & Magic's premise is on Ernesti Echevarria voiced by Rie Takahashi in which he was an otaku obsessed with robots and was reincarnated as Ernesti but the backstory of him is glossed over instead bringing world building to it's forefront of the fantasy world that Ernesti now lives in. If anything Knight's & Magic is more fantasy mecha show than isekai.\r\nSemantics out of the way...so how did Knight's & Magic fare?.\r\nKnight's & Magic has the formula of Ernesti going up in the world with his love of robots and mecha-creation driving him, but not forglory or money or power, but so that he can continue to make mecha's and make better ones that aims for his aesthetics. Now Ernesti as a character is a pure wish-fulfillment character especially for mecha fans, however he does face some resistance in the form of other nations' engineers and even Ernesti's own nation engineers wanting to one up him and in the other nation's engineers case to fight him and finally destroy him. The resistance he faces are similar to Ernesti himself just with differing ideals when it comes to mecha-creations and it's THAT reason that Ernesti wants the maligned mecha creations to be wiped out from history as Ernesti wants his own designs to shine in the world.....yeah go for the monopoly Ernesti.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, well they get the bare minimum development or screentime as the narrative is ENTIRELY focused on Ernesti's endeavors of mecha-creation. The one thing LA finds funny is that Ernesti's denseness to romance is justified because of his love of mecha's is everything to him even when he has Adeltrud Olter voiced by Ayaka Ohashi glopping him any chance she gets and is in love with him. Besides Archid Olter voiced by Shinsuke Sugawara, Ernesti's childhood friend who gets a love interest in the form of a princess who gets a bit of screentime and Dietrich Cunitz voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu who was once a cowardly Knight but changed his tune after an incident with Ernesti and some monsters, the rest of the characters are personalities and not much else really. It's the villains who are the more interesting characters in the anime, mainly Horacio Cojal voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura who believes in if mecha's can merely work it's functional, but his mecha designs are \"exotic\" to say the least that might piss Ernesti off because he's more about aesthetics. \\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of Ernesti's endeavors of mecha-creation, the world building is plentiful in this anime at the very least in the form of how mecha's are created. The anime does go into geo-political problems in the form of invasion of countries, rebels and royalty in danger but that is more or less a setting for Ernesti's gang than anything.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by 8bit, the character designs are exotic and fantasy Grecian-esque (LA is only guessing) costume designs. Ohh and elephant in the room but LA can't be the only one to think that Ernesti was a girl when LA first saw his character design and his androgynous look both costume and character-wise wasn't helping much. Mecha-designs wise, LA did like it for the majority of it and how Ernesti keeps upgrading and making them even flashier. The fighting is pretty decent though it goes through beam spamming and somewhat repetitive mecha sword-play battles were a detriment to the fighting animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, yeah does LA need to bring up Rie Takahashi crossdressing voices as the main lead, LA doesn't mind Rie's voice acting as she did a pretty good job (and is something of her forte for odd roles for her to do). Aside from the vast voice cast from Yukari Tamura, Shizuka Ito, Ayaka Ohashi, Sayaka Senbongi and Sayaka Ohara...they were greatly underutilized as yeah...Ernesti taking over the entire narrative from the start and everything.\\n\\n\r\nKnight's & Magic is your run of the mill fantasy mecha \"isekai\" anime, it's not great beyond any stretch but it's not absolutely terrible either as it DOES give Ernesti obstacles he needs to overcome, good world building in the form of mecha-creation and the mecha fights are ok enough to watch. Not great, not terrible but run of the mill and \"run of the mill\" is the best way LA can see Knight's & Magic.",

That said, it's worth watching at least two episodes to see if it can hook you the same way.\r\nI think the key to what's got me hooked on this show is the MC's passion. I find it easy to project myself onto him because of this, so there isn't really any need to build his character. In fact, it's better that he has such a one-note personality because this makes him easier to project onto.All the side characters are pretty unimportant to my enjoyment; honestly the show would do good to cut down on their screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary element which hooks me into the show is it's world. I think it's pretty interesting that magic is like programming, and every episode I look forward to further worldbuilding tidbits. The aspect about the world that I find most interesting is the robots. Every week I look forward to the MC making some new innovation on the robots.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, that's my opinion. Objectively, the story is rushed and the side characters are alright. The mechs look cool and the fights are nice and dynamic. The MC is OP and takes months to do what a whole country couldn't do in decades. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYou will like this anime if you...\\n\r\njust have low standards\\n\r\nare intrigued about the world\\n\r\ncan relate to the MC's passion\\n\r\nlike MCs who are massively overpowered",

            "content": "This is my first anime review so you might want to expect some cringe :/\r\nOnly 6 episodes of the anime has come up as of the time that I wrote this review.\r\nThe only things you need to know is that Knight's and Magic is a light novel adaptation, is usually a upbeat anime so don't expect a lot of tension or grittiness. And if your looking for an anime that has has weight and a heavy plot than you MIGHT want to skip it.\r\nAs for light novel adaptations they will most likely not have a lot of the extra information that is in the lightnovels because there is just too much extra padding and information that is added in light novels that would almost certainly be too much for a 12 or even 24 season run! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, this is a light novel adaptation and so yes a lot of stuff has been left out and multiple time skips may happen in episodes but while some might say that the story is rushed I don't think it's a very big problem!\\n\r\nWhenever a time skip happens the narrator will fill in the blanks even if it's very vague. This also happens when the story speeds up as the episodes are very fast paced so some stuff will be left out. The time skips usually just skip a couple days and you may or may not notice that in the light novel they don't have a time skip there but personally because they condense and speed up the plot you get a lot more enjoyment and \"hype\" because a lot more things will happen in one episode even if they will skim past an entire story arc that was in the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story is fast paced in certain episodes it will never feel too fast because there will be episodes that are more slow to provide a nice balance. For example if one episode is fast paced the next one will be slow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself it's almost simple enough that you could guess what would happen next but there are curve balls and twists most of the time so that doesn't happen. Overall the fast paced plot that's combined with an interesting setting like this always leads to a lot of fantastic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nI didn't expect that much in the art department but man is the animation amazing! Before I say anything else you should know that the mechas are cgi and while that might of set you the designs are very good and everything blends well together! I could see that a lot of care has been put into the animation because everything is colorful and nothing ever feels out of place.\\n\r\nThe bright colorful animation does a wonderful job for a upbeat anime like this especially with the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound isn't neither good or bad but there's a wide variety of music so that every scene feels just right. The op is a very upbeat and catchy song that fits well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique with there own quirks but nothing goes up and beyond in terms of the characters and you might even be able to know what the characters will do next but nothing about the characters are boring or bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile his may not be everyones cup of tea I really love how much of a stress reliever this show is even with a fairly complicated premise.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I would recommend everyone to watch this even if you don't think you would like this because you'll probably regret not watching it!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, Isekai, Monster Hunter, and early day Iron-Blooded Orphans, and combining all of these parts together, you get...a terribly mediocre show! That\u2019s right, ladies and gentlemen, this show is a somewhat fun, mechanical, mess! An entertaining but very badly written Isekai show that had a ton of passion for the art of giant robots. That means despite not being very good (to the point where mediocre is giving it a bit too much credit), I can respect and enjoy it to some degree. So, why is it still mediocre, and what about all this really gets me to enjoy it aside from its spirit? Well,let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThere are...a ton of problems unfortunately with the narrative. For one, a ton of stuff is basically the narrator I explaining story beats or skipping stuff and saying what happened in between. It gives me Gundam Wing flashbacks and that is not ok. For a civilization about creating mechs to fend off beasts, knowing that they haven't made any remote innovation in the past century is rather disconcerting, especially when you consider the nature of a typical mecha show. When Ernesti (back then known as Kurata) dies in that original life, he just died without fanfare and we don't see what happened to him, let alone how he became reborn into this world. It also implies that he just basically hijacked the body of the boy he became; that's kinda fucked up. There are some real asspulls too, like how Ernesti used magic to pilot the Guair out of nowhere and how he was strong enough to pull the controls out despite other characters tugging on them quite hard just to move. I get that these run on magic, but again, this came out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other errors and dumb moments too, like when Kerhild had a chance to slay Edgar, whose Knight mech had been disabled, she (according to the visual damage since that was offscreen) simply slammed her sword into the cockpit and left instead of thrusting the sword through it to finish him. A potentially cool battle in episode 5 is skipped and given that there is some sort of war that gets ignited, the amount of time skips in development while nothing happens is disconcerting. I do like how they spend a lot of time on the building process and the camaraderie that comes of it though, even if they sorta still gloss over it. Not helping anything is the fact that Ernesti kinda dances near Gary Stu territory, nor is the fact that the pacing is a bit out of whack thanks to the obscene SAO level time skips.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are some moments that are actually pretty good, like with the king and his random duking it out for a flashy mech and showing that they're both the same basically, except one has withered a bit with age. I'm not going to really spoil too much here though despite the overall lukewarm opinion I have on the show. Even still, they can't save this pretty ravaged script that somehow gets crazier and more ludicrous in the second half. The final 5 episodes in particular are far too fast-paced given the contents within, and thus come off as disjointed that they introduce a bunch of holes and errors. I feel like they should've been their own cour to work at all, so that doesn't help matters either.\\n\\n\r\nErnesti is really OP. This kinda cuts both ways. It's nice to see that he takes his skills from his world to this one, so of course he\u2019s knowledgeable about giant robots, but to know that with all this, he also becomes a top tier magic expert who innovates there too, is a stretch. He\u2019s basically a spunky skid, and that's fun enough to see, but he does become unreasonably OP overall despite there being a good reason for some of what he can do. Unfortunately, he comes dangerously close to Gary Stu territory, always making so many advances with mainly his ideas and little outside input, having most of everything revolve around him (and I'll explain those ramifications in a bit), and being the only one to come up with crazy new  innovations, as well as some of the other aforementioned things. What\u2019s saving him a bit is his enthusiasm and passion for robots, the fact that some of what he is capable of is understandable right out the get-go, and the fact that even his stuff notably needs work, leading to himself other people being able to modify his ideas. The fact that he is a mecha enthusiast gives me some bias towards him though. The dude has fucking orgasms over this shit.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure many of us can agree that Shirley from Code Geass is not a good character, right? I mean, she\u2019s basically there to kiss up to the MC and always devote everything about her character to him, to some extent at least. Well, Adeltrud aka \u201cAddy\u201d is some next level shit! The only thing separating her from being Miyuki tier shit here is the fact they there is no incest love at all, but it is still a one-sided crush. Thankfully it sometimes gets played to admittedly humorous degrees but this is largely her character. \\n\\n\r\nThis, in particular, brings us to that whole Gary Stu issue. You see, since so much of this show is focused on Ernesti, his energy, and how awesome he is, we don't really get to see the other characters shine, a common symptom of a Gary Stu character. I'm not even gonna try to list the characterizations of the other character for this reason. I'm just thankful they don't come off as horrendous character archetypes, and some that come close, like the old man rival engineer, do get somewhat subverted (that way he isn't just a senile and jealous old coot character, he\u2019s one that eventually finds passion again, thanks to you know who) or otherwise have something to safe then from being just a bad archetype. Doesn't mean that the cast isn't bad, because it most certainly is, though again, biases to some characters like Ernesti, and the absolutely gorgeous Helvi, even though they're not actually good characters. Besides, I don't even wanna get started in the villain characters, especially the ones from the final arc, which are all terrible and generic. There are some attempts to show some character relationships but they all fall flat too, and when we are often missing useful characters, that's a problem too for an already bloated but lacking cast.\\n\\n\r\nStudio 8-Bit was in charge of this show's creation and I must say, they did a good job in the visual department. It seems I'm lucky enough to only see the works of theirs that have CGI because theirs is actually not half bad. The Silhouette Knights do have choppy frame rates in episode 1 and there is a mecha dragon that suffers from bad CGI and frame rates too, and up close, most of these don't always look very good, but the coloring and way it's done here somewhat helps remedy that, and once the kinks are ironed out, they become fun to watch in battle, both in swarming an enemy or in one on one mech combat. Those sequences are insanely fast paced and done very well, especially when we see how they take advantage of the new equipment. They're based on knight armor so they definitely don't look as appealing or potentially iconic as say, a typical Gundam, but these designs are nice enough that I can see decent toy sales of them. Those swords look especially cool. The CGI demon beasts look even better, especially that giant beast that looks like a gigantic blue Avalugg. The giant magic rods don't look nearly as good, unfortunately. Still, the CGI, on the whole, is actually pretty decent, though most kept inconsistent and certainly not great.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual art is pretty nice too, not just for the characters (just look at the way they did Ernesti\u2019s hair, that looks sick af) but especially for the magic. I especially love what they did with the eyes. The shading for the magic fire attacks looks splendid, really selling how much of a spectacle magic can be, even though it becomes a bit overused and therefore lose its luster. The animation is overall pretty decent too, even with a few minor errors like having one scene show 3 explosion dots towards the center and the moment afterwards having those dots much farther away, but it all looks good, especially coupled with the luckily very kinetic action. Sometimes we even see beasts in 2D and they look ok. Characters don't always blend well though, so that's a fault. Overall, this show looks nice. The reused animation is also very minor, so that's alright, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't as noteworthy, unfortunately. For one, I don't care for the OPs. I don't think they entirely fit the tone or setting here this series presents overall and they're ok at best songs on their own. The OST is pretty decent though. There are some decent if unmemorable tracks that often fit the scenarios well, especially in most of the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha battles were pretty fun for most part and so were the big battles against some of the demon beasts. This show's attitude towards mechs also greatly appealed to me. That being said, the crypt kind of annoyed me at times and on the whole, it wasn't as fun as it could've been thanks to that, especially in the final five episodes which left me woefully disappointed. I still had enough enjoyment with this one, more than I should have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are the makings of a good show here. Give it two cours and tidy up all the errors and the show would've been fine. I admire the spunk this show has and as a mecha nerd, this spoke to me somewhat, but it's inner workings are really on the fritz, like a loose Gunpla Kit. Shame since for a while, I probably would've recommended this series despite its faults but boy are they too many for me to safely recommend to anyone who isn't either highly interested in the concept of high fantasy crossing with mecha, a total mech nerd like myself, or really into overpowered protagonists. There are plenty of better mech shows with even better action, but this is at least one of the better Isekai shows I've seen, which speaks to the low quality of these kinds of shows. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic seemed designed for one purpose and one purpose only: showing off mechs and the battles between them. So in order to fulfil that purpose Knight's & Magic had the brilliant idea of cutting out all the unnecessary \"filler\" that isn't that. And in the process that made the show devoid to of any real weight in it.\r\nKnight's & Magic is one of the many light novel adaptations that have decided to make up for their limited advertising time by speeding up their show. It's really a bad idea. Light Novel Adaptations are designed to sell and while I understand the want toget to the biggest events so they can really sell the show it doesn't make for a good story to rush to those events. Not only does it take away from the plot and character development but it just makes the show feel that much more hallow. Important points are just glossed over. They more often summarize things that happen than they do actually show it happening. And while it at least sets up what is needed to know for what happens later, it fails at being an entertaining work. It's just like history class. Things got a lot more interesting when it was made into a story, and a lot less interesting when it was simplified down to facts. Knight's & Magic try to reduce it down to facts and it makes it less interesting. I'm not sure how making it less interesting is going to end up selling more light novels, but it's what they decided to go with.\\n\\n\r\nEvery scene that they rush through feels so hallow and unconvincing. It doesn't feel like the narrative being played out, it feels like a poorly done summary play. The character's hearts don't feel in the actions that we see, and they're grazed through so fast that it's impossible to really get a feel or the character's emotions or feel along with them. It also makes things get tied up way too easily or reduces too many lines down to catch-all lines that don't feel natural in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the lack of character development. It's really hard to develop characters when their screen time is so minimal. And when all they do while they're on screen is go with the one trait they've been allowed to express they aren't very interesting. It's hard to care about any of the characters when they're that flat, and when one doesn't care about the characters it does kill a lot of the tension of wanting a certain victor. I mean if the audience doesn't care, then where's the weight behind the battles? Only Ernie is able to have time to shine, and at the very least he's distinct. Although he happens to be a typical isekai protagonist who can do nothing wrong. He's unrealistically overpowered and seems to be able to do everything that he ever needs to. And he's still the best character in the show. That's just how bland and one note the whole cast is as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the true problem with Knight's & Magic. The audience needs to somehow find some reason to care about bland flat characters that get very little screentime. It basically relies on Ernie and his charisma to carry the show, and if you're not on board with that, then what drives the tension of the show. What makes all of that summary with it. It basically becomes mech battles and summary. And personally, I don't find that to be a very entertaining. Now if you like mech battles, then you might enjoy Mech Battles & Summary, but if you don't there's really nothing to latch onto here. The mech battles are well done, and at the very least they do pace the action a lot better. Although without caring about the fights this can leave one even more bored. They spend so much more time on battles, it does get tiring and uninteresting after a while if one is not a fan of action. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values are not bad, and that does make it enjoyable if one likes action, but if someone wants something that stands up on its own or has something to it, Knight's & Magic just doesn't. Poor characters and summarization do not make for a good anime, and that's pretty much what Knight's & Magic is. While there are good ideas in the show they're so poorly executed and so rushed through that it just doesn't work. It's one of the worst adaptations I've seen due to this skipping. It could have fleshed out itself so much more. I could have gave life to its characters. But it decided not to, and because of that, it ended up just a hallow shell of what could have been. \\n\\n",

I think one of my favorite things about this 'light novel-esque' anime is it doesn't fall into the trap of trying to be as edgy as possible for appeal (looking at you sword art).\r\nOne plot point specifically so far iswhen a pilot flees from a fight for fear of death. It seems like he is going to be demonized for it, however when the protagonist praises him and points out that he was useful for other reasons he finds renewed vigor.\\n\\n\r\nIt's great because before the incident the guy seemed cocky, then turned out a coward, but now is a pretty great character who I love to see on screen. Suddenly he is determined and working hard. GOOD DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DARK OR GRITTY TO BE GOOD DEVELOPMENT.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what this show really excels at is being a passionate R&D mecha anime. Maybe I missed the predecesor but in my experience this is the first mech anime that has shown so much of the inner working of the machines in its world.\\n\\n\r\nI was really on the fence since the characters are bleh and not much happens in the first episode. Then the second episode captivates you with its CG mecha sequences.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things the show does so well is keeping the mecha CG. It keeps it from giving the gross switch to CG from hand drawn that has always upset me in so many other anime. The detail put into the models, and I'll use this word again, the passion you can see that goes into the CG animation is outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nI was still however on the fence, since as others have mentioned the characters are cliched and forced tropes. Outside of the Dwarves who are just developing cool gadgets and mantaining the mecha, everyone is meh. Speaking of lets talk about episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 3 the protag is challenged in proving his worth so that he can continue on his path of building a custom mecha. So he begins suggesting upgrades to the current mecha in assembly. Well the entire episode is just the development of this new style of mecha and its such a joy to watch!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the show might not be the next big thing that breaks from the mold. It is however worthy in my eyes to stand with the other giants of mecha (Excluding evangalion from the list because their bots are monsters), Gundam [Iron Blooded Orphans], Gurren Lagann, Code geass.",

            "content": "Anime have brought as a variety of shows that base on real life situations. Along with it are life lessons, curiosity, romance and other things that are related to the human world. But also, anime have brought as fictional things or scientific possibility that could be possible on real life like mechas, time travel, monsters, impossible stories, superpowers and fictional characters.\r\nThis Summer 2017 season line-up of anime have been pretty simple. There's the common romance genre, isekai genre everywhere, action/fighting , Game with psychological and crazy stuffs, and comedy of course. Hidden beneath the sides of it are the ''Mecha'' genre. A genre that focuseson fictional (but soon to be non-fictional on the real world) things called ''Robots''. I welcome you the anime called ''Knight's & Magic''. An anime that is actually an ''in another world'' or isekai but when you watch it to the fullest, you may forget that it's an isekai for some reason and it's all focus on the production of weapons of mass destruction, Robots.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nPretty simple intro into the anime. A mecha otaku died then got revived as a cute looking child that looks like a girl but its actually a boy then he got used to the new place he lives because there are robots there and then started his dream to make one for himself and ride it. What makes the story interesting is how we actually see it happened. How we see the robots and the MC do the job among with other characters to build the newly improved robots and convinced the king.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art on this anime, especially on the mechas, is amazing. I'm not a fan of robots/mecha that much but I can see how much effort the artist did on the art of the anime. Not only the mechas but also the character designs as well..\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWe can hear the mecha's fighting very clearly with it's extravagant art. Along it, is the sound. The sound really defines how mechas smash to each other. Because of this sound is not an issue on this anime. Some animes that focuses on robots, have cracky/faulty sounds and thats what makes this anime (if you are a mecha fan, or u just want a good anime) to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nWhat's lacking this anime are character developments. So far only the MC like 80% of the story is about his development. Sure, in some of the few episodes, we can seee the struggle and determination of other characters but the fact still remains that the MC is always stealing the ''developing'' part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty much enjoyable in the fields of enjoyment. You know I'm a simple guy who loves anime if the story is simple and understandable (I also love complicated and twisted stories) and the fights were fine and all. You don't need very well-written story for an anime to get some attention to the viewers. In fact, it's like ''click bait'' and all, though this click bait is enjoyable at it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I would give this anime a good ol' 7/10. The story is lacking some expression though it was a nice story-telling anime where the characters are simple introduced.\\n",

            "content": "Knight\u2019s & Magic is pure escapism for the kind of people that find giant robots cool.\r\nThe easiest way to know if the show is the kind the viewer will enjoy is to have them watch the first 3 episodes, they are designed in a way to go through all the appealing aspect the show has and will get as it goes on.\r\nThe first episode establishes the world it\u2019s set in: although a fairly standard one, it heavily goes into pushing the robots and how magic is involved when it comes to piloting them but keeps the specifcs regarding the engine as such a surprise forlater. The way it eventually builds on it\u2019s pretty underwhelming though.  The other kingdoms are very poorly defined, they\u2019re either good or bad relative to Ernesti\u2019s and the threat that were the\t behemoths just become something the main character kills to make engines. Ultimately this aspect of the show is probably the weakest in terms of the appeals.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd one has him pilot a Silhouette Knight for the first time, it\u2019s a genuinely moving moment for those the show is aimed at because it pays off what is a dozen years of the main character working as hard as he could to get better with the glee Ernesti feels when riding it, jumping around like no other Knight Runner could and taking down the giant behemoth all on his own. That giddy feeling is basically what is supposed to carry the viewer through the show. Ernesti is represents the mecha fandom arguably pretty well: obsessed with how a mech looks and its firepower regardless of whether or not the mere concept of mechas is practical or not. The show has no qualms about being a pure escapism fantasy for mecha fans which makes it so much easier to ingest: when Ernesti is faced with robots that are based off his designs, he doesn\u2019t mentally break down and realize war is bad, he just claims those machines as his own and salvages them when he defeats them. His disgust towards using units as turrets for a warship is probably one of the most relatable points of the show, his sense of aesthetic which is shared among many of the people having been expressed and challenged might seem like a pretty petty thing to get hyped over, but in the context of this show being for the people who obsess over this, it comes off as an incredibly powerful moment. Ernesti\u2019s wanting to destroy the warships near the end so that they never become popular and eventually the norm is the best sign to tell who this is for: the boy\u2019s effectively trying to hold humanity back for his selfish desire of making mechas look even cooler, if the viewer can not only accept it, but truly get behind it and support it, they\u2019ll know this anime\u2019s for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd episode goes into how it\u2019s going to distinguish itself from other Isekai anime: the conception of new Silhouette. The episode is spent on trying to make the Silhouette Knights more efficient and also find more efficient ways to build them, an aspect that is criminally underexplored in the genre. Seeing the different ways he finds to innovate already existing models and what he builds from scratch put at the forefront instead of something you find out more of by looking up the wikis is one of the most entertaining aspects of the anime. The moment ernesti reveals Ikaruga is incredibly cathartic, his dream and ideal that he thought was unachievable in front of him after a dozen years of non-stop hard work and research. The machine before he conceived Ikaruga was conceptually very interesting too, the Toy-box. It was basically a prototype machine that he tried putting any kind of idea that came to his mind, him using everything he learned into making it felt like him getting really close to the finishing line, a very rewarding feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThis show really isn\u2019t the nuanced and complex military war drama that it seems some people want it to be, it\u2019s a wish fulfillment show for those who care about plastic models and how cool and powerful humanoid robots are. In that sense, I don\u2019t think the fandom would be offended by its honest and faithful portrayal of them, if anything, they\u2019d be happy for any and all the times Ernesti gets closer to his goals and finds a new one at the end.",

            "content": "since it doesn't say how many episodes this has i'm gonna review it now.\r\nthis is yet another show whose plot is about a guy (otaku) being sent to another world because we will never have too many of these. our main character was a programmer in his world and on top of that the show shoves down our throat that he is a genius at it. if you watched enough anime you know that means our character is going to be a little overpowered by the climax, which he is. in this world magic is no different from programming so he gets it quickly andis really good at it and since he has retained the knowledge of our world he basically belittles everyone as he just simply knows more. also, he looks like a girl now because traps are awesome and it allows for gags.\\n\\n\r\nthe art is nothing special. it's your basic generic modern anime art and animation if you have seen it you know it and if you like it you like it. but the designs they give us are well done and inventive for a mecha. it's not like you're looking at Gundam and Gurren Laggan mechs. you might be looking at broken sword mechs though but what do you expect, there is only so much you can do with robots.\\n\\n\r\nthe music is fine, once again its what you expect and if you like it you like it same with the voice actors. if you don't have a lot of experience with anime if you like this there are a hundred others shows like it so get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nthe side characters lack significance to me. he has his friends and senpais for important reoccurring characters but they aren't much worth mentioning in a review and I've already talked about our main character. overall the characters are meh and not all that special for this genre you are not really going to get attached to them is the important part.\\n\\n\r\noverall, it another generic boy meets another world story. I'm not tired of them and I love them but you may be. ill give it a 7 because i like it but for critics review a 5 because its really not special\\n\\n",

Well I didn\u2019t hate this anime, but I didn\u2019t like it either and I am not going to watch it again to make up my mind!\r\nAnyway, here it goes; the anime starts strong with a cool setup of Mechs run by magic and ridden by humans in a Fantasy-esque world. Add in a nice world building aspect filled with strategies and politics, you are bound to expect a hit, yet the Story and Characters hinder the overall feels of the anime. I didn\u2019t mind the narrative styleof storytelling but when they added plot jumps to that just for convenience, I suddenly wasn\u2019t a fan of it anymore! Early on it becomes apparent a lot of stuff are being cut out, so a lot of info delivered feels unnecessary which takes away the fun from the show as more time was needed for viewers to settle in with its story. Add in the fast-paced plotline to an already weak story and you have a show with very little depth to it! Plus, it didn\u2019t even make sense because for a world where science has advanced to such a degree where giant manmade robots are created and can be ridden to battle, yet they can\u2019t manage to solve their monster problem? They could have at least invented something to help give them a chance against those beasts. And our MC here gets reincarnated into this world, but they never really show how or why this happens. So, I am assuming he took someone\u2019s life which is wrong right?? Plus, the fact that the MC is a powerful person with a Mega brain of a genius & loads and loads of magic within him just cause he\u2019s the MC didn\u2019t sit well with me! I wanted more explanations and logic to this! Which is the same reaction I had with the concept of this world\u2019s science and I blame it all on those damn time skips! The final arc is set to a ridiculous pace where the anime is desperately trying to wrap everything up, thus leaving such a giant mess of plot holes that has you questioning \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d All of this leads to the show failing to connect with you since there is no real weight to it, so the sad or triumphal moments feel empty and hollow, the character motivations and emotions feel and look unreal, as if you are watching a bad play on stage! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as one-dimensional as it\u2019s story with little or no development despite having a huge cast. Ernesti is our MC who\u2019s unrealistic in every sense! He looks like a girl yet he\u2019s a boy! (Or so we are told\u2026\u2026\ud83d\ude09) I found this very distracting because it was hard for me to take this guy/girl seriously! I did like fact that the anime pokes fun at this issue by pointing it out. Anyway, he is blessed with plot armour and seems to never make any mistakes which automatically takes away all tension from the situation. He was just too good at everything which made him boring. In other words, he was too OP for my liking because he always seems to be ahead of everybody else. Even though I found his hyper and charismatic nature funny due to his reprising habit of talking nonstop about Mechs, but I didn\u2019t like the fact he wasn\u2019t developed more than a smart nerd. He does have his moments to shine and they mostly come with his obsessive nerdiness to robots! (I think he secretly gets off to it!) This however turned out to be a double-edged sword since the entire show only focuses on Ernesti. So, if you don\u2019t like him, then you probably are going to be bored here. Also, it\u2019s not just the focus of the show, rather the entire anime is arranged from Ernesti\u2019s point of view which does more bad than good in my opinion. Cause while the MC\u2019s ambitions and passion for machines were nice to behold, he is completely oblivious to everything else around him. Meaning when people die, the anime never takes it seriously just cause Ernesti never took it seriously which is a big mistake. The rest of the cast were kept to a minimum and only allowed one type of personality, so they come across bland, making it harder to care about them as the focus of the show is on the MC only. The evil scientist turned out to be a good villain in some respects, (his pokerfaced delivery with some lines were hilarious!) I particularly enjoyed how the fight between him and the MC was really about their ideals, thus they focused only on trying to one up each other! Though I didn\u2019t like the clich\u00e9d ending to the last arc and the comedic tone with which the villains were presented. \\n\\n\r\nThe one area where this anime delivers hard is its art style and animation, both of which were terrific! The CG for the mechs weren\u2019t ground-breaking but they were better than I asked for. I appreciated the efforts put in by the team in giving us one great mech fight after another. I was at awe at the handiwork of all the little details with design, clearly indicating the artist love for Mechs. Now the animation isn\u2019t perfect as some CGI just falls flat and the lagging framerate in some places are noticeable, but the rest of the animation is pulled off in such a fun and frenzy flair, that you can\u2019t help but forgive the errors! Same deduction with its art as well which is well-done, especially the magic portrayed here with all its vibrant colours and shades. And while props to the anime for doing a great job with their Sound Mixing which successfully sucks you in by bringing the action closer to you, the same cannot be said for the rest. Both the OP and ED failed to deliver, I found them very bad as they didn\u2019t fit with the tone of the anime! \\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn\u2019t a bad anime, it sets a standard for itself from the beginning and just never rises over it, rather sticks to it the whole time. First time I am seeing an anime where it clearly starts off on a Fantasy element, yet ends as a Mech! But this anime needs a Redo because there are chunks of good stuff in it, it just needs to be organized in a better way. If you enjoy Mech battles then you will find this very entertaining but outside of this, there isn\u2019t much present in the anime as nothing else stands out, so you can\u2019t recommend it to others. The show brings about good ideas but implements them poorly and they bring about many interesting characters but barely give them a chance to make an impact and that is why most of the show feels empty. It\u2019s a good one-time watch if you can get past 3 episodes, otherwise this one isn\u2019t for you.",

Although the main character is reborn into another world of his dreams, his past skill and knowledge were only briefly mentioned in the first few episodes before being lost. The amount of content feels worthy of a 25 episode full season anime, however,was compressed by focusing on pretty much the highlights of the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: B\\n\r\n8Bit does a great job with art and has a fair bit of mecha in it with Infinite Stratos and Busou Shinki, however, Knight's and Magic has a quality of art that competes with Gundams. The characters are all very well drawn and the animations feel clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: B\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime where I enjoyed the opening enough to watch it more than twice. The music fit both the mecha and isekai magical theme perfectly. The up-beat music does get you into the anime, especially during action scenes. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6-8: D-B\\n\r\nCharacters are completely down to personal preference. You either like them or you don't. I personally loved the main character's of Knight's and Magic. It does have the feel of a all-ages or kid-friendly anime, however, the well voiced, well animated characters are something I really enjoyed watching. Even though everyone seemed like they weren't aging in the span a few years worth of time-skips.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: A\\n\r\nIf you enjoy Mecha and a isekai theme where the MC introduces new technology this is an amazing anime. I enjoyed this much more than anime like Gundam or Evangelion where advanced mecha's are a standard. A intelligent, otaku like main character that astonishes the world with his knowledge from before being reborn is something I'm a complete sucker for. Cough, Isekai Smartphone, NGNL, Youjo Senki.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were many time skips and a lot of lost focus on development and character building, the most important part of any anime is how entertaining it is, and I'd say Knight's and Magic passed amazingly.",

            "content": "So far, a lot of my friends have really disliked this anime for its Plot and generic idea, but I wanna give my perspective, and why I really like this anime despite it's apparent flaws\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story is pretty generic isekai with mecha. That's really all there is to it. My friends say the story is pretty generic for the genre, and honestly, it's true. But one thing that really makes me like it so much is that, there aren't very many Isekai mecha anime that's as straightforward as this. There's no grand scheme. There's no amazing, impending danger. There's no reason to band togetheragainst a super threat. The plot doesn't pick up either. So if your looking for an action packed anime, with a plot that leaves you breathless, this anime might not fit your agenda. What makes it unique in my eyes is that, for once, it's actually an Isekai mecha genre without any of the gritty, complicated, dramatic, and passionate plot. This anime is straightforward. As Ern would describe it, it's literally a hobby. And I enjoy it. The story in itself is pretty boring, but the characters make it really something to watch. I give it an 8 not because it's amazing, but I give it an 8 simply because it's easy on the eyes to watch. It's like a light-hearted story, but with mecha. That said, the story does suffer for being not too original. There's not much world building beyond the kingdoms, and there's nothing grand about their objective. What makes it nice and good, is that it's light hearted and straightforward. I'd appreciate it if the plot picked up too, but I really like the unique theme the anime has to mecha anime that normally has a cynical view\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe character art is good. It's not too amazing, but it's easy on the eyes. It's pretty much average, but the animation is pretty fluid anyways. It's not osmething I'd give praise it for all day long, but I'd appreciate the cute character designs anyday. The visuals are also really nice to look at. Not too color heavy, and the mecha movement is pretty fluid anyways. Sometimes it looks weird though, but I'll be honest, Looking at Ern is all I really care about\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nThe opening is LIT. Fhana openings are really nice. The voice actors are really good too. The cast are really good. I don't have much complaints to this one. The opening and ending are catchy and nice, (especially he OP, I Really love it). The voice actors do a great job, and the mecha sounds and visuals are really nice\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I get from watching this anime is really unexpected. I don't really sing its praises as if its the best of the season, but it's something to watch. I enjoy the characters. But let's be honest, Ern is the best thing this show has to offer. Ernesti's character design, voice, and how the story revolves around him is what really makes me enjoy this anime more than it should make me. Ern is really cute (and here people keep praising Astolfo. Ern's my fave trap of the season), his passion for mecha is enjoyable, especially for someone like me who can also be quite the Mecha fan. The story isn't deep, it doesn't expand a lot, but how it focuses on mecha designing, Ern's hobbies of how he makes them, really comes through to me. It's straightforward, it's cute, it's light-hearted. I like it the way it is, whether the plot does pick up from here or not\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI for one, won't be giving this anime a bad score. Just cuz my friends think it's bad for its generic nature. Just cuz it's not action packed. I give it praise for what it is. And it does  a good job of doing it. Mecha is a hobby. Nothing more, nothing less. The anime really shows that message in every aspect. The enthusiasm of the Ernesti, his mecha designs, everything. It really comes through for what it wants to be, the hobby of a young boy for robots. If it started having convoluted, complicated and cynical plotline beyond his hobbies, then I'd give it a lower score since there are far better anime in general that can do better than Knights and Magic when it comes to storytelling. Some say the plot is rushed and stuff, while I agree that there are moments that it can be quite rushed, the story doesn't get boring, even during info dump segments, sicne there's enthusiasm in every line. Credit to Takahashi Rie for doing a really good job at showing that enthusiasm too",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic has shaped up to be one of the most fun and entertaining anime I've ever seen in my life, (and I've seen over 100). \r\nKnight's & Magic is very different than your typical mecha anime which focuses on convoluted stories, wars in space, politics and all that jazz. Instead, more like the Gundam Build Fighters' series, Knight's & Magic focuses on the mecha themselves. Designing and improving them, building them, upgrading them, and then of course, battling them. \r\nThe show has a very simple standard anime plot, about an Otaku who is hit by a car, likely thrown into a coma andforced to live within his mind - or was actually somehow reborn in another world while retaining his memories. Regardless, in this world, giant robots, much like the gunpla he loved to build in his world exist, and using his knowledge of robots and models, he becomes the first person in over a century to design a new mecha for the military, and soon becomes the lead mecha designer in the kingdom.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series so insanely fun and addicting, is how much it focuses on exactly what we want to see, while cutting out all the other BS. In typical Shounen fashion, Knight's & Magic feels very much like Boku No Hero Academia in the sense that all you really want is to see the characters get stronger and improve and for everyone to recognize them - and ultimately, to watch them to badass things -- and that's what you get in Knight's & Magic. Ernesti, our protaganist is a genius mech designer, he makes the coolest mechs, surprises everyone, every time, and you get a 24 minute episode watching awesome mechs be created, in detail, and then seeing them battle with fantastic choreography. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series to any fans of the battle and creation aspects of mecha anime. Fans of mecha anime like Gundam Unicorn or Iron Blooded Orphans may not like this anime, as it focuses on the mecha, not the characters or the world.",

            "content": "As an engineer, this is like some kind of fantasy porn - the idea that I could show up in a new place and get shitloads of R&D done in the here & now AND have it work on the first try was oddly satisfying, not to mention having the stuff go into limited-production without a hitch or the part where I'm beloved by an entire kingdom.\r\nI was watching this with a group of friends who read the LN; they were a little less than pleased with how much the plot is excised. Even as someone with no knowledge of the show, I was alittle peeved at how often they went with the \"exposition dump\" to speed through large chunks, and that leads into my major criticism of the show: the lack of character development. Ernesti shows up. Ernesti does good works. Ernesti is beloved. Anything and everything in between is just there to remind us of those three things - Addy's dialogue is basically \"GEE ERNIE! YOU'RE THE BEST!\" The only two characters who get anything resembling development are Archid and Edgar and it's a shame, because what glimpses we get from these two would make for a much better story. \\n\\n\r\nKnight's and Magic (why is the apostrophe there?) somewhat redeems itself in the final arc. It gives us some semblance of character development, but more importantly, it gives Ernesti a challenge requiring more just drawing up some machine and handing the drawings off to the elves. Again, it's a shame we didn't get more of this during the series; it really would have made the show a lot more fun. At least Ernesti is likable.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I will say that it's at least unique. Sure, it's \"Yet Another Isekai\" but it's not everyday we get a series which delves into the engineering aspects of building a giant fighting robot. And, for the most part, it works. The universe has consistent rules and laws of physics and very real consequences.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say it's a solid 7 (out of 10). A fun and unique concept, but it falls short on execution.",

The anime glosses over details and worldbuilding in its attempt to fit as much mecha action in as possible, and, of all things, uses a narrator - a disembodied voice - to give whatever small bits of exposition they might have considered important. In this kind of anime.\r\nAs for the rest, they seem to be relatively good in comparison. The art isn't anything special, but it works well enough and delivers on the premise. Sound is okay, even if....... Characters aren't that well explained, either, due to the continued skipping of actual worldbuilding in favor of more battle scenes...\\n\r\nIn all, it's a fun series, like the LN, but this anime adaptation skips so much content it's pretty much impossible to really get into it.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nBy the time I had started watching Knights and Magic, it had been a while since I saw a mecha anime, especially one that was set in a medieval fantasy, with an MC that seemed like the Tony Stark of building Mecha's. \r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story begins a lot like Youjo Senki, where our MC dies and is reborn in another world, the only difference is that one is set in an alternate world war, while this anime is set in a medieval fantasy.\r\nOur MC Ernesti basically wants to build the greatest Silhouette Knight ever, so with the help of his friends and manyother people he manages to impress, he tries to achieve this dream.\\n\r\nThe first half of the story has our characters overcoming a few obstacles, which gets them noticed allowing Ernesti to try and build a new Silhouette Knight to impress the King, there's a lot of focus on the building and testing of these new knights, which is one of the stories major strong points, because you don't see many mecha anime's showing the development of how their built, plus there were a few good fights mixed in between all of the development of the silhouette knights.\\n\r\nHowever the second half of the show decided to go down a war route, where a opposing nation decided to attack the nation our characters live in, this is where the story gets a little meh to be honest, because we've seen this before plenty of times, Code Geass being a very good example, it made me feel like the anime had lost the reason for why it existed and wanted to just be another normal mecha anime. Luckily it was still entertaining despite this cliched direction, plus the ending made it seem like it wasn't finished yet, like there's still more to tell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty mixed for me, considering only a few characters, if not just one of the characters was still in my memory by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nErnesti the male MC is pretty much the main reason why you stick around, because this guy is like the mecha version of Midoriya from Hero Academia, he's smart and really loves to make Silhouette Knights, however unlike Midoriya he doesn't tremble or fear danger, in fact he's more willing to sacrifice himself to make sure his friends survive. He was also pretty funny, because he never really knew when to shut up really and it was funny how this able to defeat some opponents he went up against.\\n\r\nAdeltrud and Archid are twins and they are Ernesti's best friends, however their roles in this show was not as impactful as I was expecting, Adeltrud's role is mainly to either hug Ernesti a lot or just get jealous whenever another female character takes an interest in him, however her playful nature does make her a fun character to have around.\\n\r\nArchid is actually even more forgettable, mainly because he doesn't do anything memorable other than when a plot device was literally made for his character, that's pretty much it for him other than being the generic secondary male character.\\n\r\nThere is also the Silhouette Knight drivers, who are Helvi, Edgar and Dietrich, they do provide some entertainment, since they love to bicker and mess around with each other in between the fighting moments, however they can be pretty damn badass during the fighting sequences.\\n\r\nOther than these guys, the rest of the characters in the show are pretty much forgettable and don't really do all that much.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the Silhouette Knights and monsters being CGI, it actually wasn't too bad, considering that the design of the Knights and monsters were very well done especially the Knights, they had a lot of variation and looked pretty damn badass in a fight. The characters weren't too bad either and I liked the way the world was set out with the whole medieval look, but having futuristic mechs at the same time, yet despite having mechs, the way they looked to me made it look like they were suited for this world.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op actually wasn't that bad, it was kinda catchy, however after a certain point they started adding in sound effects to the op which just made it annoying to listen to, luckily the ed didn't have this problem and was pretty good too, yet I feel like there was a hidden message in there that the show didn't take advantage of, then again Romance isn't really in the genres sadly.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nDespite School being in the genres, there really wasn't much for this genre to be there, when only 3 or 4 scenes had the characters in a classroom and usually it only showed Ernesti so really the school genre shouldn't be there.\\n\r\nThe action however was done quite well, it was definitely more enjoyable than Infinite Strato's action scenes, but that's the furthest I'm going to go, because even though it was fun seeing two giant mecha's going at it with each other or giant monsters, other mecha's like Gurren Lagann or Code Geass have done it miles better and the second half of the action scenes felt like they were trying to hard to be as good as Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven though the characters and story had some problems, most of the show was pretty good and for a mecha it's worth checking out, however there are better ones out there, but if you're looking for an anime that focuses more on the CGI aspect then this might be alright for you.",

This one however doesn't stop at redefining robots by replacing much of their technological nature with magic, it shows off much of how they are built and how the protagonist tries to remain one step ahead ofthe eventual opposing forces by tweaking how the robots work and developing clever equipment.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest deviations from the standard mecha trash is that the characters while having a somewhat smaller roll than usual are roughly a thousand times more believable than usual. Their traits are well defined and often collide in hilarious ways that can be hard for non adults to fully appreciate. The older you are and the more you love big robots the more likely it is you'll enjoy this anime, however younger viewers with lukewarm interest in robots may still find it quite amusing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story isn't anything special it's still very enjoyable, I'd rather stories do like this one and stick to things that work than try to be unique and just end up as an incoherent mess. The art is beautiful and the sound is lovely, the only issue with the characters is that they don't get as much focus as some viewers probably want but their screen time is incredibly well spent which more than makes up for it in my book.",

            "content": "I am not sure why there are the horrible reviews with under a total score of 7, maybe because the anime wasn't for them but writen then reviews to make this anime bad is inaccaptable, however here is my review of this anime:\r\nHint: Spoilers maybe in this review, even if I try to avoid them but a review can not be out of them so it maybe the best to activated an include the Spoiler-BBCode.\r\nThe beginning was a bit wired because you are thrown in while he was at work and after that, while it was raining (waht is sometimes in most animes a badpoint so smth. bad will happen) he was in a shop to buy robots (note: he is an otaku and loves them). Then the accidant happened to him and *wooooosh* we are now in the world of Knight's and Magic and this isn't still enough; they also shown those Shilouette Knigths rigth at the beginning which isn't that bad but maybe a bit to early for now since the soul from our protagonist just arrived in his new body.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rly a bid wired because it happends that fast. Would be better if this where splitted into two or maybe three episodes if the LN allows this.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, he has seen the SKs and he fastle remembered where he was rly and this means that the fun begins because he hasn't only his knowledge about programming, he has also his knowledge about robots and that he is an otaku of it. At this point I wondered which direction will it follow since all other chars which are real childrens, are out of his age (to remember: he is 30).\\n\\n\r\nWell, a few episodes later I think that his otaku side was a bit to much for this anime, since on the kids seems to have emotins for him but he did not shown any reactions to this maybe because he knewed that he was in real 30 and not smth. arround 12 or 14 but on the other side it is fine for me since we have then not that much edgy like in other animes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, b2S:\\n\\n\r\nI think that there is a bit more stuff which has fit from the NL into the anime because most things are not in it but for this rly nice fights. But I miss the \"Magic\" in this anime. Well, there are Magic speels and also this secreat reactor uses magic and all those scripts are using magical words or phrases but it is less then what is shown from all those SKs.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the thruster engine reminds me on Gundam 00 a bit because of those green particel effects but since it isn't that much overused it is fine for me.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what was also an interesting point? Mabye the time whil he should normaly been in school but what he made there destroyes that for what a school noramly stands so here is one point which I'll remove from 10. It isn't the problem that he skipped some classes ... it is the problem that the hole school time or most of it where left out (I did not made any compares to the NL for now so I dunno what is going on in the NL while he was in school). It would be better if they have spend a bit more in this time.\\n\\n\r\nNext thing is that he not rly gets any loses in any fight for now. Well, other ones may now think \"wait, but there are a few points which you can count as a lose ...\" - No, definitly NO! A lose in such an anime should be a bit more pain as for now. The only point which I would acknowledge as loos will be that one where some SKs get stolen but thats all. And this is the 2nd point which I remove from 10 points to the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also has been rly nice is a bit more telling about those monsters. I mean that it seems that there are classifications like smaller ones but also hugh and rly dangerous ones like the behemoth class. But only two or three episodes where made arround it so those monsters hasn't have much todo in this anime which is a bit bad but only a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end we have 8/10 points for the Story. Maybe we will get a 2nd Season of it which will have a few more episodes and a detailed story as for now.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what is to say over the Art? Nothing! Why? Because I don't see anything what should be wrong with it. At the beginning we have a normal city, with buildings and streets and so on. Modern technic as well and all other stuff from the world.\\n\\n\r\nAt the place where the hole story rly happends we have all things known from the kingdome age. Castles, Coaches, paths and also the clothes are not like real world clothes for our world time. Well, that we have in there modern machines which are used for figths/defensive against those monsters seems not rly to fit into the covered age but since whe have magic used in them it is ok and also they ave a nice look.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end no point removel: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, music and all other things related to it there is nothing bad to say. Effects well known like in most other animes have gotten there correct sound effects and also the music for the intro and for the outro are nice.\\n\\n\r\nMakes 10/10 for Sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chars in this anime are sometimes wired. Well, it is fine for me that our protagonist looks a bit like a girl but what is with his friends? They have had a task todo for there father which they have done so I assumed smth. bad would happend but nothing bad happend. Was this intented? Because they where not rly happy todo this task. A question which will not rly find an answere.\\n\\n\r\nAlso they are not going to growth. Means they earn knowledge but compared to the years which they are passing they are looking like at the beginning of the story and this is one point where I cutoff one out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I haven't had any problems whith the fact that some of them got merried. Since there are many hints that emotions are shown from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe scound point out of 10 goes to the Chars which are playing the evil guys in the war because they are coming out of nothing. I mean many animes have evil guys but from what I know they are not coming out of nothing. Normaly they are slightly revaled while they are planning there thing so I wondered why there was a spy in our group from our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe in a 2nd season it will be better.\\n\\n\r\nWell, even if I have removed a few points from a few categories I enjoed the anime. For me it was knew to combine magic with machines and maybe some ideas are coming from gundam 00 but not sure since there is for me only this particle things compared to it.\\n\\n\r\nWith only 13 episods it is one of the shorter animes but it's fine so that I can say in total 9/10 for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWaiting for another season :)",

            "content": "Should Knight's & Magic be even called an isekai show?\r\nKnight's & Magic's premise is on Ernesti Echevarria voiced by Rie Takahashi in which he was an otaku obsessed with robots and was reincarnated as Ernesti but the backstory of him is glossed over instead bringing world building to it's forefront of the fantasy world that Ernesti now lives in. If anything Knight's & Magic is more fantasy mecha show than isekai.\r\nSemantics out of the way...so how did Knight's & Magic fare?.\r\nKnight's & Magic has the formula of Ernesti going up in the world with his love of robots and mecha-creation driving him, but not forglory or money or power, but so that he can continue to make mecha's and make better ones that aims for his aesthetics. Now Ernesti as a character is a pure wish-fulfillment character especially for mecha fans, however he does face some resistance in the form of other nations' engineers and even Ernesti's own nation engineers wanting to one up him and in the other nation's engineers case to fight him and finally destroy him. The resistance he faces are similar to Ernesti himself just with differing ideals when it comes to mecha-creations and it's THAT reason that Ernesti wants the maligned mecha creations to be wiped out from history as Ernesti wants his own designs to shine in the world.....yeah go for the monopoly Ernesti.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, well they get the bare minimum development or screentime as the narrative is ENTIRELY focused on Ernesti's endeavors of mecha-creation. The one thing LA finds funny is that Ernesti's denseness to romance is justified because of his love of mecha's is everything to him even when he has Adeltrud Olter voiced by Ayaka Ohashi glopping him any chance she gets and is in love with him. Besides Archid Olter voiced by Shinsuke Sugawara, Ernesti's childhood friend who gets a love interest in the form of a princess who gets a bit of screentime and Dietrich Cunitz voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu who was once a cowardly Knight but changed his tune after an incident with Ernesti and some monsters, the rest of the characters are personalities and not much else really. It's the villains who are the more interesting characters in the anime, mainly Horacio Cojal voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura who believes in if mecha's can merely work it's functional, but his mecha designs are \"exotic\" to say the least that might piss Ernesti off because he's more about aesthetics. \\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of Ernesti's endeavors of mecha-creation, the world building is plentiful in this anime at the very least in the form of how mecha's are created. The anime does go into geo-political problems in the form of invasion of countries, rebels and royalty in danger but that is more or less a setting for Ernesti's gang than anything.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by 8bit, the character designs are exotic and fantasy Grecian-esque (LA is only guessing) costume designs. Ohh and elephant in the room but LA can't be the only one to think that Ernesti was a girl when LA first saw his character design and his androgynous look both costume and character-wise wasn't helping much. Mecha-designs wise, LA did like it for the majority of it and how Ernesti keeps upgrading and making them even flashier. The fighting is pretty decent though it goes through beam spamming and somewhat repetitive mecha sword-play battles were a detriment to the fighting animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, yeah does LA need to bring up Rie Takahashi crossdressing voices as the main lead, LA doesn't mind Rie's voice acting as she did a pretty good job (and is something of her forte for odd roles for her to do). Aside from the vast voice cast from Yukari Tamura, Shizuka Ito, Ayaka Ohashi, Sayaka Senbongi and Sayaka Ohara...they were greatly underutilized as yeah...Ernesti taking over the entire narrative from the start and everything.\\n\\n\r\nKnight's & Magic is your run of the mill fantasy mecha \"isekai\" anime, it's not great beyond any stretch but it's not absolutely terrible either as it DOES give Ernesti obstacles he needs to overcome, good world building in the form of mecha-creation and the mecha fights are ok enough to watch. Not great, not terrible but run of the mill and \"run of the mill\" is the best way LA can see Knight's & Magic.",

            "content": "This show is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's got a lot of things going on in it that I can personsonally relate to that likely won't appeal to others. That said, it's worth watching at least two episodes to see if it can hook you the same way.\r\nI think the key to what's got me hooked on this show is the MC's passion. I find it easy to project myself onto him because of this, so there isn't really any need to build his character. In fact, it's better that he has such a one-note personality because this makes him easier to project onto.All the side characters are pretty unimportant to my enjoyment; honestly the show would do good to cut down on their screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary element which hooks me into the show is it's world. I think it's pretty interesting that magic is like programming, and every episode I look forward to further worldbuilding tidbits. The aspect about the world that I find most interesting is the robots. Every week I look forward to the MC making some new innovation on the robots.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, that's my opinion. Objectively, the story is rushed and the side characters are alright. The mechs look cool and the fights are nice and dynamic. The MC is OP and takes months to do what a whole country couldn't do in decades. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYou will like this anime if you...\\n\r\njust have low standards\\n\r\nare intrigued about the world\\n\r\ncan relate to the MC's passion\\n\r\nlike MCs who are massively overpowered",

            "content": "This is my first anime review so you might want to expect some cringe :/\r\nOnly 6 episodes of the anime has come up as of the time that I wrote this review.\r\nThe only things you need to know is that Knight's and Magic is a light novel adaptation, is usually a upbeat anime so don't expect a lot of tension or grittiness. And if your looking for an anime that has has weight and a heavy plot than you MIGHT want to skip it.\r\nAs for light novel adaptations they will most likely not have a lot of the extra information that is in the lightnovels because there is just too much extra padding and information that is added in light novels that would almost certainly be too much for a 12 or even 24 season run! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, this is a light novel adaptation and so yes a lot of stuff has been left out and multiple time skips may happen in episodes but while some might say that the story is rushed I don't think it's a very big problem!\\n\r\nWhenever a time skip happens the narrator will fill in the blanks even if it's very vague. This also happens when the story speeds up as the episodes are very fast paced so some stuff will be left out. The time skips usually just skip a couple days and you may or may not notice that in the light novel they don't have a time skip there but personally because they condense and speed up the plot you get a lot more enjoyment and \"hype\" because a lot more things will happen in one episode even if they will skim past an entire story arc that was in the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story is fast paced in certain episodes it will never feel too fast because there will be episodes that are more slow to provide a nice balance. For example if one episode is fast paced the next one will be slow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself it's almost simple enough that you could guess what would happen next but there are curve balls and twists most of the time so that doesn't happen. Overall the fast paced plot that's combined with an interesting setting like this always leads to a lot of fantastic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nI didn't expect that much in the art department but man is the animation amazing! Before I say anything else you should know that the mechas are cgi and while that might of set you the designs are very good and everything blends well together! I could see that a lot of care has been put into the animation because everything is colorful and nothing ever feels out of place.\\n\r\nThe bright colorful animation does a wonderful job for a upbeat anime like this especially with the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound isn't neither good or bad but there's a wide variety of music so that every scene feels just right. The op is a very upbeat and catchy song that fits well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique with there own quirks but nothing goes up and beyond in terms of the characters and you might even be able to know what the characters will do next but nothing about the characters are boring or bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile his may not be everyones cup of tea I really love how much of a stress reliever this show is even with a fairly complicated premise.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I would recommend everyone to watch this even if you don't think you would like this because you'll probably regret not watching it!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

If you have even touched the manga and enjoyed it you may hate the anime like me. \r\nThe characters comparatively look bad compared to the anime and the story skips through every chapter that is out in the first episode leaving out so much plot and explanations that it's just dreadful. \r\nThey even heavily change how some plot points go or how in story items look best example is MC's specialized weapon and how he get's out of the starter course in the school.\r\nMy final verdict isthat if you have read the manga you probably wont enjoy the first 2 episodes, if you can suffer through them you'll get to new story not covered in the manga yet but you'll have to live with the different design choice mistakes the adaption has made. \\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side if you have had nothing to do with the manga and don't plan on it you may like it if you can get past the poor story throughout the first episode as they really don't explain anything and don't cover the actual relationship making. Get past or ignore those points and you may like the series, I still recommend the manga or web novel series instead though.",

            "content": "Are you a fan of mechs? Are you a fan of medieval fantasy? Are you a fan of both? Then you would absolutely love the concept of giant mech robots in a medieval fantasy setting, using humongous blades and gigantic magical rods to fight dreaded demon beasts with both sword and sorcery! Too bad this show executes this grand idea so poorly with a character so OP and flat that it will have you constantly asking yourself, \"What happened?\"\r\nLet me start by mentioning the best part about this show: The story. The general plot of the show - demon beasts infest the world and thepeople of the world use giant mechs called Silhouette Knights to fight them, and the main character dreams of becoming a mech pilot - is awesome! The main character is a young boy who, after being rescued by his father who is a Silhouette Knight pilot, dreams of becoming a pilot because back on Earth he was an otaku who bought and assembled mech models. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, this is yet another anime where someone from Earth is transferred to another world after dying on Earth. So this (probably) original idea is bogged down by a premise that everyone and their brother has come up with. Great. Honestly, if the main character wasn't a guy from Earth, this anime would have been a lot better and much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I can praise about the show is the pacing. I am sick and tired of anime that drag out every episode and stretch their run time to their breaking point, and have absolutely nothing accomplished after 20-25 minutes. That being said, the first episode of this show moves so quickly it will give you whiplash. And I love it! It is so refreshing to see an anime actually move at a pace in which the characters make accomplishments in long strides instead of little baby steps.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the story, everything else is average or mediocre or just plain awful. The art and soundtrack are bland, the characters are cookie cutter tropes, and they all experience the sort of character development (and I use the word \"development\" loosely) you would expect. Although to be fair, Dietrich's development caught my eye. The main character on the other hand is boring. Ernesti is the reincarnation of a genius programmer and mech otaku who was killed in a car accident and resurrected into a medieval fantasy world. He quickly figures out that magic is just like programmer and essentially becomes a living god. He quickly becomes the strongest magic user around at the age of 9, and revolutionizes the way the mechs themselves are built, because apparently there are no engineers or scientists in this world. My biggest issue with Ernesti is that he displays having knowledge of things that he likely would not have had in his previous life. His ability to be a genius at magic because it functions similarly to programming makes sense because he was a genius programmer, and I can give a pass to the fact that he apparently knows how mechanical engineering on the Silhouette Knights works because he's a mech otaku. Sure, sure, whatever. But at some point (and I will fully admit that this might be a simple nitpick), he determines that several rampaging demon beasts are running from something bigger than them, and are not actually attacking the humans. Okay so what, he's an animal expert now? He knows the patterns of these creatures that he has never seen before in his life while everyone who should be experienced with them are running around like chickens with their heads cut off? I don't buy it.\\n\\n\r\nNow I should point out that I did not hate this anime by any measure. Although saying that I liked it is too generous. No, I just really wanted it to be good; I wanted an anime all about giant mechs in medieval fantasy land to be good! It's such a simple yet awesome idea! And the creators of this show bogged it down with a character too OP for his own good. And yes, I did only watch three episodes, but that was enough for me. With how much content the show packs into every episode (which I wish to reiterate that I LOVE about it), I feel as though I can make a good enough judgement on how the rest of the show will be like. It certainly is not for me, and I can't think of anyone who would absolutely love every aspect of this show, but I can safely say that I would not recommend watching this, except for the first episode. I'm serious. Even if you're not interested in the show, watch the first episode and witness just how quickly things go with the characters accomplishing so much. At some point while I was watching it myself, I never even noticed that I had only watched the first episode, and I hadn't somehow forgotten that I hit the button for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Everything but the concept and pacing is mediocre at best. Would not recommend.",

I see so many reviews ripping this show apart and it could be... the story is not strong there is no depth but its a great show to watch if you love anime action I would recomend this to anyone who grew up watching stuff with big mech like warriors this is deffinetely for you sound was good I Loved the opening and ending theme its classic its what you want for a begining or ending animation is done well and knights look great ! and characters are lovable for veteran anime fans I can see there desire to rip it apart because lack of depth but I would say give it a go!",

It masterfully adds in bright and fun characters throughout while hinting at romance but there is no changing the fact that this is over all a mecha. A full-on robots vs. robots. \r\nIf you are one who enjoys things suchas this and doesn't care about going to in depth about the characters, mechanics, or politics then this is certainly something you should be able to enjoy!\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of the novel/manga I fully intend to steer you away from this anime.

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nGreetings, A few months ago I was browsing through CrunchyRoll looking for something to watch and I stumbled across Knight's & Magic, at first, I was intrigued, however, I stopped watching it half way through the first episode purely because I didn't like the mecha genre. I feel like that was a mistake on my behalf, by no means am I crowning this one of the Top Anime but it was definitely an entertaining watch.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI don't claim to be a professional at studying Mecha anime, this has got to be the first, maybe second Mecha anime series I have viewed that has drawn mein. The story was weird at places such as at the start. I feel like the writer(s) could've explained exactly what happened when he died, it felt like they rushed the whole start.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I didn't like would be how many time skips there were, which isn't necessarily bad seeing as it feels like it's from a Narrator's view, however, when you're skipping an excessive amount of time every other episode, it gets redundant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art, I love looking at art and animation in all these different shows and I must say, in Knight's & Magic, the art style is beautiful! The magic is drawn so well that it drags you into the story even more, the clashing of magic, the clanging of swords, it really makes the story three times better!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad, I just felt it was weird how even in the prelude of episode 1, the Main Character has the same Voice Actor.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the Voice Actors fit the characters well and the sounds really fit the representation of what they would sound like if it was reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were made very well, seems there were other races such as Dwarves and Alvs etc, but I like how everyone got some screen time and it wasn't just the Main Character who got all the spotlight.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLooking at all these massive robots jumping around, slashing at each other and magic flying around in the air is really satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not much of a Mecha fan but this was definitely entertaining to watch, however, I feel like it could've been produced much better.",

Throw in magic and a good dose of humor and blend until well mixed. That's it. If you're looking for depth, character development, plot development, you won't find much. This is about action andhumor and pretty much nothing else. For me there was plenty of both to keep me entertained and keep my interest.  The art was well done and the animation looked fluid. I Really liked the battles.The characters may not have had any development but they still had personality. FYI I watched the English dubbed version and I liked what the actors did with the characters. This isn't thought provoking or emotionally gripping; it's just meant to be fun.",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic features the combination of technology and magic. Commonly, the intertwining of magic and technology results in contradiction. However, Knight's & Magic is successful in molding the concept of \"Magitech\".\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nKnight's & Magic fits the definition of typical cliche anime. The story is predictable because every plot devices and events are cliche. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike cliche anime. Cliche anime can be great if every detail is conveyed with passion and effort. The production team did an astounding job in transforming dull and cliche event into interesting and mesmerizing event.\r\nThe pacing of the story is mediocre, not too fast,not too slow. The mediocre pacing is great to introduce the concept of \"Magitech\". The concept is easy to digest, they are explained in layman language. Unlike some Sci-fi anime the explains Photon Cannon from a scientific perspective, the explanation are simple and easy to understand. However I am not satisfied because I find the explanation to be incomplete and insufficient (Maybe some facts were removed when it was adapted from LN). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing much to say about the character design. They are pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mecha fanboy, I rate the art to be 10 out of 10. In my opinion, the art is second the Sunrise, the mother of Gundam. The robots design is epic and cool, even cooler when supported with \"Magitech\" concept. Ikaruga, the edgiest and overpowered robot in the series, revealed in the opening song is the main reason I binge watch the anime. What I was looking forward the most did not let me down. Ahem...going back to the main topic. Although being second to Sunrise, 8bit's design is unique in terms of colour. The blend of colour and colour choice brings out the \"personality\" of the robots. For example, Ikaruga with bluish-purple frame and golden edges depicts takes the center stage as the overpowered robot (alongside with it's \"Magitech\" concept).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nThe intro of the opening is ear-catching but is just lost its oomph in the latter half. On the other hand, the ending did not leave much impression. As for the insert song and BGM, they are mediocre too.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that is just my taste for music. You, who is reading this review might like the song instead.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nThe main character, Ernesti Echevarria is a quick-witted, overpowered, badass and oblivious, the quality we tend to see in cliche anime. There is only one thing that I couldn't stand. He, I repeat, he is a trap. Joining the team of Haku, Totsuka, he is one of the being that has cheated and played with the innocent heart of millions of virgin. Ernesti Echevarria is the reincarnation of a programmer/mecha fanboy that existed in the modern era. After meeting his demise, he is reincarnated in a fantasy world. To my surprise, he inherited the programming thinking and mecha love from his previous life. Perhaps, human nature remains stagnant eventhough we are embarking on a new journey. What he had inherited leads him to take the center stage of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC steals the spotlight in the anime leaving the lack of characterization in other character. They were introduced superficially and ignored until they are used again as plot device to proceed the story. A twin siblings  that has close relationship to with the main character, supposedly to be introduced with more depth as they grow up together with the main character, are nothing but BFF superficially with nothing to back it up. The emphasis on knighthood is lackluster and mundane. It is pretty much a \"touch and go\" situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate the anime 7/10. Although I did mention Knight's & Magic is a typical cliche anime, that is not the deciding factor for this anime. The \"Magitech\" concept and new creations is what you should be looking forward to in the anime.",

            "content": "Alrighty, boys. Mission over: we did it. We managed to craft the most bafflingly bad patchwork of all shitty Isekai shows. I've watched eight episodes of this shows, and I couldn't tell you a single thing about the plot other than it's about a grown man who gets put into the the body of a trap and becomes Jesus. \r\nIs it a stretch to call the main character a pedophile? It might be, but I do't really care at this point. The man literally has a girl who's constantly doting on him, unaware that before entering this world he was probably twice her age. Ican't be the only one to find this gross. Ugh let's just stop talking about this.\\n\\n\r\nHow does the magic work? Does seriously anybody know? Look, I'm not asking for a completely fleshed out magic system, just some clue would be nice. I remember distinctly that Ernie mentioned that magic in this world is akin to programming reality or some nonsense but is that really all the explanation we're gonna get? Just some shoddy explanation as to why Ernie is a prodigy? Because that's all it really boils down to- just a lame excuse for his innate magical superiority compared to others of his age. There's tons of jargon flown around during episodes- but none of it is explained so I don't really care. Honestly all the bull shit they say when discussing robot cores and stuff really works against this show- maybe they could've spent more time on the characters than on their vague sci-fi bs. It honestly gets more confusing The more advancements are put onto one mech, like when they made a weird centaur looking machine and just wrote it off as the mech having two cores or something like that- nevermind that it would control and design completely differently than anything else that had ever been designed before because they have to account for two pilots. \\n\\n\r\nAlright I'm done talking about this lore. Now let's get to my favorite part- that ART. Let's get it out of the way- Ernie's hair. We've all seen it. Why does it have a piss stain? I'm not sure. Honestly character designs in this show run from very endearing to outright offensive (looking at you, Ernesti Echevalier). I feel like the best and most likable character designs were the ones pushed at the back however, with others like that ridiculous ear guy and Dixgard to take center stage where they really don't belong. I seriously can't be the only one who burst out laughing when they saw that dude with the huge hoop ear rings and fucking awful hair, right? The bigger the hoop the bugger the hoe, as they say. The general costume design is this way as well, with characters who look atrocious taking up minutes upon minutes of screentime while the background pedestrians are the ones I found myself interested in.  Also a lot of the characters just kinda looked like people I've seen before- the biggest example of this is Nora the Spy, who reminds me strongly of that one speedy girl from Keijo, and even the girl from Keijo manages to be more interesting in her presentation with her blue hair transforming into wings as she fights. It all just feels pretty lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. I enjoy watching this show a lot. It's one of the greatest comedies ever in my opinion- watching it with my friends week after week has been a blast. What with all the fake Northern Europe-sounding names and Ernie's every growing, eldritch piss stain serving as the real villain of the story, it's hard not to enjoy this show. If I would recommend it to anyone, I'd recommend it as a comedy to watch with people, like Garzey's Wing. Other than that, there's just no value in this damn show.\\n",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic - the grammar in the title is killing me to type. Henceforth, I shall be referring to this show as K&M. Whoever named it clearly didn't speak great English.\r\nYou'd think the creators chose the genres at random. Fantasy, magic and mechs together aren't the first thing that would come to mind when you think typical. But that's precisely what it is; the blandest, most generic fantasy concept, mixed with the blandest, most generic mechs. Add a supposedly school-like back drop and some fraternal twin sidekicks, and there you have it. Honestly, the scenario sounds more interesting than it should, but what K&Mlacks is execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of the issue is the writers trying to cram too much story into 13 episodes. The pacing is awful. It lacks the essential, \"show instead of tell,\" element we see in anything remotely good. As a matter of fact, they should have scrapped the narration entirely. It feels like I'm reading a fantasy picture book that's trying to be as dry as non-fiction. K&M relies too much on the main protagonist and the pretty colours. Everyone else might as well be as personable as stage props.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the only saving grace it has is Erne himself. He's so bubbly, and enthusiastic, and sparkly you can't not dislike him. My favourite scene was that one in the first episode, where the teacher turns around to find student half the size - and age - as the rest, staring back with eyes so bright and eager to learn. But too much time is spent on him, and we learn next to nothing about anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the potential is wasted. It's a shame, but it's an illness we see all too often. Is my life richer after viewing? No. Would I go out of my way to see it if it weren't conveniently airing at this moment? No. Is K&M recommended to the reader? Not particularly, but if you have nothing better to do, it's not so bad you'll regret searing it into your retinas.",

If they remain faithful to every single detail in the light novel as much as possible, this series might take 24-26 episodes just to cover it all. Still, for a mecha anime that is only expected to run for 13 episodes, the animator still dida good job in showcasing the mecha fight scenes since this is the most important aspect of the story - the mechas. :D",

That being said there's not much to say about this one, the story is just poor, there's little to no character development and it was just a painful experience trying to finish the last few episodes.\r\nSTORY: 3/10\r\nThe story was ultimately rushed and not allowed to develop as it should have. There were a few good ideas and concepts that I liked but were never developed upon and wasted. The story could have been so much more than it was. The outcome was just average and uninteresting. \r\nART:7/10\\n\r\nI liked it, the art style was ok. The style is more on the average side but wasn't bad all things considered. The scenes were drawn well and the CG mechas could have been much worse.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the sound. It was ok. I wasn't too fond of the OST in this one though. It wasn't bad I just felt that it didn't quite fit and was out of place. Other than that it was fine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters are just bland and boring. Everything about the main character and supporting characters is just way too undeveloped. One thing that was actually surprising about this anime though is the almost nonexistent fanservice in it. That was the only surprising thing about it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nI went into this thinking it wouldn't be too bad and that it might actually be good.

            "content": "K&M is almost aggressively average. It is in many ways a victim of its genre. The \"isekai\" i.e. reincarnated in another world genre tends to have a ubiquitous and critical flaw. The main characters are generally ridiculously (too) powerful. The better ones avoid this entirely or in part, or they account for it and use it as the basis for the story. Unfortunately K&M does neither. Which reveals the shows biggest flaw. A complete lack of tension, there is never any fear of defeat and it robs the action sequences of anything beyond interesting spectacle. \r\n\"Interesting\" is probably the best word to describe the series,well, perhaps not the series but the setting. The idea of codified magic is surprisingly rare, or at best given lip service, but to its credit K&M goes all in on the \"magic as a programming language for reality.\" Now it's not the first to do it, Rick Cook explored similar territory in his 1989 book \"Wizard's Bane\". But again its rare enough so it deserves kudos for that. It is also a fairly acceptable explanation for how and why the protagonist becomes so powerful so quickly. Though apparently it should have made it more explicit as it seems to have escaped several other reviewers, or perhaps more charitably they arent familiar with how programming works? In short general coding concepts are eminently portable from one language to another. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately beyond the setting and the exuberant love for giant robots this show doesnt have a huge amount to offer. Which is perhaps unsurprising given its origin. As the name of medium explicitly informs you light novels are meant to be an idle diversion and that phrase sums up Knights & Magic perfectly. It's a light distraction, it won't change your life but it also wont waste your time.",

The main character is a gender ambigious boy who is designed to look cute and the writers wantyou to think he's cute as they have characters reinforce this. If the main character would've been interesting in anyway and not so dreadfully overpowered I would've stuck with this show because the art and sound design are not the worst.

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching Knights & Magic and though great care has been taken to reduce story spoilers there might be spoilers within character and story analysis. \r\nWhat happens when a mecha otaku gets reincarnated in world where mechas really do exist and when his memories and hobbies can be of use in a war between monsters and nations. \r\nKnights and Magic is a mecha anime that is based on the light novel of the same name. The anime itself is set in a fantasy world where both magic, monsters and mechas exist. This is a bitunique as most mecha anime\u2019s are set in a science fiction setting. The anime\u2019s overall plot follows the life of Ernesti Echevarria a young noble who was reincarnated from a mecha otaku from the future and his friends as they learn to become knight runners and help protect the country from beasts and hostile nations. As Ernesti grows in skill his intelligence and dedication to the robots would see him forever change the nature of mecha design and combat use in the fantasy world forever.  \\n\\n\r\nErnesti \\n\\n\r\nErnesti Echevarria played by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Battle Girls High School fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the show. Before his reincarnation into a noble he was originally a talented programmer from the future and a a mecha otaku.   In the beginning of the series Ernesti\u2019s initial personality can be described as that of   innocent, smart and kind.  As Ernesti grows older however and his inborn desire to learn more which is reinforced by his hobby starts to change his personality. While retaining his trademark intelligence and kind nature Ernesti also becomes more motivated, positive and develops a calmness that is rare for someone of his age to have. Ernesti\u2019s personality after meeting with his future best friends Adeltrud and Archid also prompts his personality to change even further becoming kinder, considerate and also more loyal to them. Ernesti because of his unique origin has a number of personal traits that truly define him. The first of these is the fact that since Ernesti\u2019s memories and the skills that he gained in his previous life remain within him he\u2019s able to use this to help him better understand the concepts and knowledge at an astonishing rate. The second is that by using this advanced knowledge Ernesti is easily able to come up with new inventions that includes weapons and armor that this world has not seen before. \\n\\n\r\nArguably the trait that makes Ernesti such a great character and such a fearsome opponent to his enemies is his ability to use his knowledge and memories to not only create new equipment and weapons that no one in this world has seen, but also adapt existing equipment to deal with deal new situations. This shows that not only does he have excellent perception skills  but also deduction and problem solving skills as well.  A notable trait of Ernesti that is only visible in combat is that he can get rather excitable in combat which I think stems from his dream of becoming a mecha pilot something that I think most fans of mecha anime like myself can relate to. In terms of character development Ernesti as the series advances becomes smarter, and more motivated as previously noted but also becomes somewhat bolder and more willing to take risks something that I did not expect from him given his personality. While certainly smart and brave beyond measure this habit of always wanting to improve his knowledge by putting himself at risk also creates a lot of worry that his friends and comrades have for him and creates one of the few flaws that exist within Ernesti\u2019s personality. A surprising element of Ernesti\u2019s personality that I think really defines him and puts him in good stead in my opinion is the fact that Ernesti has is that Ernesti does not bear any kind of ego or arrogance in him that most inventors have and rather cares little about fame, glory or riches and preferring instead to design new mecha and their equipment and testing them on the field. As a character, I felt that Ernesti was a well-designed one that best showed that might alone does not win battles but creativity and the ability to out think your opponents and pre-empt their moves will. Rie Takahashi I felt really did an excellent job portraying the character of Ernesti. \\n\\n\r\nAdeltrud \\n\\n\r\nAdeltrud played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayaka Ohashi of Masamune Kun\u2019s Revenge and Re Creator\u2019s fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Ernesti\u2019s childhood friends alongside her brother Archid. Adeltrud who due to her long name prefers to be called Addy is a member of a noble house though only in name only and as a result is often looked down upon by others especially by people from other such houses. As a result, the closest relationship that she had in the beginning was with her brother. Initially Addy\u2019s personality was that of a quiet girl that was also guarded around strangers and was not someone that trusted easily. After she met Ernesti however Addy\u2019s true personality began to surface due to the fact that Ernesti treated her and her brother like normal people and didn\u2019t look down on them. Addy\u2019s personality become one that was kind, positive and cheerful but also loyal to Ernesti and her many new friends that she made at the academy.  Addy as a result of meeting Ernesti also become quite attached to him and has a tendency of getting jealous when other girls like Stefania her elder sister gets close to him which perhaps indicates that she may have feelings for him. As a result of this Addy can be seen to be very loyal to Ernesti and will do everything in her power to help him even if it meant fighting on the frontlines itself. As a character, I thought that Addy was an interesting character that though mainly limited to a support role did a great job of bringing in some humor to the series. Ayaka Ohashi I felt did a great job portraying the character of Addy.  \\n\\n\r\nEdgar \\n\\n\r\nEdgar voiced by veteran voice actor Yasuaki Takumi is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Ernesti\u2019s main allies. A veteran pilot that alongside his fellow pilots Dietrich and Helvi were senior students at the academy that Ernesti and his friends attended in the beginning of the series and later joined Ernesti\u2019s new order becoming one of its key members Even before meeting Ernesti Edgar was someone that was noted and seen by many to be an exceptional pilot and seen as a model example of what a knight should be. Personality wise Edgar is a kind, polite and caring person that cares a great deal about his friends and allies whether on the field or not. Unlike most archetypical elite pilots that we see in other forms of media Edgar\u2019s personality is that of a humble person and has little ego that get in his way traits of which allow him to bond easily with people that he meets.  Indeed, it is a result of these traits and the respect that he earned that allowed him to meet with the strange kid that was Ernesti on the dawn of their first serious battle in the series. As a knight runner Edgar takes his duty as a defender of the people pretty seriously and will always try to protect those people that are weaker than him a trait that puts him in good stead in my book. Edgar\u2019s most prominent trait that I find the most admirable is trademarked calmness that he displays in battle. Even when confronting the most powerful of enemies or the most unexpected of events Edgar is able to face each situation with calmness analyzing and discerning the best path possible while remaining cautious of what may lie ahead traits that I think are important for any soldier.  Yasuaki Takumi I felt really did a great job portraying the character of Edgar and did a great job as acting as the bulwark that the enemy\u2019s tide will break upon. \\n\\n\r\nEleonore \\n\\n\r\nEleonore Miranda Qsperka voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yukari Tamura of Naruto and Akame ga kill fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Ernesti\u2019s main allies in the series latter half. Initially the princess of the kingdom of Kuschpercha a kingdom that borders Ernesti\u2019s own kingdom Eleonore initially was a kind, caring and innocent person that was unused to the hardships of war and suffered a great shock when her country was invaded and subjugated by the forces of the Zaloudek kingdom. The twin shocks of losing both of her treasured possessions which in this case was her kingdom and her farther affected Eleonore greatly and in the beginning, she was reduced to being meek, submissive and not willing to do anything for fear of causing harm to her people. The chance meeting of Eleonore and Archid during Ernesti\u2019s rescue attempt however was the catalyst that eventually caused her to break out of the shell that she had created to protect herself. Thanks to Archid\u2019s determination and willingness to serve her as her knight Eleonore\u2019s personality began to change becoming braver, more responsible to herself and to others and more mindful of the role that she must assume for the sake of her people.  Eleonore also become more humble towards others a trait that I think suits her rather well and most notably as a result of her newfound determination and courage Elenore also become rather inspirational with the speech that she gave before the final battle being the best example of this. As a character, I felt that Eleonore was a very well-designed character that was developed nicely and seeing her evolve from a weak willed and submissive princess to a strong, inspirational and brave queen was something that I enjoyed watching. Though only seen in the latter stages of the series I felt that Yukari Tamura really did an excellent job portraying the character of Eleonore. \\n\\n\r\nCojal Horacio \\n\\n\r\nCojal Horacio voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura of Owari no seraph and Guilty crown fame is one of the main support characters of the series and acts as one of Ernesti\u2019s main opponents in the latter stages of the series. An inventor of the Zaloudek kingdom and Cojal  was the chief architect of their rapid advances in tech that allowed them to make such wide gains during their assault in the story. Personality wise Cojal is evil, cunning and creative person whose intelligence is easily Ernesti\u2019s might. A cunning and intelligent person Cojal sees his work and role as the kingdoms inventor as the best stage for him to use to showcase his work and see\u2019s each new problem as a new challenge for him to showcase his intelligence. As a result of this rather vain personality of his Cojal is someone that cares little about others and indeed would sacrifice other people gladly if it meant that they would die in his place. Similar to Ernesti Cojal is able to easily see and understand how something works just by looking at it and can come up with some rather grand creations that have a nasty habit of surprising Ernesti and his friends with the best example being the Drake. As an inventor Cojal is someone that takes pride in his brainpower and when confronted with a threat to that would stop at nothing to crush them intelligently and totally. Choosing to use Cojal as the main villain for the end part of the series I felt was a great move as Cojal is every bit as equal to Ernesti in intelligence which only served to make their struggle that more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation for any anime is one of the most important things that it must have and more so more mecha anime where we need to see each and every blow that is made by each side during the battles. In this I felt that the animation for the series was excellently done with the combat animations between both the danger beasts and enemy mechas being especially impressive. With regards to the art the design of the mecha\u2019s both the initial ones that the cast make use off and the ones that Ernesti creates was well designed and really looked cool. In particular the new types that Ernesti creates I felt were well designed and apart from looking impressive also had a specific role on the field something I really appreciate as I felt that the initial versions lacked this. The sight of these new types which also took inspiration from real life mecha\u2019s in demolishing the enemy\u2019s frontline mechas was truly a joy to see. The danger beasts that served as the series\u2019 first enemies I thought were well designed and certainly looked dangerous enough to classify them as dangers to the mechas with the behemoth being the crowning jewel in this regard. Of particular note to the new second tier mechas that Ernesti creates I felt that the new innovations that he put in as part of their weapons and equipment was really interesting and well thought out. Of particular note is Edgar\u2019s suits double shields which served to enhance his defence and Dietrich\u2019s shock cable which provided him with a degree of ranged combat capability.  Of course, if we were to talk about best mecha designs that would likely belong to Ernesti\u2019s own personal suit which really looked amazing and combined with his skill truly was unmatched on the field. Starting from the latter half of the series with the coming of the Zaloudek kingdom\u2019s invasion the odds that Ernesti and his order faced notably increased significantly as they faced enemies that were not only veterans but also far better equipped as well.  It is here that the battles scenes for the series really goes into high gear with the struggles between Ernesti and the enemy commanders being much more interesting than the battles against the beasts. Watching Ernesti and co not just outsmart their foes by coming up with new innovations that will rub the enemy of their advantages but also outfight them truly was inspirational. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Voice\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty good especially the opening theme which was Hello my world by the veteran band Fhana and You & I which was sung by Addy\u2019s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Ayaka Ohashi. The voice acting for the series I felt was impressive with praise going to Rie Takahashi who portrayed the character of Ernesti, Ayaka Ohashi who voiced Addy and Yukari Tamura who voiced Eleonore. Veteran seiyuu Sayaka Ohara who had the dual role of serving as Ernesti\u2019s mother Celestina and as the narrator I felt also deserve praise as well as her clear voice allowed her to easily explain the circumstances that lead to each story arc. Of the support cast I felt that Edgar\u2019s voice actor Yasuaki Takumi and Archid\u2019s voice actor Shinsuke Sugawara also did a great job portraying their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Knights & Magic was an anime that I really enjoyed and helped relive some of the old mecha dreams that I had when I was a kid. The main strong points that made Knights & Magic such a good anime in my eyes was its unique premise, excellent story, excellent characters, interesting and well-designed battles, creative mecha designs and its focus on beating the enemy not just by using might but also by using intelligence and creativity as well.  The premise of the anime itself is a simple one that\u2019s been used countless times before but the origin story this time really was unique. The overall story I felt was also something that I thought was well thought out as it not only showed Ernesti\u2019s growth as a person but also his standing within the kingdom as well. The most important thing that mecha anime\u2019s need to get right in order to be successful is of course the mecha designs and the battles that they are used.  In this I felt that both were executed well as the mechas that were shown in the show especially the tier two ones that were designed by Ernesti were amazing and had a well-defined role on the field.  Each of the battles that were shown in the series were clear, well designed and had clear and well-defined objectives that one side had had to achieve in order to attain victory something that some mecha animes do not have. Lastly the emphasis on using intelligence and creativity to win battles was one thing that I really admired in the series and seeing Ernesti put real thought into creating plans that will not just stop the enemy but also remove their strongest assets through clever innovations really was a joy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you\u2019re looking for a good mecha anime that has an interesting story, excellent battles and well-designed mecha that you can\u2019t really go wrong with Knights & magic. In my opinion for the final score I would give this anime a 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If there was anything I learned from this anime, it\u2019s that no one should ever underestimate an otaku and his \u201chobby\u201d.\r\nKnight\u2019s & Magic is an anime about mechas and magic. Yes the combo might sound very contrasting but the anime does so well to execute the combination of the two elements that I couldn\u2019t help but be entertained throughout the whole way. The magic is actually the source of power for the mechas and since they live in the middle ages, modern conventional power sources haven\u2019t been invented yet. They certainly executed the machines being powered by magic trope far better than Broken Blade, theonly other anime to my knowledge that uses magic as the catalyst to piloting a mecha.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in modern day Japan where a gunpla otaku who is an extremely efficient programmer dies of an accident. He is then reincarnated into another world as Ernesti Echevarria (man that\u2019s a mouthful). In his new world, giant mechas called Silhouette Knights are common sight and they are constantly fighting against big monsters called demon beasts. Thanks to his new life, Ernesti can finally realize his dreams of creating mechas, so he got to work fast on learning about magic and how the robots work. A little too fast though since he had already started creating revolutionary machines and soloing fleet worthy giant demon beasts at the age of 12.Eventually Ernesti and his friends don\u2019t just fight demon beasts but also other nations who have their own Silhouette Knights, which is a dream come true for the young boy since his sense of aesthetics is that Mechas should only be destroyed by other mechas. And while he\u2019s busy making more powerful mechas and demolishing his enemies with it, he takes them and studies how they make them work. All of this is done for the sake of his \u201chobby\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai (reborn in a new world) stories are my guilty pleasure since I love to see the implications of what would happen if you had a 21st century mind in an era of walls, steel, and magic. And this anime showed a great deal of it since Ernesti was creating new advancements in the Silhouette Knights industry 1-4 mechs in a month or two compared to having a new design every 3 centuries. Yes he was going at a centuries century\u2019s pace. He was also busy making miniature suits that would benefit him and his friends on the side to boot. To the boy, magic is basically a program, so casting fire is as elementary as \u201cHello World\u201d. Another great thing about it is that it is not a harem anime. Ernesti doesn\u2019t even realize the girl beside him and only cares about cold steel.While the story is pure escapism, I have to applaud the very impressive way the direction was executed. Not only did they create an entertaining anime but the plot was very consistent and was devoid of any filler to the untrained eye. The pacing was definitely rushed but it never gave you that feeling, it took me a while to realize it and was amazed how they managed to do it. It was a surprisingly complete story from beginning to end, everything is so straightforward and there are no flashbacks or anything that holds back the plot. It was so straight to the point that they ended all of it in just 13 episodes. It is quite rare for an anime to do all of that especially if the source material is a light novel.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes even a 2nd season can\u2019t finish the entire plot. Usually the the author and studio would just agree that if fans want to find out what happens next then we have to buy the novels and for us fans outside of Japan, we have no access to buying them and we still have to face the language barrier. So I nearly couldn\u2019t be any happier than seeing this anime tell us a story from start to finish given the number of episodes that were allotted to it. Hopefully more light novel adaptations can be more like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely a treat since the character designs were really well done but kudos to the design of Ernesti since he was a cute trap throughout the anime. The mechas were incredibly detailed it was like mecha porn. The anime had the 2nd most realistic mechas I have ever seen with the 1st being in Broken Blade. The demon beasts had probably the best CGI and were amazing to behold while a certain few mechas suffered from it. The weapon designs could have been better like the rods while only a few blades showed some cool or authentic designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has one of the best opening sequences I have ever heard in my life and while the tune got me excited for another adventure of another episode, the main reason was that they added SFXs to go with the sequence. From tiny ones like a mecha head turning to blasting all the firearms, that little bit of detail captured my ears and it instantly became one of my favorite opening sequences of all time. Unfortunately the background music didn\u2019t have anything that was memorable while the ending sequence was also forgettable but it did have an epic picturesque scene that captures the trap beauty of Ernesti and the mechas surrounding him.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really does a great job in what it would be like if you were a mecha architect who wanted to make some of the most revolutionary mechas in as fast as possible. The development process was basically design and innovate but it was so well done that I had no complaints sine the technical jargons would usually diminish any form of enjoyment in the long run. I also love how they captured Ernesti\u2019s childish innocence in pursuing his passion, nearly nothing was as consistently enjoyable in the anime as seeing a happy enthusiastic smile from our OP trap MC.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an amazing anime to just binge watch, which I did and I was so excited to see the next episode as soon as the last one was finished. While it did suffer a bit from the character development of the side characters, it didn\u2019t detract a bit from my overall enjoyment of the entire show. Had the anime continued on to that one story in the ending then I would have lost it since they stated where my true passion lies.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best animes I have ever seen and I easily recommend it to anyone who loves mecha, isekai stories, and adventure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "A very bad show thats a bit entertaining.\r\nThe biggest issue, really, is tone. The show is a light hearted romp through a man-child's fantasy of playing robots, but for some reason is set in a fantasy world besieged by demons and constantly at war. Hundreds of people die in the wars and conflicts, but the main character always succeeds and never cares. It feels fundamentally at odds; as though Ernesti is playing with Medabots the whole time, but his attitude is never examined by the writing in any capacity. It's not funny either, or dramatic, or even particularly clever. Who is this show even for?\r\nAsplenty of others have pointed out, all of the politics are ignored, and none of the drama ever functions, since the characters not only never lose, but never even struggle. Not that every story has to have character arcs, or real conflict, but again, it feels like a wild mismatch to have the tone of a high-school-girls'-casual-club-anime in a war-torn monster-ridden fantasy world played totally straight.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd make much more sense if the framing device never dumped the MC in the fantasy world, and it was about passionate toy-mecha makers and coders having a hobby tournament. Maybe even a little bit of work-life vs hobby-life conflict in there to make the MC investigate his real desires for fun vs responsibility, or even figuring out a way to combine the two.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for being a show about geniuses there's a bit too much ignoring of any sense of how any of the work ever *actually* gets done. Where are the mines and the smelters and forges? Where are they getting all their commodities from? Where are the lathes, mills, hammers, presses? Who the hell figured out how metallurgy works in this world? How do they actually pay for any of this stuff? There's a profound sense that the writers never did any research into how anything actually gets made (or how wars work). Any concrete details that ground the world would go a long way. Sure they spend a couple scenes on braiding the magic muscle fibers, but how do those fibers even get made? What're they made of? Who invented them, and how?\\n\r\nI'm not a pedant that needs every question answered in my fantasy stories, but when the central thrust of the show is getting into how the engineers design and build these things, there's startlingly little specific details. The show constantly tells us how clever Ernesti is, but at no point did I ever think the writers had been clever.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, it's harmless enough. The action bits are alright, and the show is closest to being good when it's more about the development of the mecha, despite how nonce it is. The characters hardly even rise to the status of boring clich\u00e9, the plot is nonsense, there is no drama. Recommended if you like to watch other people play with toy robots in a very straight forward and childish \"but now my robot has *four arms* and is *invisible*,\" kind of way.",

            "content": "Sometimes you encounter a show/film that just smittens you so much that you cannot help but gleam in happiness. The cast of Knight's & Magic along with the carefree nature of the beginning half of the show is quite amazing to behold...but is the rest of the show up to the same level?\r\nStory: 3.5/10\r\nFirst and foremost let me say this; I really like the plot of  Knight's & Magic. It has this special \u201cair\u201d about it that I cannot find myself to fully explain. Even though I consider myself not a fan of mecha anime, this series makes it really interesting. From episode oneI was completely captivated by its overall feeling. The way the MC and his closest friends progress though the early stages was so much fun to watch. As they move through the school-focused arcs, they and their new allies find themselves with the creative freedom to make their own robots. It is at this point however when the show shows its greatest weakness; the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the first times I can say this about an anime; they crammed way too much into thirteen episodes. The show takes way too far of time skips (sometimes months) and skips a lot of the smaller world building moments. Honestly they should have expanded on the first six or so episode's material and made that the entire season. The amount of time skipped in those sections really fast-tracked the character development. What happens later on in the season is much of the same but instead of character development being missed out on, it is world building and faction building. I'm not sure if the source material was like this too (I hope not) but it doesn't matter. What matters is what is in the anime and because of this fatal flaw, I was unable to fully enjoy the show. Luckily the other elements of the show makes up for the pacing shortcomings.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show was very much to my liking. The colors used in the scenes just seem to make the world feel just right. This is also helped by actual good use of CG. All the robots (from what I can tell) were animated using CG models. They still have a clunky look to them but I think that was also an intentional element since the robots are primitive for the most part. The character models are also quite great. Each main character's character model easily tells you everything you need to know about the character. The MC's earnest love for technology is shown tenfold by his appearance and actions. His two closest friends are brother and sister and they actually look similar (something anime somehow fucks up more times than not). \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise the show has great moments then a lot of ok moments. The high movement/action scenes flow nicely but some of the low-key ones are pretty meh in both animation and art quality. As anime is usually made on a very tight time schedule, it was easy to tell which parts got less love from the animation studio. It was too off-putting but it's there to easily see.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this season was quite great. The main theme is very catchy and really pumps up w/e scene it is in. The rest of the music also fits in quite nicely. The miscellaneous noises that populates the world (animals, robot sounds, ext) were pretty well crafted too. The battles really feel amazing due to this element. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines in my opinion. To make up for the breakneck pacing and lack of world building (in some sections), the characters steal the spotlight. The MC is absolutely a gem in my book. His absolute earnest drive to make robots coupled with his inherent kindness and morals makes him such a likable figure. There was a sort of mini arc in the first half of the season where the MC essentially helps one of the main robot pilots get over his hidden fear of defeat. Because of this, that character turns out to be a very prominent and likable character later on in the series. The MC just has that special ability to elevate others no matter the situation. The other main characters all have super likable traits too which makes the cast so much fun to watch interact with each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing character wise that let me down were the final arc's villains. All of them (except one) were just your stereotypical, cookie cutter \u201cWe're bad and we want to conquer all!\u201d type antagonists. Their tactics seemed pretty week compared to the MC's and overall never really seemed to pose a real threat (other than the last two or so episodes). I tend to really like antagonists that you can see yourself siding with due to their characteristics and actions. This show had none of that.\\n\\n\r\nThis is absolutely a show where if you find yourself not liking the characters you should probably drop. It is the main thing the show uses as a crutch in order to make up for the lack of attention to detail plot wise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't even mention in the review that the MC was once alive in our time as a programmer. It really didn't strike me as important but it does explain how the MC is able to break down magical elements in this new world so quickly. This was in my opinion however an unnecessary shoe-horning in of the \u201cisekai\u201d genre into a show that didn't really need it. Maybe it is brought up as a plot device in the source material; I'll never find out unless it gets adapted into more anime episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show was still a real stand out for me this season. I only ended up sticking with four or so shows this season and I would rank the final, full version of this season around 2nd out of the 4. Its charm is just impossible to escape and those first five or so episodes were really something special. The pacing however is just impossible to look over since it is so ingrained into the show. Regardless, I really recommend that you give this show a shot if you are ever looking for a cool mecha show with an older time period feel.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Knight's & Magic is another entry into the isekai category of anime. This time around, the isekai element is used as a catalyst for the story of our mecha-obsessed main protagonist. I thought the story of Knight's & Magic was a very fun one and it was mainly focused around the development of mechs and the battles between them. The conflicts that take place in this other world just serve as a vehicle to get us to that plot point. One thing to note is that the pacing of the story is very fast and it's apparent even if you haven't read the source material.In some instances it was good like in the first episode where it eliminated a lot of scenes that I think did not need to be animated but in other instances you wish that the show slowed down so that more story or character development could have be done.\\n\r\nThe art was great and the animation was well done. A special mention has to go out for the 3D animation that was used for the mechs. I thought it was some of the best use I've seen of CGI in motion in a TV anime. The characters are likable albeit a little bit on the generic side. The main character Ernesti Echevarria, feels overpowered at times and this may irk some people. It definitely contributes to the lack of danger the anime seems to have.\\n\r\nKnight's & Magic is one of the better Mecha anime that I have seen in recent memory and it was an enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "This is my 4th review and I'll be doing this from now on for fans of anime and for those who are considering on watching this anime. So here goes.\r\nStory: I gave it a 6/10. I think it was fine in some parts. But ultimately you could tell it was rushed. Fans of the series who have read the light novel have specified so. Still I have to respect another world anime genre(Isekai for short). A mecha otaku reincarnated into another world, a dream world. One with big silhouette knights can make anyone go crazy. The passion sure shows in the MC Ernie. He befriendsAdy and Chid at a young age and they're inspired to become Knight Runners. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Like any typical mecha anime, the focus usually resides on the design of them. I think they were well detailed. Especially Ernie's. I can not relay to much since it's spoiling. But, ultimately, it was good in some places, lacked in others. The character design is what stood out most to me. I think they blended them in well. I can not describe to well on my thought process of this art section. But let's just say I give it a strong 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Hmm...Sound I will give a 7/10. Most of the time that damn opening it what let me to be impressed with noise add ons and such. You can hear the blast off/maneuvers of the knights extremely well. The moments they attacked, explosions too. Every time the knights would collide swords or magic attacks were put into play, I was left shaking my head yes for \"well done\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Characters:\\n\\n\r\nErnie: I really loved his passion for mecha. A lot of folk usually hate big robots and show their disapproval of them well. But he, was fascinated by them. Wanted to build his own, be creative. He received his chance when reborn in the other world. From there he was ensnared by what befell him. His curiosity and question asking went through the roof. This isn't the first series I've gotten into where a kid MC is the star/genius of everything that occurs. I just hope whatever goes down in the Light Novel doesn't destroy Ernie in good time. Too much creativeness can be a bad thing. Or is that greed? Ha, ha.  \\n\\n\r\nAdeltrud/Ady: Got to love her. She fell for Ernie right away when they grew up together. Showed her jealousy big time too whenever someone was trying to claw their hands all over Ernie. Especially Stefania. I love her girl who get's jealous. It certainly is a great emotion. Shows a lot about their character and what they're willing to do as they go forward. Just my thought on the matter though with Ady, hehehe. She's great. \\n\\n\r\nArchid/Chid: Chid and Ady were both solid partners in helping Ernie with his dream. Of course, Ernie originally helped them by teaching them what he knows when they were young kids. As the anime progresses I think Chid had the better share of development than Ady. I admired his will to act instead of staying still when things got rough. However, I believed he picked that habit up mostly from Ernie. I liked EP's 10-13 of the anime the most. He really shows who he truly is and want's to become. Chid expresses he wants to become stronger. He starts off by protecting Eleonore. I really am extra curious how they relationship turns out in the LN. I believe now I'll have to read it or do some research to understand better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEleonore/supporting characters: Eleonore went through that rough patch of seeing her father pass away and her having to make the tough decision to lead. Would she be able to do it? Would they accept her? So on. Like I said with Chid he stepped in and provided her with the confidence she needed. Like a knight should. This is why like I said that I'm extra curious now if their relationship goes any further. I believe it will. As for the Order of Silver Phoenix. I give them credit for their hard work and for not giving up on Ernie. I guess that's why they're there to support.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A tough call. I was stuck between a 6 or a 7 most of the way. But since I enjoyed this series more than I should have. I gave it a 7. A lot of my friends on twitter were telling me this anime wasn't really a must watch. In truth, I would agree with them. But my love for mecha shows no bounds. Like Ernie, I love giant robots who do battle. Muv Luv is a good example too. Total Eclipse. I recommend it. Code Geass is a big reason why I love Mecha. I don't think I have to even explain why there. I wish this anime received more than 13 EP's. If it was 22-26 EP's long. They probably could've tagged better with character growth, maybe the story a little better. A rush job never pleases anyone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: My score for Knights&Magic was a 7/10. Aside from me giving the story a 6. That didn't comprehend with what I was going to give it. Anyway, this series isn't a must watch. I'll agree with my mates there. Although, I think it's worth killing some time on to enjoy another anime to add to that completed column. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "This series isn't as bad as a lot of people make out, yes it has a good few issues but beyond that there is a lot of promise that keeps your interest and it also does something that is rare in mecha anime.\r\nSo I'll start with the bad, \r\nThe Narration:\r\nNarration in anime isn't a hugely common thing for a reason, sometimes it works, a lot of time it doesn't especially if the narrator is not the main character but just a narrator, it can ruin any immersion and reminds you this is just a show.\r\nThe golden rule is show don't tell, and the pointless narrationat times either says they don't think we can't pick up what's going on or they can't devote time to developing events so we know who is who and from where and what is happening.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to use the animation and the characters to tell the story, you don't use the narrator to tell the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe narration here is also being used to progress the story and to skip ahead with things, as well as the 'obligatory exposition dumps' \\n\\n\r\nI get the feeling a lot of things would have been better if they got rid if the narration as they might force them to remove the things that they felt the need to narrate, they could have developed things more and spent more time with things and they wouldn't be able to jump ahead quite so frequently with zero build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to pacing.\\n\r\nThe pacing is generally a mess, sometimes it takes pains to develop things and when it does that it's great, other times it just skips it, the show hasn't realised what it's strengths are and what its big selling point is, and that is the development of the mechs, it was at it's finest when it was designing and building the new mech and then the testing of it, later on it decided it already had shown us such things so would skip those parts.\\n\\n\r\nInstead we'll get random forced encounters just because the writer wanted mechs fighting monsters or mechs fighting mechs, some of them just come out of nowhere. It just seems like random things keep getting thrown in in case you might be getting bored with the other stuff, like the light novel author had no confidence in what they were writing, so we get too many elements, too many ideas just thrown at you. \\n\\n\r\nIt would have been better if it had followed the model of Infinite Stratos, a heavy focus on the training and over the 12 episodes there are only 3 notable events outside of the training, one of those was a mini tournament, that allowed it to be better paced as it let the events flow naturally rather than forcing them by skipping the story ahead every 5 minutes to the next event.\\n\\n\r\nThe isekai gimick\\n\r\nThis was forced and feels like it's there just because it's a fad, if you skipped the first part of the first episode you wouldn't know it was isekai, you would think it was a fantasy mecha anime, it doesn't gain anything by being isekai, so I don't know why this is a thing\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThey aren't great, they aren't terrible either, no one really pops, They are just average, no one is really developed, it's like everyone is a supporting character and Ernesti is the only member of the main cast. Everyone gets left behind, the focus is only on Ernesti and he's the only one it seems to care about, this would imply that his character is then given complexity, but no his character is still pretty simple, he loves mechs he wants to build mechs, that's what drives him, that's all he cares about, the end.\\n\r\nIt's just bland.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the big issues, this is probably why people say it's a bad anime, but that's only if you stop at the issues, you have to look beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing it does right and where it shines is the development of the mechs, this is something rarely seen in mecha anime, to actually watch the design, build and testing phase of a new mech is something most don't focus on.\\n\r\nWhen it's spending time doing this and the episodes where this is the focus are the episodes that stand out and the series really shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe action also looks good, the mecha are well designed and the battles are effective.\\n\\n\r\nIf it spent more of its focus on the building and testing of the new mechs this could have been a great series, if it had been more confident in this side of things and learnt how to pace itself, cut out a lot of the extra goings on and just kept things simple, have three big set pieces in terms of action, be it a demon beast fight, mock tournament and then mech vs mech clash it would have been better, and the isekai stuff should have been cut.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a lot of potential, it could have been a 9, but because of it's problems it doesn't reach that far.\\n",

It's a informal, purely emotion-based review. Now with that said...\r\nI am loving this show. I presume you've read the premise/summary, but if you haven't, slight spoilers.\r\nThis show is fanservice to people who have felt like their life wasn't the best. That whatever road they took in life, things just didn't turn out as exciting as they wanted it to be. Then fate decides to intervene and you get another chance in another life. You start over but you getto retain your experiences and knowledge prior. It's the ultimate \"I get to do things right and really enjoy life with what I know what to do, how to do it..in the world I like\" kind of thing. So if there's anyone who feels like that, then this anime will likely be very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSo far from what I've seen it's pretty much nonsensical fun. There's nothing wrong with watching anime like that. I haven't gone into more episodes yet as of this writing. I may update this review and try to be more formal, critical and all that stuff later on.",

            "content": "\"knights and magic\" is quite an enjoyable series, at least so far. The art and sound perfectly acceptable. And the plot, while a bit loose ended in some places, is enough to engage me for an afternoon; it could just be that there are only six episodes out; somehow I doubt this, but no matter.\r\nWhats more, the pace is quick enough that it never feels boring; in the first episode, for example, we traverse 6 years. Perhaps this is why then, there is so little time for character development.\r\nyes indeed, the character development in \"knight's and magic\" is very poor. Well, that is a lie;that would imply that there is some character development. I challenge you; watch up to episode six, and attempt to describe the characters in a meaningful way. I certainly find it hard to do, beyond \"the girl who likes him\", \"the guy who is friends with the MC\", \"the MC who likes mechs\" etc. Again, it could just be that the whole series is not out yet. but we are on episode six. that's 1/4 - 1/2 a season. one would hope that at this point we would at least know something about the characters.\\n\r\nThere are hints, perhaps, at deeper meaning, at a greater depth of thought and emotion. however, these depths are left unexplored. Even the main character, who I think is supposed to be a classic paragon, fails in that regard. That I am unsure whether or not he is a paragon should be evidence enough.\\n\\n\r\non the whole, though, I found it enjoyable. The pacing of the story and the sheer scale of the crazy events that happen were enough to distract me from the lack of character. so if you are bored and have nothing to do with your weekend, and just want to watch something silly which doesn't think too hard, then look no further than this.",

The whole reincarnation aspect just doesn't work its practically non existent but would have made a good basis for a story if it was done properly instead there could have been a whole saga into why and how many more people have been reincarnated into this magical world. Will they be good or evil out for fame and fortune...\r\nFor me after Eru arrives the storyline is pretty good the use of Magic and Mecha blends well alsothe characters development after his arrival.",

While I acknowledge and admire the sheer passionate love for giant robots that does shine through the doldrums of the show, the absence of the grand stories of personal drama or world-threatening cataclysmsthat define the Mecha Genre are entirely absent. The result is... people playing with mechs for fun with zero stakes, like Build Fighters without any charm.\\n\\n\r\nA waste of time that will only be remembered at ALL if it manages to spawn some good model kits or action figures of the mechs someday.",

Low and behold, Knights & Magic turned out to be complete garbage (though I still enjoyed it...somehow). The characters are copy & paste cutouts of stereotypes with no unique personality elements. You can tell how they will act for the entire series based on 5 minutes. The story was about as barebones and stereotypical as thecharacters. The only \"story\" this might beat is that of pornos, which isn't really an accomplishment. The sound is ok but nothing super interesting there. The art does deserve some credit but the overuse of CGI loses it some major points. Overall...this anime sucks. There is no real redeeming factor other than potential enjoyment. \\n",
