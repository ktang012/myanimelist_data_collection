            "content": "The first season of Tokyo Ghoul, while certainly not reaching the heights as the manga, was an enjoyable exposition to the series that was able lead newcomers like me to binge read the entire 143 chapter manga in two days. As a stand alone show, ignoring the quality of the manga, it was pretty good.\r\nRoot A, however, is trash from an anime-viewer-only perspective and worse than trash if you've read the manga. It is a mess of unexplained plot points that insult the complexity of the source material it was adapted from. For all the hype generated by Sui Ishida creating an original plot linefor the anime to follow, Root A fell inconceivably short in almost all areas it could. Studio Pierrot proved itself completely inadequate to handling the franchise and we can only hope that the Tokyo Ghoul series gets the Brotherhood-esque 50-episode reboot with a much better studio.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a promising opening episode that immediately introduced a difference in story to the manga, Root A never seemed to be interested in actually developing an original story. From one episode to the next, content was centered around adaptations of the sidestory in the manga. I never got the feeling that there even was  an original element to the story. Kaneki, who should've been the focal point of the so-called \"original plot\", is left thoroughly underdeveloped and recieves approximately half a minute of air-time per episode. I was excited for the prospect of a different take on perhaps the manga's weakest arc, but found myself disappointed by the lack of attention to the main character. For all intents and purposes, there are zero differences in plot progression between the anime and manga, besides the fact that the anime development of the characters is far inferior. Simply nothing comes of this original direction  despite the many glaringly obvious routes it could add to the series. Instead, Root A follows a rather slow-paced development of the supporting cast with intermittent unexplained violence. The story somewhat resembles season 1 Aldnoah Zero - intriguing major plot points outlined but no content to flesh out the story and add impact to the plot's important events.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of the problem is no doubt due to the shortness of the adaptation. The first season, while not perfect, was able to a manage a somewhat coherent story condensing around 60 chapters of manga. Root A attempts to condense something closer to 75-80 chapters and royally screws it up. Major story arcs are melded together so that the overall picture is completely nonsensical. There is no coherent progression from one event to the next; the end result is that the series as a whole feels like a haphazard, condensed jumbling of the manga. With everything feeling rushed and coming from left field, it's nearly impossible to get invested or enjoy the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are some legitimately good scenes of character development of the side characters. Suzaya Juuzou's character and his relationship to Shinohara is actually better done in the anime than the manga. Unfortunately, the rest of these character development scenes are mostly direct adaptations from the manga. If you've read the manga, you will very soon forget that this is supposed to be an original story, as 90% of each episode is cut from the manga. You really begin to question Studio Pierrot's priorities, as the main story arc is so sidelined by side stories (how ironic) that when bouts of action occur, you simply have no idea what the conflict is about. Pacing was an issue in the first season; however, Root A takes poor pacing to a new level.\\n\\n\r\nThe major climax of the manga was impactful and well thought out but gets completely butchered in the anime thanks to a missing major fight as well as the larger issue of simply not adapting enough of the main story to really understand Kaneki's profound development as a character, which is what makes the final arc so epic. Once again, I really have to question the director's priorities - if you plan to adapt the epic, final showdown of the main story arc, why wouldn't you spend more time adapting the events of the main story?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, Root A is fairly underwhelming. The art is nothing spectacular (aside from one beautifully detailed keyboard) and the animation hits power-point level quality during some fight scenes. With this show, Studio Pierrot proudly declares to the world that fighting scenes are not their fort\u00e9 and fills most major fights with smoke so nearly all art is obscured.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a similar story.  Pierrot should have kept the same opening song from the first season (Unravel by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure), which will undoubtedly be the most memorable piece of the Pierrot iteration of the franchise. This is pretty evident considering Pierrot even brought in an acoustic version was made specifically for the (rubbish) final episode of the show. The ED is a decent song but the series offers nothing spectacular when it comes to OST aside from the one standout song that came from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was an extremely disappointing follow-up to a semi-decent first season. I'm still having trouble comprehending the stupidity that was the decision to cram the brilliance of the 143 chapters of Tokyo Ghoul into 24 episodes; furthermore, the hint of a :re follow up is nothing more an insult to manga readers. Root A has some good moments of character development, but that is due entirely to a direct adaptation from manga scenes and should not be any way credited to Studio Pierrot. In fact, Root A has only shown that Studio Pierrot should not adapt any more Tokyo Ghoul material - or any material really.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Read the manga from chapter 1, watch episode 12 of the first season, avoid all else.

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSomething that is inherent in all people is the need to protect the things you love. Doing whatever it takes to keep the stuff around you safe. Either by fighting or sacrificing, as long as what truly matters to you is unharmed, the rest doesn't matter. It might be family, friends, or your dearest of objects; it's not so much what it is but the act of protecting it that matters. But there are those times when, despite how hard one tries, such protection just isn't possible. Such is the idea that Tokyo Ghoul Root Aworks with. But without being kept safe itself, it merely implodes.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRoot A (the name to be used from here on out) takes place immediately after the conclusion of the first season. Kaneki has become quite strong and through his own volition, has decided to join the \"bad\" ghoul group known as Aogiri.\\n\\n\r\n...And that's as logical of a plot as Root A offers. From then on, the show adopts a completely nonsensical and disjointed front that, even upon closer inspection, follows no semblance of thought. Kaneki's underlying problems? Sorry, those aren't looked at in depth because it's much more important to have a terribly choreographed fight scene. What about that guy during said fight? Nope, ignored completely for some asinine reason. How about the encompassing battle that was occurring around them? Nuh-uh, nothing is revealed there either. Where were the girls who have only one ghoul eye like Kaneki? What became of Yoshimura, aka \"Baby Owl\"? What was Aogiri's true motive? Why did Touka literally do nothing for twelve straight episodes? There are no answers to these questions because the show doesn't bother to talk about any of them. And it's not as if they bring them up themselves to elaborate on; they sort of lazily occur, with the narrative progressing from one instance to the next without contributing even an ounce of credible evidence as to why anything that is happening is going down.\\n\\n\r\nSince Root A cannot support itself on the events that really matter, then it falls onto the fights themselves to attempt to salvage anything that remains. But even those cannot escape the downward spiral that is happening. Not counting the lackluster animation, there is an inadequate look at both sides -- the humans and the ghouls -- which causes zero emotional resonance with any of the cast. Thus making the outcomes of the fights a moot point. Touka's \"presence\" has already been brought up, but the entirety of the cast falls into the same unimportant boat as she does. Yoshimura is given an inconsequential flashback with Koma (\"Devil Ape\") and Irimi (\"Black Dog\") receiving the absolute bare minimum of background to constitute some form of morality. Takizawa complains about being second-best, Amon can't understand Kaneki, and Shinohara is a super-nice guy to Juzo; all three men, more or less, die at some point in the anime, but their deaths hold no value because, like the plot, they are given no attention or purpose. The same goes for Hide -- his death is supposed to be somber, but it's awkwardly placed and means nothing to the audience who's only interaction with Hide was him stalking around the Dove headquarters. This all says nothing of the fights in which neither side seems to be able to kill off primary characters after receiving the wallop of a lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nHearkening back to the introduction and the established inability for the anime to craft relatable characters, one of Kaneki's supposed drives is to protect the people he loves dearly -- those at Anteiku. And to this end, he joins Aogiri, believing that by aiding them he can eradicate the people going after the only friends he has. Obviously, this notion sounds completely insane, but it at least makes sense for Root A. But (perhaps obviously again) it doesn't work: Anteiku burns and his friends are decimated. This is acceptable; as has already been discussed, sometimes protecting the things you love isn't possible. Yet Kaneki seems to just give up. So instead of continuing to try to protect his loved ones -- the whole reason the show began in the first place -- he stops, making his actions up to that moment mean as much as if he never parted ways in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Tokyo Ghoul isn't that engaging. Many dark grays, browns, and greens are used all over the place, making the anime feel more depressing than beautiful. Granted, this may be what the show was going for, but it only makes everything seem muddy. Even worse, the fight choreography and direction is lackluster, where the duels seem like an amalgamation of blobs maybe striking at one another here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for Root A can be good at times, but are nothing too impressive. The Owl is quite intimidating, Kouma's ape mask, and many of the other ghouls are definitely unique and give the necessary feeling of being alien.\\n\\n\r\nYet, actual animation pulls it all back down, being below average in most cases. The earlier episodes are the most egregious, with a loss in flow in movements, static characters, and simple facial expressions. The later episodes at times can go against these notions, but having to fight through the censoring, the bad camera work, and obstructing debris makes it hard to see much movement even when it is supposedly going on.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe problems continue for Root A when it comes to its characters. Besides being completely distant to the audience, their independent development is severely lacking. It's also difficult to pick any character to initially focus on. Not just because they are all incredibly weak, but because none of them are given enough spotlight to constitute a \"main\" status.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Kaneki is around once more this season. After his previous trauma at the hands of Jason, Kaneki is no longer the scared, helpless kid but instead a confident, strong ghoul. But following his beginning speeches and departure, his vocabulary is reduced to a lot of screaming and the occasional \"Hide...\" here and there. He has some kind of metamorphosis that essentially enwraps his mind but -- like most everything within Root A -- why this happens to him isn't clearly looked at. He manages to go around, attacking random human buildings and groups until \"finally\" realizing that he should have been there to protect Anteiku personally instead of indirectly. His character is supposedly killed (the ending is obscenely convoluted), and since his actions have been relatively unknown, his growth is nearly nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow worse than Kaneki is Touka, the semi-in-love-but-not-really girl who is doing what she can to be by Kaneki's side. After fighting to save him and him suddenly leaving her and the coffee shop, Touka is somewhat crestfallen. In order to take her mind off of the situation, she opts to go to a college while simultaneously getting nearer to Kaneki. Her inner turmoil about fitting in and the struggles she faced against her brother and society are replaced with quasi-romance feelings, effectively killing any development she may have had. Which would have been at least tolerable, had they done something with such a turn of events. Instead, after working rather hard to be with him, the two times she comes \"face-to-face\" with him, what occurs is: her attacking him and her letting him go. The former can make sense in context; she is simply letting out her frustration against the boy who won't look her way. The latter goes against what Root A had started in her. By the end, the only thing she gained was a few facts from a college textbook.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, from both the human side and the ghoul side, are not even worth mentioning. Nearly all of the Doves are given one-note personalities, with their respective persons being more foreign than the ghouls that inhabit the show. Amon does nothing but fight and complain, Akira laments about her dead relatives, and Takizawa has some forced melodrama. Other members exist, but a passing show of their messed-up face or a single line from the enemy about their power doesn't tell the audience anything about their character, let alone what kind of experiences they might have had. And the same can be said for the ghouls. All of Aogiri is filled with characters that somehow seem to have pasts with their Dove counterparts, but such revelations are never given and subsequently their characters mean nothing. Names like Noro, Tatara, and Eto are just that; names without any fraction of message behind them besides that they are \"really cool looking.\" The only character that maybe earns any sort of credibility is Juzo. He is a known psychopath working under Shinohara, with his background being explained in an exchange between the two. And after all of the time he spent with his pseudo-father, he shows some form of compassion and sadness for the only person who cared for him. Unfortunately, not even Juzo's markings are enough to keep the cast stitched together.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is extremely grating on the ears. The instruments are a mishmash of sound that doesn't seem to follow any kind of order, the singing is all over the place, and it isn't catchy at all. It's as mangled as the rest of what Root A gives.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about the anime is the ED. The drums and singing in the first half work nicely in tandem, rising and falling in power as it works its way to the halfway point. At that moment, the background singers kick in and the piano takes on a more prominent role, giving the whole a piece a presence that overtakes the whole anime. On top of all that, the various ending art for each of them is quite beautiful, too; more so than anything that the actual art for Root A used.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack often uses rather loud sounds and more pounding instruments for a higher feeling of creepiness and awe. But it can also tone down that feeling, incorporating a soft piano for those more heartfelt moments. The tracks fit the mood of the anime but aren't worth listening to outside of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, the cast performs generally around average. There are no special shout-outs to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show prioritized the fighting and the \"drama\" before anything else, and it was not something that I could effectively get behind. All of the fights were boring, predictable, or honestly dumb. Akira getting bit on the leg while Amon just stands around for no apparent reason makes no sense. Arima being able to take on the Giant Owl by himself wasn't fun to watch, it made me question why in the world he wasn't doing anything before. And the Kaneki versus Amon fight had so much smoke billowing through the area, I barely got to see any of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt has been mentioned briefly, and it has to be brought up at some point, but the ending to Root A is probably the worst ending to an anime that I've ever witnessed. At the minimum, it comes very close. Lots of hair, walking, and intentionally confusing camera work make the ending so painful to see that when it concluded I was happy that I wouldn't have to be watching this show any more.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A didn't just fail at being an anime. It failed at being anything even remotely worthwhile. The story is abysmal, the characters are atrocious, and the rest is forgetful. Honestly speaking, this is one of the worst shows I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, nonsensical, pointless, and meaningless\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring art style, okay character designs, below-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Kaneki and Touka are awful while the rest of the cast means absolutely nothing\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, lame OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, lame fights, unnecessarily confusing ending, and contains no value\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "This series is essentially what you would expect to be the end product of 12 directors and script writers playing telephone together with each episode, which would mean no overarching consistency, lack of cohesion and continuity between episodes, little to no character development, and a poor narrative. Alas, although it has turned out like a poorly written fanfiction, Tokyo Ghoul  \u221aA does not suffer from its staff playing games in its production. It's just a lackluster adaptation on all fronts, even without comparisons to its source material.\r\nThe plot is the biggest pitfall here, due to lack of clear direction and explanation. Even ignoring thatthe adaptation left out pivotal details from the manga, looking at it as a standalone, it still falls flat on its face because it leaves the viewer in a constant state of confusion. Questions arise from the very first episode and we expect them to be answered, they never are. We are left like outsiders looking in through a pane of glass, excluded from a narrative that should be feeding us something but instead we are left to guess. Why are things happening? Why are characters doing what they are doing? What are their motivations? We are given such limited information because the pacing is so rushed and for lack of ability to expound on the plot, the writers simply gave us bland fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough we grew to love and enjoy the characters in the first season where they were given some room for development, here we are suffocated by a narrative that refuses to allow us to reconnect with them. Kaneki receives no more development from the end of the first season than by the end of this season; we feel as disassociated from himself as he does \u2013 as he struggles with himself, we struggle to understand what is even going on with him because we have nothing to clue us in. It\u2019s one great question mark. Touka is perhaps the only character whose actions, thoughts, and frustrations we can truly sympathize with because she receives enough lines and screen time to convey them. There were even several compelling scenes with Ayato, but ultimately these things amount to little when the plot can\u2019t deliver. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest point of this season is the animation, although I would argue that it\u2019s not particularly spectacular. The animation is essentially acceptable which means that it is neither strong nor weak, but because it is average, it\u2019s probably the best part of the series. It seems the majority of the attention was paid to the fight scenes and everything else is rather bland\u2014and that\u2019s giving some leniency for the fighting scenes which themselves waver between interesting to drawn out and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEven the sound is average at best. The tone of the opening scarcely matches the overarching themes of the season, which is a grand disappointment in light of how amazing the opening was for the first season. That comparison aside, the opening animation is just outright disappointing and elicits none of the excitement that we should be experiencing. It accompanies a song that doesn\u2019t set the mood for the rest of the episode, by and large considering the majority of the series includes fighting, and the rest of the soundtrack occasionally sets the generally atmosphere but there is never anything particularly impressive or noticeable about any of it. Only the ending stands out as actually decent and fitting for the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the complaints above about the end product, I wouldn\u2019t be giving this even a mediocre rating if it hadn\u2019t had some redeeming qualities. One of them was a solid premise and good potential\u2014it may have not fulfilled that, but it did a decent job setting up plot points it just lacked on fulfilling them. It also has a solid cast, though not fully utilized as they should have been and not developed as they should have been, it has a good range of characters. On top of this, it does have an exciting and suspenseful final arc, though not as compelling as it promised to be, still manages to captivate interest. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, this season was poorly executed on all fronts and a great disappointment. If you enjoyed it and have not read the manga, I highly recommend it as it further develops the empty husk that is the anime series. If you are wondering whether or not you should watch it, then I would say it\u2019s a coin toss\u2014you exchange your time for some minor moments of sincerity and animated battle scenes some of which are exciting others mediocre.",

            "content": "(NOTE: This is a re-upload of the review that was originally published on March 26 2015 but then was removed. However, I was allowed to re-post it. At the time of the removal, the review had 403 likes and was the 3rd most liked review of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA.)\r\n\u201cI laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life...\u201d\r\n- LemonLyme about Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, 2015\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA is one of the most brilliant and intriguing anime I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to watch. With a breathtaking plot, well-developed characters and wonderful animation that leaves me speechless beyond measure it is definitely one of the greatest, if notTHE greatest, anime that has been, and will ever be, made.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around all of the many wonderful characters that appear in Tokyo Ghoul; Ken Kaneki (his hair is completely white now by the way. That\u2019s badass!), the Anteiku ghouls and the not-so-evil police force that tries to eliminate the poor ghouls from the surface of the Earth. But does having an unnecessary gigantic amount of characters make the anime, in any way, messy and more than often really hard to follow? No! Not at all! I actually think it would have been harder to follow the story if they hadn\u2019t decided that switching between mindless action scenes, yummy slice of life sequences and awkward gay sexual innuendos all the time was the best way to tell the story of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA. I mean, who wants to watch an anime with a well-paced, comprehensible and, Io and behold, well-written story? Not me at least, and I don\u2019t see why anybody would like to watch something like that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s move on to the best part of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA: the characters. Oh, how I love them! How I love all those unrealistic ghouls and police men who keep making moronic and unjustified decisions, those deep and multidimensional villains that pop up from nowhere and we don\u2019t get to know anything about, those poor victims that also pop up from nowhere and die a tragic death ten seconds after their first appearance! I never knew such fantastic characters existed until I watched this anime. The best character is, without a doubt, our dear protagonist Ken Kaneki. He only gets around two minutes of screen time in the first nine-ten episodes or so, and yet he gets so much character development. When he rolls around on the floor while screaming we understand that he\u2019s really sad. When he fights the good guys for the lulz we understand that he does that because he has to do it. When he joins the Aogiri organization we understand that he does that because he has to protect his friends (because the evil guys also want to protect his friends \u2013 that\u2019s what enemies are for!). The other characters are also wonderfully fleshed out and get some brilliant development; some of them are so realistic that I even tried talking to them once and touched my computer screen to see if the characters weren\u2019t real people after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are, likewise, absolutely fantastic. Especially the clumsily animated action sequences, the dialogue scenes where nothing but the mouths are moving and the derpy faces that appear in each and every scene - I can really feel that the animators put a lot of love in their work while animating this and that they definitely didn\u2019t do it just because they needed the money. I'd even go as far as say that Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA has changed my view on what ''good animation quality'' is; this anime's animation makes stuff like Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) look like complete garbage.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least: the sound. The voice acting is absolutely superb; whenever Kaneki or any of the other characters open their mouth and talk/whine/scream overdramatically I could hear angels chant somewhere far away. I can\u2019t praise the voice actors enough (especially Natsuki Hanae who voiced Kaneki and Yuki Kaji who voiced Ayato. Such dramatic! Such sensitivity! Much feels!) \u2013 Or well, almost all of them. I simply can\u2019t understand why they hired that unprofessional bastard Mamro Moyano to voice Tsukiyama. Seriously, why didn\u2019t they hire a bad voice actor instead, like the dude who voiced Kiri-gay-a in Sword Art Online?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, of course, also great. Especially the opening theme; the lyrics are simply amazing. They are so deep that they are almost 2deep4me - \u201cWe gave our love to toys (\u2026) The prostitute spat fire\u201d. I believe that whoever wrote the song is the Japanese songwriter version of Shakespeare and that s/he will receive a Grammy for \u201cBest Songwriter\u201d in five-six years, and I will definitely try to support her/him and her/his songs about the terrible porn industry all the way.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is, without a doubt, one of the best anime ever created. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will scare the heck out of you, it will make you upset, it will change your life. Before I watched this anime I was nothing but an edgy emo teen that enjoyed watching mindless horror movies and being envious of the popular girls in my class. But Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA made me see The Light. It made me understand that my current way of life was shameful and wrong, and that I should start living like a good person instead. This anime is the very reason why I am who I am today. God knows what would have happened to me if I hadn\u2019t watched this show.\\n\r\nOnce again: this show will change your way of thinking, your way of life. I simply can't recommend this anime enough. Go watch this masterpiece immediately!",

            "content": "To save you the trouble, Short Review: Wasted potential \r\nNow if you'll like to get more insight into where this show could of excelled and what it ultimately opt out for instead then continue on, as we place Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA under a analytical microscope for closer inspection. A show that had the opportunity to be more but ultimately became yet another \"schlock\" level blood bath.\r\nSocial discrimination and persecution is an issue that has plagued mankind for as long as we know it, dating back to the oldest historical texts and manuscripts. Whenever a societal group feels threatened or simply don't comprehend another group's socialnorms, hostility becomes ever present. And despite our advancements and technical prowess, this primitive reaction to the unknown is still an issue today. One just simply need to watch the news and current events to see that unfold on a daily basis. Because of this constant conflict there are many stories that try to shine light on the issue with social commentary in one form or another. May that come in the form of a song like what John Lennon, Bob Dylan and similar artists produce or familiar written works like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Animal Farm' that many of us read at school. Every storytelling medium have tackled this issue in one way or another. Anime is no exception, with every year giving rise to at least one title that takes this route.\\n\\n\r\n Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA became that title for 2014/15, with the story of a sub-species known as Ghouls and the tug of war relationship they have with humans. A very similar setup to other anime titles like Shiki, Parasyte, Shinsekai Yori and others. TG had the option to further examine and explore themes such as existentialism, the human condition, Social Darwinism and human ethics. But the common problem that most shows like Ghoul face is not being able to properly convey them. Instead it was simply an idea that took a backseat so we can get yet another action/gore fest, no different from other shows such as Gantz, Deadman Wonderland, Terra Formars etc. None of the themes are explored pass the surface level and were simply there to try to add depth to a show that clearly lacked it.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that they were trying to portray an air of maturity but the way it was executed was just juvenile. While the 1st season suffered from rushed pacing this season suffered from the exact opposite. Everything came to abrupt stop when viewed side by side with the prequel and even as a stand alone work. Several episodes will go by with obvious stagnation due to unneeded padding and an unfocused narrative. Instead of following our protagonist Kaneki and using him as a proxy to explore all these multifaceted themes they hinted at, we are instead just teased every now and then as to his metamorphosis as a character. This is a cheap way to not properly go through the correct steps of providing layered characterization. So when he is present we get a personality switch instead of a character that gets any form of development. He's simply a 2 dimensional character that moves from one side of the gradient to another. Like how bad guys can become good at the drop of a hat, this change from 'Shinji Ikari' to 'Char Aznable' is no different. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are handled superficially. Instead of focusing on molding the already sizable cast they introduce a plethora of new ones and less than a handful get fleshed out to basic standards. The rest feels like \"read the manga\" territory since they're suppose to play an important role to the plot but we never get any screentime with them to even care or remember their names. This heavy dependence on the source material just reflects on the subpar script and a lack of proper execution. Instead you remember them for their outlandish presence or caricature-like personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is standard fare but the way it goes about presenting it is deplorable. The world setting remains underdeveloped as we never see the large scale public concern that should come with such a big dilemma or even the themes common with such a setup, such as social discrimination. The closest we get to that comes in the form of the law enforcing authorities but they are made out to be a overblown sinister group, so you never feel the weigh behind their actions. They express no real empathy and only use 2 law enforcers to represent mutual camaraderie. This could of worked if those 2 characters were properly written but they never got the proper screentime due to the ever growing cast. The only time ever dedicated to world building came from the 1st handful of episodes of season 1 and even that wasn't given enough time to settle in due to the erratic pacing. Everything just felt like a giant stage play with surface deep grey morality and silly cock fights. They want you to question who's right and who's wrong but when it actually plays out it just seems laughable and childish.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an area where TG deserved credit it will be in the sound department. With well timed music cues that delivers a certain 'punch' to every accompanying scene and well composed vocal tracks that brought emphasis to moments that would normally not carry any weigh on their own.\\n\r\nAlso I may be in the minority here given the general consensus regarding the opening but I personally like it. The avant garde imagery accompanied by unique time signature instrumentals worked beautifully in unison. Add in the bittersweet vocals and it becomes even better. It's reminiscent to that of The Mars Volta and Portishead  (if anyone's even familiar with those bands) . It maybe a little too deserving for the show its attached to but it's an opening I never skipped and one I often find myself coming back to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation however leaves little to be desired. There are many instances where it becomes choppy and even had entire episodes where the quality dipped from beginning to end. Even for scenes where you think they would go all out like the Ghoul fights still contained noticeable hiccups, even to the untrained eye. This inconsistent fluidity greatly hindered one's immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the show had maintained the same level of care and effort that was found in the 1st and last episode throughout its entire runtime, then maybe, just maybe it would of had a fighting chance to be called decent. But unfortunately it didn't and what we got was the same issues found in season 1. If you have nothing to watch then go for it but as it stands its nothing that should take high priority on your radar.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul has an interesting concept, humans kills ghouls as they eat humans, ghouls kills humans to eat them as it i their primary food source. The question of who is right and wrong is not easy to answer as they have their reasons on what they do. \r\nInteresting? For me, this was what pulled me into watching this series. So as I finished season 1, I started to read the manga and it was great.\r\nI liked the manga (so I'm writing in the perspective of a manga reader), so when Studio Pierrot announced a season 2 (root A) I was kinda excited and lookedforward to it. Turns out that my hype was for naught.\\n\\n\r\nSince you're here, you've probably watched season 1 and kind of have an interest in this series (right?). Tokyo Ghoul Root A continues from where it left off in season 1, but Ishida Sui decided to write an original story for the anime. This isn't rare and isn't bad if the story is nice. But here comes the problem, it's supposed to be an anime original story, yet majority of the scenes are just taken from the original manga. If you're thinking it's not too bad, try thinking how is the anime going to be good if you adapt almost a 100 chapters of manga into a 12 episode anime. Original scenes are present, but really, only a few minutes throughout the whole anime can be called \"anime original\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story is all over the place, you won't know what are the characters thinking at all, especially kaneki. Kaneki is the main character and yet the amount of words he speak are so few, you'd probably remember him only because of his white hair or his trademark finger cracking. His character development ended the moment root A started.\\n\\n\r\nThe only notable character development goes to Suzuya Juuzou. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, mediocre? (or worse) The fight scenes are so good, people call them dancing. Sure there are some nice scenes, the close up look on kaneki, and...a really nice keyboard?\\n\\n\r\nSound wise on the other hand, are pretty well done, OST's are fitting the anime quite nicely. As for the OP, I wouldn't say it's bad, but the OP from season 1 just outclassed it. ED on the other hand, is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't  recommend to watch this. If you liked season 1, read the manga instead. Root A can be a real disappointment for you (as for me) if you're looking for the character developments and story continuation from season 1. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Described by some as horror, some as a character story, and some as a hellish battle zone that erupted from the events of season 1, Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a series that got quite a lot of people talking. Written by Ishida Sui (the brainchild of the manga), this sequel isn\u2019t just a continuation but serves as another work in the universe of TG. However, it does directly correlate with the first season so by all means, do yourself a favor and finish the first season or otherwise, this is going to be one hell of a confusing ride. Nonetheless, Tokyo Ghoul Root Agets a fair amount of attention as a sinister story that involves humans, ghouls, and a whole load of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the events of the first season, we see Kaneki\u2019s change after being tortured and now he has white hair, advanced powers, and a whole badass attitude. His personality feels different from the way he was initially introduced thanks to the tragic events that has changed him. And by all means, his actions speaks louder than words in this season. For starters, he becomes involved with an organization that he despises because of his instinct. Now that he realizes the reality of himself (being a ghoul), he takes responsibility. It\u2019s also important for viewers to realize that Kaneki doesn\u2019t necessary become an antagonist but rather choosing his path to protect what he cares about. At the same time, we see how his actions affects others. Touka is a prominent example as we see her bitter emotions from the start of the season. Portrayed essentially as a stoic girl, she now shows a lot of emotions revolving around her friends but especially for what has happened to Kaneki. Despite their short time together, it\u2019s shown that she is clearly affected by the thoughts of losing him. And really, that\u2019s what a lot of the season is all about. We see how the story\u2019s characters adapt with what has happened from the first season. Furthermore, Kaneki isn\u2019t the only focus we get as Tokyo Ghoul Root A traces its roots with all of our noticeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn storytelling, the series focuses a lot on building up events. For the majority of the first half, we see insightful narratives from groups/organizations such as Aogiri, Anteiku, and CCG. It has both a heartwarming and pale way of presenting scenarios as we see a variety of moods throughout the season. The series demonstrates a moving tale when it lets the audience see their background stories. Characters such as Akira Mado, Toka, Yoshimura all shares a dark trend of tragedy in this series. And because of that, Tokyo Ghoul builds on their personal stories that transformed the character into who they are in the present. Among other things, the series explores a variety of themes such as revenge, humanity, morality, innocence, and guilt. Surprisingly enough, it works out quite well when it combines certain elements together to craft the overlay of its story. Because the series builds on many of its events, it employs these themes to bring the show into a grimmer horror. Sure, it still relies on violence, bloodshed, and body horror to make itself credible but at the same time knows its intentions. As the series progresses on, we see some startling plot twists, revelations, and an all-out battle for survival.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tokyo Ghoul Root A focuses on various characters, there\u2019s insight on the chemistry between them. Because Kaneki is no longer with Anteiku, we now see a happier Touka; when she isn\u2019t around him anyways. However, the series does show that she feels lonely without him and their reunion turns into an emotional outburst with fists, tears, and emotions thrown right into each other. Similarly, we also see how Akira and Amon bonding because of what they\u2019ve both lost \u2013 someone they both cared for. Some characters such as Suzuya can be come as quite a bit of a strange twist. The generic crazy child character seems to fit for someone of his caliber while we also see other bizarre characters as Eto that is hard to get used to. Regardless though, the series gives them significant roles alongside many other supporting characters. Like I mentioned before, Kaneki isn\u2019t just the superstar anymore. Described by Touka as a \u201ctragic hero\u201d or what he may think he is, the series makes it hard to read what he really wants.  He\u2019s still a main event player but other characters play their roles with a goal in mind. One particular antagonist also plays the role of the Big Bad to show the audience the true powers of a ghoul really is like. In the end, how does this all work out? It\u2019s like a genre-hood of characters all pieced together in their world. Some will no doubt be memorable while I can say that others can be easily dismissed as comedic factors or otherwise, just meh.\\n\\n\r\nPierrot is the studio to adapt this series once again. In terms of animation quality values, it\u2019s hard for me to say this but it doesn\u2019t live up to the first season. One particular episode really downgraded on this with mediocre fight scenes by its budget. Luckily, the latter half makes it up with better coordination and animated scenes. And in the world of Tokyo Ghoul, there\u2019s always that moodiness that seems to flow around. The sequel\u2019s animation style portrays it quite well with the chilly nights, frosty snow, and the dark alleyways. Character designs also remain intact with the way our audience are familiar with them. Certain ghouls also gets a clear makeover to show their malevolence while CCG investigators has their technological aspects fleshed out on the surface. However, the OP song of the sequel dramatically changed. It\u2019s lazy with still moving montage of white haired Kaneki and some pretty backgrounds. Although there\u2019s some symbolism behind this, it\u2019s just downright slothful. Luckily, the ED song makes it up with this with artistic visuals and high quality imagery.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast with the artwork, soundtrack improved for this season. Both OP and ED song styles has that moody tone yet portrays its melancholy with elegance. Furthermore, many characters\u2019 voice mannerisms shows how real they feel after the events of the first season. I also give high praise to Yutaka Yamada for crafting the music of the season. With prior no experience besides the first season, he enhances almost every scenario with the skills of his musical direction. It\u2019s welcoming with a darkly yet cinematic style that I think people will find quite approachable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the sequel, I think this stands out above the original season. With tense buildups, characterization, and dark themes to go on, Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a landmark of irresistible ideas. The story is more than just about good vs evil but tells of how characters change and take action. On another note, the season also awards those who appreciates a bit of comedy. Because in most horror series, comedy is mostly absent but this sequel has a bit of that that can spawn some genuine laughter. Just be aware that on a technical scale, the series isn\u2019t as impressive in the art department. Certain characters will also be easily forgettable, or perhaps you want to forget them yourself. It\u2019s still a ride for the thrills though.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe first season of Tokyo Ghoul had three major problems: A plot that went absolutely nowhere, a lack of any real character development, and a plethora of impossible-to-take-seriously, one-dimmensional characters that completely ruined the tone and broke any immersion that might have been occurring. When it was announced that season two was going to break away from the inevitable dead-end that is the fate of an incomplete manga adaptation in favor of being based around an original story, there was widespread hope that the show would be able to correct these issues. Well, now season two is complete, and not only were thepreexisting problems from season 1 still omnipresent, they were ten times worse. They quite literally took the show in the worst possible direction. MORE focus on absurd characters that are comically flamboyant and impossible to take seriously, MORE edgy bullshit for young teenagers, LESS focus on fleshing out the character\u2019s thoughts and motivations, and LESS time spent embellishing a barebones, uninteresting plot. Oh, and did I mention that the animation went WAY downhill as well? In almost every single way, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is absolutely fucking terrible.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Directly continues right from where season 1 left off. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worse than a horrible anime is a horrible anime that is comically oblivious to how horrible it truly is. I struggle to find the words to describe just how explicitly stupid, functionally retarded, and logistically nonsensical this anime\u2019s plot really is, especially considering that it is so straightforward on paper; there are humans and there are ghouls. They don\u2019t like each other. Fighting ensues. Now, the real strength of season 1 of the show was how it tried to focus on the idea that not all ghouls have lost their humanity and how there are significant similarities between the ghouls and those hunting the ghouls. This plot point dabbles in the concept of grey morality, which is always a major plus. However, season two does away with this entirely. As I mentioned already, the amount of screentime given to the ridiculous \u201cI\u2019M CRAAAAAZY!\u201d type characters who are completely unrealistic and asinine has been upped, making the show downright hammy. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you can get passed that, season two\u2019s plot would still be ridiculous because NOTHING makes sense; nothing is justified or has any kind of logical consistency what so ever. Why did Kaneki suddenly turn into a super-badass with white hair after being tortured? I dunno. Why did he suddenly decide to join the bad guys if his only motivations are to protect his friends? I dunno. Why does he completely maintain his attachment to his friends if his morality has been altered to the point that he can now kill indiscriminately? I dunno. The anime has simply never takes the time to slow down and explain to us WHY all of these things are happening. That\u2019s not to say that the show doesn't slow down though, because it certainly does. There is NO shortage of exposition, and when I say exposition, I mean the worst possible kind of exposition. There\u2019s talking and talking and talking and yet it never feels like you are actually learning anything. It\u2019s hard to follow what all the factions are, what they are doing, and why, partially because most of it is nonsensical and partially because there\u2019s no reason to care. The storyline is an absolute trainwreck and a pain to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are even MORE of a trainwreck. Kaneki was a mediocre at best character in season one, but now he\u2019s just unbearably boring and inconsistent. His motivations make no sense what so ever and neither does the fact that he is suddenly a completely different person. Since the show refuses to explain what is going on with him, we have to decipher it for ourselves, but such a task is impossible because his behavior is so inconsistent. As previously mentioned, if his motivation for joining his new \u201cevil\u201d group of ghouls is to protect his friends (I don\u2019t even understand how that would protect his friends\u2026), why does he kill people with no remorse now? Did he lose his sense of humanity or not? We have no idea, and the show never tells us.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Touka, the detective, and all the other minor characters from season one, they are either mostly cut out of the main narrative and given a fraction of the screen time (Touka) or they simply make no progress from where they already were in the first season (detective). Tokyo Ghoul refuses to even attempt to build upon any of its characters, EXCEPT FOR THE WORST ONES! I know I\u2019ve brought this up twice already, but I can\u2019t get over that the characters they chose to focus on are the one-dimmensional looney toons who you couldn\u2019t pay me to take seriously. The Gourmet, the scarred guy (I think he\u2019s a guy\u2026) working for the detectives, and the guy who\u2019s insanely obsessed with his boss for god knows what reason? THOSE are the characters who you thought needed more screen time?! They are among the stupidest characters I\u2019ve ever seen in anime! They are crazy just for the sake of being crazy! Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the absolutely deplorable attempts to make the audience be attached to new characters who have gotten virtually no screen time, that are completely unlikable, or both. It\u2019s honestly stunning how laugh-out-loud hilariously idiotic the cast is. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA fails in a lot of ways, but none more so than in the character department.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one aspect in which Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s second season does not fail and one aspect alone: The sound design. The use of sound is very effective, seamless, and well executed. It greatly enhances the piss poor action scenes and it provides some standout tracks that are worth listening to in your spare time (Glassy Sky, anyone?). The OP got a lot of flak for, well, not being the first season\u2019s OP, but I think it\u2019s quite good. Unfortunately, the sound design does not make up for the awful animation. At least season 1 had effort put into its cinematography and action scenes (albeit they were obnoxiously censored\u2026), but this time, they look like complete garbage. The frame skips are extremely distracting, the choreography is uninspired, and the dialogue scenes have no attention to detail. It\u2019s always an issue when the second season of a show has noticeably inferior effort put into it than its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, this is the definition of an uninspired, rushed, low-quality product. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA takes everything that was wrong with the first season and amplifies it simply because that\u2019s what\u2019s easiest. This show feels like a cash grab to milk an overhyped series as it is quite evident that its production was virtually passionless. If you watched the first season of this show and aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s worth continuing, the answer is a definitive \u201cNo.\u201d",

I can\u00b4t speak for what time of day TG airs in Japan though so that\u00b4s enough said about that.\r\nSlow story, usually i don\u00b4t have a problem with that but already 5episodes in and i have no id\u00e9a what the hell is going on, the focus on the maincharacter is at a bare minium and that wouldn\u00b4t be a problem if the sidecharacters didn\u00b4t have cliffhangerflashbacks giving in to even more confusion. This all will ofcourse make sense later storywise but as far as keeping me intrested, not so much.\\n\r\n(I also found the side-character very mainstream)\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to someone who doesn\u00b4t have a standard and don\u00b4t have a problem with colourful pictures. Feels like making this \"ROUTE\" A a side story is only about milking money from whom ever get their paychecks filled.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI may get bashed for this but i stand for what i\u00b4ve said. Instant drop. Although from what i know the manga is 100% better so i suggest reading if you want to be stimulated and happy in your storytelling",

            "content": "A review of *Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA*, a disappointing second season to an already disappointing anime. \r\nFrom the beginning, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA was advertised as an anime original story by the of Tokyo Ghoul manga, Sui Ishida, and this idea is an exciting one to me as an anime-only-watcher. With so many fans complaining about how the anime butchered the manga, creating an alternate story by the mangaka himself should be an interesting way to appeal to both the manga and anime fans, right? Well, not if the story itself is more disjointed than Kaneki\u2019s fingers at the end of the first season....\r\nJust like the firstseason, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA kicked off with three strong and interesting episodes that made me interested in Tokyo Ghoul for the first time since the beginning of the first season. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA's plot turns into an absolute mess. Various events are taking place without any impact or explanation, thus leaving the viewer confused and aloof. Manga readers might know what is happening, but for everyone else, the plot is all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nKen Kaneki is effectively sidelined throughout the majority of the series with only the action sequences focusing on his character until the final episodes, thus wasting all of his character development from the first season. The majority of the screen-time goes to first season's antagonists, the CCG, specifically Investigators K\u014dtar\u014d Amon and Akira Mado. Thankfully, Amon continues to be the only worthwhile character in the entire anime, and his relationship with Akira, as rushed as it may be, is the best aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSloppily written and just plain dull, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is an absolute narrative disaster that lacks any semblance of cohesion. With that said, it is not entirely irredeemable thanks to a few minor aspects being executed surprisingly well amidst the gory mess of a plot. \\n\r\n_Watch if you like:_ Tokyo Ghoul's first season,\\n\r\n*-3.5/10*\\n",

            "content": "Everybody is probably used to the fantasy logic \"humans treated as livestock or inferior beings by someone supposed superior\", that's pretty much what half the theme in Tokyo Ghoul is about. Initially, it begins as something utterly empty, using a vague example of the nature \"there are two sides in each coin\". That there are both good and bad ghouls, both well-natured and evil humans, and slowly that meaning breaks the story from the boundaries of being just an anime. As a result, you end up wondering, why from the moment that there are so many sources to absorb intellectual information from, anime which aresupposed to be used for having fun with the concept of abnormal battles and ideal affection, make you understand certain philosophical meanings better...\\n\r\nIn the first season, the protagonist, Kaneki Ken, went through the transition from human to ghoul, the anime presented the changes in his surroundings and lifestyle, his new urges and efforts to suppress them, as well as the unknown world to everyone aside his kind and CCG he had to adapt to. We come to know bit by bit the two opposing sides, CCG and ghouls, the means of fighting and process of thinking, through incidents containing adventure, action, violence and drama we do. And towards the season's conclusion, we get introduced to the core of strength of those two opposing sides, but not only, as complex characters with unclear motives and range of thinking surpassing the incumbent exist. Hence, in Root A, all hell's breaking loose. Using the already laid foundation of the prequel, the battle of everything first season prepared to be interesting and enthralling begins. Thus, in a sense, initially the show gets you excited by exhibiting limitless complexity and introduction of situations, characters and questions to look forward to, and thereafter, it utilizes them to start the game of revealment and war. \\n\r\nAs expected, we get a better picture of everybody...CCG, Aogiri, Anteiku...and Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that makes you get excited when new characters arrive, friends or foes, and also inflict strong emotions at you. The weapons and methods of fighting that are expanding are unique at its genre, refreshing and finally prototypical. The outcome of the battles feels unpredictable, and while it deviates from cliche it can be considered somewhat cold since it's too objective and realistic. At shounen anime, that monopolize the credibility of a good battle, someone will be utterly evil and someone utterly righteous, however Tokyo Ghoul demonstrates fantasy mixed with reality. The unreal fighting skills but the realistic results a war can have, the undeniable noesis that in a conflict nobody is correct and everybody is, both sides have losers both sides have winners. Another concept mainly applied in shounen anime and absent from Tokyo Ghoul is that at decisive battles the hero will find it incredibly difficult to win but eventually will, Tokyo Ghoul fosters a differentiability and originality in fighting many might welcome. All of  the battles feel like when you're fighting bosses at play station, fortunately and unfortunately you become part of them, sense the anxiety the adrenaline, the agony for the outcome and the pleasure of defeat. In general terms, the succession of the battles do not have a main goal like in Bleach where you're waiting for Ichigo to fight Aizen, it just plays around with the interesting characters it created.\\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned the anime was realistic. Finding someone as kind and helping as Luffy and someone as badass as Zoro is unrealistic, yes, but taking the relationships and attitudes in Tokyo Ghoul rawly-leaving the supernatural aside-yes, it was realistic, these things exist in our every day lives. The unpredictability of the human mind, the way we surprise ourselves when acting unlike us during difficult situations in life or the cruelty we are able to show to one and the sweet affection to another.\\n\r\nThe explanation may be lying within all those consumed theories many authorities recorded officially and ordinary people figured out for themselves, that we instinctively draw back from everything reminding us of ourselves and shut down all logical cerebration when confronting situations and behaviors that we ourselves create or use...how the greatest and most fearful reason for destruction is fear, when we kill the insect that scares us we could also feel scared by how much illogical, automatic and high our murderous instinct is at that moment.We, real life people exterminate and place distance between us and the 'different' without the slightest effort in understanding it, exercise racism with fear as a pretext without really knowing if the subject could bother or harm us. Colored people, non-aristocrats and not only have been discriminated for centuries. Same logic applies between humans and ghouls.\\n\r\nMoving further into the folds of the story, we have the issue of violence and people beating each other \\n\r\nup in general...For that, I am going to use an example and comparison...\\n\r\nDeath Note is a hell of an interesting story, with cruel scenes that might cause a weak individual's mind to rot and foster false perceptions. However, through them it elaborates utile and pragmatic reminders, the existence of immorality and its breaking down, the sickness and distortion of the world and their annihilation by something diviner, the defiance of that divinity and its negation...Death Note generally presents all ugliness and false human judgement but only to break it down way too objectively into realism making use of the natural course of life. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, Tokyo Ghoul is also a hell of an intriguing and magnetizing story, the cruel scenes it has might affect an individual's mind whose ideals, beliefs and principles are wavering in a negative manner, it points out the existence of immorality, sickness and distortion, only unfortunately, unlike Death Note and other than that it only has to offer some yes, intriguing, but utterly trite, dramatic, loving scenes, that everybody will like but to those with at least some discriminative power will leave a bitter aftertaste.\\n\r\nAnother drawback, might be the fact that in Tokyo Ghoul you have to figure things out for yourself, people who do not like their food raw will most likely dislike that element. Because, even when you realize an answer behind a mystery, there will be no confirmation, the anime insinuates things and when you realize them you promptly take them for granted. I can feel for people who want confirmation and can not be satisfied or support their information on mere insinuations, those people will be left with a bitterness of some degree. (next sentence contains naruto spoiler). How awesome did you feel when your suspicions of Tobi being Obito got confirmed, that same way the answers in Tokyo Ghoul will be in front of your eyes only nobody will later admit it, and that is the drawback.\\n\\n\r\nThere have also been complaints about how Kaneki's screen time has been reduced. Well, you do remember where the prequel has been left off. Consequently, the continuation truly fills you up with emotions, the sudden changes in everything, the fact that it got you accustomed to a certain pace-black haired Kaneki, timid and kind, complex life but with an unbreakable order-and then it takes everything away, completely altering the pace. And for all that, it still keeps you at the edge of your seat...wondering whatever is going to happen now that everything got complexed'...agonizing about 'what Kaneki's status and personality is now. So all in all, nobody wrote a protocol or established an etiquette on how anime's range of characters should be, or what the appropriate amount of time for the lead character to be showing is. Each artist is different and writes the story based on what he has inside of him..\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are quite a few, from the Anteiku and Aogiri members to especially the CCG staff. You will consume every bit of information it reveals about them, and for those it doesn't dedicate much time to, you will ask for more. That is the level of interesting the characters in Tokyo Ghoul are. More importantly, in their case, actions speak louder than words do. For the anime will not have them uttering lengthy monologues to themselves in order to develop, like most anime made you accustomed to derive information about their depth, but via scenes from their past or direct behavior and interaction with others, you will get to know them. As you watch them engage in battles the excitement makes you want to yell 'cool' or 'badass' or 'show me more about him', like some Aogiri ghouls who kick ass in battles but you barely know their names, of course you are in position to comprehend that it is not the time to develop those certain ones now. As previously mentioned,  each character has his own tragic story, rendering you unable to blame anyone or choose sides, for the reason that everyone can be justified. \\n\r\nWhat is also realistic about Tokyo Ghoul, is that none of them can be called 'villain who's just there to piss me off, so that I can be extra glad when his time to die comes'. The author carefully explains and justifies everyone's position, rendering nobody as unnecessary. Lastly, it will be very pleasant to watch Touka as her feelings for Kaneki push harder towards the surface and as Yoshimura narrates his past, finally shattering that flawless aura surrounding him and making him look more human-or ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the artistic part, the background is absolutely brilliant, fluid and detailed, from a mere lamp post to a coffee cup. What makes a difference is a couple of sunset scenes that are being displayed from time to time, stony passages or parks with scattered leaves soaked in orange sun rays, all these are really pleasant to the eye. The character designs are slightly inferior, sometimes the lines get incohesive or their movement skewed, but in general terms they're distinguishably well elaborated. With quirky hair and beautiful eyes, or scars and specifics, unusual clothes floating and majestic badass weapons. The art is so good it makes you wonder, did I rate it that high because I liked the art or the anime, and if I was to watch it in five years that \\n\r\nthe art would be outdated would I still like it that much..\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that it is intact however, applies. That it is distant, independent, self contained and accurate, you can not get close to it or relate with something in it as you do in almost all anime, it is a finished plate of food you have no choice but to eat, but it is up to you whether you will digest it or not. Furthermore, you feel like you can entrust yourself to the author because he is reliable, it doesn't feel like he's still working the story as it is unfolding but as if he cleared and mapped out everything and now he's simply presenting it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul is not like One Piece or Code Geass, that even if you don't like the genre you have to watch it. But if you don't mind giving a little strain to your brain cells in order to think while watching, if you can handle violence and realistic endings then do watch Tokyo Ghoul. For the reason that the last seven minutes that Kaneki walks towards uncertainty and death with a body in his arms and the dignity of an angel amidst disaster and snow, shouldering all the sins and sorrow of both humans and ghouls while the amazing first opening rhythmically echoes is a pretty impressive and worthwhile scene indeed.",

The ridiculous censoring for a series that has so much gore in it makes little sense. The first season sucked because they cut out a bunch of character development to squeeze around the first 60 chapters into 12 episodes. While I'm not gonna bitch about it being an alternate ending from the manga, it still sucks. If I hadn't read the manga before watching it, I would have no understanding of it whatsoever. There are random flashbacks all over the place, and there hasn't reallybeen any legitimate justification as to why Kaneki joined Aogiri. In fact, Kaneki really hasn't had that much time on screen at all. The pacing is just horrible.",

            "content": "If it's one thing that astonished me before writing this review, it's the sheer amount of disappointment that other people are projecting in their reviews of this follow-up to one of the biggest new shows in anime as of recent. 5's and 6's flutter about in the review section stating different strengths and weaknesses that this anime had and I can agree that some of them are true to an extent. However, for those who are turned off from watching something due to a really strong resentment of choices made for a show, allow me to highlight every reason why Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is ashow worth your time while still identifying some of its apparent weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nAs some of you might know, \u221aA takes a path that the manga did not take in its plot and allows for a different approach on what might have happened in an alternate universe. For some people, (*cough* manga readers *cough*) this might be a huge turn-off. While it's been identified on nearly every corner of the anime universe on the internet that the Tokyo Ghoul anime series is not entirely on equal ground with the manga, it still comes pretty damn close. The impact of the characters' relationships with each other and the different direction their lives are turning at this point in the series becomes incredibly gripping as the story marches on, leading to some incredible revelations and unexpected turns in the plot. I was left gripping whatever was closest to me tightly by the end of every episode lost in wonder as to what would happen next. This anime does not disappoint on the thrill scale, even if there are a few episodes where it's primarily character interaction. Sure, this can occasionally drag on a little long sometimes, but I remained captivated through every second. I didn't want to miss a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season builds itself up well with an incredibly promising first episode and great development in the story and action that follow afterwards. From my understanding, there was a lot of resentment toward the way it ended, but I didn't feel resentment toward it at all. If anything, it left me incredibly intrigued seeing that there are hints of a 3rd season and a cliffhanger as well. Who knows? Maybe people will appreciate \u221aA more if there's a good 3rd season to follow it up with.\\n\\n\r\nNow I was left feeling a little bitter towards the opinions people are sharing that say there was no character development in \u221aA. Yes, the show DOES focus on the other characters more than Kaneki himself while the first season focused primarily on Kaneki but still showed good character development for all the others in the series. However, Kaneki did have a bit of character development occur in \u221aA. I wish I could speak about it without spoilers being given, but the most I can say is you do see a change in Kaneki by the end and I'm sure it was more intentional to focus more on the change in atmosphere occurring throughout \u221aA rather than Kaneki himself. Amon and Touka share a LOT of character development this season alone, and we even see changes in Juuzo for crying out loud. It gives more time to connect with the side characters and learn more about what the plot has in store for the future. I personally found myself really connecting with Amon this season and found myself loving his character more and more as it continued. But I do have some gripes to pick with \u221aA, as nothing is without its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nHaters, I do agree that there was some really jumpy messy choices with how everything was pieced together this season, both in character development and plot. Some of the plot choices in episodes made no sense regarding their relation to the overall plot of the anime. While there were certainly many interesting ideas at large here, some of them never seemed to really quite fit well or go into enough detail that would provide a satisfactory cohesion with what the viewer understands is trying to be conveyed. While the first season of Tokyo Ghoul managed to compress the first 7 volumes of the manga into 12 episodes really well, \u221aA did not succeed at making full sense of itself within its own 12 episode span. There were things that needed more elaboration and detail, more explaining on the side of Kaneki, more attention and plot relevance. Instead, we are offered mere glances at it, as if we are on the sidelines each moment Kaneki is with Aogiri as opposed to being right there alongside him. It leaves quite a bit to be answered by the time the final episode is finished, including the changes in Kaneki's character. If you've seen the final episode of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, imagine something like that which is placed entirely around Kaneki during a scene that occurred in the last episode that had showcased pieces of Kaneki's experience but a lot of everyone else's experience during that same time. That's essentially what a season 3 would seem to have to be in order to give a lot of relevance to Kaneki's infamous decision to join Aogiri at the beginning of this season. That's also where the character development falls a little flat. Kaneki does undergo character development and that's evident by the end of the season, but we're left asking ourselves what exactly happened to cause him to undergo what he did and why it's so significant or why we should care. We were forced to feel it in the first season with how brilliantly it was executed then, but Kaneki is a different person this season and we don't entirely get to see how. There were also a few things left entirely unanswered or abandoned by the end of \u221aA with a couple introductions to new plot points and characters, so hopefully we'll see a season 3 to tie that up and make sense of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for those who seek action in their Tokyo Ghoul, \u221aA does not disappoint in the very least. While maybe not among the greatest action sequences in anime, it's certainly very far from the worst. The fight sequences executed excited me to the point of where my thoughts were entirely drowned by the action taking place in front of me with their incredibly riveting contributions to the story. There is certainly a lot more action that occurs in \u221aA when compared to its predecessor and I can honestly say nothing felt too forced. The art is fantastic as well, having slightly improved since the first season. Some scenes really brought the grittiness of Tokyo Ghoul to life in ways that hadn't been previously achieved this season which I was happy to find as I continued watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed \u221aA and will recommend it to those who enjoyed season 1 and are looking to continue watching. Should there have been more episodes? Yes. Were there some things that could have been done much better? I will not deny that in the least. Were there some plot choices that could be questionable? Most certainly. Was there too much wrong for the show's own good? Maybe not. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I love Tokyo Ghoul a lot and look forward with anticipation to what might come next after experiencing all of \u221aA. I am currently reading the manga (though quite slowly because I'm reading it in Japanese for both learning and entertainment) but am in the middle of volume 2, so maybe my opinion will change after I complete the half that \u221aA is different during. But for now, \u221aA gets a light to decent 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (Creative and gripping, but fairly messy and unexplained)\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (Some improvements since season 1, which already had great art)\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (The sound during the episodes was great and the opening grew on me after a while, though it pales in comparison to the incredible opening of season 1 in both song and animation)\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 (Some characters had very strong development and roles throughout the show while others needed more attention, including Kaneki)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (Maybe it's just because I really love Tokyo Ghoul, but I had a lot of excitement and fun watching it and would not mind watching it several more times in the least)\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "I've read many reviews below, and I feel like they compare a lot back to the manga. I have not read the manga but I plan to soon. I think this anime deserves a lot more credit than it is given. \r\nI agree with many that season one was a bit slow. Each episode felt like an hour instead of 20 minutes. The character build up took much longer than it should have. I found it quite difficult to sympathize with Kaneki Ken. He was this weak kid thrown into a new world and I was bored of constantly seeing him being pushed about. Inthe end came a big twist - this strong guy with a different aura (almost sexy not going to lie) and just like everyone else, we wanted to know what happened next. Enter - season 2. This season is full of action. I feel like Kaneki Ken doesn't speak much, we only really see him in battle. I like this though, it adds a bit of mystery, it makes you fall in love with his character even more and understand his struggle/change. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great story. I\u2019m assuming a lot of the low marked reviews are due to the adaption of the story from the manga, and I can\u2019t comment on that as I have not read the manga yet. My personal opinion is that the manga will always outshine the anime. You're not always going to agree with the way an anime is made. And, if you love the manga, you're always going to think it deserves more justice. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Character \u2013 8.5\\n\\n\r\nNot going to go into lots of detail on the story as majority of the reviews explain it well. The story, for me, is very captivating.  I\u2019m sitting on the edge of my seat trying to guess what the next twist could be. I\u2019m a huge Claymore fan and the half-monster, half-human aspect really shone to me. I can\u2019t help but love Kaneki, and I totally understand his struggle as a weak human to one of the strongest ghoul. I think that struggle has been portrayed well throughout the story. There are some episodes where I think they wasted time which could have been put to better use. In particular the last episode. I'll be completely honest, I was not satisfied with it. There was too much silences, too much switching to different scenes - just stick to one bit. It felt like everything was building up - and then the storm didn't come. It was way too calm. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of distinct characters. I don\u2019t think they are given enough air time for me to appreciate truly who they are. Devil Ape and Black dog are prime examples. I only became aware of their strength during battle in episode 9. Prior that, they were workers at the coffee shop who joked around and seemed ordinary. I personally don\u2019t like Tsukiyama. I get that his character is eccentric and a bit crazy. I don\u2019t like how he bursts out in random French and English \u2013 it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It really lets the anime down and gives it that amateur look. I don\u2019t like how investigators are thrown in to the episodes; Arima recently, Hachikawa and Moragn in episode 9. However, I get they are tight on air time and so they\u2019ve thrown these investigators in with enough information for you to process that they are the \u201ctop dogs\u201d. They are the head of a division and wear a different outfit, and have a weapon that is crazy. They are trying to help me digest the characters and I appreciate that. I wish there was more character development on Hide - especially as he is predominately in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are given more air time and I can really see their development. Kaneki \u2013 we see his transition from this hopeless, weak boy, torn between two worlds to this strong, yet psychologically depressed character, who finally accepts his fate. I love that his character is more quiet and gives off this cool, calm aura in this season. He doesn\u2019t speak often, he's seen weak and trembling in some scenes. We can see he is adjusting and still not use to his full power. I love that we get glimpses of him emotional and broken because it helps the audience connect with him. I think the portrayal of his character is amazing given the short amount of time. I would not have truly appreciated him had they not dragged out his weakness in season one. It was the best way to show me his development.\\n\\n\r\nTouka in season one was stronger than Kaneki. It was like she was saving him, keeping him alive and then the tables completely turn. He is now stronger, he leaves because he wants to save the people he loves, so now he's protecting her. I actually feel sorry for Touka a lot, i can see she's lonely, misses him and shes thrown herself into studying to distract herself. I'm sure there's lots of women out there who have behaved similarly during breakups, etc - so I like how it all felt personal. It touches you because you can relate (mainly because I am a woman). Touka was the emotionally, weak person this season in comparison to season one where she was strong and independent.\\n\\n\r\nJuuzou, although brief, we understand his character, why he behaves like that and how he joined CCG. We even get a brief intro on the twins. So, even though they have less time to play with, I think they really do try to help you understand the characters. Eto is done perfectly. I love her laugh and the way she is sitting there swinging her legs like a child. I love that scene after Kaneki explains he is joining Aogiri, where she disappears with the wind around him. I love Yoshimura telling his story \u2013 that episode \u2013 I completely zoned out. It was so gripping and then the intro music starts, and you snap out of it. This anime has great characters and the dialogue is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\r\nI think it\u2019s drawn well. In some fight scenes \u2013 I wish I could maybe see a little bit more detail. I want the attacks to be more sharp, the camera angles moved a bit more and just have it all build up nicely to give a proper action feel. To me, it seems there's a lot of long distant camera shots, lots of smoke or fog during fight scenes - it takes the excitement and craziness away from it all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s poor or average. The art is above average but with a little more work, it could be epic. \\n\\n\r\nSounds \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nI think the music is beyond amazing! Season one intro \u201cUnravel\u201d \u2013 my all time favourite anime theme song. It\u2019s soft, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s rock \u2013 I just love it. Ending song \u201cSeijatachi\u201d is equally awesome. Season one is darker, psychological, full of violence and this is reflected well through the music. Season 2 is softer and reminds me of someone who is lost, confused, trying to find their way \u2013 and again this is reflected throughout. The intro \u2013 \u201cMinou\u201d is a beautiful, soft melody. \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d \u2013 is someone trying to find their way. \"White Silence\" \u2013 sounds like accepting defeat. \"On My Way\" -  just reminds me of when Kaneki left to go on his path and he leaves everyone behind.\\n\\n\r\nI love every song, they all have a meaning that is specific to the progression of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. I haven't been obsessed and dedicated to an anime like this in a loooong time. It\u2019s dark, mysterious and psychological. The story is gripping, the script and the characters voices are spot on (I watch in Japanese with English subs for reference). I feel like I can emotionally connect with the characters. It all just feels very personal and that's why I love it so much. I agree, I was let down by the last episode, I was expecting A LOT more. But still, I loved the way everything was done. How it begins and ends with the same conversation in the coffee shop. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nI think it's an awesome anime. It unquestionably has not deterred me from reading the manga - it has in fact encouraged me to do so - and to do so quickly indeed. I love the psychological element to the anime and I think that is what makes the audience connect with the characters. The music is phenomenal. I personally love Kaneki dress sense and aura - he is so hot (totally fan girling him). I appreciate that this is a 12 episode season and so I guess I give consideration to that and try not too mark low. I haven't seen many animes but this is undoubtedly in my top ten. It's something that kept me on the edge of my seat, the 'one more episode' turns into 4 more. It's addictive. Loved it.",

            "content": "This season was such a huge disappoint. I would not recommend this anime to anyone. I kept waiting for it to get good, but that just did not happen. This season was like a prime rib...without any of the seasoning: fell way below my expectations. I am throughly sad I wasted my time on this piece of trash. \r\nStory: This plot was so flawed I'm not even sure where to start. I have not read the manga so this is me speaking from watching the series only perspective. After every episode I wanted an analysis for what happened. None of it made much sense. Themain plot was not even developed. It just kept skipping around to characters and as a whole was just not cohesive. I found myself constantly waiting for explanations or for it to all make sense, but the series severely failed at delivering. I realized halfway through that this plot was just full of holes and the anime tried way too hard on making emotional character connections.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This brings me to my second point of flaw in season 2. None of the characters were well developed. At scenes where it is supposed to be emotional and gut wrenching for the viewers, I found myself feeling \"meh\". Part of this is because the series is so short...but part of is due to bad planning. I was unable to understand any of the characters, much less connect. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: Sound and Art stayed consistent with season 1, so nothing to complain there. Although the opening theme was no where as great as season 1s.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: BORING. There were spurs of exciting moments but a lot of the \"gore\" was cut out. However the spurs of exciting moments made no sense again. The way that events occurred made it seem like the anime just needed to  throw in exciting moments so captivate the viewers. Yet, the exciting moments also fell short. Kaneki is supposed to be super awesome butt kicking machine but we probably got like 5 mins of action throughout the whole series. The season finale is supposed to be a good closer but 2 mins were wasted on a part that could have been shortened to 5 secs. I get the idea of building up drama, but it was so unnecessary consider 2mins/20 mins is 1/10 of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor planning is all I have to say. Events, characters.....everything was like a train wreck...as if 10 different writers came together and wrote a season and then it was collaged together. That is the best way to summarize season 2. An absolute mess. Please just stick to season 1 or read the anime. Season 2 will leave you craving for an anime that is incapable of delivering. Fingers crossed that in the future another director will take over and give the anime a needed reboot of way longer episodes.",

            "content": "Since this is my first time writing a review, i would keep this as simple as possible. Another reason i decided to write a review for this Tokyo Ghoul is because i felt the need to point out the problems in this season. Also, this whole review is written entirely in an anime viewers perspective only.\r\nStory:3\r\nIn the first season, the story pacing was quite well as we see new characters being introduced gradually and given enough screen time to actually give viewers the idea of their backstory. I was expecting somewhat the same thing for season 2 but i was wrong. More and more newcharacters were being introduced in a ridiculously short 12 episodes, heck even in the last episode. These characters' backstory are unknown, because they never get enough screen time except to appear in meetings and in the last few episodes to make it look epic. The story pacing failed so much it's so obvious they rushed it and ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good but i would say that the fighting scenes are actually a bit off and not as good as the first season. Other than that, nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound:2\\n\\n\r\nThe OP suck so hard i actually gave it 2 because i believe no OP should have the MC to stand in the center for one and a half minutes while waiting for the song to finish. The song itself... is not good. So much disappointment compared to its prequel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:3\\n\\n\r\nIn this second season, there is barely character development. As mentioned earlier, too many new characters are being thrown into this season and its only 12 episodes long. What development can you expect when the whole story pacing is so fucked up? The part that confuses me is that 10 minutes long walk kaneki did in the last episode... 10 minutes long with minimal dialogue and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season , you probably would finish the second. If you are planning to watch the second season, i wouldn't recommend it but if you like leaving a bad taste in your mouth, go ahead. Since so many said that tokyo ghoul was so popular, i was hyped for the second season but unfortunately it was better if this sequel was never created. Perhaps it might be Pierrot's bad adaptation. I would love to rate this higher but 3 is already too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:3 \\n\\n\r\nI can feel the anime has good potential ever since i watched the first season although i never read the original manga. But Season 2 is just completely garbage. What a waste...",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nIf you haven't seen either series yet then stop reading this review because am going to spoil everything.\r\nHave you ever had an anime adaptation that made you cry? Not in a good way where you were perfectly satisfied with the adaption but in a way where the anime competently threw your expectations out of the window in favour of having a shallow anime adaptation that not only removes all the charm of set manga but also competently destroys everything that made set manga awesome in the part. Well, you\u2019re not alone. As a person who is notmuch of a manga pursuit, I was gravely disappointed with the Negima/UQ Holder animes because while they were fun adaptations that I enjoyed, for the most part, they don\u2019t really up well as an adaptation as both series skipped a lot of important contents that made this series special to me. Every time I watch Negima and UQ Holder anime I always to tear mainly because these will never reach the heights of the manga. I don\u2019t hate them, but they kinda left with a bad taste in my mouth. What does this have to do with Tokyo Ghoul put to straightforward? Tokyo Ghoul is not only a terrible anime that cannot even hold up on it, but it\u2019s also a horrendous adaptation that completely everything that the manga has going for. I honestly cannot believe how freaking terribly this adaptation. Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows an average bookworm namedKen Kaneki, has desired an attractive woman. On their first date, said woman reveals herself to be a monster known as a \"ghoul\", a creature in human form that feeds on human flesh. Having taken the time to trap him, she prepares to eat him when a falling girder smashes her to bits and leaves Kaneki horribly injured. Saved through a transplant of organs from the dead girl woman, Kaneki is left with the inability to eat normal food and hunger that just won't go away. It doesn't take long before Kaneki realizes what's happened to him, and the broad implications of being a person who belongs to both the human and the ghoul world.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I tragically talk about the things that I hated about the story am going to quickly talk about the things that I liked about the story of Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul was how the show established the world in the beginning. We see that, despite people living normal life\u2019s they had to fear the presence of ghouls where at any moment in the night the people in Tokyo can potently become prey for the ghouls. On the other side, the ghouls would not only have to take people dead or alive to the ghouls feasting grounds but they also have to try not caught by the CCG who be trying to put down the ghouls. These two things along really like the world of Tokyo Ghoul alive. Two races trying living they peaceful lives in Tokyo but the confidence that happens inevitably seem to have these races clash with each other in a negative light. This aspect was the thing that drove me into the world of Tokyo Ghoul and while the manga did this far better the anime least the first season did a pretty solid job at establishing its world.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final thing that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul was episodes 1, 12, 22 and 23 because not only these episodes perfectly captured the tone of the series but they were the episodes that had the most effort throughout its 24 episode run. Not to mention there were actually enjoyable to watch unlike the rest of the episodes from this subpar series which I will get in a bit.\\n\r\nSo those are the two things that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul. Now let's get into the stuff that I didn't like/hated about the story and I have 5 big problems with Tokyo Ghoul that completely killed the series.\\n\\n\r\n1: Identity crisis.\\n\r\nOne of the first things that you will notice about Tokyo Ghoul it has an identity crisis. On one hand this show can a gritty psychology seinen that stays true to manga counterpart for the most while in the other it can be this out of place dark shounen series that has no business being their thanks to how the show was set up in the beginning. The dark shounen elements really start to over the show once you get to Root A where most of the psychology seinen elements of Tokyo Ghoul were either heavily watered down or non-existent.\\n\\n\r\n2: Pacing.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul in general moves at a very fast phase as the shows tires to mostly adapt a 144 chapter manga into 24 episodes, however, the only ended up suffering massive as the show despite being very fast paced it left a lot of plot elements that were important cut. This doesn't end there the show does a shitty job at keeping the viewer interested with the overall plot as the fast pacing completely ruins most of the interesting plot points and as a result of many of the plot points there were done in the manga are no longer interesting to follow. Case in point the Aogiri Tree stuff in the end of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets worse in Root A where not only the show completely goes anime original but many story arcs such as the\u00a0Raid On Kanous Lab and\u00a0Anteiku Cafe Invasion feel so rushed and disjointed to a point where character development and the main purpose for these arcs are thrown out the window in favour of showcasing boring shounen tier fights that have no place being in a senien.\\n\\n\r\nThree: Season 2 aka Root A has a whole.\\n\r\nRoot A, in general, was just a poorly directed mess that had no idea to focus plus the writing and pacing for that season were in an all-time low to a point where certain scenes and pieces of dialogue were left unfinished. Am not even joking. To add insult to injury Season aka Root A was filler despite the manga finishing Ummm I don't know\u00a04 MONTHS BEFORE THE FIRST EPISODE OF ROOT A STARTED AIRING. Like are you for real Studio Pierrot...\\n\\n\r\nFour: Episode 4 of Root A.\\n\r\nIf there was one freaking episode that represents everything wrong with this series it would be episode 4 of Root A. Not only it featured some of the worst animations that I have ever experienced in any anime but that episode narratively was disgusting to a point where every single character in that episode including humans behaved like animals where scream and grunt a lot without much as a thought. Truly one of the worst episodes I have ever experienced as an anime as it really shows how garbage the directing of Root A\u00a0was.\\n\\n\r\nFive: The final episode aka episode 12 of Root A.\\n\r\nThat episode alone was the final nail of the coffin of the series because not only the directing was unbelievably insulting for the viewer but that episode left a lot of unanswered questions and plotholes that were not explained from both season 1 and 2. To add insult to injury instead of seeing the Kaneki vs Arima fight that was hyped up since the beginning of season 2 the show decided to feature the now infamous Kaneki carrying Hide's body for 5 minutes and by the time where we got to the Kaneki vs Arima\u00a0fight, the show decided to cut off to the ending credits as well skipping the Kaneki vs Arima fight completely. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I have never seen a show simply self-destruct like that where the show literally gave up and decided to blow up itself splashing its ghoul blood all over our faces. Ghostbusters Tokyo Ghoul Root A you\u2019re now officially the most soulless anime adaption filler nonsense I have ever seen.\\n\r\nOverall the story of Tokyo Ghoul is tragically garbage.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot took one of the best modern mangas out there and decided to butcher it to oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters are not much better and that's the tragic part because the characters can be great but the directing, pacing and the way that they are handled leaves them at best underdeveloped and at worse an empty shell of the manga counterparts.\\n\r\nLet's start with Kankei who is by far the most mishandled protagonist I have seen in season 1 he was a pretty okay character where he was trying to adapt his best to adapt to ghoul life while trying to lose his humanity.\\n\r\nUnfortunately as the series progresses everything that was good/decent Kaneki took a dark path for the worst and when you get to Root A he devolves into empty husk where he barely appears in the show despite being his story. Not to mention his dialogue has reduced to scream and talking every now and then. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that his reasoning of joining the Aogiri Tree in episode 1 was retarded in the previous season they tried to kill him with Jason torturing him. What a mess of a character if I ever think of one.\\n\r\nNext is Touka where do I begin with this waste of space. She was a decent character in the first season the where she was a pretty good monitor for Kaneki where she teaches him to control his kagune. Also after he helps her avenge Ryouko, she starts to treat Kaneki in a more friendly manner. Unfortunately after Kaneki kidnapping incident as well him joining Aogiri Tree everything about her takes a turn for the worse and the second half of Root A she devolves into dismal in distress where she does nothing in the narrative other than to promote teenage angst as well running around in circles looking for her prince Kaneki. Am not kidding.\\n\r\nTOUKA SPENDS 3 EPISODES IN ROOT A RUNNING AROUND FOR KANEKI. What a disgrace.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Tokyo Ghoul seemed to appear and disappear on screen for the plot. They are not worth mentioning at all.\\n\r\nThe only good characters I liked in Tokyo Ghoul Amon and Juuzou as they are both decent and engaging characters that justify their ideals. Other than that the characters in Tokyo Ghoul are at best shallow and mishandled.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that the Tokyo Ghoul falls flat it would be the visuals. While at times the series at times can give pretty solid animation and great secretly many times the show just look below average at best that it filled with a lot of hiccups.\\n\r\nThe characters designs, for the most part, are nothing home to write about as they mostly feature generic and basic characters models that did an okay job at presenting. The only characters designs that were great were Juuzou and Kaneki when he goes white hair everyone else just feels bad by comparison especially when you compare them to the manga counterparts where they actually look great.\\n\r\nThe CGI that was used in Root A was abysmal that rivals Gantz CGI. Seriously what the hell was the character designer was thinking when making theses suit armour\u2026\\n\r\nThe background scenery least in the first season was pretty okay. The first and final episode of season 1 seemed to be the highlights for the series as these episodes use of the beautiful urban colour palette that perfectly captures the atmosphere and tone of the series. It\u2019s such a shame that the rest of the first season looks your boring slice of life shounen series. As for Root A background scenery\u2026 OH GOD. While the first season tried to decent background scenery Root A doesn\u2019t even try to adequate scenery as season shameless dumps in many greys, black oranges and browns all over it the show backgrounds making the show more depressing and dark than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the worst part about the visuals the animation.\\n\r\nWhile the first season mostly had decent animation that had some good fights every now and then it still feels like a low budget production throughout half of its run.\\n\r\nThe animation in Root A, on the other hand, ranges from subpar at best, and an abomination at worse. Minus the decently engaging Kaneki vs Amon fight in episode 11 Root A is generally a poorly animated mess that is filled with budget cuts and choppy movement.\\n\r\nThe worst case of this was in episode 4 where the animation literally shits itself as not only the fight choreography in that episode was piss poor but the visual directing and character was piss poor.\\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that I want to address about is the censorship and like with the animation in Root A it really bad. The show censorship favour is to cover the screen with the use of negative filters and blacks every time something slightly violent happens. When I watch this show on Netflix half of time I had to guess what was happening while the other half I had to literally read the manga to understand the full picture\\n\r\nIf the animate is going to animate a fight than let us the viewer watch the fight. Don\u2019t do these cringe-inducing censorships because that can easily annoy the viewer to a point where they will only end dropping set series.\\n\r\nI am aware that the series now has an uncensored version on DVD/Blu Ray from Funimation US and UK Anime Limited but am not going to go out there and by the Blu-Ray just to watch the uncensored version of the same that is from a subpar series such as shit. I eventually watch the uncensored version of Tokyo Ghoul by borrowing my friends Blu-Ray copy where I re-watch the whole series just so I take notes for this review that you\u2019re now currently reading. Also watching this show uncensored did not change my opinion of this show at all as I still think it a shit series regardless of which version that I watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\u00a0\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul is by far the best thing about this series.\\n\r\nThe music is filled with pretty atmospheric tracks that perfectly captures the urban dark tone of the series.\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul is pretty good by itself it's how it's show directed the soundtrack that makes it pretty annoying. Tokyo Ghoul Root A contains a lot of amazing emotional tracks such Glass in the Sky,\u00a0On My Own and Wanderers but the problem is Root A completely abused it interest songs to a point where they no longer have any meaning or purpose as the interest songs at times seem to play at random scenes in Root A\\n\r\nThe worst part about the show sound directing happens in the final episode where the show played an Unravel\u00a0Acoustic. The track by itself is meant to be a heartbreaking emotional piece that was meant to close the series in a sad way. However, for some unknown reason, the song suddenly stops playing while the\u00a0Kaneki walking scene is still going on in complete silent for another 3 minutes...\\n\r\nJust why!!!\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 opening theme unravel\" by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures the tone and atmosphere of the series. It's also extremely catchy.\\n\r\nRoot A's opening theme on the other hand sucks. While\u00a0Munou by \u00f6sterreich is a pretty good song on its own the problem with the opening is how it was directed as it featured terribly animated visuals that feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 ending theme\u00a0Seijatachi by People In The Box is a pretty decent ending that did an alright job at closing off an episode of the first season.\\n\r\nRoot A's ending theme\u00a0Kisetsu wa Tsugitsugi Shindeiku by Amazarashi is one of the best ending themes I ever heard in a long while as it filled with energy and passion that perfectly closes an episode of Root A.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is filled with pretty strong performances all across the board as each\u00a0Seiyuu did a great job bringing these characters to life into the anime. So there is that.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Tokyo Ghoul is very underwhelming. \\n\r\nDespite having very noticeable dub actors such as\u00a0Austin Tindle (Kankei),\u00a0Brina Palencia (Touka)\u00a0Todd Haberkorn (Ayato)\u00a0Christopher Sabat (Jason) and\u00a0John Michael Tatum (Tsukiyama) the overall acting feels so wooden, flat or downright forced at times.\\n\r\nStick with the sub for this for this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a perfect example of how to not do an anime adaption.\\n\r\nThe story is a poorly written and directed mess that doesn't do the source material justice.\\n\r\nThe characters are for the most part are butchered versions of the manga counterparts and visuals range from okay to absolutely horrendous.\\n\r\nThe only good things about Tokyo Ghoul is the music and a couple of decent characters that are in it that are in it everything else is at best awful.\\n\r\nIf you want to get into Tokyo Ghoul please for the love Sui Ishida heart read the manga.\\n\r\nStart from chapter 1, download the soundtrack for Tokyo Ghoul for background music then read it from there.\\n\r\nDon't waste your time with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.5/10",

            "content": "I have heard a lot of hate for Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA and I'll be honest, it triggered my brain to have very low expectations towards it when I first got into it. I did not really absorb the first season as it was incredibly rushed except for a few episodes so it only deformed my expectations for the second season.\r\nBut boy, I was not disappointed.\r\nI have not read the manga and therefore, I entered this series completely blank and you may think of me as 'not a real fan of Tokyo Ghoul' for not reading the manga, but it definitely helped me enjoy the animeso I am not complaining.\\n\\n\r\nFACT: You CAN appreciate an anime without a religious standing with the manga. That is something I find in a lot of manga fans who are deluded into thinking that an anime would suck if it did not follow the manga.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA is one of the animes that prove this delusional thinking wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the storyline did not completely follow the actual manga, it still delivered the suspense and melancholy of the characters' situations and for me, it was not as rushed as the first season and took its time building on the story of the CCG investigators' lives as well as following Kaneki's brutal growth while in Aogiri. It makes me appreciate both the lives of the ghouls and the humans fighting against them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the ending finished everything perfectly... I won't spoil it but the image of life, death and the struggles of both ghouls and humans were beautifully depicted and it becomes one of my favourite scenes in anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for its art, sound and character, it is mostly consistent and plays along the psychotic melancholic nature of the anime. I have no additional comments other than how I am always captivated by the music of this anime; both this season and the prequel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion? To hell with all your gourmet expectations to anime based on the original manga. If an anime is executed well, it becomes amazing. If a manga is total trash, it is still trash. Don't be closed minded and you may be able to appreciate both anime and manga equally. \\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA receives a generous 9/10 from me~!",

I won't get into the thick of it but to summarize most people's complaints:\r\nCons\r\n1. Stupid bad animation for a show with this much fighting. \r\n2. Poor time management.  There was a lot of just nothing happening on the screen with just walking or something.  The problem with this is:\r\n3. About 50% of what happened in the manga was skipped, whether it was personal internal monologues, or simply arcs. Its almost as if they simply ripped pages out of a book.  My complaint is:If you're running short on time, don't fill it with nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n1. The ending song and most of the music was very good.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be extremely long if I went any further so I'll leave you just one bit of advice: Read the manga. It is worlds better.",

            "content": "While the first season of Tokyo Ghoul wasn\u2019t perfect, with underdeveloped villains, censoring, and leaving things about the setting unexplained, it still had entertaining elements and an ending that delivered some hard hitting truths. I had high hopes for what was to come, considering how much more interesting the main character and his conflict had become. You\u2019ll find that the second season doesn\u2019t deliver on the promises that were set up. Instead it leaves you disconnected from the main character, making him barely even appear on screen for most of the show. Instead we focus on the minor characters, something that I did appreciate, yetI wished it would have been secondary to the actual main character\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nSome positives would include the great animation and the diligent use of atmosphere, the direction definitely improved in terms of giving the show more personality and flavor. However, saying it has a great style doesn\u2019t equal having much substance. We are left with a finale that introduces completely new characters that we know nothing about, fighting each other with spectacle rather than with compelling motivations. This would have worked had this season been the build-up for a third season, but sadly it decided to blow its entire load in one go.\\n\\n\r\nI have left the most important part for last, which is the context that I watched the series in. This has technically nothing to do with the actual show, but it definitely affected how I viewed the story. For one I could not escape hearing how this season was supposed to go its own path, away from the manga. From what I understand the story just ended up being a condensed version of the manga with a few tweaks here and there, which means it is still not different enough to warrant being called an alternative story-line. This means it still cannot escape being compared to the manga. It seems to me that only manga-readers could actually fully enjoy this season, since it would show them several of the best parts of the story animated. For the rest of us though, it is just a mess of a commercial telling us to buy the manga. Because of this I will call this season out for what it is, a cash-grab, designed to be confusing and just barely enjoyable so that the audience will feel compelled to read the manga instead. So as a cautionary tale, if you haven\u2019t watched the series yet, skip it and read the source-material.",

            "content": "The first season of Tokyo Ghoul, while certainly not reaching the heights as the manga, was an enjoyable exposition to the series that was able lead newcomers like me to binge read the entire 143 chapter manga in two days. As a stand alone show, ignoring the quality of the manga, it was pretty good.\r\nRoot A, however, is trash from an anime-viewer-only perspective and worse than trash if you've read the manga. It is a mess of unexplained plot points that insult the complexity of the source material it was adapted from. For all the hype generated by Sui Ishida creating an original plot linefor the anime to follow, Root A fell inconceivably short in almost all areas it could. Studio Pierrot proved itself completely inadequate to handling the franchise and we can only hope that the Tokyo Ghoul series gets the Brotherhood-esque 50-episode reboot with a much better studio.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a promising opening episode that immediately introduced a difference in story to the manga, Root A never seemed to be interested in actually developing an original story. From one episode to the next, content was centered around adaptations of the sidestory in the manga. I never got the feeling that there even was  an original element to the story. Kaneki, who should've been the focal point of the so-called \"original plot\", is left thoroughly underdeveloped and recieves approximately half a minute of air-time per episode. I was excited for the prospect of a different take on perhaps the manga's weakest arc, but found myself disappointed by the lack of attention to the main character. For all intents and purposes, there are zero differences in plot progression between the anime and manga, besides the fact that the anime development of the characters is far inferior. Simply nothing comes of this original direction  despite the many glaringly obvious routes it could add to the series. Instead, Root A follows a rather slow-paced development of the supporting cast with intermittent unexplained violence. The story somewhat resembles season 1 Aldnoah Zero - intriguing major plot points outlined but no content to flesh out the story and add impact to the plot's important events.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of the problem is no doubt due to the shortness of the adaptation. The first season, while not perfect, was able to a manage a somewhat coherent story condensing around 60 chapters of manga. Root A attempts to condense something closer to 75-80 chapters and royally screws it up. Major story arcs are melded together so that the overall picture is completely nonsensical. There is no coherent progression from one event to the next; the end result is that the series as a whole feels like a haphazard, condensed jumbling of the manga. With everything feeling rushed and coming from left field, it's nearly impossible to get invested or enjoy the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are some legitimately good scenes of character development of the side characters. Suzaya Juuzou's character and his relationship to Shinohara is actually better done in the anime than the manga. Unfortunately, the rest of these character development scenes are mostly direct adaptations from the manga. If you've read the manga, you will very soon forget that this is supposed to be an original story, as 90% of each episode is cut from the manga. You really begin to question Studio Pierrot's priorities, as the main story arc is so sidelined by side stories (how ironic) that when bouts of action occur, you simply have no idea what the conflict is about. Pacing was an issue in the first season; however, Root A takes poor pacing to a new level.\\n\\n\r\nThe major climax of the manga was impactful and well thought out but gets completely butchered in the anime thanks to a missing major fight as well as the larger issue of simply not adapting enough of the main story to really understand Kaneki's profound development as a character, which is what makes the final arc so epic. Once again, I really have to question the director's priorities - if you plan to adapt the epic, final showdown of the main story arc, why wouldn't you spend more time adapting the events of the main story?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, Root A is fairly underwhelming. The art is nothing spectacular (aside from one beautifully detailed keyboard) and the animation hits power-point level quality during some fight scenes. With this show, Studio Pierrot proudly declares to the world that fighting scenes are not their fort\u00e9 and fills most major fights with smoke so nearly all art is obscured.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a similar story.  Pierrot should have kept the same opening song from the first season (Unravel by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure), which will undoubtedly be the most memorable piece of the Pierrot iteration of the franchise. This is pretty evident considering Pierrot even brought in an acoustic version was made specifically for the (rubbish) final episode of the show. The ED is a decent song but the series offers nothing spectacular when it comes to OST aside from the one standout song that came from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was an extremely disappointing follow-up to a semi-decent first season. I'm still having trouble comprehending the stupidity that was the decision to cram the brilliance of the 143 chapters of Tokyo Ghoul into 24 episodes; furthermore, the hint of a :re follow up is nothing more an insult to manga readers. Root A has some good moments of character development, but that is due entirely to a direct adaptation from manga scenes and should not be any way credited to Studio Pierrot. In fact, Root A has only shown that Studio Pierrot should not adapt any more Tokyo Ghoul material - or any material really.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Read the manga from chapter 1, watch episode 12 of the first season, avoid all else. Or, wait for the 50-episode remake of Tokyo Ghoul it deserves with a competent studio.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSomething that is inherent in all people is the need to protect the things you love. Doing whatever it takes to keep the stuff around you safe. Either by fighting or sacrificing, as long as what truly matters to you is unharmed, the rest doesn't matter. It might be family, friends, or your dearest of objects; it's not so much what it is but the act of protecting it that matters. But there are those times when, despite how hard one tries, such protection just isn't possible. Such is the idea that Tokyo Ghoul Root Aworks with. But without being kept safe itself, it merely implodes.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRoot A (the name to be used from here on out) takes place immediately after the conclusion of the first season. Kaneki has become quite strong and through his own volition, has decided to join the \"bad\" ghoul group known as Aogiri.\\n\\n\r\n...And that's as logical of a plot as Root A offers. From then on, the show adopts a completely nonsensical and disjointed front that, even upon closer inspection, follows no semblance of thought. Kaneki's underlying problems? Sorry, those aren't looked at in depth because it's much more important to have a terribly choreographed fight scene. What about that guy during said fight? Nope, ignored completely for some asinine reason. How about the encompassing battle that was occurring around them? Nuh-uh, nothing is revealed there either. Where were the girls who have only one ghoul eye like Kaneki? What became of Yoshimura, aka \"Baby Owl\"? What was Aogiri's true motive? Why did Touka literally do nothing for twelve straight episodes? There are no answers to these questions because the show doesn't bother to talk about any of them. And it's not as if they bring them up themselves to elaborate on; they sort of lazily occur, with the narrative progressing from one instance to the next without contributing even an ounce of credible evidence as to why anything that is happening is going down.\\n\\n\r\nSince Root A cannot support itself on the events that really matter, then it falls onto the fights themselves to attempt to salvage anything that remains. But even those cannot escape the downward spiral that is happening. Not counting the lackluster animation, there is an inadequate look at both sides -- the humans and the ghouls -- which causes zero emotional resonance with any of the cast. Thus making the outcomes of the fights a moot point. Touka's \"presence\" has already been brought up, but the entirety of the cast falls into the same unimportant boat as she does. Yoshimura is given an inconsequential flashback with Koma (\"Devil Ape\") and Irimi (\"Black Dog\") receiving the absolute bare minimum of background to constitute some form of morality. Takizawa complains about being second-best, Amon can't understand Kaneki, and Shinohara is a super-nice guy to Juzo; all three men, more or less, die at some point in the anime, but their deaths hold no value because, like the plot, they are given no attention or purpose. The same goes for Hide -- his death is supposed to be somber, but it's awkwardly placed and means nothing to the audience who's only interaction with Hide was him stalking around the Dove headquarters. This all says nothing of the fights in which neither side seems to be able to kill off primary characters after receiving the wallop of a lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nHearkening back to the introduction and the established inability for the anime to craft relatable characters, one of Kaneki's supposed drives is to protect the people he loves dearly -- those at Anteiku. And to this end, he joins Aogiri, believing that by aiding them he can eradicate the people going after the only friends he has. Obviously, this notion sounds completely insane, but it at least makes sense for Root A. But (perhaps obviously again) it doesn't work: Anteiku burns and his friends are decimated. This is acceptable; as has already been discussed, sometimes protecting the things you love isn't possible. Yet Kaneki seems to just give up. So instead of continuing to try to protect his loved ones -- the whole reason the show began in the first place -- he stops, making his actions up to that moment mean as much as if he never parted ways in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Tokyo Ghoul isn't that engaging. Many dark grays, browns, and greens are used all over the place, making the anime feel more depressing than beautiful. Granted, this may be what the show was going for, but it only makes everything seem muddy. Even worse, the fight choreography and direction is lackluster, where the duels seem like an amalgamation of blobs maybe striking at one another here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for Root A can be good at times, but are nothing too impressive. The Owl is quite intimidating, Kouma's ape mask, and many of the other ghouls are definitely unique and give the necessary feeling of being alien.\\n\\n\r\nYet, actual animation pulls it all back down, being below average in most cases. The earlier episodes are the most egregious, with a loss in flow in movements, static characters, and simple facial expressions. The later episodes at times can go against these notions, but having to fight through the censoring, the bad camera work, and obstructing debris makes it hard to see much movement even when it is supposedly going on.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe problems continue for Root A when it comes to its characters. Besides being completely distant to the audience, their independent development is severely lacking. It's also difficult to pick any character to initially focus on. Not just because they are all incredibly weak, but because none of them are given enough spotlight to constitute a \"main\" status.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Kaneki is around once more this season. After his previous trauma at the hands of Jason, Kaneki is no longer the scared, helpless kid but instead a confident, strong ghoul. But following his beginning speeches and departure, his vocabulary is reduced to a lot of screaming and the occasional \"Hide...\" here and there. He has some kind of metamorphosis that essentially enwraps his mind but -- like most everything within Root A -- why this happens to him isn't clearly looked at. He manages to go around, attacking random human buildings and groups until \"finally\" realizing that he should have been there to protect Anteiku personally instead of indirectly. His character is supposedly killed (the ending is obscenely convoluted), and since his actions have been relatively unknown, his growth is nearly nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow worse than Kaneki is Touka, the semi-in-love-but-not-really girl who is doing what she can to be by Kaneki's side. After fighting to save him and him suddenly leaving her and the coffee shop, Touka is somewhat crestfallen. In order to take her mind off of the situation, she opts to go to a college while simultaneously getting nearer to Kaneki. Her inner turmoil about fitting in and the struggles she faced against her brother and society are replaced with quasi-romance feelings, effectively killing any development she may have had. Which would have been at least tolerable, had they done something with such a turn of events. Instead, after working rather hard to be with him, the two times she comes \"face-to-face\" with him, what occurs is: her attacking him and her letting him go. The former can make sense in context; she is simply letting out her frustration against the boy who won't look her way. The latter goes against what Root A had started in her. By the end, the only thing she gained was a few facts from a college textbook.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, from both the human side and the ghoul side, are not even worth mentioning. Nearly all of the Doves are given one-note personalities, with their respective persons being more foreign than the ghouls that inhabit the show. Amon does nothing but fight and complain, Akira laments about her dead relatives, and Takizawa has some forced melodrama. Other members exist, but a passing show of their messed-up face or a single line from the enemy about their power doesn't tell the audience anything about their character, let alone what kind of experiences they might have had. And the same can be said for the ghouls. All of Aogiri is filled with characters that somehow seem to have pasts with their Dove counterparts, but such revelations are never given and subsequently their characters mean nothing. Names like Noro, Tatara, and Eto are just that; names without any fraction of message behind them besides that they are \"really cool looking.\" The only character that maybe earns any sort of credibility is Juzo. He is a known psychopath working under Shinohara, with his background being explained in an exchange between the two. And after all of the time he spent with his pseudo-father, he shows some form of compassion and sadness for the only person who cared for him. Unfortunately, not even Juzo's markings are enough to keep the cast stitched together.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is extremely grating on the ears. The instruments are a mishmash of sound that doesn't seem to follow any kind of order, the singing is all over the place, and it isn't catchy at all. It's as mangled as the rest of what Root A gives.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about the anime is the ED. The drums and singing in the first half work nicely in tandem, rising and falling in power as it works its way to the halfway point. At that moment, the background singers kick in and the piano takes on a more prominent role, giving the whole a piece a presence that overtakes the whole anime. On top of all that, the various ending art for each of them is quite beautiful, too; more so than anything that the actual art for Root A used.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack often uses rather loud sounds and more pounding instruments for a higher feeling of creepiness and awe. But it can also tone down that feeling, incorporating a soft piano for those more heartfelt moments. The tracks fit the mood of the anime but aren't worth listening to outside of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, the cast performs generally around average. There are no special shout-outs to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show prioritized the fighting and the \"drama\" before anything else, and it was not something that I could effectively get behind. All of the fights were boring, predictable, or honestly dumb. Akira getting bit on the leg while Amon just stands around for no apparent reason makes no sense. Arima being able to take on the Giant Owl by himself wasn't fun to watch, it made me question why in the world he wasn't doing anything before. And the Kaneki versus Amon fight had so much smoke billowing through the area, I barely got to see any of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt has been mentioned briefly, and it has to be brought up at some point, but the ending to Root A is probably the worst ending to an anime that I've ever witnessed. At the minimum, it comes very close. Lots of hair, walking, and intentionally confusing camera work make the ending so painful to see that when it concluded I was happy that I wouldn't have to be watching this show any more.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A didn't just fail at being an anime. It failed at being anything even remotely worthwhile. The story is abysmal, the characters are atrocious, and the rest is forgetful. Honestly speaking, this is one of the worst shows I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, nonsensical, pointless, and meaningless\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring art style, okay character designs, below-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Kaneki and Touka are awful while the rest of the cast means absolutely nothing\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, lame OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, lame fights, unnecessarily confusing ending, and contains no value\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "This series is essentially what you would expect to be the end product of 12 directors and script writers playing telephone together with each episode, which would mean no overarching consistency, lack of cohesion and continuity between episodes, little to no character development, and a poor narrative. Alas, although it has turned out like a poorly written fanfiction, Tokyo Ghoul  \u221aA does not suffer from its staff playing games in its production. It's just a lackluster adaptation on all fronts, even without comparisons to its source material.\r\nThe plot is the biggest pitfall here, due to lack of clear direction and explanation. Even ignoring thatthe adaptation left out pivotal details from the manga, looking at it as a standalone, it still falls flat on its face because it leaves the viewer in a constant state of confusion. Questions arise from the very first episode and we expect them to be answered, they never are. We are left like outsiders looking in through a pane of glass, excluded from a narrative that should be feeding us something but instead we are left to guess. Why are things happening? Why are characters doing what they are doing? What are their motivations? We are given such limited information because the pacing is so rushed and for lack of ability to expound on the plot, the writers simply gave us bland fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough we grew to love and enjoy the characters in the first season where they were given some room for development, here we are suffocated by a narrative that refuses to allow us to reconnect with them. Kaneki receives no more development from the end of the first season than by the end of this season; we feel as disassociated from himself as he does \u2013 as he struggles with himself, we struggle to understand what is even going on with him because we have nothing to clue us in. It\u2019s one great question mark. Touka is perhaps the only character whose actions, thoughts, and frustrations we can truly sympathize with because she receives enough lines and screen time to convey them. There were even several compelling scenes with Ayato, but ultimately these things amount to little when the plot can\u2019t deliver. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest point of this season is the animation, although I would argue that it\u2019s not particularly spectacular. The animation is essentially acceptable which means that it is neither strong nor weak, but because it is average, it\u2019s probably the best part of the series. It seems the majority of the attention was paid to the fight scenes and everything else is rather bland\u2014and that\u2019s giving some leniency for the fighting scenes which themselves waver between interesting to drawn out and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEven the sound is average at best. The tone of the opening scarcely matches the overarching themes of the season, which is a grand disappointment in light of how amazing the opening was for the first season. That comparison aside, the opening animation is just outright disappointing and elicits none of the excitement that we should be experiencing. It accompanies a song that doesn\u2019t set the mood for the rest of the episode, by and large considering the majority of the series includes fighting, and the rest of the soundtrack occasionally sets the generally atmosphere but there is never anything particularly impressive or noticeable about any of it. Only the ending stands out as actually decent and fitting for the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the complaints above about the end product, I wouldn\u2019t be giving this even a mediocre rating if it hadn\u2019t had some redeeming qualities. One of them was a solid premise and good potential\u2014it may have not fulfilled that, but it did a decent job setting up plot points it just lacked on fulfilling them. It also has a solid cast, though not fully utilized as they should have been and not developed as they should have been, it has a good range of characters. On top of this, it does have an exciting and suspenseful final arc, though not as compelling as it promised to be, still manages to captivate interest. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, this season was poorly executed on all fronts and a great disappointment. If you enjoyed it and have not read the manga, I highly recommend it as it further develops the empty husk that is the anime series. If you are wondering whether or not you should watch it, then I would say it\u2019s a coin toss\u2014you exchange your time for some minor moments of sincerity and animated battle scenes some of which are exciting others mediocre.",

            "content": "(NOTE: This is a re-upload of the review that was originally published on March 26 2015 but then was removed. However, I was allowed to re-post it. At the time of the removal, the review had 403 likes and was the 3rd most liked review of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA.)\r\n\u201cI laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life...\u201d\r\n- LemonLyme about Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, 2015\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA is one of the most brilliant and intriguing anime I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to watch. With a breathtaking plot, well-developed characters and wonderful animation that leaves me speechless beyond measure it is definitely one of the greatest, if notTHE greatest, anime that has been, and will ever be, made.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around all of the many wonderful characters that appear in Tokyo Ghoul; Ken Kaneki (his hair is completely white now by the way. That\u2019s badass!), the Anteiku ghouls and the not-so-evil police force that tries to eliminate the poor ghouls from the surface of the Earth. But does having an unnecessary gigantic amount of characters make the anime, in any way, messy and more than often really hard to follow? No! Not at all! I actually think it would have been harder to follow the story if they hadn\u2019t decided that switching between mindless action scenes, yummy slice of life sequences and awkward gay sexual innuendos all the time was the best way to tell the story of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA. I mean, who wants to watch an anime with a well-paced, comprehensible and, Io and behold, well-written story? Not me at least, and I don\u2019t see why anybody would like to watch something like that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s move on to the best part of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA: the characters. Oh, how I love them! How I love all those unrealistic ghouls and police men who keep making moronic and unjustified decisions, those deep and multidimensional villains that pop up from nowhere and we don\u2019t get to know anything about, those poor victims that also pop up from nowhere and die a tragic death ten seconds after their first appearance! I never knew such fantastic characters existed until I watched this anime. The best character is, without a doubt, our dear protagonist Ken Kaneki. He only gets around two minutes of screen time in the first nine-ten episodes or so, and yet he gets so much character development. When he rolls around on the floor while screaming we understand that he\u2019s really sad. When he fights the good guys for the lulz we understand that he does that because he has to do it. When he joins the Aogiri organization we understand that he does that because he has to protect his friends (because the evil guys also want to protect his friends \u2013 that\u2019s what enemies are for!). The other characters are also wonderfully fleshed out and get some brilliant development; some of them are so realistic that I even tried talking to them once and touched my computer screen to see if the characters weren\u2019t real people after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are, likewise, absolutely fantastic. Especially the clumsily animated action sequences, the dialogue scenes where nothing but the mouths are moving and the derpy faces that appear in each and every scene - I can really feel that the animators put a lot of love in their work while animating this and that they definitely didn\u2019t do it just because they needed the money. I'd even go as far as say that Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA has changed my view on what ''good animation quality'' is; this anime's animation makes stuff like Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) look like complete garbage.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least: the sound. The voice acting is absolutely superb; whenever Kaneki or any of the other characters open their mouth and talk/whine/scream overdramatically I could hear angels chant somewhere far away. I can\u2019t praise the voice actors enough (especially Natsuki Hanae who voiced Kaneki and Yuki Kaji who voiced Ayato. Such dramatic! Such sensitivity! Much feels!) \u2013 Or well, almost all of them. I simply can\u2019t understand why they hired that unprofessional bastard Mamro Moyano to voice Tsukiyama. Seriously, why didn\u2019t they hire a bad voice actor instead, like the dude who voiced Kiri-gay-a in Sword Art Online?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, of course, also great. Especially the opening theme; the lyrics are simply amazing. They are so deep that they are almost 2deep4me - \u201cWe gave our love to toys (\u2026) The prostitute spat fire\u201d. I believe that whoever wrote the song is the Japanese songwriter version of Shakespeare and that s/he will receive a Grammy for \u201cBest Songwriter\u201d in five-six years, and I will definitely try to support her/him and her/his songs about the terrible porn industry all the way.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is, without a doubt, one of the best anime ever created. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will scare the heck out of you, it will make you upset, it will change your life. Before I watched this anime I was nothing but an edgy emo teen that enjoyed watching mindless horror movies and being envious of the popular girls in my class. But Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA made me see The Light. It made me understand that my current way of life was shameful and wrong, and that I should start living like a good person instead. This anime is the very reason why I am who I am today. God knows what would have happened to me if I hadn\u2019t watched this show.\\n\r\nOnce again: this show will change your way of thinking, your way of life. I simply can't recommend this anime enough. Go watch this masterpiece immediately!",

            "content": "To save you the trouble, Short Review: Wasted potential \r\nNow if you'll like to get more insight into where this show could of excelled and what it ultimately opt out for instead then continue on, as we place Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA under a analytical microscope for closer inspection. A show that had the opportunity to be more but ultimately became yet another \"schlock\" level blood bath.\r\nSocial discrimination and persecution is an issue that has plagued mankind for as long as we know it, dating back to the oldest historical texts and manuscripts. Whenever a societal group feels threatened or simply don't comprehend another group's socialnorms, hostility becomes ever present. And despite our advancements and technical prowess, this primitive reaction to the unknown is still an issue today. One just simply need to watch the news and current events to see that unfold on a daily basis. Because of this constant conflict there are many stories that try to shine light on the issue with social commentary in one form or another. May that come in the form of a song like what John Lennon, Bob Dylan and similar artists produce or familiar written works like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Animal Farm' that many of us read at school. Every storytelling medium have tackled this issue in one way or another. Anime is no exception, with every year giving rise to at least one title that takes this route.\\n\\n\r\n Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA became that title for 2014/15, with the story of a sub-species known as Ghouls and the tug of war relationship they have with humans. A very similar setup to other anime titles like Shiki, Parasyte, Shinsekai Yori and others. TG had the option to further examine and explore themes such as existentialism, the human condition, Social Darwinism and human ethics. But the common problem that most shows like Ghoul face is not being able to properly convey them. Instead it was simply an idea that took a backseat so we can get yet another action/gore fest, no different from other shows such as Gantz, Deadman Wonderland, Terra Formars etc. None of the themes are explored pass the surface level and were simply there to try to add depth to a show that clearly lacked it.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that they were trying to portray an air of maturity but the way it was executed was just juvenile. While the 1st season suffered from rushed pacing this season suffered from the exact opposite. Everything came to abrupt stop when viewed side by side with the prequel and even as a stand alone work. Several episodes will go by with obvious stagnation due to unneeded padding and an unfocused narrative. Instead of following our protagonist Kaneki and using him as a proxy to explore all these multifaceted themes they hinted at, we are instead just teased every now and then as to his metamorphosis as a character. This is a cheap way to not properly go through the correct steps of providing layered characterization. So when he is present we get a personality switch instead of a character that gets any form of development. He's simply a 2 dimensional character that moves from one side of the gradient to another. Like how bad guys can become good at the drop of a hat, this change from 'Shinji Ikari' to 'Char Aznable' is no different. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are handled superficially. Instead of focusing on molding the already sizable cast they introduce a plethora of new ones and less than a handful get fleshed out to basic standards. The rest feels like \"read the manga\" territory since they're suppose to play an important role to the plot but we never get any screentime with them to even care or remember their names. This heavy dependence on the source material just reflects on the subpar script and a lack of proper execution. Instead you remember them for their outlandish presence or caricature-like personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is standard fare but the way it goes about presenting it is deplorable. The world setting remains underdeveloped as we never see the large scale public concern that should come with such a big dilemma or even the themes common with such a setup, such as social discrimination. The closest we get to that comes in the form of the law enforcing authorities but they are made out to be a overblown sinister group, so you never feel the weigh behind their actions. They express no real empathy and only use 2 law enforcers to represent mutual camaraderie. This could of worked if those 2 characters were properly written but they never got the proper screentime due to the ever growing cast. The only time ever dedicated to world building came from the 1st handful of episodes of season 1 and even that wasn't given enough time to settle in due to the erratic pacing. Everything just felt like a giant stage play with surface deep grey morality and silly cock fights. They want you to question who's right and who's wrong but when it actually plays out it just seems laughable and childish.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an area where TG deserved credit it will be in the sound department. With well timed music cues that delivers a certain 'punch' to every accompanying scene and well composed vocal tracks that brought emphasis to moments that would normally not carry any weigh on their own.\\n\r\nAlso I may be in the minority here given the general consensus regarding the opening but I personally like it. The avant garde imagery accompanied by unique time signature instrumentals worked beautifully in unison. Add in the bittersweet vocals and it becomes even better. It's reminiscent to that of The Mars Volta and Portishead  (if anyone's even familiar with those bands) . It maybe a little too deserving for the show its attached to but it's an opening I never skipped and one I often find myself coming back to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation however leaves little to be desired. There are many instances where it becomes choppy and even had entire episodes where the quality dipped from beginning to end. Even for scenes where you think they would go all out like the Ghoul fights still contained noticeable hiccups, even to the untrained eye. This inconsistent fluidity greatly hindered one's immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the show had maintained the same level of care and effort that was found in the 1st and last episode throughout its entire runtime, then maybe, just maybe it would of had a fighting chance to be called decent. But unfortunately it didn't and what we got was the same issues found in season 1. If you have nothing to watch then go for it but as it stands its nothing that should take high priority on your radar.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul has an interesting concept, humans kills ghouls as they eat humans, ghouls kills humans to eat them as it i their primary food source. The question of who is right and wrong is not easy to answer as they have their reasons on what they do. \r\nInteresting? For me, this was what pulled me into watching this series. So as I finished season 1, I started to read the manga and it was great.\r\nI liked the manga (so I'm writing in the perspective of a manga reader), so when Studio Pierrot announced a season 2 (root A) I was kinda excited and lookedforward to it. Turns out that my hype was for naught.\\n\\n\r\nSince you're here, you've probably watched season 1 and kind of have an interest in this series (right?). Tokyo Ghoul Root A continues from where it left off in season 1, but Ishida Sui decided to write an original story for the anime. This isn't rare and isn't bad if the story is nice. But here comes the problem, it's supposed to be an anime original story, yet majority of the scenes are just taken from the original manga. If you're thinking it's not too bad, try thinking how is the anime going to be good if you adapt almost a 100 chapters of manga into a 12 episode anime. Original scenes are present, but really, only a few minutes throughout the whole anime can be called \"anime original\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story is all over the place, you won't know what are the characters thinking at all, especially kaneki. Kaneki is the main character and yet the amount of words he speak are so few, you'd probably remember him only because of his white hair or his trademark finger cracking. His character development ended the moment root A started.\\n\\n\r\nThe only notable character development goes to Suzuya Juuzou. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, mediocre? (or worse) The fight scenes are so good, people call them dancing. Sure there are some nice scenes, the close up look on kaneki, and...a really nice keyboard?\\n\\n\r\nSound wise on the other hand, are pretty well done, OST's are fitting the anime quite nicely. As for the OP, I wouldn't say it's bad, but the OP from season 1 just outclassed it. ED on the other hand, is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't  recommend to watch this. If you liked season 1, read the manga instead. Root A can be a real disappointment for you (as for me) if you're looking for the character developments and story continuation from season 1. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Described by some as horror, some as a character story, and some as a hellish battle zone that erupted from the events of season 1, Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a series that got quite a lot of people talking. Written by Ishida Sui (the brainchild of the manga), this sequel isn\u2019t just a continuation but serves as another work in the universe of TG. However, it does directly correlate with the first season so by all means, do yourself a favor and finish the first season or otherwise, this is going to be one hell of a confusing ride. Nonetheless, Tokyo Ghoul Root Agets a fair amount of attention as a sinister story that involves humans, ghouls, and a whole load of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the events of the first season, we see Kaneki\u2019s change after being tortured and now he has white hair, advanced powers, and a whole badass attitude. His personality feels different from the way he was initially introduced thanks to the tragic events that has changed him. And by all means, his actions speaks louder than words in this season. For starters, he becomes involved with an organization that he despises because of his instinct. Now that he realizes the reality of himself (being a ghoul), he takes responsibility. It\u2019s also important for viewers to realize that Kaneki doesn\u2019t necessary become an antagonist but rather choosing his path to protect what he cares about. At the same time, we see how his actions affects others. Touka is a prominent example as we see her bitter emotions from the start of the season. Portrayed essentially as a stoic girl, she now shows a lot of emotions revolving around her friends but especially for what has happened to Kaneki. Despite their short time together, it\u2019s shown that she is clearly affected by the thoughts of losing him. And really, that\u2019s what a lot of the season is all about. We see how the story\u2019s characters adapt with what has happened from the first season. Furthermore, Kaneki isn\u2019t the only focus we get as Tokyo Ghoul Root A traces its roots with all of our noticeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn storytelling, the series focuses a lot on building up events. For the majority of the first half, we see insightful narratives from groups/organizations such as Aogiri, Anteiku, and CCG. It has both a heartwarming and pale way of presenting scenarios as we see a variety of moods throughout the season. The series demonstrates a moving tale when it lets the audience see their background stories. Characters such as Akira Mado, Toka, Yoshimura all shares a dark trend of tragedy in this series. And because of that, Tokyo Ghoul builds on their personal stories that transformed the character into who they are in the present. Among other things, the series explores a variety of themes such as revenge, humanity, morality, innocence, and guilt. Surprisingly enough, it works out quite well when it combines certain elements together to craft the overlay of its story. Because the series builds on many of its events, it employs these themes to bring the show into a grimmer horror. Sure, it still relies on violence, bloodshed, and body horror to make itself credible but at the same time knows its intentions. As the series progresses on, we see some startling plot twists, revelations, and an all-out battle for survival.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tokyo Ghoul Root A focuses on various characters, there\u2019s insight on the chemistry between them. Because Kaneki is no longer with Anteiku, we now see a happier Touka; when she isn\u2019t around him anyways. However, the series does show that she feels lonely without him and their reunion turns into an emotional outburst with fists, tears, and emotions thrown right into each other. Similarly, we also see how Akira and Amon bonding because of what they\u2019ve both lost \u2013 someone they both cared for. Some characters such as Suzuya can be come as quite a bit of a strange twist. The generic crazy child character seems to fit for someone of his caliber while we also see other bizarre characters as Eto that is hard to get used to. Regardless though, the series gives them significant roles alongside many other supporting characters. Like I mentioned before, Kaneki isn\u2019t just the superstar anymore. Described by Touka as a \u201ctragic hero\u201d or what he may think he is, the series makes it hard to read what he really wants.  He\u2019s still a main event player but other characters play their roles with a goal in mind. One particular antagonist also plays the role of the Big Bad to show the audience the true powers of a ghoul really is like. In the end, how does this all work out? It\u2019s like a genre-hood of characters all pieced together in their world. Some will no doubt be memorable while I can say that others can be easily dismissed as comedic factors or otherwise, just meh.\\n\\n\r\nPierrot is the studio to adapt this series once again. In terms of animation quality values, it\u2019s hard for me to say this but it doesn\u2019t live up to the first season. One particular episode really downgraded on this with mediocre fight scenes by its budget. Luckily, the latter half makes it up with better coordination and animated scenes. And in the world of Tokyo Ghoul, there\u2019s always that moodiness that seems to flow around. The sequel\u2019s animation style portrays it quite well with the chilly nights, frosty snow, and the dark alleyways. Character designs also remain intact with the way our audience are familiar with them. Certain ghouls also gets a clear makeover to show their malevolence while CCG investigators has their technological aspects fleshed out on the surface. However, the OP song of the sequel dramatically changed. It\u2019s lazy with still moving montage of white haired Kaneki and some pretty backgrounds. Although there\u2019s some symbolism behind this, it\u2019s just downright slothful. Luckily, the ED song makes it up with this with artistic visuals and high quality imagery.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast with the artwork, soundtrack improved for this season. Both OP and ED song styles has that moody tone yet portrays its melancholy with elegance. Furthermore, many characters\u2019 voice mannerisms shows how real they feel after the events of the first season. I also give high praise to Yutaka Yamada for crafting the music of the season. With prior no experience besides the first season, he enhances almost every scenario with the skills of his musical direction. It\u2019s welcoming with a darkly yet cinematic style that I think people will find quite approachable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the sequel, I think this stands out above the original season. With tense buildups, characterization, and dark themes to go on, Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a landmark of irresistible ideas. The story is more than just about good vs evil but tells of how characters change and take action. On another note, the season also awards those who appreciates a bit of comedy. Because in most horror series, comedy is mostly absent but this sequel has a bit of that that can spawn some genuine laughter. Just be aware that on a technical scale, the series isn\u2019t as impressive in the art department. Certain characters will also be easily forgettable, or perhaps you want to forget them yourself. It\u2019s still a ride for the thrills though.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe first season of Tokyo Ghoul had three major problems: A plot that went absolutely nowhere, a lack of any real character development, and a plethora of impossible-to-take-seriously, one-dimmensional characters that completely ruined the tone and broke any immersion that might have been occurring. When it was announced that season two was going to break away from the inevitable dead-end that is the fate of an incomplete manga adaptation in favor of being based around an original story, there was widespread hope that the show would be able to correct these issues. Well, now season two is complete, and not only were thepreexisting problems from season 1 still omnipresent, they were ten times worse. They quite literally took the show in the worst possible direction. MORE focus on absurd characters that are comically flamboyant and impossible to take seriously, MORE edgy bullshit for young teenagers, LESS focus on fleshing out the character\u2019s thoughts and motivations, and LESS time spent embellishing a barebones, uninteresting plot. Oh, and did I mention that the animation went WAY downhill as well? In almost every single way, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is absolutely fucking terrible.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Directly continues right from where season 1 left off. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worse than a horrible anime is a horrible anime that is comically oblivious to how horrible it truly is. I struggle to find the words to describe just how explicitly stupid, functionally retarded, and logistically nonsensical this anime\u2019s plot really is, especially considering that it is so straightforward on paper; there are humans and there are ghouls. They don\u2019t like each other. Fighting ensues. Now, the real strength of season 1 of the show was how it tried to focus on the idea that not all ghouls have lost their humanity and how there are significant similarities between the ghouls and those hunting the ghouls. This plot point dabbles in the concept of grey morality, which is always a major plus. However, season two does away with this entirely. As I mentioned already, the amount of screentime given to the ridiculous \u201cI\u2019M CRAAAAAZY!\u201d type characters who are completely unrealistic and asinine has been upped, making the show downright hammy. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you can get passed that, season two\u2019s plot would still be ridiculous because NOTHING makes sense; nothing is justified or has any kind of logical consistency what so ever. Why did Kaneki suddenly turn into a super-badass with white hair after being tortured? I dunno. Why did he suddenly decide to join the bad guys if his only motivations are to protect his friends? I dunno. Why does he completely maintain his attachment to his friends if his morality has been altered to the point that he can now kill indiscriminately? I dunno. The anime has simply never takes the time to slow down and explain to us WHY all of these things are happening. That\u2019s not to say that the show doesn't slow down though, because it certainly does. There is NO shortage of exposition, and when I say exposition, I mean the worst possible kind of exposition. There\u2019s talking and talking and talking and yet it never feels like you are actually learning anything. It\u2019s hard to follow what all the factions are, what they are doing, and why, partially because most of it is nonsensical and partially because there\u2019s no reason to care. The storyline is an absolute trainwreck and a pain to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are even MORE of a trainwreck. Kaneki was a mediocre at best character in season one, but now he\u2019s just unbearably boring and inconsistent. His motivations make no sense what so ever and neither does the fact that he is suddenly a completely different person. Since the show refuses to explain what is going on with him, we have to decipher it for ourselves, but such a task is impossible because his behavior is so inconsistent. As previously mentioned, if his motivation for joining his new \u201cevil\u201d group of ghouls is to protect his friends (I don\u2019t even understand how that would protect his friends\u2026), why does he kill people with no remorse now? Did he lose his sense of humanity or not? We have no idea, and the show never tells us.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Touka, the detective, and all the other minor characters from season one, they are either mostly cut out of the main narrative and given a fraction of the screen time (Touka) or they simply make no progress from where they already were in the first season (detective). Tokyo Ghoul refuses to even attempt to build upon any of its characters, EXCEPT FOR THE WORST ONES! I know I\u2019ve brought this up twice already, but I can\u2019t get over that the characters they chose to focus on are the one-dimmensional looney toons who you couldn\u2019t pay me to take seriously. The Gourmet, the scarred guy (I think he\u2019s a guy\u2026) working for the detectives, and the guy who\u2019s insanely obsessed with his boss for god knows what reason? THOSE are the characters who you thought needed more screen time?! They are among the stupidest characters I\u2019ve ever seen in anime! They are crazy just for the sake of being crazy! Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the absolutely deplorable attempts to make the audience be attached to new characters who have gotten virtually no screen time, that are completely unlikable, or both. It\u2019s honestly stunning how laugh-out-loud hilariously idiotic the cast is. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA fails in a lot of ways, but none more so than in the character department.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one aspect in which Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s second season does not fail and one aspect alone: The sound design. The use of sound is very effective, seamless, and well executed. It greatly enhances the piss poor action scenes and it provides some standout tracks that are worth listening to in your spare time (Glassy Sky, anyone?). The OP got a lot of flak for, well, not being the first season\u2019s OP, but I think it\u2019s quite good. Unfortunately, the sound design does not make up for the awful animation. At least season 1 had effort put into its cinematography and action scenes (albeit they were obnoxiously censored\u2026), but this time, they look like complete garbage. The frame skips are extremely distracting, the choreography is uninspired, and the dialogue scenes have no attention to detail. It\u2019s always an issue when the second season of a show has noticeably inferior effort put into it than its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, this is the definition of an uninspired, rushed, low-quality product. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA takes everything that was wrong with the first season and amplifies it simply because that\u2019s what\u2019s easiest. This show feels like a cash grab to milk an overhyped series as it is quite evident that its production was virtually passionless. If you watched the first season of this show and aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s worth continuing, the answer is a definitive \u201cNo.\u201d",

With so many fans complaining about how the anime butchered the manga, creating an alternate story by the mangaka himself should be an interesting way to appeal to both the manga and anime fans, right? Well, not if the story itself is more disjointed than Kaneki\u2019s fingers at the end of the first season....\r\nJust like the firstseason, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA kicked off with three strong and interesting episodes that made me interested in Tokyo Ghoul for the first time since the beginning of the first season. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA's plot turns into an absolute mess. Various events are taking place without any impact or explanation, thus leaving the viewer confused and aloof. Manga readers might know what is happening, but for everyone else, the plot is all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nKen Kaneki is effectively sidelined throughout the majority of the series with only the action sequences focusing on his character until the final episodes, thus wasting all of his character development from the first season. The majority of the screen-time goes to first season's antagonists, the CCG, specifically Investigators K\u014dtar\u014d Amon and Akira Mado. Thankfully, Amon continues to be the only worthwhile character in the entire anime, and his relationship with Akira, as rushed as it may be, is the best aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSloppily written and just plain dull, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is an absolute narrative disaster that lacks any semblance of cohesion. With that said, it is not entirely irredeemable thanks to a few minor aspects being executed surprisingly well amidst the gory mess of a plot. \\n\r\n_Watch if you like:_ Tokyo Ghoul's first season,\\n\r\n*-3.5/10*\\n",

            "content": "Everybody is probably used to the fantasy logic \"humans treated as livestock or inferior beings by someone supposed superior\", that's pretty much what half the theme in Tokyo Ghoul is about. Initially, it begins as something utterly empty, using a vague example of the nature \"there are two sides in each coin\". That there are both good and bad ghouls, both well-natured and evil humans, and slowly that meaning breaks the story from the boundaries of being just an anime. As a result, you end up wondering, why from the moment that there are so many sources to absorb intellectual information from, anime which aresupposed to be used for having fun with the concept of abnormal battles and ideal affection, make you understand certain philosophical meanings better...\\n\r\nIn the first season, the protagonist, Kaneki Ken, went through the transition from human to ghoul, the anime presented the changes in his surroundings and lifestyle, his new urges and efforts to suppress them, as well as the unknown world to everyone aside his kind and CCG he had to adapt to. We come to know bit by bit the two opposing sides, CCG and ghouls, the means of fighting and process of thinking, through incidents containing adventure, action, violence and drama we do. And towards the season's conclusion, we get introduced to the core of strength of those two opposing sides, but not only, as complex characters with unclear motives and range of thinking surpassing the incumbent exist. Hence, in Root A, all hell's breaking loose. Using the already laid foundation of the prequel, the battle of everything first season prepared to be interesting and enthralling begins. Thus, in a sense, initially the show gets you excited by exhibiting limitless complexity and introduction of situations, characters and questions to look forward to, and thereafter, it utilizes them to start the game of revealment and war. \\n\r\nAs expected, we get a better picture of everybody...CCG, Aogiri, Anteiku...and Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that makes you get excited when new characters arrive, friends or foes, and also inflict strong emotions at you. The weapons and methods of fighting that are expanding are unique at its genre, refreshing and finally prototypical. The outcome of the battles feels unpredictable, and while it deviates from cliche it can be considered somewhat cold since it's too objective and realistic. At shounen anime, that monopolize the credibility of a good battle, someone will be utterly evil and someone utterly righteous, however Tokyo Ghoul demonstrates fantasy mixed with reality. The unreal fighting skills but the realistic results a war can have, the undeniable noesis that in a conflict nobody is correct and everybody is, both sides have losers both sides have winners. Another concept mainly applied in shounen anime and absent from Tokyo Ghoul is that at decisive battles the hero will find it incredibly difficult to win but eventually will, Tokyo Ghoul fosters a differentiability and originality in fighting many might welcome. All of  the battles feel like when you're fighting bosses at play station, fortunately and unfortunately you become part of them, sense the anxiety the adrenaline, the agony for the outcome and the pleasure of defeat. In general terms, the succession of the battles do not have a main goal like in Bleach where you're waiting for Ichigo to fight Aizen, it just plays around with the interesting characters it created.\\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned the anime was realistic. Finding someone as kind and helping as Luffy and someone as badass as Zoro is unrealistic, yes, but taking the relationships and attitudes in Tokyo Ghoul rawly-leaving the supernatural aside-yes, it was realistic, these things exist in our every day lives. The unpredictability of the human mind, the way we surprise ourselves when acting unlike us during difficult situations in life or the cruelty we are able to show to one and the sweet affection to another.\\n\r\nThe explanation may be lying within all those consumed theories many authorities recorded officially and ordinary people figured out for themselves, that we instinctively draw back from everything reminding us of ourselves and shut down all logical cerebration when confronting situations and behaviors that we ourselves create or use...how the greatest and most fearful reason for destruction is fear, when we kill the insect that scares us we could also feel scared by how much illogical, automatic and high our murderous instinct is at that moment.We, real life people exterminate and place distance between us and the 'different' without the slightest effort in understanding it, exercise racism with fear as a pretext without really knowing if the subject could bother or harm us. Colored people, non-aristocrats and not only have been discriminated for centuries. Same logic applies between humans and ghouls.\\n\r\nMoving further into the folds of the story, we have the issue of violence and people beating each other \\n\r\nup in general...For that, I am going to use an example and comparison...\\n\r\nDeath Note is a hell of an interesting story, with cruel scenes that might cause a weak individual's mind to rot and foster false perceptions. However, through them it elaborates utile and pragmatic reminders, the existence of immorality and its breaking down, the sickness and distortion of the world and their annihilation by something diviner, the defiance of that divinity and its negation...Death Note generally presents all ugliness and false human judgement but only to break it down way too objectively into realism making use of the natural course of life. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, Tokyo Ghoul is also a hell of an intriguing and magnetizing story, the cruel scenes it has might affect an individual's mind whose ideals, beliefs and principles are wavering in a negative manner, it points out the existence of immorality, sickness and distortion, only unfortunately, unlike Death Note and other than that it only has to offer some yes, intriguing, but utterly trite, dramatic, loving scenes, that everybody will like but to those with at least some discriminative power will leave a bitter aftertaste.\\n\r\nAnother drawback, might be the fact that in Tokyo Ghoul you have to figure things out for yourself, people who do not like their food raw will most likely dislike that element. Because, even when you realize an answer behind a mystery, there will be no confirmation, the anime insinuates things and when you realize them you promptly take them for granted. I can feel for people who want confirmation and can not be satisfied or support their information on mere insinuations, those people will be left with a bitterness of some degree. (next sentence contains naruto spoiler). How awesome did you feel when your suspicions of Tobi being Obito got confirmed, that same way the answers in Tokyo Ghoul will be in front of your eyes only nobody will later admit it, and that is the drawback.\\n\\n\r\nThere have also been complaints about how Kaneki's screen time has been reduced. Well, you do remember where the prequel has been left off. Consequently, the continuation truly fills you up with emotions, the sudden changes in everything, the fact that it got you accustomed to a certain pace-black haired Kaneki, timid and kind, complex life but with an unbreakable order-and then it takes everything away, completely altering the pace. And for all that, it still keeps you at the edge of your seat...wondering whatever is going to happen now that everything got complexed'...agonizing about 'what Kaneki's status and personality is now. So all in all, nobody wrote a protocol or established an etiquette on how anime's range of characters should be, or what the appropriate amount of time for the lead character to be showing is. Each artist is different and writes the story based on what he has inside of him..\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are quite a few, from the Anteiku and Aogiri members to especially the CCG staff. You will consume every bit of information it reveals about them, and for those it doesn't dedicate much time to, you will ask for more. That is the level of interesting the characters in Tokyo Ghoul are. More importantly, in their case, actions speak louder than words do. For the anime will not have them uttering lengthy monologues to themselves in order to develop, like most anime made you accustomed to derive information about their depth, but via scenes from their past or direct behavior and interaction with others, you will get to know them. As you watch them engage in battles the excitement makes you want to yell 'cool' or 'badass' or 'show me more about him', like some Aogiri ghouls who kick ass in battles but you barely know their names, of course you are in position to comprehend that it is not the time to develop those certain ones now. As previously mentioned,  each character has his own tragic story, rendering you unable to blame anyone or choose sides, for the reason that everyone can be justified. \\n\r\nWhat is also realistic about Tokyo Ghoul, is that none of them can be called 'villain who's just there to piss me off, so that I can be extra glad when his time to die comes'. The author carefully explains and justifies everyone's position, rendering nobody as unnecessary. Lastly, it will be very pleasant to watch Touka as her feelings for Kaneki push harder towards the surface and as Yoshimura narrates his past, finally shattering that flawless aura surrounding him and making him look more human-or ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the artistic part, the background is absolutely brilliant, fluid and detailed, from a mere lamp post to a coffee cup. What makes a difference is a couple of sunset scenes that are being displayed from time to time, stony passages or parks with scattered leaves soaked in orange sun rays, all these are really pleasant to the eye. The character designs are slightly inferior, sometimes the lines get incohesive or their movement skewed, but in general terms they're distinguishably well elaborated. With quirky hair and beautiful eyes, or scars and specifics, unusual clothes floating and majestic badass weapons. The art is so good it makes you wonder, did I rate it that high because I liked the art or the anime, and if I was to watch it in five years that \\n\r\nthe art would be outdated would I still like it that much..\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that it is intact however, applies. That it is distant, independent, self contained and accurate, you can not get close to it or relate with something in it as you do in almost all anime, it is a finished plate of food you have no choice but to eat, but it is up to you whether you will digest it or not. Furthermore, you feel like you can entrust yourself to the author because he is reliable, it doesn't feel like he's still working the story as it is unfolding but as if he cleared and mapped out everything and now he's simply presenting it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul is not like One Piece or Code Geass, that even if you don't like the genre you have to watch it. But if you don't mind giving a little strain to your brain cells in order to think while watching, if you can handle violence and realistic endings then do watch Tokyo Ghoul. For the reason that the last seven minutes that Kaneki walks towards uncertainty and death with a body in his arms and the dignity of an angel amidst disaster and snow, shouldering all the sins and sorrow of both humans and ghouls while the amazing first opening rhythmically echoes is a pretty impressive and worthwhile scene indeed.",

The ridiculous censoring for a series that has so much gore in it makes little sense. The first season sucked because they cut out a bunch of character development to squeeze around the first 60 chapters into 12 episodes. While I'm not gonna bitch about it being an alternate ending from the manga, it still sucks. If I hadn't read the manga before watching it, I would have no understanding of it whatsoever. There are random flashbacks all over the place, and there hasn't reallybeen any legitimate justification as to why Kaneki joined Aogiri. In fact, Kaneki really hasn't had that much time on screen at all. The pacing is just horrible.",

            "content": "If it's one thing that astonished me before writing this review, it's the sheer amount of disappointment that other people are projecting in their reviews of this follow-up to one of the biggest new shows in anime as of recent. 5's and 6's flutter about in the review section stating different strengths and weaknesses that this anime had and I can agree that some of them are true to an extent. However, for those who are turned off from watching something due to a really strong resentment of choices made for a show, allow me to highlight every reason why Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is ashow worth your time while still identifying some of its apparent weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nAs some of you might know, \u221aA takes a path that the manga did not take in its plot and allows for a different approach on what might have happened in an alternate universe. For some people, (*cough* manga readers *cough*) this might be a huge turn-off. While it's been identified on nearly every corner of the anime universe on the internet that the Tokyo Ghoul anime series is not entirely on equal ground with the manga, it still comes pretty damn close. The impact of the characters' relationships with each other and the different direction their lives are turning at this point in the series becomes incredibly gripping as the story marches on, leading to some incredible revelations and unexpected turns in the plot. I was left gripping whatever was closest to me tightly by the end of every episode lost in wonder as to what would happen next. This anime does not disappoint on the thrill scale, even if there are a few episodes where it's primarily character interaction. Sure, this can occasionally drag on a little long sometimes, but I remained captivated through every second. I didn't want to miss a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season builds itself up well with an incredibly promising first episode and great development in the story and action that follow afterwards. From my understanding, there was a lot of resentment toward the way it ended, but I didn't feel resentment toward it at all. If anything, it left me incredibly intrigued seeing that there are hints of a 3rd season and a cliffhanger as well. Who knows? Maybe people will appreciate \u221aA more if there's a good 3rd season to follow it up with.\\n\\n\r\nNow I was left feeling a little bitter towards the opinions people are sharing that say there was no character development in \u221aA. Yes, the show DOES focus on the other characters more than Kaneki himself while the first season focused primarily on Kaneki but still showed good character development for all the others in the series. However, Kaneki did have a bit of character development occur in \u221aA. I wish I could speak about it without spoilers being given, but the most I can say is you do see a change in Kaneki by the end and I'm sure it was more intentional to focus more on the change in atmosphere occurring throughout \u221aA rather than Kaneki himself. Amon and Touka share a LOT of character development this season alone, and we even see changes in Juuzo for crying out loud. It gives more time to connect with the side characters and learn more about what the plot has in store for the future. I personally found myself really connecting with Amon this season and found myself loving his character more and more as it continued. But I do have some gripes to pick with \u221aA, as nothing is without its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nHaters, I do agree that there was some really jumpy messy choices with how everything was pieced together this season, both in character development and plot. Some of the plot choices in episodes made no sense regarding their relation to the overall plot of the anime. While there were certainly many interesting ideas at large here, some of them never seemed to really quite fit well or go into enough detail that would provide a satisfactory cohesion with what the viewer understands is trying to be conveyed. While the first season of Tokyo Ghoul managed to compress the first 7 volumes of the manga into 12 episodes really well, \u221aA did not succeed at making full sense of itself within its own 12 episode span. There were things that needed more elaboration and detail, more explaining on the side of Kaneki, more attention and plot relevance. Instead, we are offered mere glances at it, as if we are on the sidelines each moment Kaneki is with Aogiri as opposed to being right there alongside him. It leaves quite a bit to be answered by the time the final episode is finished, including the changes in Kaneki's character. If you've seen the final episode of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, imagine something like that which is placed entirely around Kaneki during a scene that occurred in the last episode that had showcased pieces of Kaneki's experience but a lot of everyone else's experience during that same time. That's essentially what a season 3 would seem to have to be in order to give a lot of relevance to Kaneki's infamous decision to join Aogiri at the beginning of this season. That's also where the character development falls a little flat. Kaneki does undergo character development and that's evident by the end of the season, but we're left asking ourselves what exactly happened to cause him to undergo what he did and why it's so significant or why we should care. We were forced to feel it in the first season with how brilliantly it was executed then, but Kaneki is a different person this season and we don't entirely get to see how. There were also a few things left entirely unanswered or abandoned by the end of \u221aA with a couple introductions to new plot points and characters, so hopefully we'll see a season 3 to tie that up and make sense of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for those who seek action in their Tokyo Ghoul, \u221aA does not disappoint in the very least. While maybe not among the greatest action sequences in anime, it's certainly very far from the worst. The fight sequences executed excited me to the point of where my thoughts were entirely drowned by the action taking place in front of me with their incredibly riveting contributions to the story. There is certainly a lot more action that occurs in \u221aA when compared to its predecessor and I can honestly say nothing felt too forced. The art is fantastic as well, having slightly improved since the first season. Some scenes really brought the grittiness of Tokyo Ghoul to life in ways that hadn't been previously achieved this season which I was happy to find as I continued watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed \u221aA and will recommend it to those who enjoyed season 1 and are looking to continue watching. Should there have been more episodes? Yes. Were there some things that could have been done much better? I will not deny that in the least. Were there some plot choices that could be questionable? Most certainly. Was there too much wrong for the show's own good? Maybe not. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I love Tokyo Ghoul a lot and look forward with anticipation to what might come next after experiencing all of \u221aA. I am currently reading the manga (though quite slowly because I'm reading it in Japanese for both learning and entertainment) but am in the middle of volume 2, so maybe my opinion will change after I complete the half that \u221aA is different during. But for now, \u221aA gets a light to decent 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (Creative and gripping, but fairly messy and unexplained)\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (Some improvements since season 1, which already had great art)\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (The sound during the episodes was great and the opening grew on me after a while, though it pales in comparison to the incredible opening of season 1 in both song and animation)\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 (Some characters had very strong development and roles throughout the show while others needed more attention, including Kaneki)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (Maybe it's just because I really love Tokyo Ghoul, but I had a lot of excitement and fun watching it and would not mind watching it several more times in the least)\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "I've read many reviews below, and I feel like they compare a lot back to the manga. I have not read the manga but I plan to soon. I think this anime deserves a lot more credit than it is given. \r\nI agree with many that season one was a bit slow. Each episode felt like an hour instead of 20 minutes. The character build up took much longer than it should have. I found it quite difficult to sympathize with Kaneki Ken. He was this weak kid thrown into a new world and I was bored of constantly seeing him being pushed about. Inthe end came a big twist - this strong guy with a different aura (almost sexy not going to lie) and just like everyone else, we wanted to know what happened next. Enter - season 2. This season is full of action. I feel like Kaneki Ken doesn't speak much, we only really see him in battle. I like this though, it adds a bit of mystery, it makes you fall in love with his character even more and understand his struggle/change. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great story. I\u2019m assuming a lot of the low marked reviews are due to the adaption of the story from the manga, and I can\u2019t comment on that as I have not read the manga yet. My personal opinion is that the manga will always outshine the anime. You're not always going to agree with the way an anime is made. And, if you love the manga, you're always going to think it deserves more justice. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Character \u2013 8.5\\n\\n\r\nNot going to go into lots of detail on the story as majority of the reviews explain it well. The story, for me, is very captivating.  I\u2019m sitting on the edge of my seat trying to guess what the next twist could be. I\u2019m a huge Claymore fan and the half-monster, half-human aspect really shone to me. I can\u2019t help but love Kaneki, and I totally understand his struggle as a weak human to one of the strongest ghoul. I think that struggle has been portrayed well throughout the story. There are some episodes where I think they wasted time which could have been put to better use. In particular the last episode. I'll be completely honest, I was not satisfied with it. There was too much silences, too much switching to different scenes - just stick to one bit. It felt like everything was building up - and then the storm didn't come. It was way too calm. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of distinct characters. I don\u2019t think they are given enough air time for me to appreciate truly who they are. Devil Ape and Black dog are prime examples. I only became aware of their strength during battle in episode 9. Prior that, they were workers at the coffee shop who joked around and seemed ordinary. I personally don\u2019t like Tsukiyama. I get that his character is eccentric and a bit crazy. I don\u2019t like how he bursts out in random French and English \u2013 it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It really lets the anime down and gives it that amateur look. I don\u2019t like how investigators are thrown in to the episodes; Arima recently, Hachikawa and Moragn in episode 9. However, I get they are tight on air time and so they\u2019ve thrown these investigators in with enough information for you to process that they are the \u201ctop dogs\u201d. They are the head of a division and wear a different outfit, and have a weapon that is crazy. They are trying to help me digest the characters and I appreciate that. I wish there was more character development on Hide - especially as he is predominately in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are given more air time and I can really see their development. Kaneki \u2013 we see his transition from this hopeless, weak boy, torn between two worlds to this strong, yet psychologically depressed character, who finally accepts his fate. I love that his character is more quiet and gives off this cool, calm aura in this season. He doesn\u2019t speak often, he's seen weak and trembling in some scenes. We can see he is adjusting and still not use to his full power. I love that we get glimpses of him emotional and broken because it helps the audience connect with him. I think the portrayal of his character is amazing given the short amount of time. I would not have truly appreciated him had they not dragged out his weakness in season one. It was the best way to show me his development.\\n\\n\r\nTouka in season one was stronger than Kaneki. It was like she was saving him, keeping him alive and then the tables completely turn. He is now stronger, he leaves because he wants to save the people he loves, so now he's protecting her. I actually feel sorry for Touka a lot, i can see she's lonely, misses him and shes thrown herself into studying to distract herself. I'm sure there's lots of women out there who have behaved similarly during breakups, etc - so I like how it all felt personal. It touches you because you can relate (mainly because I am a woman). Touka was the emotionally, weak person this season in comparison to season one where she was strong and independent.\\n\\n\r\nJuuzou, although brief, we understand his character, why he behaves like that and how he joined CCG. We even get a brief intro on the twins. So, even though they have less time to play with, I think they really do try to help you understand the characters. Eto is done perfectly. I love her laugh and the way she is sitting there swinging her legs like a child. I love that scene after Kaneki explains he is joining Aogiri, where she disappears with the wind around him. I love Yoshimura telling his story \u2013 that episode \u2013 I completely zoned out. It was so gripping and then the intro music starts, and you snap out of it. This anime has great characters and the dialogue is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\r\nI think it\u2019s drawn well. In some fight scenes \u2013 I wish I could maybe see a little bit more detail. I want the attacks to be more sharp, the camera angles moved a bit more and just have it all build up nicely to give a proper action feel. To me, it seems there's a lot of long distant camera shots, lots of smoke or fog during fight scenes - it takes the excitement and craziness away from it all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s poor or average. The art is above average but with a little more work, it could be epic. \\n\\n\r\nSounds \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nI think the music is beyond amazing! Season one intro \u201cUnravel\u201d \u2013 my all time favourite anime theme song. It\u2019s soft, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s rock \u2013 I just love it. Ending song \u201cSeijatachi\u201d is equally awesome. Season one is darker, psychological, full of violence and this is reflected well through the music. Season 2 is softer and reminds me of someone who is lost, confused, trying to find their way \u2013 and again this is reflected throughout. The intro \u2013 \u201cMinou\u201d is a beautiful, soft melody. \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d \u2013 is someone trying to find their way. \"White Silence\" \u2013 sounds like accepting defeat. \"On My Way\" -  just reminds me of when Kaneki left to go on his path and he leaves everyone behind.\\n\\n\r\nI love every song, they all have a meaning that is specific to the progression of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. I haven't been obsessed and dedicated to an anime like this in a loooong time. It\u2019s dark, mysterious and psychological. The story is gripping, the script and the characters voices are spot on (I watch in Japanese with English subs for reference). I feel like I can emotionally connect with the characters. It all just feels very personal and that's why I love it so much. I agree, I was let down by the last episode, I was expecting A LOT more. But still, I loved the way everything was done. How it begins and ends with the same conversation in the coffee shop. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nI think it's an awesome anime. It unquestionably has not deterred me from reading the manga - it has in fact encouraged me to do so - and to do so quickly indeed. I love the psychological element to the anime and I think that is what makes the audience connect with the characters. The music is phenomenal. I personally love Kaneki dress sense and aura - he is so hot (totally fan girling him). I appreciate that this is a 12 episode season and so I guess I give consideration to that and try not too mark low. I haven't seen many animes but this is undoubtedly in my top ten. It's something that kept me on the edge of my seat, the 'one more episode' turns into 4 more. It's addictive. Loved it.",

            "content": "This season was such a huge disappoint. I would not recommend this anime to anyone. I kept waiting for it to get good, but that just did not happen. This season was like a prime rib...without any of the seasoning: fell way below my expectations. I am throughly sad I wasted my time on this piece of trash. \r\nStory: This plot was so flawed I'm not even sure where to start. I have not read the manga so this is me speaking from watching the series only perspective. After every episode I wanted an analysis for what happened. None of it made much sense. Themain plot was not even developed. It just kept skipping around to characters and as a whole was just not cohesive. I found myself constantly waiting for explanations or for it to all make sense, but the series severely failed at delivering. I realized halfway through that this plot was just full of holes and the anime tried way too hard on making emotional character connections.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This brings me to my second point of flaw in season 2. None of the characters were well developed. At scenes where it is supposed to be emotional and gut wrenching for the viewers, I found myself feeling \"meh\". Part of this is because the series is so short...but part of is due to bad planning. I was unable to understand any of the characters, much less connect. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: Sound and Art stayed consistent with season 1, so nothing to complain there. Although the opening theme was no where as great as season 1s.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: BORING. There were spurs of exciting moments but a lot of the \"gore\" was cut out. However the spurs of exciting moments made no sense again. The way that events occurred made it seem like the anime just needed to  throw in exciting moments so captivate the viewers. Yet, the exciting moments also fell short. Kaneki is supposed to be super awesome butt kicking machine but we probably got like 5 mins of action throughout the whole series. The season finale is supposed to be a good closer but 2 mins were wasted on a part that could have been shortened to 5 secs. I get the idea of building up drama, but it was so unnecessary consider 2mins/20 mins is 1/10 of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor planning is all I have to say. Events, characters.....everything was like a train wreck...as if 10 different writers came together and wrote a season and then it was collaged together. That is the best way to summarize season 2. An absolute mess. Please just stick to season 1 or read the anime. Season 2 will leave you craving for an anime that is incapable of delivering. Fingers crossed that in the future another director will take over and give the anime a needed reboot of way longer episodes.",

            "content": "Since this is my first time writing a review, i would keep this as simple as possible. Another reason i decided to write a review for this Tokyo Ghoul is because i felt the need to point out the problems in this season. Also, this whole review is written entirely in an anime viewers perspective only.\r\nStory:3\r\nIn the first season, the story pacing was quite well as we see new characters being introduced gradually and given enough screen time to actually give viewers the idea of their backstory. I was expecting somewhat the same thing for season 2 but i was wrong. More and more newcharacters were being introduced in a ridiculously short 12 episodes, heck even in the last episode. These characters' backstory are unknown, because they never get enough screen time except to appear in meetings and in the last few episodes to make it look epic. The story pacing failed so much it's so obvious they rushed it and ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good but i would say that the fighting scenes are actually a bit off and not as good as the first season. Other than that, nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound:2\\n\\n\r\nThe OP suck so hard i actually gave it 2 because i believe no OP should have the MC to stand in the center for one and a half minutes while waiting for the song to finish. The song itself... is not good. So much disappointment compared to its prequel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:3\\n\\n\r\nIn this second season, there is barely character development. As mentioned earlier, too many new characters are being thrown into this season and its only 12 episodes long. What development can you expect when the whole story pacing is so fucked up? The part that confuses me is that 10 minutes long walk kaneki did in the last episode... 10 minutes long with minimal dialogue and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season , you probably would finish the second. If you are planning to watch the second season, i wouldn't recommend it but if you like leaving a bad taste in your mouth, go ahead. Since so many said that tokyo ghoul was so popular, i was hyped for the second season but unfortunately it was better if this sequel was never created. Perhaps it might be Pierrot's bad adaptation. I would love to rate this higher but 3 is already too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:3 \\n\\n\r\nI can feel the anime has good potential ever since i watched the first season although i never read the original manga. But Season 2 is just completely garbage. What a waste...",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nIf you haven't seen either series yet then stop reading this review because am going to spoil everything.\r\nHave you ever had an anime adaptation that made you cry? Not in a good way where you were perfectly satisfied with the adaption but in a way where the anime competently threw your expectations out of the window in favour of having a shallow anime adaptation that not only removes all the charm of set manga but also competently destroys everything that made set manga awesome in the part. Well, you\u2019re not alone. As a person who is notmuch of a manga pursuit, I was gravely disappointed with the Negima/UQ Holder animes because while they were fun adaptations that I enjoyed, for the most part, they don\u2019t really up well as an adaptation as both series skipped a lot of important contents that made this series special to me. Every time I watch Negima and UQ Holder anime I always to tear mainly because these will never reach the heights of the manga. I don\u2019t hate them, but they kinda left with a bad taste in my mouth. What does this have to do with Tokyo Ghoul put to straightforward? Tokyo Ghoul is not only a terrible anime that cannot even hold up on it, but it\u2019s also a horrendous adaptation that completely everything that the manga has going for. I honestly cannot believe how freaking terribly this adaptation. Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows an average bookworm namedKen Kaneki, has desired an attractive woman. On their first date, said woman reveals herself to be a monster known as a \"ghoul\", a creature in human form that feeds on human flesh. Having taken the time to trap him, she prepares to eat him when a falling girder smashes her to bits and leaves Kaneki horribly injured. Saved through a transplant of organs from the dead girl woman, Kaneki is left with the inability to eat normal food and hunger that just won't go away. It doesn't take long before Kaneki realizes what's happened to him, and the broad implications of being a person who belongs to both the human and the ghoul world.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I tragically talk about the things that I hated about the story am going to quickly talk about the things that I liked about the story of Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul was how the show established the world in the beginning. We see that, despite people living normal life\u2019s they had to fear the presence of ghouls where at any moment in the night the people in Tokyo can potently become prey for the ghouls. On the other side, the ghouls would not only have to take people dead or alive to the ghouls feasting grounds but they also have to try not caught by the CCG who be trying to put down the ghouls. These two things along really like the world of Tokyo Ghoul alive. Two races trying living they peaceful lives in Tokyo but the confidence that happens inevitably seem to have these races clash with each other in a negative light. This aspect was the thing that drove me into the world of Tokyo Ghoul and while the manga did this far better the anime least the first season did a pretty solid job at establishing its world.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final thing that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul was episodes 1, 12, 22 and 23 because not only these episodes perfectly captured the tone of the series but they were the episodes that had the most effort throughout its 24 episode run. Not to mention there were actually enjoyable to watch unlike the rest of the episodes from this subpar series which I will get in a bit.\\n\r\nSo those are the two things that I liked about Tokyo Ghoul. Now let's get into the stuff that I didn't like/hated about the story and I have 5 big problems with Tokyo Ghoul that completely killed the series.\\n\\n\r\n1: Identity crisis.\\n\r\nOne of the first things that you will notice about Tokyo Ghoul it has an identity crisis. On one hand this show can a gritty psychology seinen that stays true to manga counterpart for the most while in the other it can be this out of place dark shounen series that has no business being their thanks to how the show was set up in the beginning. The dark shounen elements really start to over the show once you get to Root A where most of the psychology seinen elements of Tokyo Ghoul were either heavily watered down or non-existent.\\n\\n\r\n2: Pacing.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul in general moves at a very fast phase as the shows tires to mostly adapt a 144 chapter manga into 24 episodes, however, the only ended up suffering massive as the show despite being very fast paced it left a lot of plot elements that were important cut. This doesn't end there the show does a shitty job at keeping the viewer interested with the overall plot as the fast pacing completely ruins most of the interesting plot points and as a result of many of the plot points there were done in the manga are no longer interesting to follow. Case in point the Aogiri Tree stuff in the end of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets worse in Root A where not only the show completely goes anime original but many story arcs such as the\u00a0Raid On Kanous Lab and\u00a0Anteiku Cafe Invasion feel so rushed and disjointed to a point where character development and the main purpose for these arcs are thrown out the window in favour of showcasing boring shounen tier fights that have no place being in a senien.\\n\\n\r\nThree: Season 2 aka Root A has a whole.\\n\r\nRoot A, in general, was just a poorly directed mess that had no idea to focus plus the writing and pacing for that season were in an all-time low to a point where certain scenes and pieces of dialogue were left unfinished. Am not even joking. To add insult to injury Season aka Root A was filler despite the manga finishing Ummm I don't know\u00a04 MONTHS BEFORE THE FIRST EPISODE OF ROOT A STARTED AIRING. Like are you for real Studio Pierrot...\\n\\n\r\nFour: Episode 4 of Root A.\\n\r\nIf there was one freaking episode that represents everything wrong with this series it would be episode 4 of Root A. Not only it featured some of the worst animations that I have ever experienced in any anime but that episode narratively was disgusting to a point where every single character in that episode including humans behaved like animals where scream and grunt a lot without much as a thought. Truly one of the worst episodes I have ever experienced as an anime as it really shows how garbage the directing of Root A\u00a0was.\\n\\n\r\nFive: The final episode aka episode 12 of Root A.\\n\r\nThat episode alone was the final nail of the coffin of the series because not only the directing was unbelievably insulting for the viewer but that episode left a lot of unanswered questions and plotholes that were not explained from both season 1 and 2. To add insult to injury instead of seeing the Kaneki vs Arima fight that was hyped up since the beginning of season 2 the show decided to feature the now infamous Kaneki carrying Hide's body for 5 minutes and by the time where we got to the Kaneki vs Arima\u00a0fight, the show decided to cut off to the ending credits as well skipping the Kaneki vs Arima fight completely. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I have never seen a show simply self-destruct like that where the show literally gave up and decided to blow up itself splashing its ghoul blood all over our faces. Ghostbusters Tokyo Ghoul Root A you\u2019re now officially the most soulless anime adaption filler nonsense I have ever seen.\\n\r\nOverall the story of Tokyo Ghoul is tragically garbage.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot took one of the best modern mangas out there and decided to butcher it to oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters are not much better and that's the tragic part because the characters can be great but the directing, pacing and the way that they are handled leaves them at best underdeveloped and at worse an empty shell of the manga counterparts.\\n\r\nLet's start with Kankei who is by far the most mishandled protagonist I have seen in season 1 he was a pretty okay character where he was trying to adapt his best to adapt to ghoul life while trying to lose his humanity.\\n\r\nUnfortunately as the series progresses everything that was good/decent Kaneki took a dark path for the worst and when you get to Root A he devolves into empty husk where he barely appears in the show despite being his story. Not to mention his dialogue has reduced to scream and talking every now and then. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that his reasoning of joining the Aogiri Tree in episode 1 was retarded in the previous season they tried to kill him with Jason torturing him. What a mess of a character if I ever think of one.\\n\r\nNext is Touka where do I begin with this waste of space. She was a decent character in the first season the where she was a pretty good monitor for Kaneki where she teaches him to control his kagune. Also after he helps her avenge Ryouko, she starts to treat Kaneki in a more friendly manner. Unfortunately after Kaneki kidnapping incident as well him joining Aogiri Tree everything about her takes a turn for the worse and the second half of Root A she devolves into dismal in distress where she does nothing in the narrative other than to promote teenage angst as well running around in circles looking for her prince Kaneki. Am not kidding.\\n\r\nTOUKA SPENDS 3 EPISODES IN ROOT A RUNNING AROUND FOR KANEKI. What a disgrace.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Tokyo Ghoul seemed to appear and disappear on screen for the plot. They are not worth mentioning at all.\\n\r\nThe only good characters I liked in Tokyo Ghoul Amon and Juuzou as they are both decent and engaging characters that justify their ideals. Other than that the characters in Tokyo Ghoul are at best shallow and mishandled.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that the Tokyo Ghoul falls flat it would be the visuals. While at times the series at times can give pretty solid animation and great secretly many times the show just look below average at best that it filled with a lot of hiccups.\\n\r\nThe characters designs, for the most part, are nothing home to write about as they mostly feature generic and basic characters models that did an okay job at presenting. The only characters designs that were great were Juuzou and Kaneki when he goes white hair everyone else just feels bad by comparison especially when you compare them to the manga counterparts where they actually look great.\\n\r\nThe CGI that was used in Root A was abysmal that rivals Gantz CGI. Seriously what the hell was the character designer was thinking when making theses suit armour\u2026\\n\r\nThe background scenery least in the first season was pretty okay. The first and final episode of season 1 seemed to be the highlights for the series as these episodes use of the beautiful urban colour palette that perfectly captures the atmosphere and tone of the series. It\u2019s such a shame that the rest of the first season looks your boring slice of life shounen series. As for Root A background scenery\u2026 OH GOD. While the first season tried to decent background scenery Root A doesn\u2019t even try to adequate scenery as season shameless dumps in many greys, black oranges and browns all over it the show backgrounds making the show more depressing and dark than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the worst part about the visuals the animation.\\n\r\nWhile the first season mostly had decent animation that had some good fights every now and then it still feels like a low budget production throughout half of its run.\\n\r\nThe animation in Root A, on the other hand, ranges from subpar at best, and an abomination at worse. Minus the decently engaging Kaneki vs Amon fight in episode 11 Root A is generally a poorly animated mess that is filled with budget cuts and choppy movement.\\n\r\nThe worst case of this was in episode 4 where the animation literally shits itself as not only the fight choreography in that episode was piss poor but the visual directing and character was piss poor.\\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that I want to address about is the censorship and like with the animation in Root A it really bad. The show censorship favour is to cover the screen with the use of negative filters and blacks every time something slightly violent happens. When I watch this show on Netflix half of time I had to guess what was happening while the other half I had to literally read the manga to understand the full picture\\n\r\nIf the animate is going to animate a fight than let us the viewer watch the fight. Don\u2019t do these cringe-inducing censorships because that can easily annoy the viewer to a point where they will only end dropping set series.\\n\r\nI am aware that the series now has an uncensored version on DVD/Blu Ray from Funimation US and UK Anime Limited but am not going to go out there and by the Blu-Ray just to watch the uncensored version of the same that is from a subpar series such as shit. I eventually watch the uncensored version of Tokyo Ghoul by borrowing my friends Blu-Ray copy where I re-watch the whole series just so I take notes for this review that you\u2019re now currently reading. Also watching this show uncensored did not change my opinion of this show at all as I still think it a shit series regardless of which version that I watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\u00a0\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul is by far the best thing about this series.\\n\r\nThe music is filled with pretty atmospheric tracks that perfectly captures the urban dark tone of the series.\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul is pretty good by itself it's how it's show directed the soundtrack that makes it pretty annoying. Tokyo Ghoul Root A contains a lot of amazing emotional tracks such Glass in the Sky,\u00a0On My Own and Wanderers but the problem is Root A completely abused it interest songs to a point where they no longer have any meaning or purpose as the interest songs at times seem to play at random scenes in Root A\\n\r\nThe worst part about the show sound directing happens in the final episode where the show played an Unravel\u00a0Acoustic. The track by itself is meant to be a heartbreaking emotional piece that was meant to close the series in a sad way. However, for some unknown reason, the song suddenly stops playing while the\u00a0Kaneki walking scene is still going on in complete silent for another 3 minutes...\\n\r\nJust why!!!\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 opening theme unravel\" by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures the tone and atmosphere of the series. It's also extremely catchy.\\n\r\nRoot A's opening theme on the other hand sucks. While\u00a0Munou by \u00f6sterreich is a pretty good song on its own the problem with the opening is how it was directed as it featured terribly animated visuals that feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 ending theme\u00a0Seijatachi by People In The Box is a pretty decent ending that did an alright job at closing off an episode of the first season.\\n\r\nRoot A's ending theme\u00a0Kisetsu wa Tsugitsugi Shindeiku by Amazarashi is one of the best ending themes I ever heard in a long while as it filled with energy and passion that perfectly closes an episode of Root A.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is filled with pretty strong performances all across the board as each\u00a0Seiyuu did a great job bringing these characters to life into the anime. So there is that.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Tokyo Ghoul is very underwhelming. \\n\r\nDespite having very noticeable dub actors such as\u00a0Austin Tindle (Kankei),\u00a0Brina Palencia (Touka)\u00a0Todd Haberkorn (Ayato)\u00a0Christopher Sabat (Jason) and\u00a0John Michael Tatum (Tsukiyama) the overall acting feels so wooden, flat or downright forced at times.\\n\r\nStick with the sub for this for this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a perfect example of how to not do an anime adaption.\\n\r\nThe story is a poorly written and directed mess that doesn't do the source material justice.\\n\r\nThe characters are for the most part are butchered versions of the manga counterparts and visuals range from okay to absolutely horrendous.\\n\r\nThe only good things about Tokyo Ghoul is the music and a couple of decent characters that are in it that are in it everything else is at best awful.\\n\r\nIf you want to get into Tokyo Ghoul please for the love Sui Ishida heart read the manga.\\n\r\nStart from chapter 1, download the soundtrack for Tokyo Ghoul for background music then read it from there.\\n\r\nDon't waste your time with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.5/10",

I did not really absorb the first season as it was incredibly rushed except for a few episodes so it only deformed my expectations for the second season.\r\nBut boy, I was not disappointed.\r\nI have not read the manga and therefore, I entered this series completely blank and you may think of me as 'not a real fan of Tokyo Ghoul' for not reading the manga, but it definitely helped me enjoy the animeso I am not complaining.\\n\\n\r\nFACT: You CAN appreciate an anime without a religious standing with the manga. That is something I find in a lot of manga fans who are deluded into thinking that an anime would suck if it did not follow the manga.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA is one of the animes that prove this delusional thinking wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the storyline did not completely follow the actual manga, it still delivered the suspense and melancholy of the characters' situations and for me, it was not as rushed as the first season and took its time building on the story of the CCG investigators' lives as well as following Kaneki's brutal growth while in Aogiri. It makes me appreciate both the lives of the ghouls and the humans fighting against them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the ending finished everything perfectly... I won't spoil it but the image of life, death and the struggles of both ghouls and humans were beautifully depicted and it becomes one of my favourite scenes in anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for its art, sound and character, it is mostly consistent and plays along the psychotic melancholic nature of the anime. I have no additional comments other than how I am always captivated by the music of this anime; both this season and the prequel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion? To hell with all your gourmet expectations to anime based on the original manga. If an anime is executed well, it becomes amazing. If a manga is total trash, it is still trash. Don't be closed minded and you may be able to appreciate both anime and manga equally. \\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA receives a generous 9/10 from me~!",

I won't get into the thick of it but to summarize most people's complaints:\r\nCons\r\n1. Stupid bad animation for a show with this much fighting. \r\n2. Poor time management.  There was a lot of just nothing happening on the screen with just walking or something.  The problem with this is:\r\n3. About 50% of what happened in the manga was skipped, whether it was personal internal monologues, or simply arcs. Its almost as if they simply ripped pages out of a book.  My complaint is:If you're running short on time, don't fill it with nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n1. The ending song and most of the music was very good.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be extremely long if I went any further so I'll leave you just one bit of advice: Read the manga. It is worlds better.",

            "content": "While the first season of Tokyo Ghoul wasn\u2019t perfect, with underdeveloped villains, censoring, and leaving things about the setting unexplained, it still had entertaining elements and an ending that delivered some hard hitting truths. I had high hopes for what was to come, considering how much more interesting the main character and his conflict had become. You\u2019ll find that the second season doesn\u2019t deliver on the promises that were set up. Instead it leaves you disconnected from the main character, making him barely even appear on screen for most of the show. Instead we focus on the minor characters, something that I did appreciate, yetI wished it would have been secondary to the actual main character\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nSome positives would include the great animation and the diligent use of atmosphere, the direction definitely improved in terms of giving the show more personality and flavor. However, saying it has a great style doesn\u2019t equal having much substance. We are left with a finale that introduces completely new characters that we know nothing about, fighting each other with spectacle rather than with compelling motivations. This would have worked had this season been the build-up for a third season, but sadly it decided to blow its entire load in one go.\\n\\n\r\nI have left the most important part for last, which is the context that I watched the series in. This has technically nothing to do with the actual show, but it definitely affected how I viewed the story. For one I could not escape hearing how this season was supposed to go its own path, away from the manga. From what I understand the story just ended up being a condensed version of the manga with a few tweaks here and there, which means it is still not different enough to warrant being called an alternative story-line. This means it still cannot escape being compared to the manga. It seems to me that only manga-readers could actually fully enjoy this season, since it would show them several of the best parts of the story animated. For the rest of us though, it is just a mess of a commercial telling us to buy the manga. Because of this I will call this season out for what it is, a cash-grab, designed to be confusing and just barely enjoyable so that the audience will feel compelled to read the manga instead. So as a cautionary tale, if you haven\u2019t watched the series yet, skip it and read the source-material.",

Tokyo Ghoul season 1 was already a poor adaptation and they removed IMPORTANT content that they didn\u00b4t realise in the moment that was important. lol. so, tokyo ghoul season 2, was IMPOSSIBLE to perform after that season 1 adaptation, but they forced it just beucase the SALES, and they decided to make a 80-70% anime original (with ishida\u00b4s help) with just 20-30% manga content and it made this Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA.\r\nRootA, is trash from an anime-viewer-only perspective and worse than trash if you've read the manga. It is a mess of unexplained plot points that insult the complexity of the source material it was adapted from.\\n\\n\r\nIt only proves that Studio Pierrot is UNABLE to adapat high level series and Tokyo Ghoul is a good example of it, so they should focus more on shonen and simple stories and giving up trying to addapt decent stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI hope SOMEDAY, Tokyo Ghoul has an anime remake, because it\u00b4s an epic story and with an amazing tragic MC, that anime only watchers don\u00b4t even imagine about.\\n\\n\r\nFor anime only watchers, just read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nStory:2/10\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\nCharacter:3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10\\n\r\nOverall:5/10",

Kaneki Ken became more badass when his hair turns white and he has his mask in place. And now he has to fight evil.\r\nThe story at least explored about how ghouls were originated and this season they made Kaneki become more badass. However, does that excuse the rest of this season with problems, of course not. The story was boring. Although there were few sad moments, there are more boring moments than sad moments. \r\nThe final fight scene where Ken Kaneki fights Amon was so intense, however, theproblem is they just cut to another scene and Kaneki defeats Amon. I was looking forward to the fight scene between Kaneki & Amon, C'mon. The fight scenes are boring and rushed.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good and the fight scenes are tense just like the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are ok. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Ken Kaneki is the only badass in the show. The rest of the cast are more boring cardboard cutouts than in the last season. Like for example Touka Kirishima, she was a badass in the first season, however in this season, she became more useless. She rarely participate in the fight.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the way how this season handled Kaneki's character. As a ghoul, he also has to sacrifice what he has cherished and has to do what is right.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, there was an excellent build-up. However, in the second season, all that build-up was gone. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (4):\\n\\n\r\nI was extremely disappointed with the second season of Tokyo Ghoul. Maybe because I expected too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd season at least rectified some problems that I had with the 1st season. However, the 2nd season has more problems than compared to the 1st season. \\n\\n\r\nI have to give Tokyo Ghoul 2nd Season a 4/10.",

            "content": "After the end of season 1, many people were wondering about its sequel and how it would be executed especially because Ishida Sui, the mangaka, was involved on it since he decided to write the draft of the second season, and that looked like a sign of hope and possibly an improvement in the middle of a controversial first season with so many mixed opinions. \r\nI must say, even when there were announcements of an \"anime original route\" for Tokyo Ghoul, I was looking forward to it and I wanted to see what Ishida would bring to us, especially when it was revealed the nameof it: Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, also known as Tokyo Ghoul Root A, or you could interpret it as Route Aogiri (don't confuse it as Route Alternate or something similar). \\n\\n\r\nWhen it started and episode 1 showed Kaneki moving to Aogiri, I was actually fine with it and especially okay without the 103 bones/half-killing scenes that so many manga readers were disappointed. \\n\r\nThe first episode looked nice even though it felt a bit anticlimatic in certain moments like the end of Aogiri's arc, it had a promising start again though. There were some interesting ideas and Root A had a slower pacing to actually explain the story and important elements as the Owl along with the introduction of new characters, and it was expected to be shown more about Aogiri Tree, their members, Kaneki interacting with them, maybe even the story and the origin of the organization along with that anime original route (I mean, who would not expect that after Kaneki joining the organization?), however...\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul Root A does not deliver when it comes to the hype and potential, just like season 1 didn't do it too, but now it just got worse and sometimes even confusing, since there wasn't enough screen time to know what was going on through Kaneki's head, why he decided to move to Aogiri (it was eventually revealed later, but... moving to the bad side so Kaneki can \"get stronger and protect the people that he loves\", that's kinda understandable, although it does feel strange to see him deciding to go to Aogiri and then the story isn't even resolving around him, but the worst thing is that Kaneki moving to Aogiri DID NOT have any relevance neither impact in the end of the anime), and it reached to a point where it felt awkward or ridiculous to watch him almost not talking a single word or barely showing up on the anime's first half. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that, despite the Root A title, we did not find out more information about Aogiri and their characters, which is a big letdown. Another problem regarding the show is the whole deal about that \"anime original\": Studio Pierrot did not learn from their mistakes and they basically rushed through the story AGAIN, but guess what else they did? They were still adapting important scenes/events of the manga, however there wasn't development neither a nice and detailed setup like Ishida does in the manga, except for probably the last arc, which is actually an upgrade over the first half but it wasn't enough to cover up their mistakes and flaws from the whole anime, some moments (for an example, Kaneki fighting Shachi on episode 4, especially when he SAVED this guy from CCG's prison and yet no proper explanation on why they were fighting) made the story go all over the place and it started to be so confusing with the unexplained events and many plot holes after the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I mentioned the fights, I must also mention that the animation/art is so inconsistent, it can have some nice visually appealing scenery along with the important scenes too, but the characters were distorted during some moments, the movements were not really fluid and the animation had its sloppy moments too. Also, some fights were poorly animated and you could clearly notice which scenes had more investment and budget... well, if there was ever a lot of budget for Studio Pierrot though. And let's not forget Arima looking like a yaoi character along with his weird chin, it was impossible to take seriously every scene with him... once he showed up on episode 11. \\n\r\nI must mention another positive aspect when it came to the art: the ED sequences (each episode got a different one) with Ishida's drawings are amazing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was one of the few positive points about the anime. The opening (Munou by \u00f6sterreich) isn't as bad like many people say, also it does fit well into the series and what's going on or what is going to happen, but it does not compare to Unravel at all when it comes to quality and meaning. The ending (Kisetsu wa Tsugitsugi Shindeiku by Amazarashi) is pretty good though, and the ost got nice songs too (a great example is Glass Sky).\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest disappoiment on season 2 were the characters and their development throughout the story mainly Kaneki, who got butchered again in his development and his characterization even more since he got less screen time than last season neither had monologues or an idea/insight of what he was thinking or what was going on inside his own mind. The same should be said for some supporting characters, and how they portrayed Tsukiyama only as a maniac/psycho who is obsessed to eat Kaneki. I must admit that he was still funny and enjoyable to watch on his moments, but he is still another character heavily butchered by Pierrot. I mean, how are we supposed to care or feel something for him like on episode 9 in the rooftop scene when he had a conversation with Kaneki while asking him to not go into a big fight happening during that moment? In the manga, it felt impactful and sad due to his development, but in the anime it felt awkward or even funny... \\n\\n\r\nHowever, CCG and their members had some focus on the plot, and they did get a bit of development like Akira, Amon and Suzuya... actually, they were the characters who did receive more devopment on season 2, but thats not enough when the main character and the group that he joined don't even get enough time to be developed, and let's not forget that there were only 12 episodes, so even their development wasn't that great or amazing to watch. It's kind of ironic watching how CCG got some sweet screen time on Root A, it makes me wonder why the title is even this one.\\n\\n\r\nDid it have differences? Well, it did have like obviously Kaneki going to Aogiri, but the whole original concept felt like a poor excuse to make season 2 and STILL adapting some manga scenes while cutting out development and rushing through the source. What a \"brilliant\" decision to take the story made on 143 chapters and do a half-assed version of that with a few differences into 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tokyo Ghoul Root A was disappointing and it did not really fix the issues previously shown on the first season, and it makes many anime watchers who were reading the manga wonder why Pierrot decided to animate many manga scenes despite that promise of an anime original story. After all, read the manga and pray that there will be a remake someday.",

            "content": "Okay, so literally almost everyone on MAL already wrote a review for Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, but for some reason I wanted to write one as well. And a very short one as that, simply because of the fact that most things have already been said a lot of times.\r\nA friend of mine and I were talking about overrated anime, as Tokyo Ghoul came into discussion and she asked \"But don't you think the hype surrounding it is kind of justified?\" No, I don't think it is. At that point I have to say that said friend did only watch the anime adaptation, she did neverread the manga. Which already brings me to my main questions: Was it enough for an anime like Tokyo Ghoul to have two seasons with only 12 episodes each? No. Did they at least make good use of the limited screen time given? Not exactly. \\n\r\nCould a person who has only seen the anime walk out of this without any questions left unanswered? Not at all. Is it possible for anyone who read the manga to not detect possible plot holes, because they are small enough to forget about? Hardly so.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was a little bit more than disappointed. The people who produced both series made great use of the hype that already clung to Tokyo Ghoul, not to mention how EVERYONE was looking forward to the second season, that none of the producers broke out in a cold sweat: fatality at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nPeople really tend to fall in love with the main concept of a show, where i have to say that the underlying idea of a world where ghouls and humans coexist is rather neat. BUT you also have to take into account what they actually made out of it. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up with that, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is NOTHING but a great basic idea, any potential was simply wasted. If this really is one of your favorite anime, I assume you have never read the manga and you must be okay with all the flaws, maybe because you have not seen enough anime yet. If that's the case, I'd like for you to stop by in 6 months again, reading through the reviews of this show once more, maybe understanding why most of the ratings above literally scream \"mediocre\" right into my face.",

            "content": "(These are my impressions of the 9 episodes i've watched of this show, not a full review, pls take a note of that also there are gonna be some spoilers from S1, but it dosent matter cause this is shit anyway.)\r\nAre you fucking kidding me Studio Pierret? After seeing Yona of the Dawn from Fall and how well done it was, I thought this not might be a fuckup. Well the first episode was good, like seriously, it was really good. And with a new director on board, hell the author of the damn manga and being an anime original. I thought this show wasfinally gonna be respected, well my hopes were brought down after the first episode. What went from such a great beggining turned into a sloppy mess of a sequel, its somehow worse than Season 1, Season 1 was shit whereas this is shit and piss. How do you top off what was a mess of the first season? Lets find out shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSo the story left off S1's cliffhanger ending, after Kaneki goes coocoo mode and is now 'Badass Kaneki\" he decides to join the enemy and take revenge on the people who tortured him. Sounds like a story of sorrow and revenge. From the sounds of it how is this gonna be bad? This sounds like a great plot! Well no, from there on, the story evolves around so many new and old characters that you feel like your watching Durarara on LCD. You're wondering whats going on, Its not even doing what shows with big casts do best, it connects. Here it dosen't connect, one second we're looking at the goverment and their plans, the other we see these new characters, the other we see these old characters thats do stuff. Like compared to the first season, what the fuck is going on?\\n\\n\r\nThe art here at first, there was no censoring.....yes you heard me.....no.....cen- wait, on Ep. 5 they brought it back, and its as terrible as ever.............FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- well other than that, the animation is as average as the first season with beautiful backgrounds as usual, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe music here is pretty good, I found myself in love with the OP, it shows how dark and tragic Kaneki,'s past is, only problem about it is that the animation is choppy. The ED is really damn good, a improvement over the previous ending, its catchy and enjoyable. The background music is OK for the most part, and the acting is goddamn well done, Kaneki's voice shines like it has before as well as the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, good grief, what have they done? Not gonna say much on this, first off we have the 'MC' which is Kaneki, well last season the show didn't focus on him, but here, he hardly gets any screentime and is hardly even focused, how do you take a problem and make it worser? The other characters, Touka has went from a meh character to a somehow weak bitch. The other characters arent worth mentioning except for two. Amon and Akira, these two actual have some developement and feel like the real MCs, these 2 feel like a real duo and get the job done. Other than that, the under-devolpment returns and is much worser, hell there isn't even any this time around.\\n\\n\r\nNow the enjoyment, the only actual episodes I enjoyed were Ep 5 & 6, these 2 eps actually were enjoyable, they were engaging and fun. Other than that, the show will bore you with dialouge that half of the time dosen't matter and boring ass characters. There are a couple of innuendos here and there that are worth a chuckle but thats really it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 4.7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 1.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2.5\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThis show was a damn dissapointment, the fact I was actually kind of hyped for this makes me feel bad, SP, you had a chance to show us what you can do but fell off your ass, gave up and gave us this atrocity. If you want something which is much better, Parasyte, which is nearly done airing is TG done right. Overall, leave this and the the first season like they're the plague.",

            "content": "English is not my native language so please excuse my grammatical errors.\r\nWhen I realized than Sui Ishida wrote part of the story as an alternate route to show us the story he couldn't put in the manga where Kaneki goes with Aogiri I had hopes than this season could be great. But sadly, Pierrot decided to make some \"changes\" to the story of Sui Ishida and in the end we only had a bastardized version of Pierrot.\r\nStory: 3\r\nLet's start with the most important thing: The story promised, with the participation of self Sui Ishida the first episodes could see some improvement as we saw thelast season. But as always we had the bad way by Pierrot who took things his way altering things like [insert here] wished, and finally we had a story more than loose ends left us even more holes in the plot. The arcs ends abruptly and immediately they jump to another place without telling us when did it begin the new arc. It's like Pierrot had said \"Sui Ishida just give us a great idea, but we'll read his story shortly after starting it because after all when we start reading know where it leads and then we well do the rest with a few changes to his idea\". Changes that eventually became the greatest of all the problems in this season leaving plot holes everywhere:\\n\\n\r\n-Kaneki left Aogiri after some time, but why? That's not explained.\\n\\n\r\n-What happened to Matasaka Kamishiro after the attack of Aogiri to the Ghoul Detention Center? That's not explained.\\n\\n\r\n-What's about Irimi and Koma after the Anteiku Raid? That's not explained. If you want to know what happened to them read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anteiku's Raid Arc was one of the most important arcs in the story and Pierrot ruined each of the aspects about it. The entire arc was used by Pierrot as an excuse to throw us various fights with weird movements and you don't even know who is fighting against who. In the manga, this arc shows up more dialogues and story than fights. Kaneki's encounter with Hide and the mind corruption because of his kagune was one of the key factors that triggered his final transformation which led him to his final destination to meet Arima. Pierrot destroyed each of this factors and \"softened\" them becoming this part of the arc incoherent with the manga story. I think I need not say that the meeting between Kaneki and Arima was part of that, right?.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nThe poorest part of this season were the characters. Almost all of them were overshadowed. Kaneki who last season had developed and evolved, here he don't showed no change at all. It seemed that he makes things just because and didn't have any specific target to meet. Well, let us suppose Sui Ishida had really planned to fulfill objectives had Kaneki, but we know that Pierrot always do things their way, and they put aside that part of the plot. Touka was the only character saved from being overshadowed, she showed up more emotions, frustrations and changes in her personality, this can be because she had enough time on screen. However, characters like Tsukiyama, Uta, Renji, Hinami, etc. appears just thrice in this season and almost all of them with three or four dialogues that last after a few seconds. The backstory of them was explained in the manga, here their past is completely unknown.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nLeaving aside the already often mentioned Opening and Ending Theme discussions, I will talk about the background music and from what I see here is noticeable that almost nobody has talked about anything other than the Opening and Ending theme. The background music is simply amazing, it has hints of suspense in certain scenes and other orchestral touches that will amaze you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe colorization and backgrounds are well made, the atmosphere of each of them is perfect. But one thing that annoyed me is that censorship is still present, although he no longer was well as in the first season, on the few occasions I saw censorship was most annoying than ever: The censorship when the Yasuhisa sisters are stabbed with the knifes of Suzuya it's the most ridiculous censorship I've seen through the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nPersonally, I expected a good alternate history and more with Ishida writing it, but you can never expect anything good from Pierrot because they always want to do everything his way. In the end we only had a plot full of holes and a story that is unrelated to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nI don't recommend to the TG fans to watch this. If well the first episodes are some good, later the story turns drastically into a different thing making it impossible to take it seriously.",

            "content": "No it doesn't get better. You might of thought that despite the first season being pretty medicore, there was some promising ideas and themes there to build on, and the character development was starting to show up. You might think that Root A has the opportunity to take the good ideas of the badly exectued  season 1 and make a actually really good and interesting show. After all, the world and themes Season 1 promised under the hood seemed pretty decent, right?. You may have watched this because you saw re: coming out. You may have kept watching, thinking the garbled mess of thefirst few episodes would improve. It does, certainly, but it just feels like the story was written by one talentless 16-year-old after episodes 6 or so, instead of a dozen 16-year-olds getting drunk whilst their parents aren't home as it does for the first half of the season. \\n\\n\r\nYou (or me, as you have realised), were duped. Root A didn't take the promising world and characters that Season1 failed to competently expouse upon and make a good anime, instead it delivered this.... whatever this is. I confess, I actually made it through this show pretty quickly, only a few sittings. Mainly because I really just had to watch the next episode to find out what the fuck was going on all the time. Oh, and because I was sure that the fever dream would end and everything would come together and we'd have the greatest anime of all time. It was just that confunding to watch that I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out how this anime was actually secretly the best anime of all time; sometimes something is both so repugnant that it becomes morbidly facinating to watch, just to see what will happen. Its like watching someone getting murdered in front of your eyes and watching on it rapt horror, just to see what will happen. Thats how it feels to watch Tokyo Ghoul Root A. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAfter finishing the first season and to confirm this, I said \"I'll see it, nothing could be worse than the first season,\" how wrong I was...\r\nI will like to say that Ishida was right to want to change the path of the series, but no. I admit that at first the story was based on something interesting \u00bfKaneki going to Aogiri? \u00bfWhat he plans? \u00bfWhat will happen? things like that, but while the chapters passed, I saw something move from the \"interesting\" to \"ok\", to \"WTF?!!\" and finally to the \"appalling\". Appalling, yes, thus I would describe Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA \r\nLet's startwith the story: Kaneki goes to Aogiri ... And that's all! Apart from that fact, it was not anything else. \u00bfThen what was the rest of the anime? the rest was a lot of situations, mostly random, where they put a lot of characters for no reason and for do fanservice with fights and pseudo-gore. Throughout we see Kaneki doing \"missions\" to Aogiri whose fundaments never said, \u00a1it's not even explained why Kaneki left Anteiku! they mentioned it as sometthing personal, but never with any solid purpose. Then the \"history\" becomes something like a gang fight, with those of Anteiku by their side, the CCG and a lot of strange people who did not even bother to present ... The end was the crown. It could be said well, actually the second season had no solid plot, which is the same as not having.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point is the characters. As I said, most were pure characters who got into any random situation and then not seeing them again \u00bfWhat was the point of that? \u00bfFanservice? \u00bfTo create \"mystery\" situations?. There were also other characters who, although they appeared more often, did not have enough space for a good development, such as Amon and Akira. Kaneki... well, compared to the first Season he got better a little, only because he is now more badass with his skills and is no longer another Shinji Ikari (although at times it was coming out that way again), Touka did NOTHING throughout the series, those of Anteiku only served for Meat Cannon and many of the GCC to make them \"heroes\" and then lament their deaths... Finally for discard my favorite character (aside from Amon and Akira) was the cute Hinami. Even she looks to have grown and matured from the first season, it can be said that their development is worth all the rest...\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst was that in the end, the series did not fix the problems coming from its first season. Plot holes, things unexplained \u00bfWhy the Ghouls can only drink coffee? \u00bfWhat was the origin of the different districts and because they fight? etc. The animation also played a great trick this time. But surely the best was the sound, there were emotional tracks and very consistent at the scene, even made poor action scenes look better...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA came from a poor first season, with this new original season, it had many opportunities to get better, but it did not at all. History -even more- inconsistent, and an incredible amount of characters for anything interesting and memorable. I repeat, if I had to describe this anime with one word, it would be \"Appalling\".",

            "content": "Oh boy, where should i begin whit this one.\r\nIt has become a known fact that there is always that one anime that marks the year, in 2012 we had Sword Art Online, in 2013 we had SNK and now in 2014-2015 we have Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nSo if you are reading this review, it is very more likely that you have already finished the first season so i don't really need to talk about TG story here, however if you didn't leave now, because obviously there is going to be some spoilers for the first season.\r\nSo after i finished season 1 of TG i was actually well,preety excited for season 2, even though the first season didn't follow the manga very well and the pacing was horrible, the last episode really got me excited whit the amazing final battle between Jason and Kaneki, one of the things that got me excited was the fact that they decided they would go for a completely diferent route from the Manga, i personally liked this ideia, could it be that the people at Studio Pierrot realized that it was time for them to get their head's working on something new and fresh that WOULD ACTUALLY WORK this time? It turns out that no, they didn\u00b4t and its even worse than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nSo the first episode begins whit alot of promissing stuff, good animation, fast paced fight's and Kaneki joining the evil side, yes he does join the evil side, but why? Well we never do get this explained, and that's what is wrong whit the plot in this season, there is SO MUCH stuff going on that isn't explained, and dont even mention the false hype they create at the end of every episode, like the Centipede.....Which didn't work out very well...But seriously i feel so...Uncomfortable whit this plot...Events are all over the place, some character's and plot points get completelly forgotten and thrown away, the way they make thing's try to look complicated and mysterious, it's just a completelly disconected mess, whit alot of wasted potential, it is a gold mine that they are just NOT using well, unlike the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nSo the first 2 episode's showed some really amazing art,it was GORGEOUS, everything was working so well, every character looked so good and uh.....Then comes episode 4.....The episode that stopped me from continuing and expecting something out of this season, i didn't felt ANY excitement on this episode, the animation was horrible, the fight scene's were slow and the character's just looked weird, everybody technically spended the whole episode in complete silence,just saying some useless stuff and well, building more hype to nothing whit an episode ending that just made me go *NOPE*\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe only good aspect in here, the opening and ending's are still awesome and the soundtrack is still beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nThis is where Tokyo Ghoul fails dreadfully, 12 episode's won't do it whit all this foreshadowing they give to every character and its *Mysterious dialogue*, but if they run out of creativity they can always give the *Kill4Fun* motive, which is preety much what happens here seriously, i CANNOT find myself liking any of these character or villains, because of their shitty reasons that can't go behond a Kill4Fun or Yandere motive's, the show now spends more screen time whit the CCG, WHICH IS THE MOST BORING ORGANIZATION IN ANY ANIME, and the way they try to make them look like they are talking about complicated stuff by using formal words is hillarious, i would like to see Kanek's inside struggles and how he is feeling towards the situation he is in, not fighting law suits living their everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nDo not watch tokyo ghoul Root A, if you did indeed finish the first season, keep reading the manga, it is alot more rewarding, if you are looking for some good anime in this season watch something Like Ansatsu Kyoushitsu",

            "content": "As a manga reader (knowing this, I might be harsh on some aspect), I was very impressed at the season one of Tokyo Ghoul and I felt that they have done a good job in only 12 episodes introducing the world of Tokyo Ghoul. What I don't understand is how could they not do the same for the second season? \r\nStory (2)/Characters(4):\r\nWhat you have to understand is that this season 'supposedly' does not follow the manga and has taken a different route then the manga, hence the \u221a meaning route. Ishida Sui, the creator of Tokyo Ghoul, has work along with this season of animeand has made an original draft to be followed.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, unlike the first season of the anime, the second season has a lot more characters to be unraveled (hehehe) and a more complicated story. Unfortunately with only 12 episodes is impossible. And the making of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aa was very short when you think about it. Tokyo Ghoul season ended and then boom, a few months later second season came on by and also not with the budget it deserve most likely too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of all this, the drafts that were supposedly new and takes focus on a certain group in the anime, did not take place and disappointing the fans who knows about this. \\n\\n\r\nNot only it didn't follow the drafts (and I've read some so I know it was going to be good) it also didn't even make sense. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Kaneki Ken, did something that was supposed to be big but hardly makes an appearance (this is what I was talking about before, it did not focus on Kaneki and a certain group). We could understood the reasons but we didn't really understood what he was really trying to do, making Kaneki this character that \"we just do not understand on what the heck is he really doing in this anime, is he even the main character anymore?\". God do not even talk to me about Touka or the horrible horrible anime Tsukiyama. They just butchered this characters' personality and motives making them just like Kaneki and making us feel \"What the fudge are you guys even doing in this anime, you have no reason to be here\". \\n\\n\r\nUnless you only like the CCG and Hide, then it's alright. BUT everything else was shit.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (5):\\n\\n\r\nBad. Horrible. What. Could be better. Could be so much better. Did not give its best in the horror and gore of the manga has (yes it has censoring and all but still, STILL)\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said the making of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aa seems really short and probably was not given the budget is deserves. Yup, it really shows in this anime. Especially since it was also an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only this that was really worthy to look at was the first and last episode. The opening and the ending cards that were different each episodes that was drawn by the wonderful Ishida Sui.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9):\\n\\n\r\nWonderful. Majestic. Orgasm to my ear.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is probably the best thing that ever come out of this anime. It's very ear catching, forcing you to notice it and settles in with the mood in the anime, or more like emphasizing the mood and the feelings in the anime. Deserves a better well written, well drawn and animated Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was also wonderful as ever and makes the what is already tragic and sad even tragicer and sadder. Is that even possible\\n\\n\r\nOverall(4):\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? There are two answer.\\n\\n\r\nFor the manga reader: NO. Nu-uh. Don't torture yourself. Please no. The only thing worthy was the last episode for a certain scene and the music and the op/ed. That's it. Nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nFor the anime fan: Also a big NO. I implore you to just read the manga because the different route thing did not matter. Still, I understand the love of just watching anime because of the voice acting and all that wonderful things that only comes from anime. I can't stop you from watching it if you still want to. But still. Manga Tokyo Ghoul is worth the read.",

It must be great to see how his life unfolds.\r\nI'm sorry we just want money this series not to tell a story, is for create money based on the large amount of fan who has.\r\nWell let's start this analysis, NOT contains spoilers quiet ;)\r\nThis review is written thanks to the translator of Google (again), I'm sorry if it has grammatical errors.\r\n-History: This is a series of 12 chapters that everything could have been perfectly developed in a maximum of 4, the story is painful, nothing new and is entirely predictable that wrote almost believed that a childof six years, it limits itself to express only banal for what the main story (Kaneki and development as half human and half ghoul), events present us a new character that does not affect absolutely nothing in history as such, is only there to let us know that there is ( and to create 2 chapters are only because of the more chapters = more money).\\n\r\n... It costs me to focus because it is very bad, sorry, we continue.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point is that everything is very artificial and falls into the mistake of putting many cliches when battles (which incidentally is a shame when the animation, but more on that later) show the feelings that the characters they are linear and are more palpable not develop this season but it came from the first season, and this makes it only good thing about this series, when you see the time goes fast because it is like watching a powerpoint. 1/10\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: garbage everyone, I understand that I should write because I find are all garbage, ah ... damn\\n\\n\r\nKaneki: the cool guy but really knows nothing and suddenly it's the best fighter of the ghouls\\n\\n\r\nTouka: the typical tough girl in the end is the softer\\n\\n\r\nI give up, all are stereotypes already seen, this does not lead to anything. 1/10\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: for lovers of the openings i do not know if they are to find good this, I personally do not look at that, but if the OST and in this anime is almost nil 0/10.\\n\r\nsound effects saved this section 7/10.\\n\r\nI can not say more about it because I do not care so much. 6/10\\n\\n\r\n-Art: Throughout the series is mediocre and you take the time to draw well only cups and a briefcase, but BOOM! In the last episode the drawing more detailed changes to make us believe that the series was so all the time, that's how it makes friends\\n\r\n*clap* *clap* 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note 2/10 \\n\r\nBrief review: Fanaticism makes money let's do this!\\n\r\ni recommend? \\n\r\nNO, why?\\n\r\nthat's not the right question, the exact is why not?",

            "content": "You think you can come back looking like some brooding, tragic hero?\" - Touka\r\nPreface:\r\nLet me start off by saying that this is not a manga review.  There's a place for those, and it's the section above the reviews, next to where it's highlighted \"Anime Reviews\". It's a wholly reductive comparison to make of Tokyo Ghoul to expect the anime to be identical to the source. While a very close to 1:1 adaptation is possible, the majority of titles, particularly ones adapted from non-illustrated sources are created with a great amount of artistic licensHae. While this in no way excuses the immense drop in qualityof Tokyo Ghoul SqrtA, it is one explanation. \\n\r\nSuffice to say: if all 870 pages of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix were adapted into a film, it would be 8 hours long, prohibitively expensive, and INCREDIBLY BORING!\\n\\n\r\nI rate Tokyo Ghoul SqrtA a 4 because it's half the show that Tokyo Ghoul season one was. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 5\\n\\n\r\nPierrot definitely had to cut some corners to finish this season out, and it shows. A lot of stillframe with pans, and some really, really horrible character models. I make point of when Tsukiyama attacks Ken on top of the building- it's literally an outline of Tsukiyama with no detail, and his kagune looks like a straight, detail-less stick with a curve at the top. While some of the more major fights look good, on the whole, the animation is average to below average, with the exception of the last two episodes, which I'd give an 8/10 to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nSame players as before, except this time Ken has maybe 40 lines in the entire season. Mamoru Miyama (Light, Death Note)  is glorious as Tsukiyama, and Rie Kugimiya (Alphonse, FMAB) is fantastic as Juzo. The OP I found kind of annoying, but the ED was a good mood setter for the ending. Overall decent sounding and with a veteran voice cast, can't go wrong here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the pain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be very blunt here. Root A has no main character. Is it Amon? Is it Ken? Is it Touka? (I don't really see watching her running around being emo and crying all the time like a 15 year old Hot Topic mall scenester as much characterization.) Root A is really just a mess on the character front. Characters crop up with none to negative explanation as to who they are, why they're there, or why the hell I should care about whether they live or die. Late in the season, during the \"Super ultra mega monster hyper epic battle\" between the CCG and the ghouls, there are 6 or 7 different NAMED special investigator characters who appear for the first time on screen in episodes 10, 11, and 12. A few of them spout cliche lines like \"Let's finish what we started 10 years ago.\" or \"Now, I can finally get my vengeance!\" \\n\\n\r\nWait, stop. WHAT? This is literally your first scene in the entire show, and two episodes before the end. I don't know who you are, and I've been given no reason to care, please die. \\n\\n\r\nRoot A is dotted with moments like this. A sudden influx of new, named, voiced characters that supposedly have backstories that are apparently meaningful to the conflict at hand, yet none of this is ever explained to the viewer in any detail. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters like Naki, Kamishiro, Hoji, the \"Devil Ape\" and \"Black Dog\" suddenly gain an inflated and undeserved sense of relevance in Root A... As the viewer, I'm never told why they're important, other than THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO THE STORY BECAUSE THAT'S THIS WEEK'S EPISODE! (Cough, prison break.) \\n\\n\r\nThe cast from the original is mostly intact, though with some serious characterization potential lost. The dynamic between Ken and Touka, and heck, even between Ken and himself is long gone, and in its place is a bunch of teen angst. Root A does have some plusses in that the sick and twisted character list grows, with Juzo and Tsukiyama at the top of the list. Juzo, despite having a literal 25 second montage of backstory, does experience some characterization and only grew more awesome as the series went on. \\n\r\nAkira Mado and Eto were also welcome additions to the cast, where they brought in some edge, but didn't make me cringe. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: characters go in circles and waste potential like my El Camino 572 wastes gas and tires. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I really don't understand where Root A went wrong. The Tokyo Ghoul manga had finished by the time of the original's airing, so this is not an 'anime original' ending. While a great amount of artistic licensing was taken with compressing 144 chapters into 24 episodes, the end result is the same. \\n\r\nWhat my problem is, is that the source material was laid out in front of Pierrot and they failed to cover the appropriate information and characterization, while leaving in a bunch of, frankly, unnecessary plot wheel-spinning and side characters with little bearing on the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the first season is a fairly intense intrapersonal journey for Ken and his struggle to reconcile his inner turmoil of being both ghoul and human, Root A is a failed attempt at an inTERpersonal conflict between the ghouls of Antique, Aogiri, and the human officers of the CCG. While this nonlinear, multipart narrative has been used successfully in superior shows such as Fate Zero, (even Code Geass,) Pierrot demonstrates a substantive lack of attention to detail and even negligence in creating a cohesive, compelling adaptation. Disjointed plot threads crop up like weeds, but feel more like hangnails.\\n\r\nEntire plot sections dead end, and are just written off- never explained later, or happen for no apparent reason. The beginning of the season is like a series of cliche action movie setpieces that happen for no explained reason... We can *assume* the prison break happens because Aogiri is attempting to raise their numbers. Are we told? NO! Half of them end up being killed by Aogiri members themselves anyway! \\n\\n\r\nThere are some moments with Akira and Amon, and also Juzo that were interesting from a sub plot perspective, but as a whole they go nowhere and add nothing meaningful to the story. A shame, because they're probably the best three characters in the show at this point. \\n\\n\r\nIs it bad that I really just wanted everyone to die about halfway through? \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I've bashed on Root A, there were quite a few things I enjoyed. Top of the list is Juzo, the sick little urchin that he is. I love the sick and twisted characters that really just don't give a crap whether they, nor anyone else around them live or die. While everyone is writing their death haikus before the big battle, Juzo takes his and makes a paper airplane. It's not enough to stab a girl in the eye, she's getting skewered 44 more times with throwing knives. Scythe to the head? Cool. Juzo is beyond messed up, and is absolutely unapologetic, and I love it. \\n\\n\r\nAkira Mado was also a nice surprise- a character with a believable background who isn't a totally plot armored Mary Sue, yet remains relevant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMisc bitchin': \\n\\n\r\nPlot convenience. CCG gas that incapacitates Kagune, and therefore the ghoul's weapons? Nah, we don't need that anymore, because it was too effective. \\n\\n\r\nAnime Biology\u2122: Have you been blown up, skewered, shot, stabbed, had limbs cut off, fallen off 50+ floor skyscrapers, had organ liquefying impacts and accelerations from punches and kicks, impaled, or otherwise had fatal blunt force trauma inflicted upon you?\\n\r\n-~-NEVER FEAR, Anime Biology\u2122 is here!-~-\\n\\n\r\nI know this is anime, but come on. The ghouls are explained to have regenerative powers... but to what extent? Some of them take days to recover from their wounds, and sometimes they are completely unaffected, wholly at the convenience of the plot at the time. If kagune are the only things that can hurt them, why is it that they're shown to be mowed down by the hundreds with MP5s? Why do ghouls not also use firearms themselves? Why limit yourself to close range when the majority of CCG officers only have melee based kagune?? \\n\\n\r\nGhoul powers are played with faster and looser than Geass, holy crap. \\n\r\nWhy do ghouls manifest only certain types of kagune? How do they have mutating ones? Does it even matter?? \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4 (Want to give it a 3, because 3 is the closest square root of what I think Tokyo Ghoul season one should be scored, but math tells me I can't do that.)\\n\\n\r\nPeople hold up examples of bad adaptations like Elfen Lied and Fate Stay Night by Deen as being the \"classic case\", but let's be honest here. It's different when an adaptation takes the tennis ball, runs to the closest football field and bats it out of the atmosphere, but Tokyo Ghoul Root A is going down as probably one of the roughest adaptations that even attempted to remain faithful to the original.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Can't spell slaughter without laughter.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Addition of some new, and improved characters\\n\\n\r\n- Annoying (main and side) characters who serve no purpose\\n\r\n- Main characters' raison d'etre destroyed and become pointless\\n\r\n- Subplots that go nowhere\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul :Re is being written as I type, and hopefully with its adaptation (and also a new production studio) it will correct the bad name that Tokyo Ghoul has after a great showing in its first season. It's not as though we can pretend Root A never happened. As the great Mr. Plinkett said: \"The unfortunate reality is that (Tokyo Ghoul Root A) will be around...forever. It will never go away. It can never be undone.\" \\n\\n\r\nIf Ergo Proxy is a refined piece of expensive steak, Tokyo Ghoul is junk food. Root A is moldy, stale bread.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul root A review\r\nIt\u2019s again the same  story with ghouls  drinking coffee and 1000-7 riddle but worse.\r\nStory 0/10 \r\nSomething that is inherent in all people is the need to protect the things you love. Doing whatever it takes to keep the stuff around you safe. Either by fighting or sacrificing, as long as what truly matters to you is unharmed, the rest doesn't matter. It might be family, friends, or your dearest of objects; it's not so much what it is but the act of protecting it that matters. Sounds good but Tokyo ghoul root is a failure to accomplish that witha garbage conclusion and no helpfull message for the viewer.\\n\r\nThis is what Tokyo Ghoul tries to express but fails miserably because of the concept and story who is poor executed and the characters  who have weak development and their interaction is a mess.Again it\u2019s a war between good(humans) and evil(ghouls) but here the victimization of the evil is present in every episode.The story in the anime is presented from both side perspective the ghouls and the humans. \\n\r\nThis concept was amazing and original until the anime turned into a battle shounen instead of character development and interaction. Going back to season 1 after Kaneki was tortured and became strong after that season two doesn\u2019t focus on him at all. \\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of Aogiri that is not presented at all , all we see is useless killing and fights like in a shounen anime for people who like badass characters and a op main character with plot armor and plot tools(Kirito from Sao for example).\\n\r\nKaneki\u2019s effort all along the season goes to vain because he fails to protect the people at Anteiku , and then he gives up.  What was the purpose for trying so hard if he gives up. What piece of shit story and conclusion.\\n\r\nThat riddle 1000-7 and jokes were retarded as the concept and story that Tokyo ghoul aborded.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\r\nKaneki has a good character development in season 1 but in season 2 the story doesn\u2019t focus on him at all and he is cast away so we forget about him. He is introduced in the last episode where the cringe festival starts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTouka again a good character who season 2 ruins her and she is only presented as a girl who serves coffee and drinks it and nothing more. She is desperate for Kaneki like a maiden who never had sex and this thing it\u2019s turning season 2 into a cringe festival.What\u2019s worse is the fact that she let\u2019s Kaneki go after she had the chance to be with him and bring him back to Anteiku. What a contradiction of character and weak mind. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Doves ghouls characters are fck new and the anime doesn\u2019t give us no information about them.Their just side characters there to die for justice and the prospering of good in the human society.What a fck joke.I even forget their names that much of a impact they had on this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nShuu this is a fck joke and a psychopath  who is turned on by kaneki blood. That is his all purpose in season 2 and to say that retarded French word over 100 times in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYoshimura this character drinked coffe all season 1 and half of season 2 and told stories to  his employs at Anteiku and life philosophy like I even care about that. This is the only character I liked in season 2 because of his past story and final fight in the last episodes.They should have focused more on him than other characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther characters like the twin sister ghouls are not even worth mentioning ,because we don\u2019t know nothing about them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArima this character  is pooped up out of nowhere and starts to make justice and other bullshit . He is used as a plot device to end the anime. Are you kidding me??\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonorable mention Kaneki\u2019s friend who I don\u2019t somebody remembers him other than when he died for the greater cause of good and to change Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 4/10 \\n\r\nBeautifull colors and censoring the gore scenes well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 0/10\\n\r\nI cringed so fck hard at the opening that I wanted to destroy the pc or to beat somebody. What was worse was the fck last episode were the opening song was ongoing for like 12 minutes. A horror experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 0/10\\n\r\nIf you like useless killing and philosophy from a ghouls perspective about humans and vice versa this show is perfect for your shit taste in anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nThe ending was a cringe festival all episode long. The main character was walking in slow motion with a fck dead body into his arms and the opening song was present all episode long. I think I got brain cancer after that episode because those words repeating in high tune\u201d Oshiete Oshiete \u201c were annoying as fck like a cat was scratching the surface of a window.The ending was a cliff hanger too so that they can sell their fck useless manga .A waste of time season 2. \\n",

            "content": "Throughout the whole first season Kaneki was a crybaby little wimp. Second season, Root A gave me hope for him evolving into somewhat of a badass.\r\nOh how badly mistaken I was...\r\nNow, do note, that I did not read the manga, my opinion is based entirely on what I saw in anime.\r\nThe visual side was decent, sounds did not make my ears bleed, nothing exceptional, but nothing bad. Let's get to the main topic, though - the content.\r\nKaneki is a misunderstood, irrational emo kid. We know nothing about his motivations, why he joins who he joins, why he does what he does, nothing. He never sharesanything with anybody, because they would not understand. He pushes away tohka and everybody else, because... Beats me. I have no idea why.\\n\\n\r\nKaneki is a downright bad character in my opinion. He evolves from a sad crybaby, to misunderstood emo, there's no progress if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are much more enjoyable. I can't remember their names, but I remember, that I enjoyed them. Some were mysterious, some were funny, but all of them were defined in one way or another. Unlike Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nBesides characters, there's one more thing that irks me - the way fights were done.\\n\\n\r\nThe standard formula for a fight in Tokyo Ghoul Root A seems to look like \"two hits, 30 seconds flashback, three hits, 20 seconds flashback, four hits, existential discussion about very nature of humanity, one hit...\", you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nThere was so much potential for interesting, enjoyable fights, yet they were wasted. I know, that the creators probably intended to show us that both sides have their reasons and all, but... Is every two or so hits during a fight really the best place for that?\\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn't be pushing it, if I said, that episodes 10 and 11 had more action in them, that the rest of both seasons together. And these episodes were actually quite fun, they were enjoyable, because we saw a fight, then during a brief break we had some exposition, it was not chopped up and mixed together.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is cheap drama, the thing I absolutely loathe. People who didn't have to die - died. Buildings burned for no reason at all. Kaneki acted irrational just to show how \"dramatic\" a situation is. Many, many events occured solely to introduce some drama, nothing besides that.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the ending. The absolutely dreadful ending, that did not close any of the plotlines, explained nothing, and suggested, that there was some thime skip. I am afraid, that it may lead to another season. Or fifteen. With such vast fanbase it's a good source of money for people who created it, why kill the goose that lays golden eggs?",

            "content": "(Note: This review contains some spoilers. Read at your own risk.)\r\n*Sigh*. Where do I even begin? You know, I really like Tokyo Ghoul, well the manga at least. The first season contained a lot of flaws, however, I ultimately thought of it as an entertaining action/horror anime nonetheless. And now, we have this uninspiring sequel that proves how weak an adaptation of a manga can be. So fasten your seatbelts, this is gonna be a bumpy, fuckin\u2019 ride\u2026\r\n     Now it\u2019s time to get to the point. Tokyo Ghoul Root A is garbage, plain and simple. It is a sequel that promisedso much but does so little with every bit of its twelve-episode run, causing you to question why the hell you watched it in the first place. The reason why I\u2019m saying that you will question why you watched it at all is because of the fact that it is almost EXACTLY the same as the point in the manga that it takes place in. Of course, it isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault if they haven\u2019t read the manga and so, naturally, the story would be a brand new ride for them. But even then, the story of Root A is completely muddled with weak characters and a very unorganized and lazy story structure that feels like it was written overnight without any thought. Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a mess that needs to be criticized in order to show to people how an anime shouldn\u2019t be made.\\n\\n\r\n     Just like the first season, Tokyo Ghoul Root A is an anime developed by the infamous Studio Pierrot, known for creating the animation for anime such as Bleach, Naruto, Yuyu Hakusho, and GTO. When Pierrot announced that Root A would be a sequel to the first season and that huge changes were coming to the story that would differ from the manga, fans everywhere went bonkers with excitement and glee. I myself would say that I was pretty hyped to see what changes were coming to the table. The problem about that specific announcement made by Pierrot is the fact that it was nothing but a lie. Tokyo Ghoul Root A\u2019s \u201cchanges\u201d to the story are so miniscule and incoherent that you will think to yourself why the changes happened in the first place. In order to explain why these certain \u201cchanges\u201d were lousy and nonsensical, I will now briefly explain the story. \\n\\n\r\n     Root A takes place immediately after the events of the first season, with Kaneki\u2019s group of comrades coming to rescue the him from Aogiri Tree, the infamously brutal organization of ghouls within the Tokyo Ghoul universe. Everything within the pilot episode of Root A is pretty much exactly the same as how the story up to the point went down in the manga. The \u201cbig change\u201d, however, is revealed to the audience at the end of the episode, which reveals that the protagonist Kaneki is going to join Aogiri Tree, instead of forming his own group of rebel-esque ghouls like in the manga. Exciting right? Well guess what? That particular change that happens is neither coherently explained nor developed throughout the rest of the show, causing it to be just one giant waste of time and hype. \\n\\n\r\n     Not only is that specific change from the manga disappointing about Root A, but so is the entirety of the story as a whole. What seemed to personally upset me even more than the change from the manga was the fact that Root A never seemed to fix the flaw that I thought was most noticeable within the first season, which were the incredibly unorganized and lackluster subplots between the characters of the show. I\u2019ve always found that the author of Tokyo Ghoul, Ishida Sui, contains the potential to create great, or at very interesting, characters within the complex world that he has created. Sadly, Root A fails even harder than the first season at making the majority of its cast at least somewhat likeable. The characters in Root A hardly seem like actual people in the first place because of the robotic dialogue and the unclear motivations and intentions that most of the characters have. For example, when Kaneki announces at the end of the first episode what his new plan was for the rest of the show, he never truly explains anywhere within each episode what his actual intentions were for joining Aogiri Tree. Instead, the show continuously treats us, the audience, as if we are gullible and easy-going idiots that would never question the basic conventions of character writing. \\n\\n\r\n     What was also noticeably disappointing about Root A was the lack of excitement or thrill from the action scenes. Back in my review of the first season, I noted how one of Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s biggest pros was the intense and very entertaining sequences of action that blended well with a good soundtrack and splendid animation. Root A tries desperately to make its action as great and wonderful as the first season\u2019s, but instead, the action is ultimately boring and way too short in order to give at least one compliment about it. Not only is the action dull, but so is the overall animation for most of the episodes. It really just seems to me that the guys over at Pierrot were very lazy when it came to the story-boarding and drawing of Root A. \\n\\n\r\n     Aside from its still very well-made soundtrack, the only thing that I can honestly say that I liked about this newest season of Tokyo Ghoul were the dramatic moments, especially within the last episode. Within giving away any spoilers, the last episode, in my opinion, was well done and tragic enough to say that it deserves to be known as one of, if not the only emotionally resonating moment within Root A that was well made. However, the rest of the show\u2019s drama is completely heavy-handed, unbelievable, and somber for the sake of being somber. There\u2019s barely any moments within Root A that contains drama where you can actually \u201cfeel something\u201d for the characters, with the exception of Kaneki and The Manager. \\n\\n\r\n     Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is that Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a sequel that is not only horrible, but is also a sequel that isn\u2019t really a sequel. The changes made within the anime from the manga are barren and unnecessary because of how undeveloped they are. Watching Root A is also a waste of time on its own because of the fact that it is basically a continuing adaptation of the manga, aside from the beginning and last episodes of the show. If you are a fan of the manga, like myself, and feel compelled enough to check out Root A, I strongly advise against that decision. Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a mess of an anime that rarely shows any intention to improve upon the incredibly noteworthy flaws that you can find scattered throughout the first season. As I side before, I like Tokyo Ghoul enough to say that I am indeed a fan of the series. However, if the potential anime adaptations continue on like this, then Tokyo Ghoul will ultimately become an obscure and dreaded series that won\u2019t eventually be worth anyone\u2019s time. \\n",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the manga and the incredible story crafting skills of Ishida Sui, it's hard not to loathe the anime. Any comparison has the manga undoubtedly favored. It is a beautiful tale of a young boy, the life of a city buzzing with ghouls (and their vengeful counterparts, the CCG), and the internal struggle of the human mind. It uses symbolism, beautiful art, and is told in a fast-paced yet in-depth and understandable way.\r\nBut, this is a review on the anime. And as much as us manga lovers like to complain about the hideous transition from page to screen, season two isquick to dismiss the blame by taking on the title, \"root a\", claiming that this is a different route than the manga. With that in mind, I will try to contain my bias opinion and comment on both the pleasing sides and horrendous sides of the anime (with little comments of the manga here and there, which isn't really preventable. sorry in advance).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully speaking, when Tokyo Ghoul comes to plot, it has SO much potential. What the manga gives the writers to work with is an endless amount of detailed story and well-structured dialogue. But Root A continues down the path of it's precursor, becoming the same sad tale of season one. While it is undeniably entertaining, it leaves out an extreme amount of potential. It becomes a flat surface of one-dimensional arcs and stories that are being forcefully told.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it's important to question WHY Ishida and the creators of season two decided to go out of their way to change the \"route\" of this season, yet still kept the main story and plot lines? Events and conversations all occur exactly the same as told in the manga, while small details are changed. Kaneki's position changes and he becomes a member Aogiri, but they do NOTHING with this plot. It doesn't contribute to the main outcome of the anime. The route is still essentially following the manga, so why claim otherwise? Unless the last episode ends differently than the manga, this can become a debatable topic. Nevertheless, all other scenes from Root A were still the same, so I personally think it was unnecessary to claim this was an alternative route (though, like I said, if the last episode is different than the manga, then my argument can be changed. STILL, a much better word for it would be alternate-ending, not 'route').\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of people say the art is incredibly visually appealing, and while I can agree at certain parts of the anime, it's mostly disappointing and cringe-worthy. Every fight scene seems half-assed, characters faces are distorted, and everything seems much too rushed. There are few moments that are actually pleasant to look at. I won't comment on the censorship problem because that's not the fault of the show's creators, but even without the censorship, there's nothing special about the art/gore.\\n\\n\r\nI maybe would have rated this at a six if Arima's face wasn't the way it looked in episode 11 (and possibly 12). How is a REAPER, a god of death (as described by Kaneki), supposed to be terrifying yet cool when he has a triangular shaped chin and a flat, boring appearance/aura? There is nothing special about him, which is sadly disappointing. And when you compare the manga, where the art gives signs to an INCREDIBLE amount of symbolism (including The Hanged Man (XII), Death (XIII), little details of foreshadowing and more), it's hard not to be unimpressed with what the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, as always, pretty amazing. The op/ed are pretty good, though not extraordinary. The voice acting is usually on-point. Kaneki, Juuzou, and a few more have pretty amazing vocals and they do a good job at screaming with the same type of insanity you feel from the manga. I would also have rated this section higher if they had not BUTCHERED Tsukiyama's voice, making him a babbling idiot who shouts non-sense in broken French. It's really cringe-worthy, so I knocked it down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, wasted potential and the same problem that occurs in season one. Tokyo Ghoul is known for its incredible story telling and plot/character development. It is a beautiful climb of making mistakes, learning, and growing into characters with new insights and points of view. But every single character falls flat in the anime. There is not a single character that we have followed long enough to actually FEEL the growth of his character. For 11 episodes, we have been at a single standpoint. Barely anything has changed. By taking out an important arc (the lab/doctor arc), we steal Tsukiyama's incredible development, which originally had proven how good Ishida is at telling the story of a character. The anime is all over the place, trying to tell so many points of view in such a short span of time, and everything only manages to fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nKaneki fails to impress the anime-watchers, and that's very understandable. Without much dialogue, he becomes a protagonist that is hard to connect with. While stoic and mysterious, we lose the idea that he is our main character, making the audience confused in their ability to grow empathetic to who we're watching. Something really important to note is that, in the anime he is seen as a stoic, quiet, unfriendly figure, most likely due to the post-traumatic stress of his torture. But in the manga, he still has the ability to act friendly. He is still kind-hearted and able to SPEAK, though still holding a visible inner pain. He de-humanizes himself by becoming a cannibal, but that doesn't suddenly change his personality, which again is an admirable ability of Ishida's continuity within his characters. But the anime fails to make this connection, making him into a character who he is not.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, while we've seen little of the clowns, I'm hoping they make an appearance in episode 12, as they play as incredibly important role to the plot (which, if told correctly, can be a pleasurable thing for the 'character' section).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the genres of the anime listed on MAL, we have \"horror, psychological, and mystery\". But the anime is none of those things. Yes, anime-watchers have questions. \"Who is the owl?\", \"How powerful is Arima?\", \"Does Hide know about Kaneki?\", etc. But these things do not make a mystery. Yes, there are monsters. But they don't linger under the beds of children nor do they lurk in closets. There's no creepy factor, no intensity, and no suspension. So it's not a horror. And honestly, the anime LOST its right to call itself psychological when it ruined the plots and characters. So, for one, the enjoyment becomes one solely based on action, seinen, and drama. While these things don't make a good anime if they only have each other, they DO prove to be enjoyable. Even if you dislike the anime, most still decide to watch it to the end. Manga readers watch it to figure out what 'route' it will take. We all want to know what happens next. And I think that is important in the idea that Tokyo Ghoul Root A is a surface anime. It takes things as it sees it, all for entertainment. There are no deeper meanings, no symbolism, no beautiful whisks or originality in the writing and portrayal of its origin. It is something that we watch, we partially enjoy, and then we move on. It slips our minds and instead, we think of the manga or a new show. So while it's not memorable in the least, we do still have those moments of short enjoyment. There's nothing remarkable about it, but it's something to watch to pass the time. If I was flicking the channels (and I had never watched anime) and TG was an option, I would watch out of boredom, and maybe I'd even thoroughly enjoy an episode. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, a little side note: It's really, really entertaining when we get to see Kaneki's mental weaknesses and the true insanity that plagues his mind due to the consumption of other ghouls and his horrid torture. But there was a lack of these beautiful scenes in the anime, which again leaves us less entertained than we could have been.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what it is. Not remarkable, not horrible. Mediocre, but not yet poor or dreadful. And while writing this review, trust me. I had a lot of fan girl in me that had originally rated a lot of these sections higher than what they are now. But as I wrote, realization dawned on me, and I came to acknowledge the failed second season of Tokyo Ghoul. It had an abundance of opportunities for potential, but it never grasped at those opportunities, making the show something that can never compare to its original story-telling form. As a writer, it's disappointing to see something so beautiful reduced to something like this, and while the art and sound were not at the fault of the writers, the room left for story and character could have easily made up for it. But alas, the anime fell too short, not reaching the high expectations of fans all around. Whether these faults lay on Ishida (who helped with the anime), or the other creators of the show, it doesn't matter. It just does not live up to anything special. \\n\\n\r\nPrior to this review, the anime was rated at a 6. But the ending was just awful. Wasted space, shock-value for no reason, too much walking/music, nothing happening. Again, things that just weren't necessary and could have been used for other plot devices and entertainment, such as the fight between Arima and Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, we never get a season three nor an adaption of Re... leave this untouched, at least.",

            "content": "This anime sucks.\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A has to be one of the worst adaptations and even one of the worst anime of all time. The first season was already rushed and they cut out some important stuff, but Root A is so poorly produced that the story made barely any sense. It's not bad because it's different from the manga, it's bad because it's just simply not well written at all. Apparantly the mangaka of TG even wrote a script for Root A, but the people at Studio Pierrot were like \"nah fuck this shit\" and just made up their own storyline. \r\nSo Root Ais basically about Kaneki leaving his friends and joining the Aogiri tree. Everything beyond that is really hard to summarize, simply because how random and disjointed everything is. Root A is a bizarre mish mash between canon scenes from the manga and anime original scenes. Obviously they cut out A LOT of content from the manga (even more than in season 1) and they also made lots of unnecassary changes, which creates dozens of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nHere is an example: there is a scene where Kaneki fights some random dude. It's not explained who that is or why they even fight. The scene has literally no context and explanation whatsoever. WHY? Even in an anime like DBZ, the characters always fight for a reason, for example some villain threatening the world. You can't just put in a scene like this without telling the audience who that even is. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Tokyo Ghoul Root A isn't busy with being one gigantic plothole, it's simply boring. There are many dialogues about things that the viewer already knows. It's nice to see how the ghoul investigators came to their conclusions, but just repeating the things we already saw is just not very interesting. Also there focused too much on these ghoul investigators, insteadt of the ghouls themselfes. Heck, the protagonist Kaneki barely appears in this season. These issues however are also present in the manga to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that TG Root A is very \"edgy\" in a way that it never uses violence in a meaningful way. It's just gory for the sake of being gory. This makes it very hard to take the story seriously, especially since the characters all act like they belong more in a highschool shounen anime, insteadt of a seinen. It's like Hellsing Ultimate, except not fun to watch and with much more BS attached to it. \\n\\n\r\nIs there anything good about it? Well the music was okay and some fight scenes are nicely animated. It did have a few nice scenes, like Touka and Kaneki's friend having a talk. But these are pretty rare. Most of the time it's just random edgy bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating:\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nAnimation and Art: 5,5/10\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10",

Some of the worst character development I've ever seen, the Cat in the Hat finished plots better than this garbage series. Let's go in order of what I had to rate before writing this review:\r\n=\r\nStory: blah blah blah protagonist has a sad childhood story/goofy best friend, something strange happens to him where he lives on both the side of good and evil so fucking original blah blah struggles to find his place in the world blah blah ambiguous fate (if I wanted to read howshit turns out I wouldn't be on a site called My ANIME List would I?).\\n\\n\r\n=\\n\\n\r\nArt: Cool, these guys know how to draw, it's like they dedicated their entire life thus far to this type of stuff, but there were no spectacular scenes of a promise land, no 7 goddamn wonders of the world; the are is on par with any somewhat decent anime of this day and age, and the most relevant scenes are set in cities. C+ for the \"effort\" used to make a bunch of building, and eventually rubble look like the doodles of an art minor who wants to get a real job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: My friend Tyrone's mix-tape is more fire than this. But honestly, theme song is whiny, and the songs used at the ends of episodes are in English (nothing wrong with that, just inconsistency). I LOVE how they replay the original theme in the last episode, I get to feel like Kaneki!...while he was being tortured by Jason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Kaneki is such a baby, worst protagonist by far. After going through so much denial, you would hope the character stays true to the morals you listen to him shout/bitch/cry about over and over again, but no. \\n\\n\r\nTouka: 3edgy5me. I imagine the thought process when developing this character was \"Hey let's make go tsundere but stray from normal!\" \"How should we do that?\" \"By just keeping her angry and rarely showing signs of any kind emotion!\" \"But won't the viewers be expecting it at some point?\" \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\". \\n\\n\r\nNot enough time in the world to go on about the characters you never see again but were relevant to the core plot of some episodes, not to mention how some that seem extremely important just pop up out of nowhere. or how the fate of characters who are known from the beginning are left unkown.\\n\\n\r\n=\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Nah. I liked it in the beginning and the only real thing I enjoyed was having background noise/content to watch while I played games mid season, because at a certain point you just gotta say \"Fuck it\".\\n\\n\r\n=\\n\\n\r\nOverall: WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.",

It's been 2 seasons so far. You still don't know what they are or what they want. Sometimes they show up, fight a bit, then disapear.\\n\\n\r\nSo much to say... but one thing to remeber: IT'S A F****** SHAME. ALL the people responsible for that garbage, ALL OF THEM should do hara kiri now if it's not already done.",

With the amazing art and a spectacular soundtrack (Excluding the opening) This show at least has something going for it. Unfortunately, however music and art do improve a series greatly, if the story-line makes no sense, it is pretty close to impossible to save the show with it. This is where this film falls behind.\r\nIf you arethe type of person who watches shows for music and art only then go ahead and watch this series, you will probably enjoy it however, if you want the story to actually make sense, I would leave this show alone. The things the characters do throughout this season make absolutely no sense. There is a few good scenes sprinkled in-between but for the most part, I would recommend you to try a different similar series instead if you enjoyed the first season.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA....how do I even start this review.....\r\nOkay, I'm just going to start off by saying if you're expecting just an amazing badass continuation of the first season, you're going to cringe a little---scratch that, a LOT while watching this.... \r\nAfter the amazing first season, I was just REALLY, REALLY disappointed by this continuation. It was a sloppy storyline without a true focus, just a bunch of storylines and characters smashed into twelve episodes. UGH!\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThis makes me SOO sad to say that I gave the 2nd season of TOKYO GHOUL this poor of a rating. I mean, it's even lower than what Igave Bokura ga Ita and Kare Kano (I think). Okay, that's not right. Let's get this straight: it wasn't downright TERRIBLE, more like downright DISAPPOINTING. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the season starts off a pretty decent way with Kaneki exiting the toture chamber and what not. Which leads to my complete confusion. No, I have not read the manga; don't know if I will after this...maybe. UGH I DON'T KNOW. I was SO confused throughout this season. Maybe it's because I have a low I.Q. PSH no! Nothing was explained like, at all. The entire thing, we got one half-assed explanation of what a Kakuja was. Don't get me wrong, explanations can be long and annoying, but in this case, they were absolutely necessary yet absolutely NONEXISTENT. I never got closure on why Kaneki's hair turned white or why his nails were black. Just because he went full ghoul mode? Because his fingers/toes got ripped off repeatedly? That makes even less sense. Did the help paint his nails? And how did they retain the color for that long? (I'm a girl, trust me, I know how it works). Okay, I never got that, but I let it slide because, well Kaneki is a total hottie now and it's not an essential must-know thing. BUT what about everything ELSE? OH. MY. GOODNESS. Someone who's read the manga or whatever please tell me! \\n\\n\r\nAnd if Kaneki's the protagonist he sure didn't get a whole lot of on-screen time. Half the time the focus shifted from episode to episode from crazy Mado's daughter and Amon's love story (..I think? Even the kiss was stopped! Is that a relationship???) to irrelevant Hinami's coffee conversation with Kaneki's fav author to Touka's hardcore studying (WHY WERE SO MANY SCENES SPENT ON THAT???) UGH. I am so FRUSTRATED. I found myself, hoping, PRAYING, that Kaneki would get an episode.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit the final battle scenes with the Anteiku staff was pretty cool though. But like most of the season I found myself dragging myself through it. It was kind of....boring. I really hate to say that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty great, awesome. Opening theme's presentation wasn't nearly as visually satisfying as season one, but fine, WHATEVER.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe I just don't get it, but the opening theme of the second season was so DISAPPOINTING. I mean, obviously it's hard to match season 1, but what! I literally SKIPPED the opening theme! I never did that in the first season! And the soundtrack didn't always mesh quite perfectly like the first season. Battle scenes just didn't feel right anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many plot jumps there wasn't enough time to do all of the characters justice. Too many new unnecessary human beings/ghouls stuffed into the plot. I feel like I didn't learn any more about the characters that were already there than I did the first season. Other than the old man. That backstory was pretty cool. Really sad, but probably my favorite part. WHAT IS THAT! WHY IS MY FAVORITE PART A BACKSTORY?\\n\r\nThe characters I wished to see more of almost disappeared from the plot completely. Got way more unnecessary screen time of the creepy cannibal sniffing his handkerchief. People say they cried at the end and I ask why. I didn't even feel sad because none of the characters that died were represented enough to the point where I actually got attached. Even the BFF only popped up once in a while as the nosy ghoul nerd and at the end. PSH. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMeh, I can't say I hated watching it. I just found myself more bored that I expected. Confused. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDO I NEED TO SCREAM ANYTHING MORE????\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well first of all many may wonder why my score is so high when almost everyone trashed this anime.\r\nWith all due respect I don't read mangas and I don't give a f*** if the anime is not as good as the manga. So for all of the ones that are asking (this happened with me as well), if this anime is worth watching or not, well go and watch it, I was very surprised when I watched it and I applaud to the studio that made this anime. \r\nThis is all my opinion many may bash it, others will take the position of a professionalreviewer, some may criticize the art, story and all that stuff, but we are forgetting something and that's the most important one of all things; the overall enjoyment.\\n\r\nOk, so first of all this may be directed to people who are only watching the anime or who doesn't care about being as great as the manga. Of course it is not as great, because the images the dialogue you are reading them. So even if you don't imagine the characters or the settings because they are drawn in the chapter, you are still using your imagination and what's going to beat your imagination, nothing because you imagine things that you like that's why nothing will be greater than what you've imagined.\\n\r\nWell enough of philosophical stuff the ones that understand it fine, the ones that don't just live with it.\\n\r\nStory: 9 I think it was a great story. I said before episode 12 of s1 almost made me drop this anime second season was a redeemer.\\n\r\nArt: 7 same as s1, was going to give a 8 but I've seen better art.\\n\r\nSound: 8 same as s1 and I liked the opening of s1 for me s2's opening sucks.\\n\r\nCharacter: Not well developed but I understood some more about Kaneki, don't care that much about side characters and I often think that giving them some back story is a waste of time. This may be a pretty high score since many characters needed back-story, but I focused mainly on Kaneki's.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9 I must say I enjoyed this anime so much. A little bit of a bummer was the ending, so that's the thing I didn't liked from this anime, both endings (the first one sucked), this one was kind of dull, but not that boring. \\n\r\nOverall: 9 I give it this score because for me it was a good anime. I'm not a professional reviewer nor do I care to pretend being one, because I'm not. So if you liked this show(s1), you'll surely enjoy this season. Don't care about what others say, I don't know what's wrong with them they seem to be taking a roll that doesn't fit them. But just go watch it, dare yourselves to watch it, I must say it is not a bummer at least for me. I'm a pretty mainstream anime watcher, of course I have my favorites and let's face it mainstream are mainstream for a reason that's because they are big and almost everyone likes them, people talking about some minor details are just some petty lil b**, jk, but go watch this anime surprise yourselves with it, its a pretty good show, what others say its of no matter to you if you liked the first season.",

However, that season ended up with massive plot holes that an anime only viewer, like me, would hate. To my luck, I finished Tokyo Ghoul a week before its sequel, Tokyo Ghoul Root A, started.\r\n\"COOL\", I said, \"I'll get the answers I need. And as this an original story to the series, I won't need to read all the manga\". I felt really happy and paradoxically hyped. However, after two months, almost none of the answers Iwanted appeared. \"CRAP\", I said. \"Now I have to wait for the next season to understand everything\". It is hinted in the end of the last episode that there's going to be another sequel, but I'm now feeling annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nI liked this season, though. It offered a very good character development for the guys of the CCG, like Akira, Amon, Suzuya, and Shinohara. It featured very good fight scenes, like the ones in the first episode and the two last ones. It also had a very good soundtrack. And that's it. \\n\\n\r\nKaneki almost had 10 lines in all the show, the Anteiku people appeared in the final act of the show, and the touching scenes of the last episode didn't have any effect on me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I still don't know a lot of things of the show. This season really felt like a transition to the next season, because it was. It's impossible that things will be left like this. So yeah, I hope that there is another season (a 24 episodes season, please), so I can get the answers I want.",

Now keep in mind that I still haven't read the manga so my review will not be compared to the manga like most reviews are. \r\nStory- The story was great, I like the whole idea of ghouls and the CCG throwing down and fighting for their beliefs. Also like Kaneki joining the other ghouls and leading them as their leader. I liked the story better thenseason1 because the season 1 was just about   establishing the whole ghouls problem that Tokyo has. Season 2 you already know that and now we can get to was really important which is the conflict between the CCG and the ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Looked great, love how well shot the fight scene were, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Better music selection exept for the intro music ( I really hate it) but loved the fight music they included, well edited.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- This season fixed a problem I had with season 1 which is the character development. They did a better job at making a connection with the characters. Now you feel the friendship with each ghoul not just Kaneki and Hide friendship but with everyone else. My favorite character got to be Juuzou. This guy was a lot of fun to watch, he was quirky and very weird but I love how careless he was when he fought, he just didn't care as long as he was having fun. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Had a better time with this season then the first. Better character development, better and more fight scenes with a great story that is fell develop. I recommend this anime to all anime fans.",

            "content": "First, I haven`t read the Manga, though I did watch the first season. After watching Tokyo Ghoul Root A, all I can say is that there was absolutely nothing wrong with this anime. I can understand why many people aren`t pleased with it, as they were all aparently expecting some sort of masterpiece, however I`m not one of them. It`s a guidline for me to not bother getting hyped for yet to be released products, much easier than being dissapointed, so I started from 0 and worked my rating from there, rather than starting it at a 10 then slowlychipping away at it the more I watched it. \\n\\n\r\n     Yes, as many other reviews have stated, the story left a bit to be desired, though it`s at least as good as half the other shows I`ve seen. It did leave questions unanswered and I would like a more expansive view of this universe, but I overall enjoyed the way it played out. Nothing amazing, definitely nothing horrible, just a fair story. I feel that it really wanted to leave space open for a sequel, though at the same time satisfy with the 12 episodes it had, which is definitely not an easy thing to do and many would say they failed, I liked it. I`m not saying they succeeded, but it was a fun show to watch, though a few times I felt there was absolutely nothing going on, the rest was exciting and really got me involved. I feel like that`s all it had to do, and in that regard I`m satisfied. If you`re just looking for a good show to watch for simple, brain addling entertainment, then this would be suitable.\\n\\n\r\n     As far as art and sound, there were no issues that I saw, I rather liked the art, even if a bit generic, and the sound was spot on for me. Other than that, I can`t say much. Didn`t make me want to rip my ears off and spoon my eyes out, therefore it`s all right.\\n\\n\r\n     As for characters, we get all the characters from the first season returning, and they`ve got the same personalities, so if what you want is a similar feeling to the first season you can get it from Root A. There was development, I thought it was enough. We find out more about some of the more elusive characters, though not important, I find they seemed more real thanks to it. All in all, nothing extraordinary going on here, though it`s high quality and easily followed.\\n\\n\r\n     At the end of the day (or months of watching) I felt that I got something that could be called a cohesive story which moves foreward and changes throughout the show. I enjoyed the show quite a bit, always looking to the next episode with an anxious smile, knowing that I could watch the episode start to finish without an urge to destroy my computer, even immensly enjoying the seldom moments where it brought me uncontrollable emotion, not always sadness either. I could relate and undertsand the situations (not exactly the same though) and see why the characters do what they do. Though there`re probably countless reiews saying how absolutely aweful this show is, I`m gonna give it a 7. By no means would I consider this to be a bad show, so I`d say watch it if you were thinking to, after other better shows though.",

Now to explain why people have an issue with the last episode of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA\r\nThe issue many people have (including me) is the last episode leaves a lot of un answered questions and does not answer previous questions. Also does not show the back story on the characters introduced in this season. Which is a problem since instead of following the manga this anime goes in a different route aka  route \u221aA sopeople figured it would be different but would be good in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ends up happening in this anime is it glazes over a lot of arcs, characters and combines it all together. Making i it hard to understand what is happening in the story and causes a lackluster anime ending.\\n\\n\r\n I would say if you're a fan of Tokyo Ghoul this is a anime worth a watch just to see some more Tokyo Ghoul content. If you're not then, I suggest you read the manga then come back to see this if you feel up to it. All in all I would not recommend watching this anime unless you already have the knowledge of what happens in the story.\\n",

            "content": "A continuation of the highly popular anime whose first season aired in 2014,Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is just as widely recieved as its predecessor but do do the similarities end there or does \u221aA share its big brothers problems as well?That's what we're here to find out,so let's be on our way. \r\n1.  Story - 5\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA continues to follow Kaneki Ken,while he struggles to adapt to life as a ghoul all the while battling dangerous foes in the form of other ghouls,the CCG and most importantly the ever growing insanity dwelling inside him ever since his imprisonment in the Aogiri Tree base inthe 11th ward.The main differences in \u221aA's story compared to that of the original Tokyo Ghoul is that the story is entirely original to the anime as well as being written by TG's mangaka Ishida Sui.This means that even manga readers like myself have something new to look forward to seeing but most importantly it means that the story is blessed with better pacing as it is not trying to fit 70+ chapters of the manga into 12 episodes but rather has its own timeline which it follows to the letter and that is clearly visible while watching the show.Not once did I feel as if things were being rushed like I did at the end of TG's first season or that the show was dragging its feet like in some early moments of the first season.All of the above being said don't go into this show expecting an exceptional story or a lot of philosophical quandaries being put in front of you.why is that you ask?Well, while the show is very well paced and the story does not leave you lacking it won't leave you craving more as well at any given moment and that is because in order to fit in all the necessary things from the manga into the show Ishida and others involved in the show had to cut out a lot of scenes that gave the story,its characters and the show overall a lot more character.And it truly is a shame to see because in the manga the nuances of the story are done in such a masterful way.\\n\\n\r\n2.  Art - 8\\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking the animation in Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA won't blow you out of your seat or anything,but it can be seen that a lot of effort was put into the art but it inevitably suffers from the lack of funds provided to Studio Pierott.During the course of the show there will be several animation \"herp derps\" that will be evident but they are few and far between so it will not affect your experience at all.The part of the show's animation that must be singled out for it's a rung above the rest are several key fight scenes during \u221aA 's run that are just breathtaking to watch due to the animation and direction.But what truly separtes \u221aA from other shows in terms of art are its 12 distinct ED sequences during which drawings by TG's creator Ishida Sui are being displayed.\\n\\n\r\n3.  Sound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to talk about in this section,but I will give it my best.All the seiyuu are up to par especially Natsuki Hanae who lends his voice to Ken.The OP and ED songs are both wonderful although I do prefer the first season's opening song Unravel to the one used in the second season.As for the OST I will surely get it once it is made available as it is simply glorious,and its usage is perfectly timed.My favourite of the pack and to many other people I am sure is Glassy Sky.\\n\\n\r\n4.  Character - 4\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the story section of this review a lot of small scenes form the original manga were cut in this interpretation so as to make it flow more naturally.Unfortunatly that means the development of a lot of characters is stunted and you will not care much for them by the end.All of this is presuming you are an anime only watcher.As for the manga readers, a dark and powerful force may boil in your stomach once you realise that a lot of your favourite scenes or really important scenes for certain characters have been cut from the show.As for the characters themselves,Kaneki or perhaps I should say his suffering is entairtaining as always and besides the Anteiku crew this time around the show switches its focus more often to the investigators of the CCG.\\n\\n\r\n5.  Enjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA and would recommend it to people who are either masochists,like to watch trainwrecks or just had to see what this new season was all about.In all honesty the enjoyment score is as high as it is just because even though the show is mediocre at best it is still Tokyo Ghoul and I enjoyed on some subconcious level\\n\\n\\n\r\n6.  Overall - 5\\n\\n\r\nIt just had the potential to be oh so so good and that is what hurts the most.Had it been in a more capable studio's hands TG could've turned out so much better,but alas it is not so.The only thing to hope for now is a FMA : Brootherhood type treatment once :re is finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "As one of the most popular anime of 2014, I was looking forward to watch Tokyo Ghoul.  However, I must say that I am very disappointed. I might come off as being harsh to some but I believe I am justified when I say that this anime is unremarkable and easily forgettable.  There are two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul, but considering that season two is a direct continuation, I feel it would be most appropriate to examine both as one.\r\nA strong introductory first episode lead me to believe that I might have to add Tokyo Ghoul to my favorite\u2019s column, but at lastI came to realize I was deceive.    Our protagonist, Ken Kaneki, is a shy college student who happens to be bookworm.  Not the most unique of characters but he is who he is.  He befriends a beautiful girl, Rize Kamishiro, who also appears to love books just as much as him.  He is smitten and takes Rize on a date.  As they are walking home Rize reveals that everything was a fa\u00e7ade, she is actual a ghoul and beginnings to attack Ken.  A construction \u201caccident\u201d miraculously kills Rize and saves Ken\u2019s life.  He is left unconscious and later discovers to his great consternation that some of Rize organs were transferred into his body during surgery.  He now becomes half human and half ghoul and his story for survival commences.    \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is very appealing, however I feel that the story is incomplete and has too many holes.  For example, the producers fail to provide adequate information about ghouls, after finishing the series I still do not fully know what a ghoul is.  In fact, the producers provided very little background in general.  Although I must stress that the first season was very entertaining.  It appears that they were trying to build some intrigue and provide answers later on.  However, season two provided little to no answers.  *SPOILER *Almost every ghoul knew of Rize Kamishiro and was interested in her in some form.  But the story provided no background into her past.  In one scene Ken breaks into a ghoul prison and ends up fighting an inmate who surprise surprise is only focus on Rize.  He is much stronger and ken proves no match for him.  The fight scene is cut and that inmate disappears with no explanation is never seen again.  Also, after Ken\u2019s transformation into a full ghoul, he joins the enemy faction and provides no clear motive.  His only explanation is that he wants to protect those he love.  How exactly will joining Aogiri tree (enemy faction) help protect them?* The story, mostly the second season, felt force. Bits and pieces of information were thrown in with no real coherence.  I keep on waiting for the story to gradually provide some answers and explanations but that never happened.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly I did not like most of the characters, this is my personal opinion therefore it may vary from other people. Omitting the torture scene Ken Kaneki was weak and a wimp, personally I find this very annoying.  After his transformation into a full ghoul he becomes stronger but too distant and mysterious to the viewer.  Touka Kirishima is a tsundere, very clich\u00e9.  Amon is one of the few characters that I enjoyed.  They revealed a little of his past which help explains some of his motives and aided the audience in connecting with him.  Yoshimura fulfilled his role admirably.  Tsukiyama was incredibly irritating I hated him.  His extravagant gestures, tone and mannerism frustrated me.   Juuzou is another one of my favorites, an enigmatic character always willing to provide some comic relief. Hide was an essential piece to the story but very little is known about him much like Rize.  Most of the remaining characters are extras and don\u2019t really add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very well done and the character design were practically flawless.  The fights were undoubtedly very visually appealing.  The opening and ending music were unsatisfactory, they did not create an impact.  \\n\\n\r\nGranted, not by design, my review can appear as if I am attacking this anime.  However, I tried eminently to enjoy this anime.  Tokyo Ghoul certainly had the potential but disappointed in most areas.  It was obvious that the producers were in a rush and crudely assembled the story.  Although I did not read the manga, from the comments that I read the producers did not stick to the manga and did a poor job in the adaptation.  Tokyo Ghoul is not terrible but as a whole this anime was rather lackluster. \\n",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first review on this site.\r\nI'm only writing this because people are literally /ripping/ this adaptation apart, differences between the anime and manga be nixed.\r\nThe manga was rushed in the last ~10 [give or take] chapters, so saying that the manga was better is only going to fuel the flames of clashing opinions.\r\nThat being said, what did you expect Pierrot to do? Animate the manga? With all the plot holes it /already has/?\r\nNo, they had to do something different\u2014\r\n\u2014and I believe they did a respectable job, given the circumstances.\r\nAnyway, OT:\r\nThe story gets a 6 from me, as it was certainly \"fair,\" farfrom outstanding, not to even mention the lack of continuity in so much as the last two episodes. The only saving grace was the after-the-credits setup for a third season. Hopefully they'll save face by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (9), sound (10), and characters (8) are hard to mess up, given that the animation meets industry standards, the soundtrack is undeniably marvelous, and the characters were already established in the first season (and manga, however you're looking at it or coming from.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I genuinely enjoyed it. If you didn't, then you must have been expecting yourself not to. The mind is a powerful thing, guys.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'm not saying the anime was GOOD, because to me, even the manga wasn't all that great. I would honestly rate it a 7.5, but since we can't use decimals in our scoring, I'm hesitant to round it to 8\u2014seeing as I was disappointed all the same. As far as I can see, the score started out much higher at the beginning of the season\u2014and the consensus has SIGNIFICANTLY dropped (from WAY over 8, to 7.78 at the time of me writing this.)\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, a whole lot of the reviews I see people posting up were written by blokes hardly capable of their elementary-level grammar. Furthermore, a good amount of /those/ folks are just bandwagon-ing the shit talk surrounding this title, making themselves out to be total jackasses.\\n\\n\r\nOn the real, if you're going to watch this anime, I'd advise you to read the manga first. You won't be as angry about all the missing details they left out in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, anything inside of forward slashes implies italicization. It's unfortunate that we can't use BBCode here, I think reviews would have much more of an impact on the readers.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I would like you to know that this review is going to spoiler-free, and that includes both THIS season AND the first season of the show. I will do my best to keep out any information revealed in season one for those who have yet to get around to either starting or finishing it. Though, if you haven't watched the first season yet, I'm not exactly sure why you are reading this.\r\nAnyway, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA takes place some time after the events of the first season. Ghouls, which are a sort of demi-human who need to consume the flesh of other humansin order to survive, are struggling to keep themselves alive in the various districts of modern-day Tokyo. The protagonist of this series, Kaneki Ken, is a teenager who -- just a year or two ago -- was still completely human. It wasn't until he was involved in a tragic accident and received a faulty organ-transplant that he became part ghoul. Kaneki eventually falls into a group of ghouls operating out of a coffee shop by the name of Anteiku that simply want to help others of their kind survive. But that's easier said than done, considering the humans want ghouls exterminated for good -- which is extremely plausible.\\n\\n\r\nIn \u221aA, Kaneki makes the decision to separate himself from Anteiku in order to become stronger and ultimately protect the ones he cares about. So to do that, he joins up with a rival gang (Aogiri) known more for their interference in human life, as opposed to Anteiku's method of just blending in. Throughout the brief course of this sequel, viewers get to sit in on the changes and interior struggle that Kaneki must face if he wants to save the ones he loves. And though the anime does face issues in showcasing that development which is ever-present in the manga, it is still an enjoyable show. The thing is, this season is receiving negative feedback from almost every critic but me. And I can see where that negative attention derives from, but is it really ALL THAT bad? I'll separate it the show into a few key component to better figure that out.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nThe music in the Tokyo Ghoul series is pretty boring most of the time, I'm not going to lie. BUT, at many moments throughout it, especially in this sequel, it hits you like a truck and completely elevates the \"Feels\" moments to the next level. The very last scene of this series is a reason in itself that should push you to watch it, if anything. Without the music, this scene wouldn't even make the impact of a fly landing on your shoulder. But the point is that the music of Tokyo Ghoul forces certain feelings out of you. After all, that is the objective of music as a whole, is it not? There's just so much stagnation in between these moments of intense emotion that the music isn't able to fully maintain your attention. Once again though, when it does manage to do its job, it does it better than almost anything out there. Go watch the last scene again on mute if you disagree with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the Tokyo Ghoul universe are, without a debt, the strongest part of the show. But even better than these characters are the actors that play them. Natsuki Hanae, who voices Kaneki, is one of the best male-performers you will ever hear in an animated series. This performance tops everything else he has done so far and, in addition to that, has become my absolute favorite voice-acting role to-date. But it isn't just Hanae that delivers a stellar performance. It is the entire damn voice cast. Tsukimiya, Nishiki, Touka, Juzo, I can go on and on. Absolutely every actor works as a driving force in propelling you toward the next episode of the series, regardless of how the story is moving or what the manga did that the show did not. A lot of development is left out due to how short the series is, but it's still there. However, there is an incredibly huge jump from the first season to the second that leaves out almost everything that would cause the characters to become who they are in the newer episodes -- because most of them are completely different people from who they were in season one. But that is more of a story-based problem than a character based-one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animators at Studio Pierrot aren't the best in the business. They're not even in the top 10, to be honest. But are they bad? Mehhhhh...I'll say no. The fight scenes in Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA are well animated considering how large they are in terms of scale at times. Character design is pretty solid as well and doesn't change that much when comparing the anime to the manga. But the blood is overdone, the faces lack serious emotion at times, and there is such a huge contrast between how everything looks at night and how everything looks during the day that it gets a little...confusing. Overall, it isn't something to worry about and only slightly depreciates the overall quality of the show. Because the character design is loyal to the books and keeps those characters pleasing to the eye, I'd say that the art is decent. That is my final answer.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story in the first season definitely outweighs the story of \u221aA. That huge gap between the two that I mentioned earlier plays a hefty part in this. Tokyo Ghoul is a series in which character development is so important that it is detrimental to the health of the show if you leave it out. But Studio Pierrot didn't care about this and instead focused too much on the conflict between Aogiri, Anteiku, and the humans -- basically leaving said development in the dust. It does get better though. As soon as you can recover from the initial time-skip and kind of figure out why Kaneki has become a completely different person over the last half-hour, it is going to be smooth sailing. The last five or so episodes really stood out, in my opinion. Not only were the riddled with nostalgia aimed at taking me back to season one, they built up hopes and chopped them down soon after. I like when my emotions get in the way of viewing a series. I like when those emotions renew my interest in a show and force me to watch it as soon as it becomes available. I looked forward to the ending of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA more than I looked forward to any other episode of the series. I think that has to say something.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of critics are right in saying Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA leaves too much out. But those critics aren't right into leading you to believe that the series is bad as a whole. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA does have its flaws -- no doubt about it. But it also has a lot of good things to offer as well. The characters, those moments of intense feeling, the performances -- so much is overlooked in the negative reviews. But hey, who am I to tell you what you will or won't enjoy? You can decide that on your own. I'm just a guy who knows what he likes, and both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul fall into that category for me.",

            "content": "Warning: This review cointains some major spoilers \r\nEver since the first airing of season one of Tyoko Ghoul it was apparent that there really was an anime for every person and seen im not actually an anime fan at all thats when I realized Tyoko Ghoul was that needle in the hay stack for me. A dark horror fantasy but place in a symmetrical environment to ours, in other words urban and modern, were man eating humans walk among our society called Ghouls which have supernatural powers. A young man by the name of  Kaneki  ends up going out on a date witha women which unfortountly leads him from just about getting eaten by his date but somehow ends up becoming a Ghoul. Now Kaneki must learn to live amongst the conflict between the Ghouls and Humans trying to exterminate each other seen as how he now is both.\\n\\n\\n\r\n In the First season there wasn't anything that I could spot that seemed overly amateur. The characters are very well done with strong unique personality's, the finale was great as it left you with that feeling of wondering what is going to happen next season without wanting to wait for the next sesaon to come out. Also was a very significant event and was a pivotal moment for kaneki's character development. The plot feelt steady and seemed like it could have a lot of potential for expanding through out the seasons but when it comes to season two the plot seems almost clumsy. The first episode's we find out that Kaneki tells Toyka hes going to join Aogiri in the second season and the creators never make it clear why so your left wondering why he does that. Even in the finale it never gets revealed. The only reason I could think of is when Jason was tortureing Kaneki, that when Kaneki came to the realization that to protect every one he cared for, he'd have to be stronger which is why he would join Aogiri. But still leaving your audience to have to assume feels kinda sloppy. But compared to some other errors thats just mild, as we come across new characters named Shiro and Kuro and we find out Kaneki is not the only half Ghoul. With that being said  you'd  think they would be significant. Well there not. Shiro and Kuro only feature in a couple of episode's not only that but one of them gets killed from these characters there's nothing we learn. Even if theres a point to this we are left up trying to assume a logical conclusion why they got put in. So in the end what do we learn about season two of Toyko Ghoul that we now know just to make the story last longer there doing shit like putting in a whole bunch of new characters and action scene to fill the show. Don't get me wrong I like the action scenes one thing about Tyoko Ghoul that caught my attention was how it's nitty gritty intense vibe but after a while it starts to get old. While watching season two it seemed like it literally was just people going app shit and killing each other not like the first season were the creators seemed to have a perfect pace and not have to really rely on that mediocre shit. Also we find out that Toyka end's up going to Kiyomi school the school that Kaneki went to before he became a Ghoul they never clarify why she came to that decision well were left guessing Again. I know theres a manga off Tyoko Ghoul were it explains a lot more, but for people who aren't into reading and prefer watching it they might not be as happy with the tv show as much as the manga. Which could possibly mean if you really want to enjoy Tyoko Ghoul at its full you have to like reading and if you too bad. \\n\\n\r\nEven though my review sounds like complete slander and all negative there are things i still like about Tyoko Ghoul like there unique characters, horror emo kind off vibe, intense raw and rugged feel it has. But because off the second season off Tyoko Ghoul proving that what can be great can also start to be  potentially leading to a fail my overall review on season two would be 4 out of 10.",

So after hearing rumours that it doesn't stand to hopes of peoples and is constantly criticized as far as i know, They are right at their place but the ending was fitted to it. though theending was not clear but we can assume that like Arima V/S Kaneki = Arima so we can certainly give it a try, and from my point of view its \"Great\".\\n\r\nHope it would Get 3rd Season Tokyo Ghoul Re; soon enough though its announced but delayed.",

Ken Kaneki is an amazing character, and very likable in the manga, but in the second season of the anime, you do not see the torment he goes through, the producers made him do things he DID not do in the manga which makes him unlikable, and there is a huge flawin the anime as a whole regarding the story and characters.

            "content": "I...\r\nI have no words. This is an anime I have been expecting ever since the first season ended with such a cliffhanger. Had I not read the manga and I would've lost any hope in Ishida whatsoever. Just... why, Pierrot.\r\nAs usual, I try to be unbiased, even though I read the manga, watched the anime's first season and legit enjoyed both, which just made this so much more painful. The story... it's a disaster. Was this supposed to be original content? Because the only two things actually changing were Kaneki joining Aogiri and Touka having a prominent role, and the earlier had no positive impactsave the initial shock whatsoever. It was possibly this twist that made Kaneki's character seem so shallow and his development near null.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime turned him into some brooding, woe-is-me dude that immediately plunges into the world of mediocrity. Many casual fans actually like this version of Kaneki better, which is probably why he was twisted into that. But it's just not... right. He was a completely different person at all times save a few precious scenes and the last episode, and even then he felt off. The worst part is there isn't any development to speak of, and he is the main character!\\n\r\nTouka, however, actually had the good end of the animation. She managed to have the best development in the cast for me, and even then it wasn't stellar.\\n\\n\r\nA last point about the story. Judging from other reviews, anyone who has read the manga can very rightfully get pissed off at perhaps the most important arc being adapted out. It's almost as though this season was made solely to attract more people with no regards to respecting good development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was, in my opinion, superior to the first season, but that's as good as it gets. The animation certainly wasn't, to the point it was plain hilarious at times, and some fights were cringe-inducing.\\n\r\nTh soundtrack was excellent, a bright spot among the darkness, bringing along many memorable OSTs and some following from the first season. Many people complain about the opening, but I feel like it goes perfectly with Kaneki's (or what they tried to achieve) state of mind, as it speaks about beign unable to go back to the peaceful days. And it does have a spark of Ishida symbolism in it.\\n\r\nThe ED was great, and unlike the controversial anime the opinion about it seems to be unanimous.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was... certainly something. Yes, it did make Tokyo Ghoul popular enough to be the most popular anime of all 2015. And yes, I must admit it was entertaining. I did wait with great diligence and watched each new episode the moment it came out, and it kept me hooked. Of course, it could also be I hoped it would get better.\\n\\n\r\nThere were scenes that stood out greatly, too, like the long-awaited reunion between Touka and Kaneki, especially because how in-character they acted. I would have lost all hope if Touka had, I don't know, rushed to hug in someone who in her eyes betrayed her given her volatile nature. And Kaneki was at his post-white hair Kaneki-est. The last few episodes were very engaging and action-packed as well, especially the second-to-last one.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite scene, however, and one that was on par with the manga was Kaneki's reunion with Hide. It was especially heartwarming how Hide reacted to the whole situation and genuinely painful to see Kaneki no distressed at having his friend look at the monster he had become. Even better when Hide actually made Kaneki laugh, as it just showed how, despite so many things changing and going to hell, their friendship was untouched. The feels.\\n\\n\r\nIt was that scene and very few memorable others that compelled me to give is a seven and not less. However, I think we can all agree that this season stomped, spit and laughed at out expectations, anime and manga fans alike.",

            "content": "The second season of Tokyo Ghoul, This anime is horror/dark fantasy says MAL but to be honest the manga is more interesting than the anime because some part was skipped due to short schedule. First of all the introduction of this Anime is much greater, by the way this anime has a lot of censorship. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nFirst of all Kaneki is a normal school student who suddenly entered the world of ghouls that eat humans for their survival later he change because Kaneki accept being a Ghoul so that he can protect the people he love and become unaware of his self. The plot isall about Ghoul Investigator(humans) and ghouls.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is morally grey and was exposed to both sides of the story as we explore the conflicts between humans and ghouls.\\n\r\nWell the story is good and great details about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe Ghouls are realistic and there is blood everywhere. The animation is so great especially in fighting scene but sometimes u can spot the mistakes.\\n\r\nCharacter designs very well and the changes like Kaneki. But the anime is heavily censored where a lot of time during fighting. You can watch the uncensored version in Blue ray.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe video casting is perfect and the voice actors are doing their best to get the voice done. The opening song is luck of variety and art, just for my own eyes. But the opening really captures the MC's changes and accurately triggers the lifestyle, influences and factors that he faced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nFor the characters, Kaneki, he was originally a human and a normal college student, is really like you know a cry baby who wants to be human again. But Kaneki change due to the dangers he encountered and loses his memories of his past and becomes unaware of his true self, thats right Kaneki becomes a great badass character in this series .The characters of the series is for more greater from the adaption of the manga. Introducing the character\u2019s issues before having thoughts in each character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot especially in season 1 but I don\u2019t like the censored scenes because of the certain scene to be done with. The anime is really great and the adaption really fits from the Manga but I hate the skipped part of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nBecause I enjoyed the manga more than anime if you want to enjoy more of this series just read the manga first in my opinion. Trust me you really enjoy this anime without hesitation. Well this anime is well animated and developed characters. I have no idea why they hate Tokyo Ghoul so much. This Anime is getting better and better.\\n\\n\r\nThis is after all, just my own opinion and I am slightly roused since I love the manga. However, I would not to force you to read the manga from chapter 1 if you're an anime only watcher especially since season 1 is essentially anime original content of this anime. Thanks for reading this review and have fun watching Tokyo Ghoul.",

            "content": "Well I know that i should be crying or something after I've watched this- but surprisingly the tears did not come and they didn't fall either so. \r\nStory: The story of this one is the continuation of the first season i think- and it started all off with the fiery scarlet battles, blood pouring about and etc. I'll be honest with you the reason i really liked TG was because of the characters and their developments and in the anime it's all about Choreography. Unfortunately i'm very disappointed about this adaptation. This story is way too tragic and that's not the main point- the storyis well plainly saying it's just boring. The first season was much more better in my opinion in terms of giving a tear jerking and a heart breaking story, oh and let's not forget the excitement. It feels like i've seen nothing new since i watched the first season and this story is pretty much predictable from the start except the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is superb in this one- i love all the landscape and scenery in this anime- feels so serene and since this aired in winter, they made sure to use a lot of snowy landscapes to illuminate the tragic horror and sorrow in this anime. \\n\r\nCharacter drawings are superb- especially Kaneki(the most awaited white haired hero of all time) The choreography was very superb in this anime even the first season- i was so glad that hadn't changed at least. Almost it feels like a movie and not an anime because of that- for a dramatic example when Kaneki was walking down the snowy lane to highlight him and to give him a spotlight they used the search light of the helicopter- so the artists had strived hard to keep this natural with the environment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending was both okay- i'd prefer the ending as much more better than the opening. All in all absolutely nothing can replace the key soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul which is \"Unravel\" by Ling Tosite SIGURE- obviously the producers knew that and that's why it was played in the last episode. The voice dubbing was superb- no complains. Mamoru Miyano coming off as Tsukiyama as intended feels to me as he's been given way too much insane characters to perform. And Kaji Yuki playing \"Ayato\" is nearly a plot twist since he is famous for shota characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Hideyoshi was my favorite character, oh and Suzuya too. Those two characters are one of the rarest kinds you find in anime. You could compare Suzuya to Sakamaki Kanato but not quite. And Hide is one of those sharp best friend lead of the main character ever. Taking Kaneki's development into view, i was pretty much surprised that he hasn't changed at all- except that he lost his smile and his black hair. Kaneki \"feels\" the same oh except when he goes berserk. Also just because the character of the main lead developed and the rest was just stuck in a time stop doesn't make the story more exciting you know.\\n\r\nThe show introduce two new characters which the personalities were contrasting over all. I think the main flaw in this one is that the spotlight wasn't given to the characters who required it more like \"Uta\" or \"Tsukiyama\" or even \"Yoma\" and god forbid that crazy nut \"Rize\" even. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was nice to see all the characters once again- but i was disappointed to see that there's not much more plot in this or much of a story. What i did see was just hordes of battles in whichever the wards ghouls were coming from. Also i think the only thing i enjoyed was the last episode- it was very dramatic and contrasting. I should cry because the person who was covered in Kaneki's arms was revealed- but no thank you, that plot twist was way too unnatural. The most anticipated moments of the anime was given wonderfully and dramatically so a point for that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/8 is given to the last episode and the rest of them doesn't deserve no more than a seven. \\n\r\nI'm still contemplating that if this is actually the sequel to \"that\" Tokyo Ghoul- oh well but it wasn't thaat bad at least.",

Not to say that these twists... these... punchy and plentiful moments of truth didn't catch me off-guard, because they did - and this worked well... until you realize that the rest of the content is filler. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime needs to do more than just relay what's happening at a given moment, it needs depth, and development of the characters to make them relatable and likable.  Doing so makes the show seem less manufactured, and offers a more personal viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nWhereas in the first season, Kaneki was very relatable, emotive and acted in a way that resembled what normal people would do - he was easy to appreciate and get attached to. In Root A, the best development in my opinion was of Akira, as generally the season starts out quite slowly, and a good amount of consideration was taken in developing her through her father - alongside some other new faces of course. Sadly though, Studio Pierrot... She is definitely not our main character. As instead, viewers of Root A have to deal with Kaneki \"version 2\": for the most part he is an emotionally devoid, isolated, brooding bore. This was a massive hit for that signature reliability, and outgoing personality of Kaneki in season 1. Despite his circumstances, there was no need to render him so brooding and quiet to the point where the show looses ALL sense of personality - and potentially causes the audience to root for the opposition. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely say that there is a very significant distance between the viewer and all of the characters, as in in addition to having no main character, the story of Root A is very much set on a larger scale. In fact, the whole anime can be described as a war, and therefore characters individually play smaller, less developed roles. This explains the loss of character attachment, but i genuinely do believe that the \"bigger, whole city\" premise was a refreshing angle for the show, kind of like how season 1 began...\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have a war without ACTION!\\n\r\nAnd Root A DELIVERS! (for once)\\n\r\nArguably, the show's only strong suit is its immediate scope presentation. The art is phenomenal, and the in-ep soundtrack is very fitting too.\\n\r\nDespite the invasion of the theme into \"filler territory\", the action fighting scenes are truly a sight to behold - dominating those of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nYou can probably gather that as a whole, i felt that this follow up season was lacking in the story and character departments. I found it hard to get acquainted to the characters again, as they were all, always so distanced during the somewhat repetitive, but dramatic and pleasing fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that i'd say, will only work well for  action-addicted judges...\\n\r\nAnd if you've read the manga (i haven't) - just forget it!\\n\\n\r\n~ It tells you that you're Not Dead! (yet) ~\\n",

First season was so interesting that even with all the censure it made me go and read the entire manga in a weekend.\r\nSo first thing first:\r\nStory: 3\r\nWTF!!!!!!!!!!!!! is this shit, not good, at first i actually think of it as like in games you take decisions that changed the ending but it was just a road that will take you to a ending pretty much the same as the others but with the drag ofthe consequences of the choice you made... but they hit us with stupid reasoning, and something that its worth hope for amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  6\\n\r\nIf i see this as from the point of Art and Animation, the art was great same like the last one, but the animation... the fights didn't just suck as hell, there was some kind of lag that i actually thought it was my laptop, the internet and even my eyes that were not working well but hell no, just another problem with this 2nd season\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNot quite good like the season one, i was actually thinking that it was a little bit sad that it wasn't so remarkable, but it fit the theme, the opening wasn't so bad, was something new i didn't like it but i didn't hate or anything else...it was ok\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nWell Kaneki took a direction that didn't made any sense at all, no matter how hard they try to explain it, it was just stupid, i was like wtf?, so we don't see him struggle or suffer, he didn't grow at all, his Centipede mode or whatever the hell it was, was such a let down. And all the cast wasn't memorable, sure they gave us some interesting things... but the stupidity that was behind all of then was so stupid that i just want to forget the logic in Amon letting Akira get almost killed... lets just leave it there, so many stupid things gathered together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nIts not a zero cuz i can't, seriously amnesia is the best thing that could happen to anyone who had seen this piece of shit, this insult to Tokyo Ghoul and to Ishida Sui.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nDon't waste your time. Its bad like cancer but worse. \\n\r\nLETS HOPE - TOKYO GHOUL RE: - gets cancelled if they its gonna be this shit again. And of course that the responsible for this gets hanged or at least fired... lol just joking, i just hope someone makes the damn guy say sorry to all of us and redo all this following blindly the manga.\\n\\n\r\nPeace!",

It was like solving the puzzle your self without knowing which piece goes where. Kaneki decides to go to Aogiri, at first you might think\r\n\"Ok,now dat is badass. \" but after that,shit is explained, not to mention their useless fights in cochlea and many other scenes. \\n\r\nThe last episode did not make any sense and it was boring as it could be, i did not understand what the hell kaneki was doing and what happened after that blackout\\n\r\nMaybe the director wanted to take advantage of our own creativity and wanted us to decide what had happened but it turned out to be a disaster\\n\r\nAlso kaneki was mostly spending his time in his hideout nd screaming like a virgin gettin an orgasm. Which really made you hate this series over all\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(3/10): Every one was a piece of garbage maybe becuz no one was getting enough screen time and so it rather seemed more action than simpe dialogues\\n\r\nKaneki: Just good for using big words nd nothing else. \\n\r\nTouka: Running around in all the streets like a kawaii b****.\\n\r\nEveryone else:garbage\\n\r\nMany new characters were intoduced and yet no explanations were given . The idea of knowing the characters gives the story a much smoother pace while as leaving blank spaces for them makes the whole plot meaningless.\\n\r\nThe two girls who became ghouls; I really wanted to know their past as well as how did they become ghouls nd the reason as well but...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOp/soundtrack(1/10): The op was really disappointing. It was totally out of unravel's league. It forced me to skip the op . Not to mention the soundtrack was really nice but it did not match the rythme of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10) If v only talk about the fights i really did enjoy it having them badass fights, it really gave me the chills but the most important aspect of an anime is not on the fights its rather on the characters and the story/plot , if the story is the spine then all the other minor things are as strong as the spine it self.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a 7 would b satisfactory for an anime like this. Anythng above this would b bragging about this more than needed. Anythng belove it would b rather harsh \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf u find any thing offensive or any other point u would like to inform me feel free to pm me, this is my first time writing a review so if u would give me a suggestion or two it would b highly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n\"Khalla tere munh te teri all olaad te tere chuttar te tokyo ghoul2\"",

Throughout the first season, I continually felt closer to the struggle of both the Ghouls and the Doves that I was familiar with. Yet I found myself confused with many decisions these characters made or chose regardless of character development.\r\nThe biggest example comes within the second episode, however, from what I understand this is a fairly significant change from the manga. This could bepart of what contributed to my lack of enjoyment, however it could simply be that the compression of the series wasn't as effective as it should have been. Additionally, I felt the show did a poorer job of conveying the greys of the world, and felt a significant push that the government was supposed to be the \"bad guys\" of the entire arc. I missed losing that \"grey\" aspect, and it was sorely missed.\\n\\n\r\nI rated this season lower than the first, and was upset that the standard of quality wasn't quite what I hoped. This shouldn't disenfranchise those who loved this show, or those who enjoyed it. I simply was not able to find what I was looking for.",

            "content": "When this season was airing, in 2015, the manga had already finished. There was really no need to alter the story. That said, I am not necessarily against changing things up, different perspective is always exciting to witness. It always comes with a risk though, especially so when the original story is brilliant. This is one of those times when it backfired completely. If I had to list all good things about this season, they would be: a brilliant OST \"Glassy Sky\" and... uh... wait, that's it... Just kidding, most of the very last episode as well.\r\nThe first episode is one that feels like whatshould have been the last episode of the previous season, so the start is already awkward. There are major changes from the very start, including the full fight between Kaneki and Ayato, which was supposed to end with one of the most badass moments I've personally had the pleasure of experiencing. This first episode already made me lose all expectations with the dumbest plot twist I could ever imagine, it being Kaneki joining Aogiri Tree.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough my expectations were gone, I kept being disappointed. The overall story is anything but cohesive and attractive. The biggest twist is in the first episode and it makes absolutely no sense. Later on it doesn't get better. For example, the Cochlea raid was absolutely random. The way it happened was really bad and the events it lead to were just disappointing. Kaneki vs Shachi was unprecedented, unneeded and with no context behind it, it just happened. If you don't plan to explain things like in the manga so it would make sense, then just skip the scene altogether. Story progresses in a very weird way, it feels like everything is happening without a good reason. Kaneki turned into a half-kakuja after eating one ghoul, when you are supposed to cannibalise NUMEROUS times for it to happen. And more. It feels like they took some good parts as ingredients and tried to make a cake, which turned out no better than horseshit. Kaneki joining Aogiri was supposed to be a huge deal and yet it just went nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is usually where bad shows excel at. Not this time. Often it is static and slow. Kaneki vs Shachi fight has some of the worst animation I've seen, especially disappointing when it was drawn exceptionally well in the manga. Characters' faces are sometimes really really weird. Kagunes looked really dope in the first season but here everything just looks the same and projectile attacks look stupid. It's almost like they tried to save as much money as possible. Who would have guessed? I would say the animators did their job with their budget but it's a far cry from an outstanding product even visually. And for the love of god, try to be more creative when animating coffee, don't use the exact same shots 50 times in a season.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first season, which had a glorious and exceedingly popular opening song \"Unravel\" (which I love, mind you), this season's is pure garbage. The melody is almost irritating to listen to and the vocals are... *shivers*. Just kidding, it's subjective, nothing against you if you enjoyed it. The show relies on overly dramatic tracks to create tension which fails miserably often. There is one pretty good song though, as I've mentioned above. Ending song is pretty good as well but it doesn't suit the clusterfuck that is Tokyo Ghoul Root A.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that most of the content is skipped, character development is dire as well. Especially for Kaneki, who, surprisingly, got the most in the manga. Here though, he is a depressed yet for some reason badass crybaby who does not know what to do with his life. It is very strange because Kaneki started going completely against his own morals and beliefs. I am trying to be as objective as possible but it's just a billion times worse than in the manga. That is not the case for all characters though, for instance best girl Touka-chan. She received much welcome additional development with Yoriko, which was quite wholesome, but that was at the expense of her doing anything meaningful. Hinami is cute as fuck, excuse my language. Hisoka's reincarnation a.k.a. Tsukiyama is hilarious and he's pretty much unchanged but he didn't do anything as well. It's too much to mention everything but a lot of characters didn't get to properly develop and shine. Also, the ending scene with the One Eyed Owl was really dragged on to the point of being simply tedious to me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed the ending of the manga much better because is was really traumatising (in a good way), tragic and unforeseen, I believe that the finale of Root A was quite good and satisfying in its own way. The unexpected return of \"Unravel\" played a huge part in it though. Unfortunately, it is simply not enough to outweigh all the flaws and bullshit of the season. (And LOL, Kaneki walking slowly yet faster than Touka sprinting was almost hilarious) With all that in mind, I am extremely disappointed as a massive manga fan. Truly wasted potential. Like I said, I don't mind altering the story but this version is just bad. \"Glassy Sky\" is a good OST that deserves much better.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say not to watch it as it may prove to be enjoyable to you but I for sure won't be rewatching this until pigs grow wings.",

It wasn't until I picked up the manga afterward that my suspicions were answered. And the one thing that could have fixed the major issues for this season was what it lacked... \r\nInsight to Kaneki's internal struggle. \r\nBoth in season 1 and onward in the manga, we're constantly exposed to Kaneki's thoughts. In addition to not having Kaneki speak thatmuch this season, we don't even hear his thoughts to at least clue us in on what's going on. Therefore, leaving us in the dark just as much as the characters in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the worst part is that it's not entirely unfixable. Even with the scenes that we were given, it wouldn't have been too hard make a few adjustments. \\n\r\nStep 1 - Extend some shots were Kaneki is just standing around.\\n\r\nStep 2 - Insert internal dialogue, maybe even mention things that were cut out & messed up continuity.\\n\\n\r\nBut as much as I (and many others) complain about the Root A, I can't say its bad for anime only viewers. It was a decent sequel to the first season, but not one that I enjoyed as much as I hoped. I hate to be THAT person, but... If you're confused or not as satisfied after watching Root A, I recommend just reading the manga. And if you liked it, still read because it will help fill any plot holes before starting :RE.",

            "content": "Every now and again, I'm thrust violently into a story that is so incompetent, so confusing, and so pointless that I can't imagine how on earth it got the green light in the first place. I'm afraid that's exactly where we are with Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA.\r\nSo, what is Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA? Well, it aired during the Winter 2015 season for 12 episodes, and was produced by Studio Pierrot. The interesting thing about \u221aA was that it actually wasn't connected to the Tokyo Ghoul manga at all. It was going to be a story that took Root from the manga (heh), but Pierrot decided they weregoing to write their own story for what happened after the finale of season 1. Well as it turned out, Studio Pierrot had no idea what they were doing and it showed. \\n\r\n-------\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I hated the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. I thought Kaneki was an idiot, I thought the tone fluctuated wildly, I thought Shuu ruined any scene he appeared in, and I thought the ending was a bunch of rushed, confusing nonsense. But as bad as that was, it doesn't even compare to how awful \u221aA is. This is just straight up one of the worst stories I've ever forced myself to sit through. But I'll be damned if I sat through this crap without getting to vent my frustration.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is about Kaneki joining the rival gang from down the block and doing some bad things. And that's it. That's the only thing that's tangible throughout the entirety of \u221aA. I have no idea why he joined Aogiri Tree because Kaneki's motivations are never explained. I have no idea what Aogiri Tree was doing because the writers and animators were too busy shoving as many fight scenes in as possible to make the story have a point. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the biggest problem here: the story of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is literally pointless. It doesn't have any meaning and it doesn't explain ANYTHING to the viewer. That would be fine if the animation or fight scenes were great, but those were terrible too! I just don't understand why Studio Pierrot decided to make their own spin-off separate from the manga if they had no idea what they were doing. Oh, and the script is awful, too. It reads like a grade school play.\\n\\n\r\nStory/writing gets a 1/10.\\n\r\n-------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the fight scenes, they're visually an eyesore just like the rest of Root A. The character designs and the look of things aren't bad, but it's clear early on that the budget for this show was pretty tight, as many of the early fight scenes are poorly animated to the point of weeping hilarity. As for the backgrounds, well, who cares? There's nothing interesting in the background throughout the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation gets a 3/10.\\n\r\n--------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is probably the best part of the show, and it's honestly still awful. I know people like the opening and ending songs, but if they don't match the tone of the show or the narrative aren't they at odds with everything going on? Given that the show has no overall message or point, the fact that they banked on these hyper-emotional tracks feels very pretentious. This becomes a big problem if you're paying attention to the music placement, as for some reason the director chose to continuously place unfitting emotional ballads over certain scenes, which completely and utterly fails. There's no build up and there's no characterization at all, so placing emotional songs over scenes where you didn't lead up to anything makes the entire soundtrack feel hollow. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about it is that if the writing was better, those songs could probably convey some powerful emotions. But as it is, the soundtrack was largely pointless because it didn't add anything and was only there for the sake of being there. Also, the sound effects were terrible too. Voice acting was passable, if unimpressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3/10.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, does it matter? It's not like the story bothered to characterize any of the ones that were interesting. Most of the characters existed purely for the sake of existing. Juuzou Suzuya was the most annoying character in the entire show, so naturally he got tons of screen time, while the petty pair of Seidou Takizawa and Akira Mado also got quite a bit of characterization while somehow never becoming interesting or likeable. \\n\\n\r\nMore importantly though, given that for all intents and purposes Kaneki and Touka are basically the main characters, they should probably be given a lot of development here, with their actions and motivations clear. Not so at all, I'm afraid. Kaneki spends the entire show mindlessly running around doing whatever for Aogiri Tree, and we NEVER, NOT ONCE, know why he chooses to join them. It is never explained. We as an audience have no idea what he wants or why he joins them. His motivations are a mystery and he has no character, so they failed with him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Touka, she doesn't really do anything. She was my favorite character in the first season (still didn't really like her that much), and here she's a total no-show. She mostly just gets slapped around and mopes around looking for Kaneki. As for what she sees in him, that's anyone's guess! She has some light characterization, but it's mostly there to make sure she gets enough screen time to justify her main character status. So as far as I'm concerned, they failed to do anything with either of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, Character gets a 1/10.\\n\r\n--------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI refuse to grade for enjoyment. Enjoyment is entirely subjective, so grading a product via an objective score is contradictory and stupid.  Instead, I will substitute it with this:\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nWhy You Should Watch:\\n\\n\r\nYou shouldn't. There is no reason anyone should watch this unless you're a hardcore Tokyo Ghoul fan and want to see it just because it has Tokyo Ghoul in the title. Even then, I'd still say watch the first episode and gauge for yourself whether or not you'll be able to sit through 12 episodes of this crap.\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThat's Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA. The story is pointless and makes no sense, the animation during fight scenes and critical moments is terrible (which is unacceptable due to the excessive number of fight sequences), the soundtrack is pretentious and rings hollow due to the empty narrative, and the characters are either missing or there for no reason. My final rating for Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is a 1/10. It has no redeeming factors and should be avoided at all costs.\\n",

Season 2 is worse. I did not see what is the difference between the Manga and Season 2 in terms of plot, being Season 2 was an alternate story. Season 2 showed us the same story but offers nothing new with the Aogiri tree. \r\nArt - theanimation in this season is not good either. Some episodes are animated badly which is recognizable in the fight scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound- One of the good things about this season is the sounds. The OST are good and It fits atmosphere and the scenario of the anime. The Ending is quite catchy and the OP is nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters are weak in terms of development especially the main character, mainly because the anime did not show what he is thinking.

            "content": "Ok, finally I finish watching Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA in one go. May contain spoilers so, read on with your own risk. \r\nOverall impression\r\nAfter finishing the season 1 and continuing the manga, I have huge expectation for season 2, hoping for some cool, badass fight to be animated.. but my expectation is crushed when I watched the first episode of this season. Apparently they decided to go on different route than the manga. I can imagine Ishida Sui saying 'Ok, since you guys ruined and butchered the first season I might as well create something really different from the existing story, an alternate universe maybe?' Soyeah, guys, if you are a manga reader, haven't watched this anime and considering to watch, I give you a warning already..\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nAs I write above, they decided to explore different route, how if Kaneki is in Aogiri instead? So yeah, more screen time of him in Aogiri and the Aogiri members.. However the story, while progressing, has so much hidden agendas. I mean, the characters never truly explain their motives of doing things. They also mixed the events and bits of the manga in, so it may cause either confusion or enlightment. \\n\r\nAnd WTF is that ending?? I was literally screaming and (almost) threw my phone I used to watch in utter disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nI understand they want to try something different, but well 12 episodes are definitely not helping. As a result, there are many plotholes, pacing issues and the story becomes very flat and not coherent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the main character Kaneki barely got any lines and screen time. He barely got development either.. except kakuja mode (manga readers, be ready to see him in action..).\\n\\n\r\nWe do have some development and explanation for CCG side like Akira, Amon, Suzuya, Takigawa (do I write his name properly? well I don't care lol) and Hide.The others are more or less the same with how they appears in season 1. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nOne good thing about season 2 is.. the art. I admit it is not yet high class like the really over the top Fate/Stay Night UBW or at least smoothly animated like No Game No Life or Free Eternal Summer and others series that was released in the same year, but some things are better compared to season 1. It has better color palette, making characters appear more contrast.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some noticeable improvements in terms of action scenes. The kagune (and also the quinques) rendition is now more realistic and artistic -- love those pulsating light veins, it makes the kagune so much alive now. Especially Ayato's kagune, Kaneki's kagune.. I like the use of camera angles and animation during fight scenes. Love Kaneki vs Amon scene. \\n\\n\r\nI quite like the opening scene also.. although not as wow as Unravel, it does have its own charm. It feels good to see watercolor painting-style animation. And the ending.. I'm always looking forward to it as the endings display original artworks yours truly by Ishida Sui. \\n\\n\r\nThe background is improving too. Especially in the later episodes. The number of details put in the texture, scenery, buildings, etc. are just impressive. Visual effects like explosion, especially fog, is better animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThey keep some tunes from season 1 OST. Feels good to hear the hauntingly epic Symphonie during badass scene and emotional Licht und Schatten during Kaneki's scenes. There's also a beautiful new song Glassy Sky that makes my heart cries. And a lot of new OST that in my opinion, is more epic than the anime story itself. The sound engineering and mastering is good, if you watch and plug your earphones, you can feel surround effect which is very pleasant.\\n\r\nLove the seiyuus acting as usual. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nWhile I'm definitely disappointed with how things goes on here, I still enjoy watching it. Some fight scenes are exciting and re-watch worthy. \\n\r\nI am quite glad for this season.. since I'm reading Tokyo Ghoul:re right now, some events that happened in this season does make sense or me, and may be a better bridge to :re compared to the original manga storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so that's my take on Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, love it or hate it it's entirely up to you. \\n",

There is plainly a huge story here which the producers pushed in front  of the \"let's wrap this thing up\" train, leaving Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA a quivering, dying mass of mangled characters and plot.  Some characters become complete anti-charismatic inversions of themselves,while others remain stupidly written in stone in spite of having multiple extra-strength character development hormone injections.  Plot arcs unfold, never to be seen again after their introductory episode.  A new key character is introduced in awed, hushed voices, and appears all of twice: once to establish his bad-assedness, andonce more to contribute to the utterly meaningless off-screen ending of this series and any potential sequels.  Actually, several new key characters receive this treatment.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up:  There is no explanation.  There is no closure.  There is no development.  There is no PLOT.  The producers needn't have bothered with this hot garbage, and the same goes for you.\\n",

I realised later that the anime story and the mang\u00e1 story don't match in some points.

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This is an honest review from an anime perspective and I won't compare it to the original source material as much as possible. No spoilers as well, enjoy and I hope I've lighten up some moods about this show.\r\nIntro/Continuation\r\nSo other reviews are too one sided and are about people crying over how they messed up an adaptation. So I'm gonna give an anime only perspective to this series and not fanboy over how the series sucks compared to the original. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A is the season 2 to the original Tokyo Ghoul regardless of the fancy \"Root A.\" It continues off onthe in medias res or height of action from where we left off in the first season. The ongoing battle between CCG and Aogiri Tree. We see Kaneki walk away from his epic confrontation with Jason and completely changed from how he was before. The story takes a turn when Kaneki makes a certain decision that changed the course of everything we understood about him and it surprised everyone (including the Manga readers to their initial ill content). The story goes on about Kaneki's inner struggle with humanity like from before, except that its been worse since his torture with Jason which leads to psychological side effects. We see him do actions, we know normally he wouldn't do and its a bundle of confusion on our part on his decisions. The story also gives a glimpse on how his behavior is affecting everyone around him so it goes into the story of some of the side characters. The weakness of the story however, is trying to patch things up with the previous season. The story strides away from the main interest (Kaneki) and goes on about everything else going around in society, mainly the CCG's perspective. Though the story poses a two unique perspectives, one being ghouls and one being CCG, we must remember its called TOKYO GHOUL, not TOKYO COMMISSION OF COUNTER GHOULS. Another plot hole in this series was the beginning when they introduced like 4 new characters, but didn't go into an detail of who they were or whether they were significant. Some of them didn't even make another appearance at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThe main reason people watch this series isn't just the idea of a world of ghouls, but the chronicle of Kaneki, the protagonist of the \"I did nothing Wrong Club.\" Seriously, he doesn't catch a single break. Since his incident at the end of last season, his whole character seemed to have changed. We see him do things we couldn't believe he would do from episode 1 as a shy bookworm. He's by far, the most dynamic character that I've ever known, enduring many hardships, you see how far transformed with not just his hair. We see him psychologically suffer from his previous experiences and how he struggles to keep his sanity making us have lots of sympathy for him like when he was tortured. The only issue with Kaneki however was that he barely had any dialogue or analysis during the first half of the series. His weak character development start was one of the issues I had with the series as a whole. We do see more development and insight on side characters though which was helpful since in the first season they showed characters we didn't care about and never showed them again until now. The whole Anteiku group is characterized heavily in this season which was a pro for me. Touka however was my favorite developing character in this season. You see her cope with the fact Kaneki's changed and try to reunite with him to like how it was before. You can call this friendship, I and many others call this the OTP or the ship to ride over tsunamis. I mean its pretty obvious and a tease for us fans. The CCG also get lots of decent screen time to show the opposite side of the coin with Amon and Akira. You see the pair have their moments and get a glimpse into their reason for fighting ghouls as well as their pasts. They synergize really well throughout the whole series from the light comedy to their own unique problems. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6/10\\n\r\nStudio Perriot was the studio that animated the 1st season and their back again with season 2. The animation quality for season 2 has greatly improved from season 1 by a lot. The only problems is every other episode has better quality. You can easily tell which episode they poured their money, time, and tears into while normal episodes with no action or meaning have below subpar animation. Being a large studio and infamous for many projects, I wished for a constant quality of animation throughout but since Perriot is known for Naruto series, I can't expect much. I just keep thinking to myself how amazing Tokyo Ghoul would look if animated by studio Ufotable (Known for Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night). Another piece of info which doesn't influence my score in any way, but worth noting was the censors. Censors didn't premiere for the first episode but later on began to appear, but that was due to the ISIS issue with Japan with the tragic beheading of a reporter. In the blu-rays they will be gone like it was with season 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound for Tokyo Ghoul has changed from the 1st to 2nd season. I felt the opening song was fair, but not up to par with \"Unravel,\" from the previous season and many fans agree, but I don't absolutely hate it. The lyrics characterizes and symbolizes Kaneki perfectly, it just the animation of the opening I found bland. The 2nd season focused on many quality pieces of background music which I found really well composed, but that's coming from a guy that doesn't play any instruments. I would say the background songs were the best and were very well executed. The strongest point I would argue, would be the OST of this season and worthy of being downloaded.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series from the ground up, regardless of whether people thought the adaptation wasn't up to expectations. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, ITS AN ANIME ORIGINAL STORYLINE and not directly from the source material. Your complaints should go to the director of the first season for moving plot arcs causing this season to have issues patching things up. I thought The characters were very interesting and the atmosphere was immersive. The story line was created by Ishida Sui (Author of the manga) himself and gave us a great \"what if\" perspective from the original manga. I recommend people wait for the Blu-rays to release if you haven't watched it yet. I can't wait for the OVA on Tokyo Ghoul Jack that's coming out later this year.

            "content": "Toko Ghoul Root A... Where shall I start from?\r\nMost people didn't get the Root A analogy: A is for Aogiri Tree, the antagonists and Tree have roots, so it wouldn't take you many neurones to guess the rest.\r\nNow, as a fan who has read the manga, I must judge this animation.\r\nRoot A is an insensitive piece of trash. If you have read the manga and are planning to watch this anime, I would advice you to back off at this point cuz you're going to hurt yourself. Everything seems wrong since the first episode, as one of the gorest moment of the story, the 103bones broken bit is removed. Then what else... ah yeah, the fights. The fights were very awkward to watch, a character could die in the middle of them you wouldn't give a damn. I am here talking about those of the first 7 episodes, I will mention the rest later on. Some events were omitted from the manga whereas most of the plot was modified, that's probably where people would start saying that it is an original piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry guys but it's not because something is original that it must make sense. Tokyo Ghoul as a story itself has 2 main strengths: The goreness of the masterpiece and its twisted plot. As many of you probably already know, TG is one of the worst censored anime of all 2014-2015, thus, removing already the goreness of the story. What about the twisted plot? Well, 22 episodes in total I believe is sure not enough to expose such a great story, and this second season will just be like some fighting game anime, just set the arena and music then launch the fights. EVERYTHING IN THIS SEASON SEEMS OFF, I GUARANTEE.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise: The OST are great, way better than the first one but WTF THEY REMOVED OSHIETE TO PUT ON \"The prostitute start fire\". This is surely one of the biggest downsides of the season for people who liked the music of the first season cuz singing an opening song is surely one of the best ways to start watching an anime. The ending song is quite catchy and the art is marvellous, I would even advise you guys to search on youtube \"amazarashi kisetsu wa tsugitsugi shindeiyuku\" to see the PV and how well the video recreated the world of TG even better than the anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the anime (Attack on Anteiku), that started well, very close to the manga and it rised our spirits cuz we all wanted to see this goreness and sadness that is well communicated in the manga. This was another letdown by Pierrot, they battles were as empty as usual, the hype you build up on seeing Arima arriving fades away within 3 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the last episode? Oshiete was finally back but that ending... Pierrot must confess their sins, if I wanna see a guy walking for 7 mins with music in the background, then I'll go to the park and put some earphones on. Seriously, the middle of the episode was great, the rest was utter crap.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal words? The only good episode imo was the one where the old man fights, you get a sadly excited of seeing him in action as we all know that he's the #1 ennemy of the CCG. Please Pierrot, don't make another season, TG already suffered enough",

Tokyo Ghouls manga had an amazing turn out that gave you a thrill ride of emotions before its end. While the first anime adaptation disappointed me with how the chopped up the series and skipped through it, i was still glad they didnt ignore the best scenes in the series (like the ending) however this series did just that. Ill just break it down a bit why i disliked this adaptation/ sequel\r\nStory:\r\nMy got how they butchered it, they decided to make an alternate series but all they did was tellthe same story but skip a bunch of important details and cool scene for nothing. This series is pretty much banking on the \"fact\" that you have already read the manga (cause they skip so much info that you wouldnt understand many things about this series with out reading the manga). Plus while there are a lot more story issues the worst thing they did was to skip some of the BEST scenes that made the manga popular....yea.... such as the \"103 bones\" scene\" and the freaken crazy end scene/fight. yea\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWow man how they took away soo much development. Lets mainly talk about Kaneki the lead. The best thing about him in the manga was his struggle and tragedies and determination, however here they just make him SUPER Emo and dont explain or show why he does anything he does. He just walks around sad or crazy all the time when you actually felt his pain and struggles in the manga. The other characters have little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell at least you can look forward to animation right?....huh...no? yea No. The animation is like a line graph to use a mediphor it just goes up and down many episodes. There are a lot of action scenes that had horrible animation until only a key scene.\\n\\n\r\nSo yea this pretty much says why i didnt care for this sequel at all and i hope really bad that they reboot this series later on with the episodes and manga faithfulness it deserves. And hopefully a better studio.\\n\r\nArt:",

            "content": "While I could make this review spoiler-free, it would not properly encompass my thoughts on this show. However, respecting the users who wish to see this review as a recommendation, here's a spoiler free introduction:\r\nTokyo Ghoul root A is a sequel that primarily focuses on the character of Kaneki Ken, despite not giving him as much screen time as the first season. The show presents a multitude of side character arcs to compliment Kaneki's story, but at its core, is primarily about the naive conceit within Kaneki. The side character arcs are these tight short narratives that establish clear ideologies, and motives for a varietyof ghouls and humans belonging to differing factions. These stories are juxtaposed against the ambiguous, and confused narrative of Kaneki Ken in order to enhance his state of moral quandary, as someone stuck in between all the various ideologies and factions.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2  of Tokyo ghoul is perfect at displaying the morally grey conflict within kaneki, to the point that it has him make emotionally irrational, but utilitarian decisions that he ends up regretting. I find beauty in the way his utilitarian actions (joining a certain group. No spoils) actually lead him down the path of insane irrationality, which he finally comes to terms with at the end. The end being this incomplete anti-climax is perfect because it presents us with Ken eternally walking forward into the future in solitude, only with the lifeless presence of Hide being carried with him. The conceit of kaneki, that makes him a beautifully flawed individual is that he attempts using utilitarian means to satisfy more personal, less rational desires, and this leads to him going down a completely separate path of insanity that takes him away from his irrationality.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER PORTION AHEAD\\n\\n\r\nA more comprehensive look at Kaneki as a character, with elaboration on his motivations that are repeatedly deemed contrived, unclear, or \"stupid\" :\\n\\n\r\nKaneki spent the entire first season in this emotionally vulnerable, scared, and confused state. He is someone who always identified as a human being, grew up as a human being, and was always taught that Ghouls are vile predators who are the enemy. After becoming half ghoul, Kaneki is terrified. However, he eventually broadens his perspective on the matter, and is able to empathise with ghouls, forming a strong bond with one of the ghouls being Touka. Immediately after this, he is kidnapped and tortured by an insane nihilistic ghoul, who cannot evoke any empathy, and represents this embodiment of insanity and evil. I don't know about the manga, but in Root A, Rize takes the form of a mental manifestation of the inherent dormant ability within Kaneki due to the transplant. She represents the part of him that he is too afraid to access earlier, and after facing suicidal thoughts, moral dilemmas, and physical torture that numbs him to his previously controlling superficial emotions, he decides to break his inaction and access the dormant Rize within him. The dichotomy between ghouls and humans, good and evil, becomes blurry with the only clarity being this desire to protect the people he loves, while realising that this dormant Rize within him that he has tapped into is unstable. The \"strength\" he wishes to attain is not simply a quantifiable physical growth in power, but the strength to be able to contain the dormant unstable power within him.\\n\r\nThis state of mind  allows him to draw the conclusions that they means of controlling this unstable power is by utilising it in battle, hence he joins the Aogiri tree. This is a utilitarian mindset that develops within him, with him viewing this decision as something rational, not driven by the superficial emotions that used to control him. The conceit of the situation is that the rationality of the decision is not a product of rational evaluation but instead an illusory opposite of what his former self would do. Kaneki thought his former self was irrational and driven by emotions, and thinks the opposite of that is rationality; however, he fails to realise that his actions are another extreme that will only enhance the irrationality within him. \\n\\n\r\nThis flawed decision making is consequential with Kaneki's attempts at becoming \"stronger\", only leading to his instability being enhanced. I think the show is able to convey this conceit that is a product of a morally greying torture quite well. The show does not give Kaneki's internal struggle an overblown amount of screen time in order to create the impact of the illusory rationalism within Kaneki on the viewer, leading to the viewer seeing Kaneki as someone who has gone past his emotionally vulnerable state, as the show effectively shows us only glimpses of Kaneki's transformation to hold up this illusion until the prison break scene which breaks away from this established illusion, both for Kaneki and the viewer. This brief moment of distress effectively sets up the conclusion with Kaneki carrying Hide walking this path of solitude, holding on to the lifeless presence of the only clarity within him.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of elaboration on internal conflict, and the lack of an overblown display of insanity within Kaneki is used effectively to keep the essence of Kaneki's conceit intact, hiding the gradual growth of insanity to create impactful bursts of change in the form of the Kakuja in order shed light on the gaping holes within his illusory rationale.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is structured quite unconventionally as I do not like using the categorical system of scoring provided by MAL. However, I will share some brief thoughts on the elements in this anime outside the themes and main character.\\n\\n\r\nVisual quality is quite consistent in line with the previous season; additionally, action sequences are shown in a frantic, and energetic manner that continually switches to different action premises occurring simultaneously to convey the chaotic nature of each clash between different factions. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not very diverse with music choice, music is used effectively to enhance the overall experience of the show. Although, a more conservative usage of music might have aided in the authenticity of some scenes. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul root A is a beautifully crafted conclusion to Kaneki Ken as a character, and Tokyo Ghoul as a series. It is a tragic tale of toil and folly, ambiguously structured in a manner that makes the melancholic defeat of Kaneki at the end of the narrative endaearing, and eventful despite feeling like an anti-climax. \\n\\n\r\nManga readers might object to some of my readings of elements of this show, but I wish to assess this as a standalone work of animation whose quality is not dependent on adherence to elements of the source material. \\n\\n\r\n10/10",

The escalation of a thirst for blood into a hunger for human flesh made all the \u2018woe is me/what have I become/we are not like you humans\u2019 thing a whole lot more convincing than it in your standard vampire tale. I felt sorry for the protagonist the whole way through, and he really came across perfectly as a genuinely nice and pleasant guy who really did not deserve all of the horriblethings that happened to him. A rare example of a mild-mannered everyman who actually seemed like a person with interests and feelings rather than a robotic audience surrogate. The first season had horror, heart and humour (the gourmet was fantastic, but then Mamoru Miyano is great in everything) in well-balanced proportions, and I thought the torture sequence in the final episode was one of the most horrifyingly gripping things I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSeason two was a bitter goddamned disappointment to say the least. Wasted potential is a real pet peeve of mine and this ended up being a prime example. I was totally willing to buy into Kaneki moving out of the main character slot into a questionable anti-hero/anti-villain/villain role after the end of the first season, and I was really looking forward to exploring the reasons for him making that choice. \u2026but we didn\u2019t get to explore anything. From a relatively tight focus on Kaneki and the coffee shop in S1, we get an incredibly fractured narrative that constantly asks new questions and provides nothing in the way of answers. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus (such as it is) becomes the Ghoul Investigators; a really interesting move if it had been done well, but it\u2019s all built around characters reacting to and dealing with the death of Mado in S1. I can see what they were going for there, but even taking somewhat justified fantasy racism into account, that character\u2019s last on-screen act was taking sadistic pleasure in tormenting a little girl with the weaponised corpses of her mother and father whom he had previously executed. \\n\\n\r\nI mean come on. I don't care how many kittens he rescued while he was off-duty, you don't come back from that. \\n\\n\r\nThe constant harping on about how wonderful Mado was becomes a critical flaw that undermines almost everything that goes on at the Ghoul Investigator HQ. Add to that some very flimsy cahracterisation, and I just couldn\u2019t work out why I was supposed to care about any of those people.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, at least the Ghoul Investigator plot mostly made sense. We see the ghoul faction that Kaneki joined rescue a crazy ghoul from an armoured transport. This guy is important for... Something? Then they engage in a costly but determined battle at a high-security ghoul prison to rescue some guy from the basement. He\u2019s very powerful, but that\u2019s pretty much all we know about him - he escapes (I think?) and then we never see him again, and nobody mentions him afterwards either. \u2026not that anyone in that faction really does much talking. A pair of twins that previously popped up in the background of certain key scenes get a lot of screen time during the same battle. They have powers that are in some way related to Kaneki and are part of a fourth independent faction? \u2026I think? Honestly I have absolutely no idea, because that doesn\u2019t have any sort of explanation either.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is also bizarrely bloodless. Two major battles take place involving at least a half dozen heroic sacrifices, but only one named character of relatively minor significance is actually confirmed as dead. This was particularly laughable after the final battle, when a load of people (even one who had the classic \u2018reach out to the hand of your lost love descending from the heavens scene!) turn up clinging to life in the most bizarrely unceremonious ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not a manga reader in this case, but I\u2019m told that S2 claims to be telling a different story that\u2019s distinct from the source material. Whatever the reality is there, the whole thing stinks of \u2018dodgy adaptation from half-finished source material\u2019. The series of miraculous survivals of main characters can only be bet-hedging over who is going to become important later in the Manga.\\n\\n\r\nI guess some of the animation is quite nice though.",

            "content": "First and foremost DO NOT WATCH IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING READING THE MANGA. DON'T DO IT. Seriously there are so many spoilers and it's much better presented in the manga. Another note is that Tokyo Ghoul has a bad anime adaptation. The series itself as a stand alone is fine, pretty run-of-the-mill if you ask me but the manga is honestly so much better and it's worth it if you still gave the manga a chance even after watching the anime and thinking that it sucks.\r\nOk to start of this review, keep in mind that the second season diverges from the manga so there are somechanges here and there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nIshida Sui wrote the plot himself, but considering the fact that he's still continuing the manga, i can imagine that he didn't have too much time to dedicate to this underwhelming adaptation. I'm just not feeling this alternative plot. Everything is too fast paced, or not fast enough and when you think something is about to happen, it doesn't. Honestly but what even was to point of having him join Aogiri if nothing really changed from the manga? They should've just announced to do a 24 episode 2nd season and just adapt the manga. THEY REALLY SHOULD'VE JUST DONE THAT INSTEAD.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style is consistent from the last season and continues to be pretty good. However the same censoring issue is still VERY PRESENT. I mean they blur out some very tame moments to the point where it was really unnecessary. Also the fight scenes are okay at best, but they're short and anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI just really like the soundtrack. Obviously there are new songs and such, but these songs just add a certain grace and atmosphere. Honestly the music is such a waste because the rest of the show can't seem to keep up with the amazing songs that are being played. I feel like the only parts of the show that have any type of atmosphere would be the music. Not even the visuals do much to make you feel empathetic or invested.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nPathetic. Where did all the characterisation go? If you've read the manga, you would see my disappointment in every single character so much. Even the 1st season did a much better job than this. Kaneki is such a jackass that i don't even recognise him sometimes. He went under such immense psychological and physical torture, nearly going insane from the pain, just to become a stone brick like this? The problem began with trying to condense 70/80 chapters into 12 episodes but that's no excuse to have him lacking in so many fundamental areas where the manga just excels and excels even further. For instance, his own resolution. He honestly did not just go through hell to become the pathetic wimpy shit he is here. Literally he gets beaten once then decides that he's just not strong enough... again. There wasn't even any progress montages of his training at all, he just suddenly knew martial arts and battle experience despite rejecting the very notion of fighting just 1 arc ago.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nDisappointment. So much disappointment and dissatisfaction. I'll be blunt and say that this 2nd adaptation had a fighting chance to be one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen. As mush as i love the manga, it's honestly sad that such a great story has a crappy 2nd season. There are no tense scenes in this season at all and honestly anyone who actually likes Tokyo Ghoul wont even consider this to be an adaptation. This \"sequel\" is just a bad decision and will turn off any anime fans that just want a continuation of the 1st season. For anyone who's really invested in the story, i highly suggest reading the manga. Honestly you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much better the story and characters are. The Kaneki in the anime and the Kaneki in the manga are two VERY DIFFERENT people.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's crap and don't watch it. Just read the manga and we can all pretend that this never happened. Lets just wait 10-20 years for another 50 episode adaptation by someone who's actually read Tokyo Ghoul.",

            "content": "Just finished watching season 1 and 2. To begin with the positive, I think the concept was good. \r\nNow for the negative. One thing I must say, is that I felt like there could have been so much more to the story overall. We got to know little if nothing about most of the supporting characters. I myself am a big fan of supporting character, as I believe they bring so much more depth to the story as a whole. I would have loved to seen a lot more of the stories behind the supporting characters as of where they came from, what they hadbeen through, etc. We got maybe a second or two from when Yoshimura met Koma and Kaya as how they were in the past. That was it.  To be fair we got to know some of Touka's past and also Nishikis. But what about Itori and Renji and what is up with Eto?? I know, many of you who read the manga, probably know more than I do about the story, as many details tends to be left out the anime. I just don't see the point of havin' so many exciting supporting characters, which you get to know nothing of. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up. I liked the overall concept / story; I would have loved to see a lot more background story and character development (more episodes!) Also it was not very friendly towards non-manga readers, as I had to read through a lot of pages afterwards to get the slightest idea of what happened in the end. The story is probably a 100 times better in the manga, but if I have to rate the anime as a standalone product, without the manga to back up the story and to help us understand what happens, , I must say it\u2019s a very poorly executed anime. \\n",

I loved the art of this season too and the sound was very good, in particular the ending, i found it nice to listen. I really enjoyed it in the last minutes of episode 12, that scene in my opinion compensated a little for the lack of development of the plot. I suppose that the author wanted to leave a lot of things in mystery and let usfigure it out or fill the blank by ourselves but something just need to be explained a little more in some way. Im not gonna  lie, i did enjoy the series, the first couple episodes were exactly what i was expecting but passing the mid point it started to let me down a bit. I am always willing to tolerate certain things in a series if the concept is new and interesting enough and while Root A still is a new concept, it got less interesting. Im hoping there is a season 3 that evens things out. The story was not the best, while i didn't know what was going to happen next and got really nice surprises, sometimes i didn't felt compelled to know why things happened the way they did, i felt disappointed, i was really hoping this season to be much better than the previous one.",

            "content": "Fist of all, I wanted to mention a that I have not read the manga, so I will not try to compare the two. This might explain my rating that is higher than the majority of the other reviews out there. \r\nSo, as an anime only watcher ot Tokyo Ghou, what did I think of it? I tought it was intriguing, creative, full of emotions but also sometimes confusiong. Here are some more details.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nRoot A picks up from where the first season started, but I think it's important to mention that this new season is not an adaptation of the manga, but more likean alternative setting. A nice idea at first perhaps, but I think it was done way too fast. The script had a lot of plot holes and I could tell important parts were skipped even witthout reading the manga. I feel like a lot of things were not explained well. For exemple, at some point CCG investigators go to some kind of prison to fight ghouls, but I never really understood why or how these fights helped them advance their work. This is a good exemple of how the whole story is handled. I feel like the story was too complex for a 12 episodes anime and would have benifited a lot more of a 24 episodes run.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the way some parts of the story were handled was quite nice. Studio Pierrot makes brilliant usage of silences. Silences are often overlooked or just non-existent in action anime but they can add so much more to a scene. I feel lile the silences in Root A added good intensity to more simple scenes, making them feel more special and emotionnal. However, in more action packed scenes it didn't work out that well. For example, there is this intense scene where a character gets injured and the watched doesn't know if he's going to make it, and boom, we change to another scene with different characters. I feel like the changes from scene to scene were often too fast, which made some important events seem easily forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is not clear enough and looses the watcher easily. It feels like Studio Pierrot wanted to make this a slow paced show, which would have worked great to build tings up, but it just can't work for a 12 episodes anime. So what you get are really good just talking and building things up scenes but extremely rushed and all over the place action scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is just there with anime normal budget anime of 2010's. It's nothing outstanding, especially for the fight scenes. Most of them are covered with smoke (probably to cut on budget costs), which make them less interesting. Some cuts were also re-used a lot, like someone making coffee or past scenes from season 1. The artstyle is very nice. I like the character designs a lot and how they don't all have the same face shape. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite part of the art were the opening and endings. I thing the opening is just brilliant. Some say it's lazy, but to me it's super creative. It expresses the overal melancholic tone of the show perfectly. The ending was great too. I liked how it had different images for each episode. The drawings were really beautiful, in a watercolour style.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is definetly the best part of Tokyo Ghoul Root A. The amazing soundtrack caught my attention right away. The music is very fitting to the show and helps to showcase the emotions of it. I liked the overall style of the music, that I would describe as a mix of soft rock and ballads. As you would say in French, it sounds like a ''cri du coeur''. It's particularly emotive. I think the usage of a lot of different instruments and the soft rock vibes were simply brilliant. I also liked the fact that most songs are accompagned by singing, not just music, which is quite rare in anime. Finally, I liked how different it felt to most soundtracks. For example, while you would expect intense rock music with lots of energy in action scenes, here more down to heart songs were used and it worked perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, it was great. Each voice actor does an amazing job at sharing the character's emotions to the viewers, in a never over the top way. Nothing bad to say there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nI feel like characters are really hits and misses. First, I think it's important to mention that the majority of the main and supporting characters get some attention. For most of them it's by telling their backstories and for some it's with development. Also, a lot of characters are really unique with different personnality traits, which make them so much more interesting. Oh, and if you lik fucked up characters, you'll love them all. Let's just say that I like when characters are not just there to be there, and this show satisfies this very well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a down side to it. First is the way some events are brought. For example, you will have this buildup of a character's personnality. You will learn more about their pasts and why they act the way they do. Then all of a sudden, something bad happens to them. As a viewer, you'd feel attached to the character and thus touched by the sad event. But, there is one thing that made me feel pretty much nothing for some characters. It was the fact that everything happens so fast that you don't really get to feel and process the events properly, so you just easily get over sad events, even going as far as not caring for character deaths. I think it could have been great, but the fact that a lot of things were rushed just made me care for a character at first and then forget about them on the next scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs for our main character, Kaneki, I think he gets decent developement in this season. He doesn't get all that much screen time, but we still really see and feel that he his completely lost inside. On the other hand, some of his actions are left unexplained and it's hard for the viewer to connect with him when we can't understand why he acts certain ways. Overall, Kaneki seems like an amazing character, but he probably didn't get the treatment he deserved in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, characters that got developement were great, but it felt like all this built up was butchered in the last few episodes. Some character were left not developped enough, which is a sad thing, because most of them were interesting. Once again, this anime would have benefited in having more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 9/10:\\n\r\nBesides the fact that I were lost by the story a lot of times, I really enjoyed the show. I cared for a majority of the characters. I felt Kaneki's sorrow, which made me want him to finally find his way. Sometimes I smiled, sometimes I cied. The soundtrack made the experience just so much better, it really made me enjoy the show a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating and final toughts 8/10:\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A is not a bad show. To me, it's even better than season 1, but only for some points. The way some scenes were handled with the silences for example was just brilliant. In the end, there was just this one problem that messed everything: the 12 episodes run. I feel like Tokyo Goul could easily be the kind of show to go the Hunter x Hunter way. In HxH, some important events would happen in maybe just a few hours in real life, but are stretched out for 10-15 episodes, which makes it so much more interesting for the viewer because you can get a better grip of what's going on for each character in their actions but also inside their heads. Without stretching things this much, Tokyo Ghoul could have easily have been a 38 episodes show. It's just a shame it didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommand it anyways, but for anime only watchers. If you want to read the manga, I'd suggest you do it after watching the anime so you don't ruin your experience. \\n\\n\\n",

More silence, almost like mourning.  It was good though.  Characters are trying to discover themselves, trying to cope with some really nasty stuff.  It was good.  Close to the end, it got intense and good, like the first season.  It ended really weird, but thats ok by me . . .  for now.   If thats the actual end I will be pissed.

For those who've read the manga- this has plenty of differences, so is worth a watch anyway. For those who haven't, why aren't you watching it right now? It holds up as an anime series, even though it was nowhere near to the level of the manga.\r\nI was thinking that it was good.

            "content": "Root A- Absolutely laudable effort from the makers to actually have the guts to deviate from the \"Manga\" after all the hype that the first season created.\r\nThis review comes from a guy who hasn't read the \"Manga\" but has a fair knowledge of how it plays out. \r\nAs biased as it may sound I actually feel that the Anime chronology made much more sense than the manga and I really love the way that the makers had the balls to deviate from the \"Manga\" which is absolutely epic according to so many of it's loyal fans.\r\nI leave judging the review upto you guys.\r\nSTORY- 8/10 Lovedthe plot right from the get-go, Episode 1 itself made such a huge impact and made much more sense to me than the manga. Although a little too rushed and with evident plot holes it was enough for me to be hooked and wanting.\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK- 9/10 \"Unravel\" by TK was a pretty awesome opening and was always going be difficult to match, but 'Mun\u014d by Osterreich tends to grow on you the more you listen to it and makes a lot of sense lyrically[ most don't recognize it] The songs that play throughout the series perfectly depict the emotions on show. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 8/10 This is probably something in which the manga trumps  the anime by a long distance or so i've heard. Although I'm totally ineligible to debate whether that's true or not I would still say that Kaneki is not given adequate screen time and his character development all throughout the anime feels rushed and doesn't do justice to what he actually deserved, it could've been done in a much better fashion. Leaving that aside the other characters are portrayed extremely well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nART-9/10 Excellent Animation I must say. Although I still feel that censorship is extremely stupid to begin with. The kagune's looked great and the visuals never left me disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 8/10 Never lacked on the enjoyment factor for me although the end of the series left me disappointed to an extent. Wont say much more about the end of the series and how and why it leaves you disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 8/10 Considering all the loopholes and flaws that Root A possessed it still manages to be good in its own way. Good but not great I must say, could've been great. \"Modest\" job done by Pierrot I must say in something that doesn't stay true to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION- A good watch for people who haven't read the manga and I suggest that for those who haven't watched it yet please watch the anime before you read the manga, watch it as something \"original\" in itself.",

            "content": "I don't write reviews for a lot of recent anime but I felt like Tokyo ghoul need it. Because of the big success that the first season had it was inevitable not to take a second one. What made this anime look even more interesting was the announcement that the creator of the manga Sui Ishida made about the second anime season to take a different rout from the manga. Hence the name Root A. The story tells the happenings of the manga from a different point of view with Kaneki joining the Aogiri side than the Anteiku's. With that really interesting plot twist thingswere looking really bright for the non-manga readers like me but also for the manga readers too because they would see a different story with the touch of Ishida in it. But unfortunately things didn't go as good as everybody was expecting it to be.Things started really interesting with two awesome first  UNCENSORED episodes and then... the downfall started. First of all unlike what Sui Ishida said things are not different from the manga. Apart from the happening with Kaneki and maybe the last episode everything else is exactly the same as the manga. I didn't have a problem with it because as I said I don't read Tokyo Ghoul's manga but I can understand the frustration that the manga readers felt. The problems don't end here though. This season has a really serious problem because it has to adapt at least 80 remaining chapters into 12 episodes. The first season managed it well enough I have to say but this one was a real failure. A lot of things are opening up right from the first episode but they never close or nobody deals with them. The results are to end without having any real meaning or having answered a lot of our questions. But if I have to give them something that would be the last episode which from an artistic side was a masterpiece and it gave a good ending to an overall unsatisfying anime.\\n\r\nAnother huge minus that ''Tokyo Ghou Root Al'' had was the animation. Even though ''Studio Pierrot'' is not the best anime studio in Japan it can do some pretty decent animation sometimes. And while the first and the second along with the last episode had really good animation and aesthetics the rest of the episodes were really average. Also after episode 5 we have another one of the anime plagues. Censorship. Yeah it returns and while is less annoying than the first season it still hurts your eyes and makes you loose all of the interesting parts and fights.\\n\r\nBefore moving to the character section I will say first of all about the sound because especially for this anime it deserves at least one paragraph. I put a 9 mainly because I want to piss off all those fan boys/girls who were bitching about the new opening. They were all saying that it was shit compared to ''Unravel'' and while a big fun of the first opening myself, I have to say that this opening was better than ''Unravel''. With it's really simple (and not stolen from another anime...yeah I'm looking at you ''Unravel'') visuals, it brings us Kaneki's character development and with it's somehow twisted lyrics it unravels (get it? XD) the fucked up world that we are seeing. Even better was the ending. Man that song was a masterpiece. In terms of voice acting every single one of the voice actors did their job really good but the one who stood out was the new in the voice acting business Natsuki Hanae as the tragic protagonist Ken Kaneki. He captures Kaneki's character so amazing that you are forgetting you are seeing a character made from pixels. This  voice actor i going to be the next big thing I'm sure.\\n\r\nAnd now we move to the character section. The results were really disappointing. Tokyo Ghoul is a character-driven anime so you expect some amazing character development. And here is the surprise. Almost none of the characters are developed to the degree you are expecting. With the only exception of Amon and Akira all the others are staying exactly the same from the start till the end. Kaneki who is the supposedly main character disappears suddenly without any meaning from the story with sudden appearances in every single episodes and then near the end he remembers that he is the main character and he returns more undeveloped and from Kirito's sword from SAO. And when you finally reach a point when you say that something good is going to be with his character the anime just ends.\\n\r\nSo overall Tokyo Ghoul Root A  was surely a disappointment as an anime series especially with the awesomeness that the previews season delivered to us. It starts off really promising but then throws the plot out off the window and just do whatever it wants trying to built all this dramatic atmosphere and forgetting to make a good story. I couldn't say that I enjoyed it as much as the first season and I can't say that is a true continuation of it's successor. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either. Watch it only if you are not feeling like reading the manga like I do and you want an ending of this anime.",

            "content": "Well. It's Tokyo Ghoul content, right? \r\nA large part of this fan base is super adamant about the manga being infinitely better than the anime. Personally I feel Root A kinda did that statement a bit of justice.\r\nSeason one, cut off at a decent point leaving Root A, with a good direction to go to be a phenomenal conclusion (Barring that the \":re\" manga sequel doesn't get an anime adaptation), but it kinda did it's own thing. Which in all rights is fine to do, but it left more questions unanswered than answered, and kinda left a sour taste in my mouth.\r\nI'm a part ofthe population that likes it more when an anime stays strict to the manga instead of doing it's own thing. So overall I'd give Root A, a 7/10 just because the art was pretty to look at, and the music was decent. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you're just looking for Tokyo Ghoul content, Root A is a good way to go. But if you're like me and like series staying stricter to the manga, this is a series where you should probably just read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: If you don't want to read the entirety of the manga after watching season one, chapter 49 isn't a bad place to start. That chapter is right around where stuff starts to get ominous at Anteiku before Kaneki gets kidnapped by Aogiri.",

He just came out of nowhere and kicked the owl's ass and on top of that he has no character development.In the finale he stood opposite to kaneki and was over? What the heck? This series really makes no sense. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  - Only some scratch scenes were enjoyable.Nothing wide in scale.Some fights like Arima and Owl , Kaneki vs Shinohara and some emotional scenes.Just mediocre.7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Such a flaw and overrated anime.Nothing in special atleast the last episode.I'm on 37th chapter of Tokyo Ghoul hope it is better than the anime.Average enjoyment.This show had lots of potential but the studio fucked up.I hope it gets a season 3 or even a REBOOT would be soooo goood.

A low budget adaptation that actually shows it by having 12 episodes which wasn't enough to get the story properly or at least decently told, the terrible art style and animation that made me cringe during the 4th and 5th episodes which was basically 50% of the fights in the season, so much filler just so studio pierrot could save money for the episode 10 and11 which i will admit were the only good thing that pierrot did right and last but certainly not least, they forgot who the main character was by showing very little of him in the first 4 episodes and the giving everyone at the ccg more character development over the more important characters which was in fact filler. The story makes no sense at all considering one day aogiri tree raids cochlea and the next Kaneki shows up at the Anteku for no apparent reason other that to chat with Yoshimura, the story was not progressed properly, they just skipped right through everything from filler to action. Honestly i had high hopes for this season, but the censorship, the low budget, the amount of filler and the lack of actual story completely destroyed them. The real tragedy was giving pierrot the rights to animate tokyo ghoul because they were terrible to this series,  fingers crossed for tokyo ghoul brotherhood\\n\\n\r\nStory : 3\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter : 5 \\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5\\n\r\nOverall : 5",

Yeah the op was trash but the ost is the best i have ever heard and probably ever will. Glassy sky, Licht und schatten, on my own its so good that it makes the show 10 times better.

            "content": "I will state this before writing the review but Tokyo Ghoul is my favorite manga while season 1 of the anime is one of my favorites. I feel sad to see season two of the anime be a butchery of the Manga. If I did not read the Manga I would of probably given this show a nine or a ten since I would not have known it could have been adapted a lot better. Overall it felt really rushed just to get to this one critical point that was a battle that was done pretty well.  If you have not read the Mangayou would probably really like Root A and give it a lot of praise but if you have read the Manga you would think differently. If you are someone who likes Root A by the end please read the Manga and be blown away because it will answer a lot of your questions after watching this.    \\n\\n\r\nAs a person who read the manga I understood what was going on in root a however I cant imagine how confused anime only's are at some points when watching Root A. Anime only viewers where probably thinking who are the twins? why is Ken fighting this guy? why does Ken look like a centipede? who is this white haired guy with a electricity firing quinque? This adaption is pretty much if you butchered/removed most of your MCs arcs and character development in the second half of the manga so that you can get to the end faster and have more fights.  The only thing different from the manga is Ken joining the bad guys but that did not make much of difference as nothing new was led to it happening. any fight scenes used from the manga where not done to the fights conclusion as all the fights in this anime where just one party running away when things where getting interesting. The only pluses in the story is they did the first  2 and last 4 episodes well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing good with how the story was done was how they adapted particular scenes. This includes mainly scenes in the final battle with Yoshimura, Koma, Irimi and Ken. Even with the battle being epic and all the whole thing was wrecked by skipping some of the most major scenes in the series. There was one anime only scene near the end that really brought out the feels which was the only other high point in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was a bit lacking in Root A especially in some of the fight scenes mid way through the season. The fights in the anime only areas where slow and boring. Character designs where good while the setting where done as well as in the first season. The ghoul investigator weapons where however not as great in terms of detail as they where in season one as halve the time they did not look as lethal as they did in the first season. The only time the art shined in the last few episodes which I guess was what the studio wanted to animate above all else. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST in this anime is absolutely beautiful. The opening song is the only downside to the sound in this anime as it can't match unravel as an opening. The soundtrack was indeed better than the first season of the anime and was likely the only thing better than the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with the characters was Ken and new characters introduced. some of the characters like the twins don't get a proper introduction and are only used as for the anime only fight scenes. Kaneki is the biggest problem when it came to characters in this anime. The problem with Kens character in Root A is similar to Godzilla in the 2014 Godzilla film. He has a extremely low presence in Root A where all his scenes and dialog would only cover 30 minutes of the entire season. This mainly due to the fact that he is hardly on screen for the middle section of the show which mostly follows Touka  who is trying to live a normal life and Amon who is trying to find Kaneki and other ghouls.  He isn't made out to be a main character in Root A but a background character. If anyone is the main character in Root A it is probably Touka or Amon. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was not as good as I hoped it would be. I hope this season gets a reboot in hope of something better. My Main reason for this is that the ending which is bittersweet is way different to the Manga and leaves out any chance of a season 3 for the second Manga Re: .  I did however enjoy a few of the episodes but the ones in the middle were extremely rushed and made me wish Root A was 25 instead of 12 episodes.\\n\\n",

Just like a late term abortion, in the beginning things where rather OK, but then you realize that child will never be able to overcome its serve mental defects and will never have a chance at life. So you decide to abort it. This is pretty much what happened to the plot. At first it was pretty good. There was action and some good dialogue that would keep me watching theanime for multiple episodes at a time. As the anime was wrapping up, I was rather excited to see everything play out, but in the end they just half-assed the final episode.",

I mean what the heck??. tokyo ghoul second season takes the story from where the first season left off and put it in a blender and blends it completely. As the first season ended on cliff hanger the second season is even worse. It answers some of the question but leaves even more questions unanswered. Now this is worst possible ending as the second season ends in the middle of nowhere and there is no sign of season three.\r\nNow this is the worst possibleending and i can't even describe how disappointed i am. Seriously studio clown you take a story with amazing potential and turn it in to shit. Well people who watched first season will definitely watch the second season but take it form me read the manga as it is ages ahead of the anime. Well for the animation and sound was good as always but the biggest problem with this anime is the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow all i say that may be there will be a season three and it will answer all of the question until then i don't recommend watching the anime instead you should read the manga.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul Root A, the sequel of the famous Tokyo Ghoul series. My personal opinion about it is that it's awesome, as always, and even though the first half of the sequel was boring, the ending more than made up for it.\r\nNow for a fair review.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story continues where it left off. The attack on Anteiku and CCG on Aogiri headquarters. Kaneki kills of Jason and eats him. And the CCG are busy killing ghouls. The first episode completes that arc and from the next episode, Root A starts. New inspectors come into the CCG, old ones stay and some less known characters fromthe prequel get a full story and more screentime.\\n\r\nThe story focusses on the two major organizations; Aogiri and CCG as they each try to complete their objectives while the other stops them. Some characters from the prequel get a full backstory and new relations develop.\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime isn't much good. It is just your normal ghoul combat, some big ass missions of Aogiri and CCG raids. It is just the setting for the awesomeness that comes in the last 4 to 5 episodes of the series.\\n\r\nAnd the best thing about the sequel is that there are a lot of feels in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nA degrade from the prequel which we've seen in many anime. The sequel's animation quality drops as compared to the prequel. Anyway, it's not so bad as to turn you off. It still captures the seriousness and gloomy atmosphere when the situation calls for it.\\n\r\nThe art is good but if you're expecting quality as the prequel, you will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nWe all know the famous and legendary \"Unravel\" on Tokyo Ghoul. Well, as famous as it was, the opening of Root A takes a complete U turn. It really disappointed me and a lot of fans who were waiting for another amazing opening.\\n\r\nAs for the ending, it is pretty good. \"Amazarashi\" is a good ending and you might just get used to listening to it everytime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nKaneki becomes cool, calm and has full control of his powers now. But he is not invincible and gets beat by stronger ghouls. His human side comes to light as the series nears the end. Old characters get less screen time and more focus is on CCG and Aogiri members. \\n\r\nNew inspectors show up which get quite the screen time as well as some old favorites which showed up near the end, get a full main role in the sequel. The character developments of the CCG members is really nice. Some characters you'd never expect to show any change surprise you near the end.\\n\r\nHistories of some characters are revealed but some characters still stay hidden, hinting a sequel (though still not sure)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime left me wanting for more. It wasn't enough. It disappointed me as to how much it fell after the hype the prequel made. But after 6 to 7 episodes, the series jumps to new heights and easily took the top place in my rankings as the best episode of the week. I would say, just pass the first half and prepare yourself for a feast. This sequel, though starting slow, does justice to this amazing series. The feels and drama make you cry and the action gets you fired up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, though it dropped in certain aspects as compared to the prequel, as far as story progression and finishing is concerned, Root A does an amazing job. Though the story isn't completed yet and I'm pretty sure there will be a sequel but still, this was an amazing sequel to watch. And the ending was the icing on the cake.",

No. The story is pretty simple, but it always has a curve ball ready to throw at you. However this can lead to some unanswered questions and/or mysterious characters with no build-up which I'll talk about later.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nOverall, the show is pretty well animated. The main issue I have is the censoring. They tend to censor the fights in some sort of bizarre way,whether it be through adding random shadows to the scene, ormaybe adding a filter to the shot. It can be really frustrating to be watching an awesome fight scene when out of nowhere a random shadow is added to block some wounds/blood on a character. Looking past the censoring though, there are some gorgeous shots throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nSound is kind of hard to judge for me. I love the atmospheric tacks they play in the background of the scenes, I love the voice actors, I love the opening and ending tracks, there's really not much to complain about. That being said, they ending track seems out of place to me, it seems too upbeat for the ending shots they show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThis where the show really drops the ball, there is little to no character development in either seasons of this show. That tends to be people's biggest complaint with the show. While it does bother me, I try to look past it. I view this show as a standalone from the manga. I have read the manga the whole way through, which makes me kind of sad that they don't build up characters as well in the show.  If you haven't read the manga, you probably wont notice this or be bothered by it as much, but I felt this was the shows biggest flaw.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nLooking past the shows flaws and just viewing it as a standalone from the manga, its really enjoyable. The fight scenes had me on my toes, the story pulled me in, and the characters...well they tried?? Either way this show is really enjoyable to me. I already plan on buying the blu-ray when its available. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes a story based anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nAs mentioned above the story is okay, the art is gorgeous, the sound is enjoyable and immerses you into the scenes, and the character development (though lacking)\\n\r\n is still passable, while adding in my own personal enjoyment, leaves the show with a final score of 8/10. I would definitely give this anime a try.",

In S2, we had the second half of the Aogiri Base Arc, followed by the Cochlea Arc and the final Owl Suppression Arc. I will address each of these arcs separately below.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Anteiku arc, we are first introduced to Kaneki and his friend Hide. Kaneki has a crush on this girl, Rize, who happens to share the same book taste as him. After a date, Kaneki walks her home only to find out that she is a ghoul who tries to eat him. And immediately, the action, the fear and the horror that is so characteristic of Tokyo Ghoul kicks in and we are thrown quickly into the dark and exciting world of ghouls (+1 for intrigue).\\n\\n\r\nKaneki, after being turned into a half-ghoul from the encounter with Rize, begins to explore the horrifying world of ghouls, and tries to come to terms with the fact that he was once human but now has to feed on humans to survive. Luckily, help comes in the form of Anteiku, and organization that helps ghouls survive peacefully with humans by only feeding on people who committed suicide. Not a bad plot point, considering the high suicide rate in Japan. The main cast of characters also gets introduced in this arc Toka and Yoshimura especially, and we start to see the overarching conflict that divides both humans and ghouls, threatening to start a complete war (+1 for overarching conflict).\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the Gourmet Arc, Kaneki then encounters a crazy ghoul called Tsukiyama, who becomes obsessed with Kaneki's scent and tries to kidnap him and sell him off at an auction where ghouls buy \"gourmet\" delicacies. I honestly have no idea what this arc is doing here, because it adds nothing to the overall story except tell us that Tsukiyama is crazy and the gourmet community is a place for ghouls who are thoroughly sick and twisted. Tsukiyama is later defeated by the combined effort of Kaneki, Toka and Nishiki. The action scenes that took place here were probably what saved this arc from being a total disaster.\\n\\n\r\nIn the following Hinami Arc, we start to see a new perspective to the story - from the point of view of the CCG-  basically those who fight against the ghouls. We are introduced to the idea of \"doves\" who are basically ghoul hunters using weapons called quinque, which are made from ghouls. While ghouls lives in fear of the doves, the doves have the responsibility to rid society from the scourge of ghouls, and two doves in particular are introduced - Mado and Amon - in charge of the 20th Ward. (+1 for deeper perspective, complexity)\\n\\n\r\nMado and Amon, as a team, manage to make Hinami, a child ghoul who uses Anteiku as a refuge, an orphan by killing off both her parents in a rather one-sided fashion. Both stood no chance against the doves, whose physical prowess was just much greater. Toka gets back at the doves by killing one of their henchmen, and tries to lure Mado into a waterway where it's harder for him to use his quinque.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a stand-off and two duels happen simultaneously - Mado vs Toka and Amon vs Kaneki. During the course of the duel, the story explores themes that are akin to both humans and ghouls, discussing the reason why innocent people need to die and why they must fight to protect their kind. We see how morals playing out from one side can also apply to the other party - if killing a ghoul will hurt the rest of the family, so will killing a human. Is it right to kill out of revenge? To protect others? Does any motive justify to outcome of leaving another person without a loved one? (+1 for thematic exploration)\\n\\n\r\nAfter this incident, we move on to the Aogiri Base arc, where the CCG identifies the base of a ghoul organization called Aogiri, which has been causing mass havoc by killing CCG investigators in the 11th district. At the same time, Aogiri's Yamori has an encounter with Anteiku, and ends up kidnapping Kaneki and locking him up in a dungeon at the Aogiri base. What happens next is basically a 3-way war involving CCG trying to eliminate Aogiri and Anteiku trying to sneak in to rescue Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the arc, we are shown horrifying and heart-wrenching scenes of Kaneki being tortured by Yamori - having his toes cut off, and having centipedes inserted into his ears. These scenes help to frame the reason behind Kaneki wanting to get stronger to protect those whom he loves, and in a way drive him crazy, succumbing to the ghoul-like nature inside of him. However, these scenes can get a bit slow and long-winded and even though the anime was trying to be clever with Rize's literary exposition, all of it revolved around the same idea over and over again, until it felt completely redundant and overly repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the arc, Kaneki manages to embrace the ghoul powers inside of him, hence turning his hair white for no apparent reason but for visual effect to the audience. He defeats Yamori by cannibalizing him and proceeds to rescue Toka from her brother, Ayato. After a short face-off against Ayato, and showing off his new found powers that came from simply getting tortured, he decides to leave Anteiku to join Aogiri, because he wants to \"become stronger\".\\n\\n\r\nWith that, S1 officially comes to a proper close and we move to the Cochlea Arc. Amon's investigator team gets a bit of a reshuffle and we also get introduced to new characters like Akira, Mado's daughter, and Juzo, who is basically Shinohara's adopted son, both of whom are investigators too. Cochlea is this poorly designed facility that is supposed to house the most dangerous of ghouls, which the anime terms as S-rated and SS-rated. Aogiri attacks this facility to rescue a certain ghoul who then vanishes from the rest of the anime. This arc didn't do anything except for further cementing the partner relationship between Amon and Akira, and giving us a slight glimpse of how crazy Kaneki has become, and who for some reason continues to have to scream and cry out like he's literally been doing the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we move on to the Owl Suppression arc, which is by far the most interesting arc out of the lot, but also the arc that was never fully resolved properly. Yasumori is revealed to be the original One-Eyed Owl, said to be the CCG's greatest enemy, and he's also revealed to have a child with the same ghoul power, hence there being two One-Eyed Owls. CCG, with the help from Akira, manages to discover Anteiku's existence in 20th ward, and our main ghoul characters' home is threatened to be destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nYasumori, instead of running, orders Yomo to protect Toka and Hinami, and teams up with Devil Ape Koma and Black Dog Irima, both of whom were leaders of previous savage ghoul organizations made peaceful by the existence of Anteiku. They accept their fate and \"punishment\" for their sins and take one final stand against CCG's strongest investigator teams and divisions.\\n\\n\r\nIn the massive fighting that ensues, they are on the brink of defeat when Kaneki manages to arrive last minute and save both Koma and Irima, but not Yasumori, who gets defeated by about 6 strong investigators ganging up on him. There is a massive turnaround though, once Yasumori's child, Eto, literally flies like a comet and smashes into their location and instantly decapitates 5 of their top investigators, but is then chased away by their top investigator, Arima. It is later revealed that Eto manages to save Yasumori when she fled from the scene.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Kaneki faces off in a duel (damn, this anime sure loves duels doesn't it?) against Amon, whom he manages to overcome and defeat, much to Akira's despair. Kaneki then meets up with a dying Hide, and Toka runs to Anteiku only to find it completely burned to the ground, as Yomo has done so on Yasumori's orders. The anime the ends with Kaneki carrying Hide's body to CCG, and the epilogue shows Toka opening up a new coffee shop, in place of Anteiku, the only place she'd ever call home.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the resolution of the plot was complete nonsense and we never got anywhere regarding the CCG-Ghoul conflict. Aogiri is still out there, as is the One-Eyed Owl. There are still so many characters who feature in the anime whose names are kind of just mentioned once then disappear (basically man of Aogiri's top ghouls). Also, Hinami's fate is uncertain, as is Kaneki. The ending was again, a cliffhanger, and it just left a gaping hole in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the overall coherence of the story, there was basically none because there are so many plot holes that I can hardly even count. They are listed as follows.\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 2, Yoshimura states that coffee is the only thing that ghouls can consume and enjoy just as humans do. However, the explanation for this is completely left out. What's so special about coffee that ghouls can drink from it without having it taste bad? In fact, while I can accept that ghouls can't eat human food, there needs to be at least some consideration as to whether they can at least eat raw animal flesh, because that's also a food source that has the same characteristics of human flesh, including all the blood.\\n\\n\r\nHide asks Kaneki why he's been skipping school, but this makes absolutely no sense. Kaneki has just recently undergone a life-threatening medical operation involving the replacement of his organs. Shouldn't he be getting at least a week of medical leave from school from the doctor? Man, Japanese schools these days must be really tough then - even after a major operation, you're expected to return to school the very day you're discharged?\\n\\n\r\nLater, Kaneki realizes that Nishiki's plan is to kill Hide while they go to his place. However, Kaneki decides that the best way to deal with this is to go with them as well? At this point, Kaneki should be terrified of Nishiki, who in their earlier encounter easily beat him hands-down. What in the world is making Kaneki think that his presence is ever going to change any of Nishiki's plans? Kaneki should have at least tried to come up with some excuse to tell Hide that he shouldn't go with Nishiki alone.\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 5, Tsukiyama kidnaps Kimi to blackmail Kaneki, but the problem is that there was no way for Tsukiyama to be so confident that he would try to save Kimi anyway. Kaneki literally just met Kimi in the same episode, having visited Nishiki's house for the first time ever. It's quite a far cry from just having met someone to suddenly wanting to save them. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, it was unnecessary for Kimi and Kaneki to have their conversation in the park, when they could have simply had it in the house, in private. Having them talk at the park was just a matter of plot convenience to explain how Tsukiyama could eavesdrop on them in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the blackmail note that Kaneki reads out, it doesn't even mention the venue where they are supposed to meet. Of course it's implied that Tsukiyama included details about the church they were to have \"dinner\" at, but this was never explicitly mentioned. Also, how the heck did Toka even know where to go to rescue them? Wait, how did Toka even know they were in trouble in the first place? Is she psychic now?\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 7, when Hinami brings Kaneki back to the scene where Ryoko is in trouble, she clearly shouts \"Mother!\" within 5 metres of the scene. Even if Kaneki managed to shut her mouth to conceal their presence, that one shout should have been clearly audible despite the rain, since it was only 5 metres away. Also, not to mention the fact that they were running straight into the alleyway and were in plain sight for quite a while, so there was no way the doves and their henchmen would not have noticed this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if we take a closer look how Kaneki and Hinami arrive at the scene, we see them sneaking up behind Mado and Amon, listening to what was going on. This is a contradiction to the earlier scene where Hinami clearly first encountered Mado and Amon from the front, then ran away back the way she came. If she then led Kaneki to the scene, they should be arriving from the front of Mado and Amon, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 8, Amon asks Kaneki, \"Why does your kind exist?\" This is the exact same question that the anime has completely failed to answer - where exactly do ghouls come from? It's simply been assumed they exist so far, but there has been no effort in explaining their origins.\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 10, Kaneki hides the fact that Rize is dead and instead tells Banjo that she isn't there any more. After hearing this, Banjo, after coming all the way from the 11th ward, gives a completely unnatural reaction and accepts that she has just travelled somewhere else. This is an unnatural character reaction because anybody, especially a love-struck Banjo, in that situation would have immediately reacted with, \"Where did she go?\"\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 11, Tsukiyama explains that he managed to keep himself alive by \"eating himself.\" If that's true, then why don't all ghouls simply keep \"eating themselves\" to survive? Also, even if a ghoul actually tried to eat himself to recover, there's no way he can ever fully recover because every time he eats, he injures himself more and will only ever regenerate the exact amount of which he injured himself. Unless of course, the laws of matter don't apply to ghouls, in which case it's still a plot hole and a horrible explanation of ghoul regenerative mechanics.\\n\\n\r\nIn the dungeon scene, Yamori explains that hypothermic needles normally don't affect ghouls unless injected into mucous membranes. While it makes sense that mucous membranes are obviously more susceptible to damage and penetration, the anime here draws into question exactly what property it is of ghoul skin that makes it impervious to knives and sharp objects. Since they decided to come up with \"RC inhibition fluid\", they should at least provide some scientific explanation as to how different ghoul skin is from humans and why the fluid changes this. But the anime fails to deliver and merely makes things up as it goes and expects the audience to believe their assumptions.\\n\\n\r\nIn a news announcement, CCG announces that the ghouls have been occupying a shopping centre more for the past two months, with their numbers at around 500. But wait a moment, CCG has waited for two whole months to pass before they are even taking any actions against this large number of ghouls? Something seems to be a little off here in this organization that's supposed to be protecting the humans in the various wards. It's more shocking than surprising that the CCG took so long to react. Perhaps excessive red-tape was the problem then?\\n\\n\r\nIn S1 episode 12, at the start of the episode, Kaneki counts 559, but he had already counted this number in the previous episode. In fact, Kaneki was counting 223 by the middle of episode 11, so does this mean he doesn't know how to count, or did we somehow go back in time here?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Kaneki claims that Yamori took off his hands and feet, but clearly only his toes were getting cut off. His fingers looked perfectly fine being chained behind his back to the chair.\\n\\n\r\nIn S2 episode 4, the existence of Cochlea isn't very clearly explained. We know that it's a facility that holds S and SS-rated ghouls, but we don't know for what purpose. There has to be a very good reason for not killing incredibly dangerous ghouls immediately and instead keeping them alive in a facility, hence wasting manpower and resources.Plus, isn't it true that ghouls must feed on human flesh to survive? If that's the case, has the facility been feeding them human flesh? This sounds absurd and calls the very legitimacy of Cochlea into question.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, no matter what purpose it is, the security forces deployed within Cochlea seem very pathetic for a place that is supposed to be securing ghouls of such high power ratings. Given the weak security system that is has, the fact that there are so few armed with quinques to defend against ghoul attacks, means its unimaginable how does S and SS-rated ghouls could even be kept down in such a facility in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, who exactly is this person that Kaneki was sent to save from Cochlea? For no reason at all they starting fighting each other, and this person vanishes from the rest of the anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn S2 episode 9, after Suzuha throws the paper plane he folded into the city below, there is a shot of it gliding horizontally across the screen with Kaneki in the foreground. It would suffice to say that I've thrown those kind of paper planes many times off high places and they only ever glide for at most 3 seconds, before nose-diving straight down. So I call rubbish on this particular paper plane gliding scene since Suzuha clearly throws it from such a height, and it's not possible for it to continue gliding after descending enough to be in view of Kaneki from the ground below.\\n\\n\r\nYasumori says that his wife Ukina, performed a \"miracle\" that allowed her human-ghoul baby to be born, but what exactly is this miracle? This is completely overlooked in the anime and never really explained! Why go through all the trouble telling us that it's impossible to create a ghoul-human baby if you're not going to tell us how they overcame this impossibility?\\n\\n\r\nIn S2 Episode 12, Toka runs through the snow, tripping on nothing and then falling down. If she visibly slipped I would have given it to the anime, but it was obvious from the animation that she \"tripped\". Unfortunately, the anime has joined the likes of many others in causing their characters to trip over nothing just for dramatic effect. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the Kanou surgeon who operated on Kaneki just vanished from the anime. He was the one who transplanted Rize's organs into Kaneki and hence played a crucial role in the plot, but was only mentioned once or twice. His motives for creating a one-eyed ghoul went unexplained, even though the anime poked fun at this plot point when they sent Takatsuki Sen to do some random interview at CCG.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, there are a total of 22 plot holes in this anime, 5 of which are rather major in nature, so this plot gets zero points for coherence and logical sense. This is rather depressing for a plot that itself already suffers from a lack of proper resolution. Despite it's attempt to explore deeper themes, the plot fails with it's many inconsistencies and logical jumps throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence 1: 2/2 - Beautiful with all the myriad of colours forming the kagunes of the ghouls\\n\r\nOP Sequence 2: 0/1 - What is this crap? A slow motion shot of Kaneki opening his eyes? Pfft.\\n\r\nED Sequence 1: 0/1- Several dull still scenes, mashed together. No effort put in.\\n\r\nED Sequence 2: 1/2 - Boring but at least it had some artistry in it\\n\r\nAesthetics: 2/2 - Generally great because the design put into the characters was very varied, from the hair colour to the clothing style.\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/2 - Just awesome and solid especially looking at the kagune and even quinque animations all around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP1 Theme: 1/2 - Ok the music was upbeat but the vocals were annoying\\n\r\nOP2 Theme: 0/2 - Just what in the world is this nonsense of an OP theme?\\n\r\nED1 Theme: 0/2 - Boring and lame\\n\r\nED2 Theme: 2/2 - No seriously why is this not an OP theme? It's way catchier than the other themes and as better vocals!\\n\r\nBackground Music: 2/2 - Generally good, and they even put in some English songs in this one, which somehow managed to fit in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul introduces so many characters that it's probably difficult to name them all, but we'll just look at the main characters and judge based on how well they've been developed in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll start off with the main character of the series, Kaneki. Kaneki is a rather confused character who's thrown into a conflict that he never wanted to be in, and as a result goes around screaming and going crazy for most of the anime. He wants to be become stronger, and this so that he can protect those close to him, and there's some minor talk of him being the only one who can bridge the gap between humans and ghouls. Kaneki's tired of not being able to protect anyone, but I'm ultimately just tired of all his whining. Sure he does get stronger, he manages to embrace his ghoul nature to become stronger (+1 for slight growth), but he, a main character, has like the least backstory out of all the other characters. In my opinion, Kaneki is a major failure of a main character who, while manages the audience to be sympathetic towards him, doesn't drive the plot and exerts even less influence on other characters, including Hide.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character, Toka, is a much better archetype. She's hardworking, determined, a bit of the Tsundere-type, but ends up having a bit of an effection for Kaneki. She also has like this amazingly beautiful Kagune wings and is really powerful in fights, at least in S1 (+1 for great tsundere female lead). For most of S2 though, she kind of just stays in her state of longing to see Kaneki, and also doesn't drive the plot in any meaningful way. There was one scene where she beats up Kaneki, telling him never to come back to Anteiku again, and that was pretty powerful, showing how desperate Toka was to see Kaneki again. It's a pity Kaneki hardly even returns this affection.\\n\\n\r\nBut we move on to much more interesting characters like Amon, one of the investigators for the 20th Ward. Amon is Mado's partner in S1 and Akira's partner in S2, and we can easily see how much Mado has changed Amon from the interactions with him, as well as from lengths of backstory that has made Amon respect Mado enough to continually visit his grave, as shown multiple times in S2 (+1 for backstory). Mado's words continually stick with him as he fights, and he's also no pushover with his dual blades and immense physical strength. His main drawback is his lack of character growth throughout the anime, as even though Kaneki shows him time and time again that ghouls can be good, Amon continues to be obsessed with revenge against Kaneki for killing Mado, and eventually pays with his own life.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character that I really like is Akira. Akira starts off as cold, disrespectful to her seniors and task-oriented. Takizawa loathes her, but time and time again, she's shown that she's capable, responsible and hardworking, and that she keeps to a strict lifestyle as well. Akira's character begins to shine in the short scene over dinner where she gets rather drunk and ends up talking about how much she loved her father and mother, and wanted to be like them (+1 for dedicated daughter). She eventually opens up to Amon and even tries to kiss him at one point (+1 for character depth).\\n\\n\r\nAnother pair of characters I have to add is the Shinohara - Juzo combination. Both are kind of one-sided without each other, but together they are like a father and son team. Juzo being the crazy scythe-wielding child who was raised by bloodthirsty ghouls, and Shinohara being the kind father who raised him to be an investigator (+1 for father-son relationship). CCG expressed many doubts about Juzo's potential as an investigator, but under Shinohara's guidance and effort, Juzo manages to excel. There's also a scene of Juzo mourning for his dad, which shows that he's grown from seeing death just as \"another death\" (+1 for character growth).\\n\\n\r\nYasumori, the One-Eyed Owl, is also a powerful character that I'd like to mention. Initially starting off as a ghoul only taught how to kill, he transforms into a peaceful ghoul after meeting a human lady Ukina who accepts him despite him being a ghoul (+1 for backstory). His interactions with her eventually lead him to set-up Anteiku, which is a symbol of ghoul-human peace throughout the anime, together with the idea of coffee, the only thing that both ghouls and human can enjoy and share together. He's also the only SSS-rated ghoul in the story, having immense power and being able to stand up to 6 investigators in battle at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nBesides all these key characters, there are also an amazing set of varied side characters like Yomo, Koma, Irimi, Hinami, Ayato, Hide, Nishiki who are all amazingly different in their own ways and who also have powerful kagunes. (+1 for varied character cast) It is also rather impressive that the anime managed to draw out the backstories of many of their characters. The only drawback from the characters is honestly Kaneki, who is really lacking in any meaningful character development. It seems like the anime thought that making him scream a lot would make him a more lovable character.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the character interactions are probably what Tokyo Ghoul manages to excel at, so definitely a job well done, but perhaps all the time spent developing characters meant less time to developing a proper plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nExcitement: 3/3 \\n\r\nIn this aspect, the anime doesn't fail to impress. Whether it's through the fast-paced action scenes or through the intrigue created by the mystery surrounding the One-Eyed Owl, the anime definitely has got me excited about what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nEmotion: 2/3\\n\r\nFor an anime that isn't technically romance, there's a lot of emotion put into Kaneki's inner turmoil and fight with himself (or Rize / Yamori, if you see it that way). There's also some very memorable character relationships, especially those of Amon-Akira, Shinohara-Juzo and even Toka-Kaneki, where things can get really touching at times.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 1/3\\n\r\nThe anime started off really good, with excitement right from the get-go, but things can get really draggy towards the middle, especially in the scenes post-Aogiri Base arc as well as at the very end where things don't really clear up. The main conflict was of course, not even resolved by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime receives 1 point for having no filler episodes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't enjoy watching Tokyo Ghoul, as it was definitely a thrill to watch. There was a whole lot of drama thrown in and mixed with the action scenes, but I really thought the anime could have been paced better. Certain plot arcs could have been omitted entirely and other episodes could have been shortened, as many a times they didn't contribute much to the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4 / 10 (rounded down to 6)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime looked really promising, but ultimately at the end, it ended with utter disappointment, with no plot ends being tied up and all the surviving characters being left confused and in a lurch. I really hope there is a 3rd season to bring some kind of closure to the plot, as there are still many unanswered questions and characters we haven't even seen yet, but as of S2, the anime has so far not performed to it's full potential, suffering especially in terms of plot.",

Sadly, it didn't turn out that way.\r\nThere are two main points which I disliked about Tokyo Ghoul so far. Character and plot. Forgettable characters, with unmemorable plot, combine to deliver a, rather, average anime, despite its brilliant sound and art. \r\nOut of all the characters that have been introduced so far, none of the them havehad a decent development. Almost all anime has at least one character you can relate to. Sadly, this has none. And another problem is, too many characters. A new character is introduced almost every other day, with no significant background to support them. As a result, I could name only a few of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has major loopholes. Transitioning between each episode has been a real pain, with either the plot abruptly changing, to never finding the initial path after it had branched off, or the characters being omitted altogether, as if the producers have forgotten about their existence. The story felt rushed as well, as there was a lack of proper buildup, or even efforts to show a little consistency with progress. Just when I thought that I'm beginning to follow the plot, it abruptly jumps to a new scenario, with no mention of the former.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely difficult to follow. The producers honestly should have taken more time to tell the story, and develop the characters more meaningfully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it has been yet another disappointing Tokyo Ghoul entry, but I hope the franchise improves in the future.",

            "content": "The first season of Tokyo Ghoul, although mediocre, ended with a solid cliffhanger that made people(me included) hyped up for the second season. Root A had quite a hype to live up to. So does it? \r\nWell, let me tell it this way. It didn't just fall flat on its face, it fell with its mouth wide open on dog shit and remained like that until another dog came and shat on its head. Yes, it was THAT bad. The first season at least had nice animation and sound to back it up. What did Root A have? \r\nWARNING:SPOILERS\r\nStory:\r\nStory? What story? All that I've seenare random shit with no build up, no explanation, no logic, and worst of all, no point. Things just happen out of nowhere and go nowhere. The plot points just appear one moment and gone the next. And unless you haven't read the manga(like me), you won't understand what the hell is happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nOne episode we see Kaneki working with Aogiri to free a certain somebody from the ghoul investigators. Why? Never answered. The other episode we see him breaking in a jail to free another someone. A few moments later that someone is fighting with Kaneki. In the end something happens and that person is never mentioned again. In the next episode Anteiku is being attacked out of nowhere by ghoul investigators. What the fuck happened? Why the fuck is this happening? How the fuck did it end? Absolutely nothing is explained and you are left with your head scratching and thinking what the hell you have just seen. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the outrageous logic? Like- the ghoul investigators take the newbies when launching an all-out war with the ghouls of a ward. But when they attack a coffee shop, they take with them ghoul investigators from all around the world with god-like powers. This is nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDestroyed. Whatever development or role they had in the first season is completely ignored. Kaneki is still as whiny and useless as he was in the first season. Amon is still the biggest hypocrite of all time. Touka does absolutely nothing but run in the entirety of the twelve episodes. All the other characters except the Manager are irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet the anime introduces a ton of new characters just for the sake of moving the plot forward. And none of these characters get enough screentime. Mado's daughter, that crazy Jason fanatic, the buttload of ghoul investigators, and Hide, who stalks around the CCG headquarters for.....whatever. Most of the major and some minor characters from both seasons are killed for no reason af all other than cheap drama and shock value. But to me it wasn't much of a big deal since I barely know anything about them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\r\nWhoa!!! Is this shit real? Root A has THE worst animation I have ever had misfortune if watching. Seriously, animation was seriously lacking. The fight scenes were so badly choreographed, it almost made me vomit. I can't believe any action anime can actually have this shit quality animation. And the last fights? Most of them happened in the smoke so you can see nothing. The ones that didn't lasted for less than a minute.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was on par with the animation, i.e. bad. The opening and endings sucked. The dialogues were long, boring and misused. The whole thing seemed pointless.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 10 or so minutes of the series consisted of Kaneki walking in the snow, his hair, his eyes, walking, his hair, his eyes.....while the song 'unravel' playing in the background. It was supposed to be sad or something as it involved someone's death. But showing the exact same thing for freaking 10 minutes is EXTREMELY boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think someone stole whatever money the producers earned from tbe first season. So what they were left with was a shitty budget and this was the result. Or they perhaps have stopped caring and wanted to milk as much cash as possible from the fans without spending too much of their money.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A has earned the worst anime sequel ever rank in my list. It will always be a mystery as to how I completed this. I won't recommend it to anyone, not even to fans of Tokyo Ghoul.\\n",

It can be a bit violent and bloody at times but hey, that's what makes it original ! You will be literally hooked on the characters as the plot goes on and of course, on the plot itself.\r\nSome episodes are better than others,just because of the combinations of music and drama.For Example, at the end of the 5th episode of season 1, there is a great combination of melody and atmosphere.Especially when Kaneki shouts ''Tsukiyama'' and Touka takes a bite of his shoulder,for me it is one of the best episodes of the series, for this simple reason.\\n\r\nIt's my 2nd favourite anime, you should Definitely give it a try.",

            "content": "Where to start....\r\nTo put it simply tokyo ghoul is a trainwreck. I do know this show deviated from the manga, but that is not the reason its bad. Its not bad because its not faithful to the original source material, this anime is just plain bad. Honestly just hoping so save some people their time who watched and enjoyed season 1 and planning to watch root a. Well here are some reasons\r\nArt: \r\nI don't know if the studio had some budgeting issues but wow the artwork was horrrible. Its super inconsistent and most of the time looks like a mess. Some episodes will look decentand all the sudden the next one will look the animators just dialed it in and decided \"hey this show sucks so fck it\" lol.  \\n\r\nColors are bland most of the time and mostly flat as well, making the whole experience feel cheap. Probably the only episode the artwork that was good was probably the last which is ironic because the it sucked and so did the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nEven worse than the art. I never watched a show where i didn't even care for even a single one of characters. The characters are shallow,one dimensional and boring. Dialogue is poorly written, and even the relationships between the cast is predictable and mostly cliche. Motives are not clear and the show just ignores or just assumes you magically know the characters reasoning and crazy logic. Btw the show does the unforgivable deed of just introducing characters in the plot and never never give any background/story to them ever!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is where i have the biggest issue. The whole thing is filled with plotholes galore. Characters are introduced and put in situations with little or no explanation. Characters motivations and reasoning is mind baffling and makes no sense most of the time. Even when characters are perilous situations or die I just didn't care because the character had so little personality/background/relationships within the story theres barely any emotional impact. PRIME Example: Mc fights a enemy character and his group of allies that are lined up behind the enemy , as the 2 clash but all the sudden all the enemies group of allies are defeated like they just fell over and died offcamera and theres no mention of it, this happens multiple times! I won't spoil it but wtf shitty ending to add insult to injury as in payment for watching this show completely to the end. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nI completed watching the first season and i thought it was decent and I have a bad habit of finishing a series completely, even if bad. Honestly wish i never heard of tokyo ghoul so i didn't feel the urge to see this monstrosity of the second season. and i coulda saved precious hours of my life. Please Save your time and watch something else, just wiki the manga synopsis and be happy with that cause if you watch root a most chances you'll regret it.\\n",

            "content": "The first season was decent although it was a bit rushed up but Root A was terrible! \r\nStory - 3/10      After watching this anime, I might have to admit that I was really disappointed. I loved the manga but I hated the anime. Here are some reasons why I hate this anime :\r\n1. Kaneki joined Aogiri Tree. Does that happen in the manga? No. He refused to join them. \r\n2. They had left out most of the important parts. For example, about what happens to Rize and WHY Kaneki was turned into a half ghoul. They had explained everything inthe manga but all those things were left out in the anime.\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!!\\n\r\n3. Hide's death - I know that Hide's death is supposed to be depressing but it wasn't. And Kaneki kept on walking and walking in the last episode. I almost doubted that he'd ever stop.\\n\r\n4. There's a possibility that there will be a season 3 judging by how the second season ended. If they were to continue the story instead of making a reboot, then the outcome would be something worse than Root A. \\n\\n\r\nIf they had followed the manga, then I am sure that this anime would never get this much of hate.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4/10     Terrible! There's nothing much I can say about it. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 3/10   I  listened to the opening once and I decided that I am not going to listen to it ever again. I always skip it. It's nothing compared to \"Unravel\". I have given 3 points for sound and that's only because of \"Glassy Sky\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10  This season made me hate some of the characters, especially Kaneki. Joining Aogiri tree was the dumbest thing he did. The Kaneki in the manga is way different from the Kaneki in the anime. The same goes for the other characters. Compare that fight scene between Kaneki and Ayato in the anime and manga and see the difference.\\n\r\n Touka kept on running and running and running and running for so many episodes. Don't get me wrong. Touka is my favorite character in Tokyo Ghoul. It's just that running for four episodes looks ridiculous and it's completely unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10   I did not enjoy it at all.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10   It was a huge disappointment. I was expecting something better. They completely ruined something that should have been a masterpiece if they had followed the original story line. The only thing that this anime needs is a reboot.\\n",

            "content": "The story of Root A picks up immediately after the first season's timeline. It follows Kaneki after being released from his torturer from the previous season. \r\nThe graphics and animation is amazing as usual. The \"painted\" art in the opening and closing theme are also very impressive. However, no matter how good the art style was, in terms of character development the show fell a little flat. Yes, Kaneki did change in this series compared to season one, he became physically stronger and more brooding but I felt that it wasn't the kind of \"change\" that I wanted from his character.  \r\nThe rest ofthe supporting characters didn't have any significant improvement throughout the entire series. Which is kind of a bummer. I'm the type of viewer who looks forward to character development. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that I didn't like the characters or that they were unappealing. Quite the opposite really. All of them are likable. I think the author did a good job at making me feel like there are no antagonists in the series. Yes, I'm rooting for the Ghouls but gah! A back story from the CCG kind of makes me want to root for them too. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the story, well honestly I got so confused most of the time I was watching this. More characters were introduced and more conflicts were  chucked into the story but at the end of the day (or the series) those new characters and conflicts did not have a resolution. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to describe Tokyo Ghoul Root A in one word it would be depressing. I mean, I could have sworn the author hated Kaneki because of all the things he had to endure. I was like, \"Come on! Give Kaneki a break!\" \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this is a sad sad anime. A sad anime that will make you realize that there are two sides to things. Just because you think you're right does not mean that the other party is wrong. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just because people are different doesn't mean that you can't find something in common.\\n\\n\r\nIt teaches you the importance of protecting the ones who are dear to you.\\n\\n",

The anime changed the story from the one in the manga (i was so what happy about that since i knew what was going to happen) but then decides to just start following the manga story. But even though they started to follow the manga story; they missed like more then half or the important stuff that happened.... You know the ending for ep 12????

I still don't quite know which side I am rooting for at times.\r\nThis anime started weakly as a comparison to what the first series had given us, I understand that they were able to do what they wanted with it since they have left the manga story line, which shows throughout parts as it seemed like they were struggling a bit to convey the emotion. There were also bits which seemed abrupt, but I guess I can't fault them on that since they wereonly given 12 episodes to work with. I will have to say that this did not go in the direction that I was expecting it to be, there were moments where I thought it would go into a cheesy route, however it continued being quite serious and I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of it. \\n\\n\r\nIt did redeem itself halfway through where there was more development on the characters so that you're let into the story a bit more and honestly some tears started to crawl in at this point. I only wish they had told the back stories earlier on, but even with the short amount it was still very emotional. Honestly, I started off disliking this series a lot because I felt that it did not live up to the standards given with the first series, however it managed to redeem itself. I give it quite a high score because I believe for an anime going off in its own routes is extremely brave and usually is not done well at all and the ending leaves the audience frustrated. This gave me a nice feeling at the end, true it left it on a lot of questions however, for the character development and the fact that they managed on their own, I cannot help but give it an 8 overall.",

I can't believe they left out some of the best parts in the manga! Why?!\r\nThere is lots of symbolism in this series. I've felt very moved by the actions that unfolded in the series. It's definitely very sad and Tokyo Ghoulhas lots of tragic events, it works nicely. I am disappointed that they had so little fights and had very little gore which was censored again. The first season had good, unique fights but this series had far too few fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation was an improvement from the first season. The sound was also great. I like the OP and ED, the sound effects were good too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were underdeveloped and underutilized. It's an absolute injustice that we got so little Kaneki.

However, despite this I really believe that the anime is actually really good as compared from other anime which totally deviated from their manga counter part and messed up everything. So, yeah I think that Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA really deserves credit and applause here because it's a well done job.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that they make an anime adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul Re and basing myself from the way it ended with Touka I think it might be a hint!\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's what I have to say and I would just advice those who intend to watch Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA to watch it without high expectations and not to judge it by the negative reviews of others cause you might end up missing something great!\\n\\n\r\nCheers....

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul A, you could have been so much more. I, like many others, have read the manga for Tokyo Ghoul. While we knew it was going to be an anime original ending etc. It looks like they bascially used that as an excuse to fit ALL of Tokyo Ghoul into 12 episodes and not 25. As the story is very loosely the same. Just minus the development, story, etc... I'll break it into parts.\r\nSTORY: ... Well as I said they tried to do to much in to little time. Story elements happened that either A didn't matter or B was just paced poorly. Withoutspoiling anything, let's just say the Anime tried to fit everything into a very tight package and lost a LOT of what was supposed to be in that package. Even if they didn't follow Tokyo Ghoul (Manga) and EVEN if you treat it as it's own thing and never read the manga. You'd still be confused by the pacing and why things happened. / Not much positive to say as it did have a continuation but it's just.. So poorly paced and inconsistent that it's shortcomings are to glaring to really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND: The sound effects and Music was great for the most part! Other than a few parts where the fights felt and sounded like they had no impact, the sound and music we're very good. The art was also good, other than a few hiccups here and there.    \\n\\n\r\nEven after all is said and done I still did enjoy Tokyo Ghoul A enough to finish it up, which counts for something. But boy do I hope for the Brotherhood treatment one day.\\n\\n\r\nThink of it like this, the studio that made Tokyo Ghoul A (Pierrot) basically looked at the manga and said \"What's the budget and how much can we cut out?\" As the anime follows the manga just cuts out SO much and changes SO little to make a difference. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR; I suggest reading the manga from chapter 1 to really enjoy all of what Tokyo Ghoul has to offer, if you do watch this, don't expect to much and just enjoy it for what it has.

            "content": "Can you rekindle what has already been reduced to ash? \r\nIn the anime industry, there tends to be a great production team behind each and every work these days. However, writers of outstanding merit are scarce. This notion is similar in a sense to a stroll in the park. Sometimes you find novelties that surprisingly evoke eccentric sentiments; but unfortunately there are times where the camera pans out, and you find yourself treading in congested crap. Unfortunately, I'm writing about the latter scenario, as Studio Pierrot brings us yet another adaptation of the renown manga: Tokyo ghoul. \r\nThe majority of people will tell you thatthe story is just a butchering of the manga; and quite frankly, I can wholeheartedly agree. A show with so incoherent a plot as Route A has must be a distorted variant of the manga-writers script, right?\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10: \\n\\n\r\nAn obvious deus ex machina moment was present prior to the events of this sequel, and surprise! They don't end there, but at the very least; they\u2019ve learned to hide in plain sight. Furthermore, there is an inadequate amount of overarching world-building. Therefore, there are even characters that are supposedly relevant to the plot; yet they don't get enough screen time to fulfill their respective roles in the plot (I'm looking at you, Arima). As a whole, this atrocious portion of the anime leaves me speechless, and as such, I'll just leave the critique of the core narrative elements with that. \\n\\n\r\nNow, given that the greatest merit of horror is the shock factor that elicits a suspenseful response or atmospheric change from the viewer, it is rather unfortunate that the execution of \"Tokyo Ghoul Route A\" has the inability to incorporate either of the above mentioned elements. In brief, one reason for this is because of the full-fledged war between the investigators and ghouls. They essentially stand on equal footings, which is rather underwhelming in a  to say the least (especially when these supernatural entities are allied on one side), and definitely does not complement the horror/tragic narrative that is tries to be. Using such means to create a collective piece of writing forgoes the process of writing fully-fleshed out characters (more on that later) and keeping the plot coherent/cohesive. As a result, what we get is a half-baked product, of which is essentially sitting on the fence between a psychological enigma and your average \"5deep3me\" tragedies.  Even worse, the problem lies in the accord to congest this over the mere span of 12 episodes, and as such, amounts to nothing more than convoluted scribe. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite me seemingly chastising the anime's plot completely, I have to admit that there are redeeming qualities associated with the direction that Studio Pierrot decided to take the show. The way the show portrays itself is intrinsically abstract, given how the entirety of the second season is a manifestation of Kaneki's introspection, following the questionable events of season one.  To illustrate, when Kaneki was reunited with Hide near the end, the scene was so beautifully done and opportune, given the whole \"childhood friend accepting who you are now \" effect. Despite this it was hard to keep my composure, given the lack of direction and plot holes in the story, not to mention the fact that the two literally had null screen time together. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10: \\n\\n\r\nIf you're an avid anime watcher, then you've probably already seen all of the troupes this show has to offer: the hard-at-work protagonist, the tsundere tryhard female lead, the generic childhood friend who has little to no relevance to the plot whatsoever, and I could just go on and on... The antagonists are similar in a sense; being generic to an extent where their motives are either completely obscure, or are limited to irrational prejudice toward the ghouls as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character development; this is arguably the most pivotal part of what limits the show from consolidating its relation between character and plot. Expectantly, a wide scope is used to depict an abundant number of perspectives. By the same token, the diversity of the cast is sizable enough to attribute the lack of development to a sheer shortage of screentime. *Warning spoiler* A perfect example of this is Yukinori Shinohara, who is Juuzou\u2019s senior investigator (If I\u2019ve mixed people up, I apologise; it\u2019s just too tall a task to remember names with the way the characters are portrayed). Nearing the end of the season, he succumbs to Eto\u2019s wrath after a valiant attempt to protect others. In effect, Juuzou mourns his death, but the scene lacked poignancy and emotion because their relation had yet to be established to the extent where you would actually care for either of them. \\n\\n\r\nIn a similar fashion to the plot, the indecisiveness of the writers is manifested by the lousy way  they experiment with each demographic of characters (The respective representatives of both investigators and ghouls). At various points in the anime, characters react in ways that one would never expect, given the previous actions they have already taken in the anime. Simply put, their personas inconsistent and are extremely lazily written.\\n\\n\r\n In essence, each character has a does have a definitive place in the story, however, they are never given the opportunity to develop. This is because their goals, morals, and ideals are latent and leave the watchers wondering what they value in relation to the story. By simply dedicating one episode to outlining each of the chief characters\u2019 back stories and ambitions, perhaps this mishap of mingled personalities could have been avoided altogether. \\n\\n\r\nArt + Animation 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the entire Toyko Ghoul TV series can be summed up in one word. Inconsistent. There are times where the fights are dazzling and perhaps even amongst the best of our time. However, for whatever reason, there are episodes where everything goes downhill and we are left with sloppy animations that can be compared to panning images encapsulated onto our screens. Overall, nothing particularly spectacular, although definitely not dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nThe show takes on a very modern art style, which may not have been the best idea, given the atmospheric conditions of the anime, but that\u2019s just personal preference. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the change in art in each ED sequence, and definitely something to take note of. \\n\\n\r\nSuffice to say, there are many potential metaphors and ways that Studio Pierrot make what you are looking at simple eye-candy. To illustrate this notion, the secret base Anteiku doesn't symbolize much per se, but the studio makes very good use of its poignance as a place in respect to both the themes of the show and the ostensibly prestigious cast. At best, you could call these moments the epitome of hype for this show, easily because they evoke great sentiment despite the poor writing of the said scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe ED and OP are phenomenal, but not pieces that the average person would listen to on their own time. Regardless, they are superb lyrically and sentimentally when situated in the dark thriller that they are associated with. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, it\u2019s hard to say whether it really complements the scenes themselves or simply diverges the audience\u2019s attention to the more beautiful tracks coupled in the OST. Genres vary from acoustic arrangements to electronic/dubstep, and I honestly cannot agree with every single piece\u2019s usage in the anime. However, one thing that I commend the studio for doing is for not straying away from pieces with lyrical accompaniment, and it honestly makes me wonder why studios seldom use such pieces. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, the pieces themselves are edifying, but can occasionally be misused at times where their presence is not ideal. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I cannot stand shows with bad writing. Therefore, the enjoyment I got from the show was very poor. However, I can see why people love this show, considering how simply abstract it is by nature. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you like dissecting a show just to see how bad it can get, this grandiose work of art is meant for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a show that you that you can take seriously one-hundred percent of the time, I advise you to stay away from this sequel; although in that case, it piques my interest that you didn't drop its prequel. That being said, it does fortunately have an abysmal list of redeeming qualities for the casual viewer. Perhaps, I\u2019m just a deranged critic and in that case, this blasphemous show is worth watching upon your personal whim. But beware, or you might find yourself binge eating it. \\n",

The colors blended together whenever they needed to set a scene. Nice and dull or very cheery depending on the intended mood. The sound quality had definitely improved from the previous Tokyo Ghoul. Once again the music never failed to fit in with the feel of the scene. However they did it again where they introduced characters and could have gone someplace with them, but however they either killed them off or we never saw them again. But the endingleft off many mysteries to be answered in the next chapter to the story. I thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA just as much, if not more than Tokyo Ghoul. Kaneki never failed to impress me. Still following him through his difficulties. He had fully adapted to living as a ghoul since the ending of Tokyo Ghoul. This anime is an amazing addition to the Tokyo Ghoul series and I cant wait till the next  Season.",

            "content": "Where to start...\r\nI first found Tokyo Ghoul at a pretty lucky moment. To be precise: Just a couple of weeks befor Root A was released. Don't ask why i write a review about the second season first, there is no reason. Reasons are for people that are not me!\r\nSo i watched the first season and it has been long since i anticipated the release of a new season of anything in a matter i did with Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nRoot A starts where the original stops - at Kanekis rescue...well, actually he doesn't get rescued, but rescues himself, but what else would you expect after the endingon season 1? Kaneki went from a whiny piece of something over well..still whiny, but at least he knows that fighting has to be done & actually helping, even without directly fighting himself to \"what did you say? Guy, my foot and your ass have an appointment!\" But at the same time he still remembers where he came from, why he is doing this - to protect Anteiku - and that he doesn't want this in the first place, but it is necessary. Well... and he sometimes loses his mind.\\n\r\nFor the rest of Anteiku i am a little confused that they are not at least slightly more outraged. They came to rescue him afterall and without any word to anyone except for Touka, he left and went to \"the enemy\".\\n\r\nWhich leads me to my actual favorite character: Eto aka Sen Takatsuki. Why i love this character? Because i see myself in her!\\n\r\nAlways sleepy, always late, always messy hair day. In addition she is an author (well... as her human identity ^^), just what i do for a living aswell. \\n\r\nSomething we sadly don't have in common... when she goes badass mode, she rocks. Sadly it only happens once and only for a short time, but i am pretty sure that in the future we will see more from her. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is a bit of a mess on the first view. We get a lot of hints on why XY is happening or why the character reacted like this, but a real explenation we have to search for. I am honest, that i sometimes read up in the wiki to be sure i didn't miss anything, but after rewatching is like 3 times already with the knowledge of the ending of the season & stuff from the wiki, it becomes fairly clear what is going on behind the scene.\\n\r\nThe story itself is still outstand and i hope they will follow up neatly in upcomming seasons.\\n\\n\r\nA flaw, i think, is the fact that the seasons are so short. 12 episodes is like nothing. And this also forces them to scrap out extra information that would have made the story easier to understand while watching it the first time, which also has been an issue in the first season. For example - i can't remember at least a short explanation, what the kagune is precisely, i had to use the wiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a bit of a let-down. Man Hide, what u dooooing? Don't pull off shit like that!\\n\r\nWell, i guess that had to do something like that, otherwise it would have been difficult to get from Root A to :re i guess.... soo, we will see if it is productive to the story in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, i am keen for season 3, it is one of my most anticipated animes.\\n\\n\r\n*Drinks a coffee* \\n\r\n....\\n\r\nwell...\\n\r\nok...\\n\r\nvodka...\\n\r\n x)\\n\\n\r\nCheers\\n\r\n-Vari\\n",

Characters were totally rushed they even introduced interesting characters without having the time to know them well. If you are someone who hates open endings and unsolved problems then this season isn't for you; it leaves almost everything hanging in the air. \r\nBut what I liked about it was the concepts and ideas it showed, It is a screwed up world and it will remain screwed up anyway ! \r\nBy coincidence I knew how this season deviated from the manga and I can totally say that this plot twist that the anime introducedmight have been even better than the manga's.  \\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong I have always been someone who prefers the manga over the anime but at this one point I support the anime. \\n\r\nIt  was a well-done twist in the story which needed more than 12 eps to show and finish and they couldn't handle it.

Like seriously, nothing was concluded at the end, the story was going soo great in season 1.\r\n Ken went all the way to the dark side to gain power, but to what end...?? He wasn't even able to protect anyone at the end of the day. He distanced himself and made himself the bad guy...but all for what?? He wasn't able to protect the old man, he wasn't even able to protect hisbest friend Hide. So what was the whole point of him running away and hurting everyone, all in the name of seeking power to \"protect them\". Most of his friends from the Caffe died, his best friend died, the old man died, the caffe which was finally a home for him was lost... So tell me now, how did all the power he wanted to get to \"protect them\" help?? The authors just went ahead and made him the worst main character ever. He lost everything and his actions were just a stupid waste. And another things was that he always talked about showing the world that humans and ghouls could co-exist, so I was expecting him to do something amazing. Maybe open the eyes of the police and others and let them see that even ghouls had as much right to live...maybe try to make both sides understand each other more.. But in the end he didn't do anything. He became the bad guy...abandoned those that cared for him, wasted what time they would have all had...damn it! He is truly truly the worst \"hero\" I have ever seen till now...he would have had the potential to be the best best, but I guess the author decided to throw that out the window, and made him look like a dummy who lost everything, and who could do or change anything...too bad...\\n\\n\r\nThis anime should be called a tragedy instead, they should add tragedy as part of the genre when describing the anime. Plus, there were just too many loose ends, and too many unfinished business..even the real Owl got away without us knowing the it's objective or it's identity. And why was everyone soo obsessed with Rize??! The story fwas just too incomplete, with characters popping out of nowhere, like who da f*** is Arima??! where did he come from?? How is he the strongest?? Why did the owl run away from him?? The anime had soo much potential, I actually expected much much more from the anime and from the characters.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is me just venting",

            "content": "Hello Everyone. \r\nFirst of all i wanna tell you that this is my first review ever made on myanimelist so i hope you will bear with me on this one.\r\nI looked through alot of the previouse reviews and i really couldent understand that everyone has rated this show so bad, i feel like this is one of the shows that really had something new to offer in the tons of anime we anime fans watch on a daily basis and i didnt agree at all with the bad reviews this show got, thus i made the commitment to watch the show for the third timeand give it a decent review. \\n\\n\r\nAs for story i really was intrigued all through most of the anime, it has a certain way to tell us stuff, sometimes in the scenery, sometimes in the base of a specific quote, but everything was important for the bigger picture. One thing i liked alot is the use of the weather/snow to express sadness. Or pictures corelating with music to explain a certain kind of athmosphere. This ofcourse helped to tell the bigger story in this anime. There was some episodes set up to tell us specific things before something big happened, this i think is really important and a nessesity to build up for something important and this is used throughout all shows. I will give the story a big 10 because there was never an episode or a minute i felt that this was boring i was always intrigued by some kind of story telling wich i find to be important and also there was a sense of uniqueness, i have never seen an anime being able to tell a story with the use of symbols and culture clash as this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFor anime Art is very important as anime shows is based on this, here i can tell that the arts of the show is uniquely beatifull in all aspects and is used to describe alot of the story, i love the setting of the art cause its tells us of the athmostphere wich is for me an important thing and it is used quite alot throughout the season. In one instance its used to make the little girl disapear in the dust wich i find quite cool, also together with the music its just an all out good corelation, to depicture certain vibes the viewer gets. Even thou im seeing this episode for the 3rd time im still seeing alot of symbols depicted in the art of the show this is what i really apreciate and forces me to give it 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\ni find the Characters the most important aspect and this aspect is the main reason why i watch alot of anime, as i love characters that has certain uniqueness. Kaneki Ken is the main character and i love that the author is holding information regarding him hidden, this is a very important thing to do cause it gives the viewer the freedom to think of the actions he does. We typically think why does he do this and try to set explanations to it. another thing i like about Kaneki Ken is that he is flawed, he is not the all around good guy wich we see in most boring animes he is very flawed. I also like the interrelationship he has with both Hinami and Touka. all in all a cool 10 here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs enjoyment for me is very hard to describe i would rather look at symbols, cause this season really has alot of em and its not depictured here as a rating wich i find pretty sad. in Tokyo Ghoul Root A we have alot of em:\\n\r\nThe anime tends to use scenarios to express certain feelings like crows flogging around an area or snow dripping sadly from the skies. Or Touka telling Hinami she doesnt wanna talk about Kaneki Ken, cause its too hard for her emotions to talk about it(she would rather shut her feelings up by ignoring it) I really love this cause its how many people would address the situation you would rather hold up the sadness instead of letting it all out and look weak, especially in front of a younger person. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe author of this manga is defo one of the best writers i have read, (yes i read the manga too) From the creation of the universe, the good vs bad setup(there are no good or bad^^). The culture clash with Kaneki-Ken stuck in the middle in a world he doesnt understand or know. The Author really knows how to setup symbols that the reader needs to catch in order for the story to make sense. This is not the story were everything is about the happy ending and i really like that, it is unique in the sense that this is about a world were both parties are in the wrong, they hate each other and cant corelate because of the basic needs of one party is to kill the other. So how do you make peace with two parties where one of the parties has to kill the other in order to survive? This is really a hard and difficult question the auther gives us. and having Kaneki-Ken in the middle of all of this really is entertaining and unique as hell.\\n\\n\r\nBtw a little spoiler alert i think:\\n\r\nSince some of you might have caught it too i think the little red girl is the author of the book Kaneki and Hinami reads ^^\\n\r\nThis is based on the legwork of them both and the weird smile they both have, as sayd everything is important in this story ^^ \\n\\n\r\nso ofcourse the overall rate of the show is 10 ;) \\n\r\nHope you enjoyed the review, have fun everyone!\\n\r\nKaneki-Sensei.\\n",

There are things that I liked about this series over the last one, such as more time devoted to The Doves, who I think are interesting as a balance to the world of Antique and the ghouls. I also thought the music, like the last series, remained consistent with the mood of the story. Iliked a particular scene where they talk about coffee, and I enjoyed hearing about Yoshimura's backstory. However, the series did become slightly as I had imagined before watching the first series, with not much justification to the violent storyline for our characters. And the pacing is just all over the place, and I feel that so many of the new characters that were introduced had absolutely no impact on the story. It never becomes unentertaining enough to be called \"bad\", per-se, but it still feels like a disappointment after the first series. \\n",

In Season 2, without Hanazawa, it regresses to its rightful bottom rating: 1 that is.\r\nStory: it consists of an infinity of gore and torture that was pure disgusting, although this season contains fewer disgusting torture scenes than season 1. Spaghetti plot and separate pieces of arches that scatter all over the place and interrupt each other. Story telling is at its worst, constant interruption and plot holes.\r\nCharacter: allcharacters invoke zero feeling from me. The MC was an otaku in season 1 and a snob in season 2 who pretended very hard to be cool and just ended up anything but. The female lead is a foul mouth tsundere who succeeded in making herself hardly likable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: it is astonishing that so many established VAs went into this anime. They are all talented but now they have to be forced associated with this unworthy drama. The songs are so so. OP and ED are better than the disaster ones from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Together with first season, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA was deleted from my hard drive immediately.",

Sure the show completely threw away the idea of trying to incorporate theme exploration and worldbuilding in favor of just mindless violence, but there were a couple of moments that I felt were well handled. The sound design and atmosphere in this anime for one are fantastic. The show really did a great job at making you feel uneasy at certain points. Certain locations within the show really felt like they had this ominous presence throughout and the calm moments really did feel like downtime after tons of bloodshed.OST is nothing special as a lot of tracks feel similar to the first season. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where my praise ends. The show for one likes to focus more on character interactions and battles than the actual plot itself. This would be fine if say they set out to develop a character but most of the conversations throughout the show just boil down to talking about studying for university exams or getting your book signed etc. Not to mention the character development in this seems to be non-existent. Kaneki in fact devolves into a complete emo, Amon is still the individual hell bent on revenge, Touka is fucking useless... You get the point. A lot of characters in this are underutilized and completely shoved to the side. Two twins are introduced early one but then they are never brought up again for the rest of the show. Why is Touka just being so useless? She's supposed to be a central character and all she does is spend time being depressed or trying to get into some university instead of contributing to the overall plot. And then when the plot actually tries to progress all it involves in some senseless violence between Ghouls and CCG members. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of emotional moments, the worse aspect of TG root A is just how emotionally manipulative it is as a whole. The show tries to get you to care for certain characters that aren't well developed enough or just do not deserve it as a whole. Certain characters suddenly pull a heroic sacrifice for some stupid reason and the music suddenly goes somber as if to say out loud \"this guy is dying, are you crying yet?\" All the emotional moments here feel way too forced and it works even less when these characters you're supposed to be caring for are nothing but psychos. Also there are also more flashbacks here than a generic Naruto episode and they happen at nearly every emotional moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights now are more or less just like every battle shonen out there. Full of random asspulls and power ups. And to make matters worse they aren't even well animated. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I said that I didn't feel it was as bad as people made it out to be, I meant that I didn't think it deserved a 1 or a 2 out of 10. So I'm just going to give it a high 3/10 instead. It is much inferior to the first season and chances are if Pierrot doesn't learn from their mistakes then I'm not looking forwards to the third.",

It also had a very interested development at the end of the season. Overall the first season was interesting and fun to watch. The second season has none of this. The character where bory and the story became boring. I considered watching another anime when I was only three episodes from the end because I did not feel very invested anymore. Although I will say that the art and action scenes were stillvery well done and enjoyable but it did not make up for everything else. The intro also somehow made me less interested in the show. The intro was so boring and it felt like the creators had $6 left on their budget to make an intro and put this together. Overall if you are considering dropping the show do it before you start season 2.",

            "content": "STORY - 3\r\nART - 7\r\nSOUND - 7\r\nCHARACTER - 5\r\nENJOYMENT - 5\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA decided it would be acceptable to slash away the good elements found in the first season. I can say that you're probably a deranged ghoul if you thought such a thing was a great decision. Now here we are, looking at this pile of mess we call the second season. Without a doubt, it had become a depressing scene that'll make you say \"What a bummer\u201d.\r\nTo describe this season, it's a lot less of the solid psychological massacre from the first season and more of a lousy breather to expand on theworld of ghouls and humans. Or actually, breather might not the best term to describe it knowing that the majority of its potential was ruined. Yeah, it's more of a suffocating gas. You tried hard to breathe, tried as much as you can to understand and care about what's happening in the narrative, but the gas turned you into doziness and confusion. Shifting the spotlight away from the ghouls of Anteiku towards the bigger groups from both sides, the CCG and Aogiri, was a key factor that contributed to the poor execution as a whole. The appearance of many characters while lacking the knowledge needed to know their role felt really pointless in the grand scheme of things. They appeared to fight and talk, and well, that's pretty much it. Introducing all these characters with little explanation or minimal context was a turf where questions arose. Why is everything happening? Who are you? What just happened? Even for existing characters, particularly Kaneki and Touka, they too suffered from this mess, getting downplayed into characters who left a phantom trail behind. Along with the jumbled up pacing, the story turned into a disconnected piece deprived of coherence. It's not good for what should had been a multidimensional world mixed with ghouls and humans. Short glimmers of backstory was not enough to expand on things. Small dialogues that come and go can only give us a gist off their relationships, but that's not enough to be impactful when they die or mourn. Investment was never there in the first place. A lot of plot elements were hanging at the end, barren and abandoned in the midst of everything.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story and character brought things down, then it's up to the art and sound to score a few points. And well, at least the audiovisual was better when it comes to presenting enjoyment. The muddied up colors of purple and red brought in a depressing tone, fitting the miserable state this anime consistently spewed out. I'm not saying that in a bad way because it did refine how the characters felt with how much they were surrounded by violence and darkness. Of course they'll find themselves fighting each other quite a lot. However, a lot of the fights felt awkward with lacklusting choreography and drawn out attacks. Connected loosely together with the narrative, the miniscule amount of tension packed little impact and served only to show clashes with no motives. Thankfully, from the climax thereon, the fighting animation became an improvement, somewhat increasing excitement towards the end. While the characters may be empty inside, their outside appearance was a shell giving off prominent coolness. We have the ghouls with their menacing looks bursting with predation and the folks of CCG equipped with their titanic armors and weapons. It's not lying to say these fights had a badass side to them, especially when they were backed up by good soundtracks. Sentimentality floated in the air with the atmosphere reeking despair for both sides. It's not a fight that comes without consequences, and the deaths and grieves the characters faced complemented with the music. Deep trembling of orchestral music was truly some powerful stuff. As for the insert songs, they had a profound feeling of emptiness which matched the hollow story. It's weird, but them playing was kind of ironic knowing they're probably meant to be emotional, not insubstantial. Just like the visual, the sound didn't fix much in the end anyway as it became an individual piece of enjoyment rather than a balanced whole with the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame how Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA decided to scrap away numerous aspects, degrading a lot of things from interesting all the way down to meaningless. It's a season where I could only grasp the surface of what's going on, and that's not going to do anything good to my enjoyment, safe for a couple of episodes. What a bummer.",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nSigh...\r\nWhere to begin with something I am so conflicted about. I'm sure if you saw the first season of Tokyo Ghoul you would have probably enjoyed and were highly anticipating a sequel. This is not the sequel the original Tokyo Ghoul deserved. If you read the manga then you would know Tokyo Ghoul and root A are a far cry from what they should be but the original season was still highly entertaining in its own right. Tokyo Ghoul root A falls way too short and does too much in too little time.\r\nStory:\r\nI was incredibly disappointed with the story here... There are too many charactersbeing introduced, and too many being 'developed' without showing how they developed. I will admit there were times where I was excited and anticipating what happened next, but branches and sub plots are just left open-ended and are not explored thoroughly enough. For example : The two half ghoul twins, Kurona and Nashiro's back story of how they became ghouls isn't explored at all. They just sort of appear for the first few episodes and never return. Also the reason for Aogiri Tree going into Cochlea is never explained. Was it to release Matasaka Kamishiro who also never makes a re-appearance? Or was it to just disrupt the CCG? Too many things are left unanswered. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art isn't terrible, in fact I liked the art style during some of the last scenes in the last two episodes like the fight between Amon and Kaneki was well done, but there are a lot of discrepancies in episode 4-5 during the Cochlea fights scenes.... Like the fight between amon and all those ghouls was just drawn terribly. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne of the higher notes for me. The opening and ending music was good, but I think Unravel should have been kept cause it was so awesome. I did like how they implemented Unravel in the final scene with Kaneki walking to CCG. The edited music of Unravel during that scene really brought everything together and made me feel so sad. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development:\\n\r\nBad. The word describes it all, the character development was straight up bad. Why? Because there was hardly any character development, people are crying, people are angry, people are making bonds, then said people who are making bonds with others die and everyone is back to crying again. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSome of the fight scenes were really well handled like the one between kaneki and Amon as well as the fight scene between the one eyed owl and all the CCG officers. There were also some funny bits which was surprising, but overall there was something still lacking in terms of action and dialogue between characters. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nMan this season has had its ups and downs and I am torn. Torn because I love the manga and enjoyed the previous season and feel obligated to stick with the show but also hate it for being such a mess compared to what it could have been. I will stick by this show though to see if it improves because It has such potential but never makes connections between its characters and the story.  5/10",

            "content": "Summary: Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA's story revolves around 3 different groups - The CCG, everyone at the Anteiku coffee shop, and Kaneki who, in order to protect everyone at Anteiku, joins the Ghoul association called Aogiri Tree.\r\nTo start off my review I would like to say I have not read any of the manga ,so this story is all brand new to me.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story seemed pretty mysterious most of the time, focusing mostly on the characters before it got down to the story, but when it did, it was -really- good. This would be rated higher if it wasn't so very mysterious and confusing alot of the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe show when it came to art, every character and background looked amazing. Though when it came to animation, it was either a hit or miss, pretty low quality in the first half, but then breaking out great animation in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWow, I have to give credit where it's deserved, the music was, to say the very least, breathtaking! The music made every scene just absolutely perfect, making and fitting the mood throughout the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nA lot of characters got their deserved development through the story, some more than others, probably Kaneki getting the very least, while the CCG getting a very good amount. The characters could have been better developed, because some just seemed to be there, but getting little to no attention at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly, given my ratings on story and characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, from the fight scenes, to the softer moments between characters, I loved Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThough I enjoyed watching this anime a lot, it definitely had some flaws, so I can't give it the perfect score that I want to give it. Would recommend this to any anime lover, Tokyo Ghoul is an amazing series.",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul season 1 while a bit overrated, was still a fun show with redeeming qualities. The second season, Tokyo ghoul root A was great fun and while people hate it, I found more enjoyment in it then in the original slightly. Let's talk about the flaws first,1 the opening theme, seriously it's a nice tune but to be honest with you it would have been a better ending theme,though the added symbolism to the song is nice. The ending theme however was great and in my opinion would have worked better as an opening. The characters are alright,Kaneki still isn't anything great though heis slightly more interesting than he was in season 1. And lastly I felt that some characters who were good in season 1 just kind of fell off this season to put it simply. For example there was one character who was extremely important last season but now she's just gone for some reason. But with these flaws brung a slew of pros. One is the actual music that plays during the anime. It is lyrical but it sets a fantastic mood throughout the scenes. Second the action,now in my review of season 1 I said I would have liked more quality action scenes,and well.....I got them. The action scenes this season were excellent just fast paced absorbing action which were very entertaining. The animation was very good as well with everything looking smoothed and polished.And lastly I also enjoyed the story I found it to be very compelling like last season. In conclusion I enjoyed root A heavily and I am very excited to see what will unfold in season 3. Root A is a must watch if you liked and enjoyed season 1.",

It was like any other shounen with a \"let's kick ass\" opening and a \"special\" main character who is weak in the beginning and gets stronger and stronger until he is almost unbeatable and kills the OP boss. The difference was that this character didn't get stronger until season 2 so season 1 was a pain but you will have to watch it to understand season 2 (obviously) But hang in there because season 2 was worth the wait. \r\nI can not begin to describe how well made this anime was but I'll startwith the opening. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people expected another \"Let's kick ass\" opening but they got something entirely different.  The entire intro consists of a weird piano line, a very unusual beat and disturbing lyrics matched to Kaneki's face which moves from time to time while female hands put on and take off his Ghoul mask. I loved it! \\n\r\nIn my opinion it captures the entire feeling of the anime. You're supposed to feel some kind of disturbing sick feeling along with deep sadness because that is what the entire anime has come to. \\n\r\nI thought it was refreshing and i watched the entire opening before every single episode. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack over all was amazing. I think they did a great job with both the openings and both endings as well as the mood music. It was all just spot on. Not to mention the beautiful art style and the beautiful colors. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, this one doesn't explain everything overly detailed. You know those moments in a fight where the evil character suddenly explains in detail how he did that move that surprised the hero. Those moments have been avoided and i find that very refreshing and it let me take this series seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere weren't too many back stories either and they only put down energy on letting you know the most important information. They didn't drag it out too much and they didn't give everyone a crystal clear past. From the glimpses you see you kind of have to figure out for yourself what kind of person they were and i have to confess. Many of those glimpses almost brought me to tears. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a very deep and emotional anime and i think the writer did a great job delivering the right kind of feelings to the watcher. \\n\\n\r\nFinally i will just say that thought i found this season beautiful there were some plot holes or unfinished threads. Non that I was bothered by, I honestly don't wish for a 3rd season because the ending was just too good! But it seems like it is needed because there are still some stories that were unfinished and it seems the ending kind of indicates that they will continue with the show. Nothing officially announced so far. \\n\\n",

For me i like tokyo ghoul \u221aA but that is only because i hav read the manga so i think season 2 is good if u read the manga to basically know the story and watch for the action etc like if u are a anime only viewer for tokyo ghoul \u221aA it will be bad because there will be things that u don't understand but if u watch and read it will be the best experience for you,\r\nThe plot for me was not there and i feel liketokyo ghoul \u221aA just skips and skips the story and if u are a anime only viewer u shouldn't watch this u can have ago at watching this by all mean but there are times were u wouldn't understand what is happening at some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thought i think the 1st season was great and the second ok (if u have read the manga) and average (if u haven't read the manga) and i just hope for the best for tokyo ghoul RE: (season 3) (it is not confirmed but a lot of clues that there will be another season)\\n\\n\r\n*NOTE if u want to read the manga start from the start cause the anime and manga are a lot different.\\n\\n",

In comparison to the manga our main character was less absent from our eyes, to a simpleton this is disheartening. To  those who watched it, and I mean actually watched it they'd find that \u221aA was the other side to the same coin.\r\nThe manga focused on Kanekidoing his own thing in the background of the actual story concerning the war between Aogiri Tree and CCG. Nothing he did changed the outcome of that battle, and in \u221aA it remained the same. I loved seeing what happened behind the scenes of the manga in the anime and it answered a lot of questions. The animation was flawless and the creator who worked with the staff to tell his original idea for the series did an excellent job of sliding in the answers to our questions of the first series of the manga, with more to come.\\n\\n\r\nAs I put in my original blog post to those that argue with logic? The story hasn't changed at all, Kaneki still suffers. No matter what path he chooses he winds up in the same place, facing the same obstacles, losing the same people.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful story, much better character development for everybody all around since Kaneki didn't change at all even when he was the centric focus.

In the beginning of the first season, kaneki was a weak boy that hated to do anything violent which completely contradicted his transformation. Along the way of his journey he meets a lot of different people and ghoulss that act as supporting characters to further his development into the being he didn't want to be at first. In the story, here are a lot of characters that you hate and love in the beginning and by the end of the second season you could be crying for the person that you hated in the first season.The character development is amazing. The story itself is kind of drawn up incomplete and the story line starts to get less exciting by the end of the second season. The story somewhat goes from a highschool DxD beginning to a black bullet middle and finally to a school days ending. Hope there is another ending to clear up the misunderstandings at the end of the second season or maybe some ovas where my ship becomes a reality",

It's more focused on Kaneki's mission to protect his family at all costs which was stated in the first season. And character development? How could you not see the character development with Kaneki? He's certainly changed from day one. I didn't like him as a submissive and shy human, but now that he's struggled and embraced his ghoul side, I find him much more interesting. \r\nJust wish Uta and Hide had been more involved in the anime.

Little glimpses of his old self still show through though to let you know not to give up on him and I think it payed off well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - Still a solid 10.

I just wanted to get my opinion out.\r\nTo be honest the only part I enjoyed about this show was introduction to a setting. An idea of a world where humans and human like monsters coexist is fascinating. It's really interesting how would world look like if we had other people of our kind who had to eat each other in order to survive.\r\nThe thing is the show has so many plot holes that it was completely impossible for me to focus on a showat all. Logic does not apply at all to this show, and if that was not overused I would be fine with that, but it's definitely not the case for this show. I am still wondering how I have managed to watch 17 episodes of this crap. One time a character who is human does not die from a thing that shoul clearly kill him and 30 seconds later a high level monster dies from something of a less threat that the thing that couldnt kill a human. Then there is a part about how ghouls regenarate and in one scene they seem invincible and in the other one they just die like flies when the plot wants it to. This list could just go on and on but you probably get the point.",

            "content": "I watched the first season and it was passable enough for a stingy, cynical, and calculating ass to move onto the supposed \"second\" season. Mother of god I shouldn't have.\r\nStory 1/10: This is all within the first episode and if spoiling the first episodes anti-climactic and nonsensical theme is enough to scare someone away from this disaster, so be it. \r\nBy the end of the first episode, for no actual reason, he decides to screw off and join the terrorists that just beat all his friends up, trashed their workplace, kidnapped him and tortured him for days. And he announces it to probably the mostpinnacle character to him, Touka, which causes an emotional breakdown considering the development between them so far.\\n\\n\r\nI figured it was going to be a plotline where he eventually comes back around from a poor choice through interacting with the friends and girl he left behind. But it proved time and time again that the main character was now a plot device for other characters. The closest we get to a main character is Touka, the basically-girlfriend whom gets no development besides other people forcing her decisions while ironically telling her to choose her own path.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that ending... Oh my god this is actually the worst and most contrived ending I have ever actually seen in my entire life to any kind of story. \\n\\n\r\nThe manga apparently has an equally dumbfounding \"ending\" for the same general story arc, but with that exasperatingly cliche and old memory loss gimmick. At least it leaves it open for continuing the pre-existing romantic tension, and it has already hinted at doing precisely that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10: It was decent enough and better than alot of anime, but compared to the last season the budget was most definitely cut or allocated strictly for the finale fights. Everything else is regular, and every other fight scene is rigid and nonsensical.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10: Kaneki's only dialogue is screaming. Touka's only dialogue is her wondering why Kaneki is being an angsty prick to her when literally everyone can see the budding relationship, even his best friend internally monologues that he has to treat her better or else he'll lose her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10: Written by an autistic midget who sharpened their pencil with their teeth. In otherwords, godawful and insulting to the previous season. Even more insulting to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10: My enjoyment towards the series was a roller coaster that basically coasted on literally zero. Then suddenly at weird times it gave the idea that Kaneki might stop being a faggot and come back to Touka and by extension the cafe. In fact it basically did push coming back for Touka and even hints it in the epilogue scene that she remains waiting.\\n\\n\r\nThe hope that Kaneki would come to his senses and the possible continuation of the romantic subplot that was realistically developing was the only thing that kept me pushing through this horrible, almost spinoff quality trash heap. Something that it never actually delivers despite constantly hinting it and characters hoping that precisely that would happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10: Do not watch. Read the Manga lest ye need chemo therapy afterwords.",

I found the first season to be slightly dull, but it set up the second season perfectly. \r\nTouka was my boo during this season. I couldn't get enough of her. In fact, I would've enjoyed it more if the series had a central focus on her rather than Kaneki. Also, I totally ship the two of them.\r\nAnyway, the ending is up in the air for me. I feel like I missed something because the  conclusion the second season came to seemed sort of hasty. Also, if the third season brings a new Kaneki without hismemories, I'm not sure that I'll buy into it. \\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, the last scene was epic. Even though it made me mad.",

            "content": "Let me preface this by saying this is just my highly unprofessional opinion.\r\nLet me follow this up by suggesting to not-watch this season, or if possible, don't watch the series in its entirety. The manga might be fine, I dno.\r\nNow for the slightly more in-depth reasons why:\r\nStory\r\nWhile watching, I felt like I missed entire episodes in-between episodes. Episodes felt jumbled and disconnected. I had no idea what was going on or why. Characters kept spouting cool-sounding but nonsensical one-liners. Motivations were questionable at best. There was no drive or end goal to look forward to. Most episodes were me wondering what was going on, andcringing at the ridiculousness of it all.\\n\\n\r\nTo give one specific example, at one point the ghouls go raid a prison. But it's never explained why or how; they just do. They free a bunch of mooks with wildly varying powers. A whole bunch of new characters are introduced and instantly discarded. At the end, it's like it never happened, except that Kanaki is now randomly more crazy than before, having thrown away his entire personality and what little bit there was to like.\\n\\n\r\nArt & sound\\n\\n\r\nFine, no complaints there. I don't think the songs were as good as the first season, but still fine. Art looked fine to me, and animation was find where it mattered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSecond big problem; there are a hundred-and-one characters who appear once, are a big deal apparently, then are never mentioned or seen again. Side characters are bumbling along fighting for screentime, and sure enough they get a bit more, but it doesn't really develop them any better. There are several character interactions that came out of nowhere, and lead nowhere. There was a random character background scene that, while cool, added nothing. Worst of all, Kaneki.. He went from a monotone pacifist to a whiny edgelord. I guess he's insane after what happened in season 1, but it kinda takes away any premise he had as a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall\\n\\n\r\nDue to the crazy nonsensical plot (or lack thereof), I literally couldn't watch anymore after 8 episodes. Even before then, it was a drag, forcing myself to put on another episode, hoping it'd be better than the last.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't.",

(i know that you're probably gonna watch \u221aA anyway after watching season 1 but whatever)\r\nOVERALL:  6/10 Okay, let's get to say that this season paled in comparison to season 1 with twists turns and confusing stuff that really made it boring.  Kaneki became scary and it made you feel almost sad for the Doves who were trying to kill him.\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10 Let's start by saying that Touka deteriorated into a mess that couldn't even help herself. Kaneki was kicking butt and all she could do when he left to join that society was beg him to stay. Kaneki became distant tome and he was hard to understand though he lived in a moment of conflict where moments of raw emotion sometimes clouded his judgment, he still seemed like a stranger in a way and the way he reacted to things seemed way too predictable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10Every episode Kaneki sounds like he is a strangled goose. While trying to cope with his powers he can't help but screech and my ears were beginning to suffer. (it was funny that everyone just stood there and watched as that happened)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 In the manga the art I loved, here it wasn't as breathtaking but I still liked it. Everything worked with it and the animation was nice and flowed together. If anything, that was the best thing about it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If you didn't know, it wasn't a direct carbon copy of the manga but they made it work. Some parts were confuzzling and convoluted and they had odd scenes. The type of kunai that Kaneki had was way too confusing to understand I had to consult various Reddit threads to completely understand what was going on to Kaneki. In contrast to Season 1, \u221aA is a failure.\\n\\n\r\nHOLA. wo de. tomodachi.",

I wasn't satisfied with my output. I took to long to come to the one thing I really wanted to write about. So I deleted this first, pathetic review of mine and started all over again, but this time I will get directly to the meat of the show:\r\nThe sound, the sound! THE SOUND!!! I fucking love the sound of Tokyo Ghoul. It alone is reason enough to watch the whole show, and I don't just talk about goodsoundtrack or songs. Many shows have a good soundtrack  but aren't worth watching because of them. No, no, no.... I talk about the whole sound design. I often leave a show thinking that I like the soundtrack just because the show could get me emotional attached to it with it's narrative or directing. But that isn't the case in Tokyo Ghoul, it's actually the other way around. And that's awesome as fuck! The sound design itself gets me more emotianlly attached to the show rather than the other way around. That was the first I experienced something like that (or atleast that was the first time I consciously noticed that) and it rocks!\\n\\n\r\nSo, what are you still doing here? Thinking about the meaning of life? Get the fuck out and watch Tokyo Ghoul for god's sake! Yeah, I know... There are other things like characters, directing and animation to talk about. But I don't care. These things were good enough for me so that I could enjoy the show and especially the soundtrack and sound design. And, as I said, this is enough for me to like the show. But if you still need this crap covered for you there are countless other reviews on MAL who joyfully do this for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now excuse me, I'm going to enjoy myself over the marvellous soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul while jerking off to some fan-art.\\n",

            "content": "[SPOILER FREE]\r\nSo this is my first review on this site, so expect something a bit weird. I wanted to start with Akame ga Kill!, but I felt as if this would be much more easier to do first as I'm much less bias on this rather than that.\r\nStory [6]:\r\nThe story gives us the well deserved season 2 we needed to a great anime. The problem comes when most of it was just filled with... well... filler. Filler isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when you put in filler for a season that's just 12 episodes long, that's a bit disappointing. For me, it was annoyingas I was watching this on Toonami, so I had wait a week before I could see the next episode. But to be fair, like I said, it gave us the season 2 we needed and did have it's moments, so here's a \"fair\" 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]:\\n\r\nThe artwork is good as usual. Not as great as season 1 did, but still good. I am counting animation, and I would have to say the action is pretty lack luster they could have done so much better. That's all I have to say for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8]:\\n\r\nI don't usually pay attention to sound, so I'm going to make it short. It wasn't horrendous and Glassy Sky was a fine song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7]:\\n\r\nAgain, short. There was some moments of character change, side story, and love, but some of it wasn't needed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [5]:\\n\r\nThe filler was annoying and the action scenes were a bad representation of season 1. Seriously, during fighting moments, people would just stand in the background, acting as if standing still would do something while two other their guys were getting hacked and slashed. They could have animated it much better, but they were lazy instead. I'm half on this because at least I got a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [6]:\\n\r\nThis is a bit boring, but a season 2 we needed. If you are coming from season 1 and want to watch this, it's best to watch it if you are seriously curious of what happens in this season.",

What I was expecting from this was another brilliant adaptation of an equally brilliant manga that we had seen in the first season, and I was sorely dissapointed. A confusing plot coupled with unexplained characters that even birthed the joke of \"you'd get it if you read the manga\" who's only redeeming qualities is good animation and a singular memorable song brought me to tears not from emotional pain, but from the suffering endured of audibly exclaiming my dissatisfaction with the stripping of an originally well written story reduced to a sub par second season. Quite simply, I just don't understand howthis happened. A near perfect adaptation of the first season showcased the emotional and psychological pain and horror of the destruction of one's humanity that was wrapped up in an eerily eliquent ending that certainly stayed in my mind for plenty of time after viewing it. While no masterpiece (as many of the more hardcore and \"edgy\" fans treat it), it certainly superceded this second season immensly and instead of wasting four hours of your life you should simply go to your local bookstore or find a website and read the source material.",

            "content": "There were no words, and yet there were so many because this anime had left me disappointed. The second season of Tokyo Ghoul actually had a few ups, but there were too many downs that I could not enjoy this anime at all. I honestly was hoping this season would get better after what happened in the last episode of the first season (I won't spoil it just in case). I can appreciate Kaneki this season though,  he finally had the personality I was looking forward to seeing from the very beginning. He was crazy, a little too crazy but it was awesome, andyet he still held onto a part of his normal human self, he still had a heart, and that was stirring. However, the other characters seem to still be stuck in that same rut as before. I was still unsure of their purpose for being in the anime and whether or not they made a difference in the story. What made my head spin was the fact that they introduced so many new characters in this season, some came into the spotlight last minute and I was thinking, \"um, who are you and why are you here?\" The story was still completely lost and mixed up just as before, but some how I was able to keep up and knew, somewhat, as to what was going on; but that doesn't excuse the poor development of the story. Nevertheless, I will say the battles were pretty captivating, but again it doesn't make up for the lack of story. And then there is the finally episode of this season, the one that is suppose to tie it all together and complete the series... Unlike last season where I was in awe, this one left a bitter taste in my mouth, my head and my soul. It was a bunch of vile garbage that I was not expecting, it made me angry. I am pretty sure I screamed at the TV saying, \"what a bunch of bull,\" along with a few other words. Though this anime has many weaknesses there are some good aspects to it as well. The art was beautiful, especially the end credits, it was done on par. The sound was decent, I actually quite enjoyed the end credits theme and the soundtrack used for this season. Most of all I found the plot of the story quite enticing. It made me really think what the world is like, how we are all monsters in some way. I again do not want to give away too much, but that was probably the best part of the series; though it is not it's saving grace, it was still an unpleasant watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was okay. There were some good points but too many bad ones that it could not save itself. The art was surprisingly alluring, it was not just the beginning or end credits, it was throughout the whole season, and I appreciate that tremendously. The sound was nice, nothing fantastic but enjoyable. The characters... While Kaneki was a nice surprise fix, they lacked on doing it for other characters. The enjoyment was there for a pref moment, but it was lost as the series continued. This anime was not pleasant to watch but it was not awful. However, what killed it, for me at least, was that finally episode!",

            "content": "When I looked through these reviews I seen a trend that is common among not only anime/manga circles but also in book vs. movie adaptations. Most people are reviewing this anime by stacking it up against it's manga. Where does it say anything about a comparison to the manga in the rubric? This is a common fanboy/fangirl issue. When you critically review a piece of work, you are to review it fairly and only really draw comparisons to other works like that work. You wouldn't compare the Mona Lisa with Shakespeare's Othello right? They're two totally different animals.So, when you review Tokyo Ghoul Root A, you really should only be comparing it with other anime, not with the manga. Using that concept, I have found that this anime stacks up very well with it's peers. Yes, there are some plot holes and the occasional, \"wait, why did he do that,\" but for the most part, the story is somewhat easy to follow. The artwork and music are both beautiful. Tokyo Ghoul has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard: Glassy Sky, Unravel, and the CCG theme(what, I like the beat). The characters are all generally likeable. I personally enjoy Tsukiyama, Juzo, and Nishiki just to name a few, but there some I wish there was some more clarity on like Shachi, Yomo, and Amon.  Overall, I greatly enjoyed this anime, in spite of \"inferior it is to the manga.\" I recommend it 8/10.",

Everyone was telling me to read the manga because of how great it was and I obliged.\r\nNow, usually when I do this I end up being a fan of both the anime and manga, but it didn't work out this way at all. When I finished the manga (not counting :re of course), I was in tears and just amazed at how amazing it was. The characters, story, art, everything was stunning. It's easilymy favorite manga of all time. After I finished I decided to re-watch the anime, which was a mistake.\\n\r\nGoing from the manga to the anime is like going from Gucci store to a thrift shop. Everything just felt wrong. Hardly any of the characters got any screentime, there was little to no character development, and, I know this was supposed to be different from the manga, but that doesn't excuse how poorly everything was done.\\n\r\nSo many important characters were forgotten, which was its biggest downfall to me. Tokyo Ghoul is full of wonderful characters with great backstories and they were all just pushes aside. As well as this, they left so many plot holes that you'd only know if you actually read the manga.\\n\r\nPlease, if you did enjoy the anime I urge you to read the manga because I promise it's so much better, and if you didn't I'd still recommend it because I can understand why many people didn't enjoy the anime.",

            "content": "If you look at my picture thinking that Tokyo Ghoul is my favorite anime don't judge a book by its cover. I'm not a person who reads manga, so I know there are answers to some things I question but this review will be in the eyes of someone who only judges anime. This anime had a lot of flaws but did OK not good, not bad, but it's something worth trying out.\r\n    Story 5/10: To start off Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA fails to explain clearly as most episodes made me question a lot. Throughout the episodes, characters hadkept mentioning or talking about Kaneki the protagonist. Sadly he never does anything in the first episodes. During the first episode, he joins Aogiri, which didn't really give a good explanation why I think it was he wanted to become stronger or something something? However, he did nothing there. However, he captured ghouls without giving a reason AGAIN. The story never explained the purpose or goal of getting Ghouls. Kaneki never did anything through beginning and middle of the season. It had ignored side characters and some main characters and threw them in the trash. When it made Kaneki get his super power it never explained what was that or even mentioned it again. I felt that the story was rushed and if was paced good enough the story would explain more and make this mediocre anime into a decent or even good anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10: Pierrot studios failed to animate this. The art style was good don't see any horrendous flaws until I saw the animation and animation in fights. During the first episodes of the fight scenes the animation was so bad I felt that animators down at Pierrot studios were bankrupt but still decided to continue making Tokyo Ghoul, and went to Mcdonalds using their internet getting the old PC and using photoshop to animate. Fight scenes were like a slideshow it never gave me chills it was very bad. During the late episodes, however, Pierrot studios kept begging out in the streets and got enough money to make decent art animation for the last fights. Even the opening animation was cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Come on now, its really hard to not like the soundtrack, Unravel is still played in season 2 and is great as ever, it places it in emotional times, its opening was ok I didn't like it but it does fit into the genre. Tokyo Ghouls ED was the best hands down. I don't speak Japanese, but I remember all the lyrics of \"Seasons Die One After Another.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: Most characters in the show were forgotten. Picture this its a basketball game and your team is losing, then an underdog comes along and carries your team to victory! The coach was so impressed that in the next game he had completely forgotten about that underdog and placed him on the bench. That's how I felt most characters were introduced. A very few characters were actually shown in the story and they still didn't get much screen time. Touka who played an important role in season 2 was shown quite a bit but was never interesting. In the last episodes of the season I was laughing so hard, Touka ran for three episodes (No spoilers) trying to reach her location. I felt like she was at least 30 miles away or that she is the slowest runner to live. Kaneki the biggest character was somehow never shown in the beginning episodes as much as I wished.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: As much as I hate this show and its flaws it is decent. It was good in the late episodes but did poorly in the first episodes. It times it had me chill and made me sad but still had flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: I expected a lot in this anime, however my expectations were not even close to being met, this show wasn't good, however this doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it, its still something worth your time, but now Im going to read the manga.",

I\u2019m sure that they are 100% true (most of the time the manga is far more superb than the anime adaptation and for that the anime that follows the manga is more successful) .But I would like to do some justice to it and write something about this season and not compare it to the manga, just think about it like something completely separated ( it\u2019s not ideal I know).Something that I enjoyed in my free time\r\n(please take note that I have not read the manga) \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, one of the best things about it it's how realistic humans seem to be and their relationships between them.The reasons behind their actions and motives. I loved that contrary to season 1, which made you kind of hate the humans and lean towards the ghouls, this season gave you an insight into the humans too, and those that firstly looked like the \u201cbad guys\u201d suddenly had a reason behind their \u201cunjustified actions\u201d. The tragicness arises from the fact that even though we finally figure out their reasons and justify them, at the same time we  come to the realization that the outcome was everyone's doing,It was everyone\u2019s fault. ( at least in my perspective) .Everyone was right and at the same time wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to point out the absolutely amazing soundtrack . The acoustic version of \u201cUnravel\u201d(and the exact scene that was played ) was breathtaking .Also,  the song \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d made it to my top anime songs.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, I would like to point out the apparent  plot holes. Personally, I enjoyed the anime enough not to let it bother me that much, but I would definitely read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I absolutely recommend this and suggest to just forget the manga for awhile and enjoy the whole aesthetic of it.",

Which is funny because the more interesting fights, events, and characters were left out of the show. A lot of this could be narrowed down to the time constraints of twelve episodes. Which begs the question of why was this even attempted? Given the success the first season had, surely a longer run time could have been done.\r\nArt is basically the sameas before. \\n\\n\r\nSound with the exception of the opening is the same. In hindsight, they should have reused the original opening. Unraveled is a tough act to follow. The chance of lightning striking twice with hit openings is very unlikely.  \\n\\n\r\nKaneki's character is completely destroyed by this adaptation. The writers have hurt him more than any character ever could. It's like watching a different person. \\n\\n\r\nAny enjoyment a viewer can get from this show is directly inverse to the amount of source material read. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is the worst adaptation I have ever seen.

The art for Tokyo Ghoul is one of those things where even if the plot was horrible, you've got to give it praise for the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it's the manga artwork or the animation art, Tokyo Ghouls art, in general, is some of the best I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nSome of the voice actors were a bit eh, in my opinion, some of the songs didn't fit in with the scenes, some songs were pretty unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were decent. Stayed pretty much the same from last season. The character development was nearly non-existent, I'd go as far as to say the only characters who really developed were Touka, Kaneki and Hide.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nI can't find it in me to enjoy this season AT ALL. It had so much potential and then it completely turned to garbage (In my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI deeply recommend that you read the manga from Chapter 1 of the first manga so that you can see how good the second season could've been, fair warning that Tokyo Ghoul:re is not where you should start off if you want to continue with the Tokyo Ghoul, there are tons of plot holes in both seasons of the anime and you really should read the manga from chapter 1 to understand.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you don't want to which is perfectly fine. I just wouldn't have a conversation with anyone in the fandom that read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed reading that! Sorry if it was too long!",

            "content": "Okay so let's start things off with \"This is my first review\". Now before you stop reading there, let me say that that I have waited before I have watched over a hundred different anime's and almost every genre possible before I can give my accurate opinions on these shows.\r\nNow to the actual review itself:\r\nBefore I see comment's \"This is so **** the manga is the best, **** the anime\", how about you actually read everything I have to say before you spread your butthurt around the world.\r\nThe first thing I'll say is that I have not read much of the manga (but am planningto) but whether I have or I haven't definitely wont and cannot change the rating of the anime. For this anime I thoroughly enjoyed in every possible way and to this day \"Tokyo Ghoul Root A\" is still my 4th most favourite anime. Just because it is different from the manga (or because everyone seems to go full rage mode when an anime differs from the manga), doesn't mean it can't be an awesome show to love. I decided to start my first review on this show because of all the hate towards the anime adaption (and maybe because my room mate rates it 1/10). But no, I will not get butthurt and develop a severe case of anime butthurt disease syndrome, but instead, will calmly tell you why I really enjoy this anime and why it deserves a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nSince I'm assuming you're reading this because you've seen the first season, it shouldn't be a problem putting season 1 spoilers here. The story on Root A leaves off from when Kaneki was tortured by Jason, Kaneki breaks free and Kaneki's personality greatly changes. The story of Root A followed this very well, becoming more in depth about the differences between humans and ghouls and making me very emotionally attached to this series. To be brief, the story of Root A is a very touching story about the relationship between Ghouls and Humans which can often invoke the question \"What is the difference between a Ghoul and a Human?\" and through every little battle and every little dialogue, it helps the viewer define and understand the differences between the two on a physical, mental and even emotional level. As a fan of deep psychological anime, the story of Root A really hit me hard in many ways and I always had many different thoughts about both Humans and Ghouls and who is really the bad guy. I'll leave it at that to prevent spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe art sticks to the typical style of anime and is very appealing to the eye with the animation being very smooth and I had absolutely no problems with the art. There was no annoying 3D aspect or weird shapes that just... made no sense, It was just a really good choice of art style and animation that everyone will enjoy without having any problems about.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nI must say the sound in this show has one of my best soundtrack's in any show I've ever seen. Epic music during the fight which gets your attention but still has a tint of sadness which makes you remember more then just the fight.  Sad music during the right times and I don't think there was many, if any happy songs, since the show certainly does not suit any happy or positive music whatsoever. Not just the music suited the events, but the music was composed perfectly just like in the original series. I have the entire OST downloaded and I still listen to it today because of how brilliant the music is. Ill also briefly mention the voice actors fit the characters perfectly, with no one sounding out of place, and the sound effects were also a perfect match. Ill never forget the sound of a Quinque and a Kagune smashing together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThis is probably what makes me love the show the most, second to the story. Root A goes much more in depth with character development then in the original series. Even though you aren't Kaneki, you can still feel what he is feeling and you can still emotionally relate to these characters even though you pretty much have almost nothing to do with them. Every character in Root A is very memorable and are all very different. They also progress very differently within the show as well. Even if they spend most of the show on the sidelines you still feel very attached to these characters, whether its a ghoul or a human character. You feel like both sides are good, both sides are bad, because even if the character at first is portrayed to be the enemy, as you watch more of them, you start to feel more connected to the character and start to barrack for the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nWith all the story, art, sound and character stuff aside, I generally extremely enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul Root A and I watched the whole thing in one night at 2AM in the morning, not going to bed until I finished it because I simply just couldn't turn it off and go to sleep I was that attached to it. There definitely aren't many shows out there that have made me do the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nJust to end this, even If you really liked the manga and you are disappointed that the anime isn't the same, just like the anime for what it is. Sure it might be a different show to what you read, but it is still, one hell of an amazing show. So just put down the book, and forget about the manga while you let this show borrow 4 hours of your time and just... Enjoy it.",

Immediately leaving off from the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, Tokyo Ghoul Root A perfectly displays kaneki's leave of anteiku and the struggles he faces.\r\nThe action for this series was beautifully animated and each fight felt like it had a purpose or meaning behind it. Closely followed with the stunning soundtrack that left me speechless creating some of the best scenes I've seen in anime. \r\nThe development of characters throughout the season through flashbacks and events was amazing and mademe attached to many of the cast. Each character with their own hardships and reasons for their actions creating a unique range of cast that just improved my enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories build-up was perfectly executed and didn't have any meaningless content. The entire of the story building up to the grand finally that left me on the edge of my seat wanting more was beautiful and will is unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I definitely give Tokyo Ghoul Root A a 10/10 and highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen the series to immediately check it out.",

You get a chance to see the the motivations of Amon (and his past), Mado's daughter, inspector Suzuhara and so\r\nOn the other hand\r\nKaneki quickly falls on to the Shinji Ikari tier, doing nothing and regretting his existence. Ok, he has a reason, he was tortured and so, but i find this type of characters who spend all the time regretting his past really annoying.  During the course of the 12 episodes Kaneki does little to nothing, hehadn't any real reasons to abandon the anteiku \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters like Touka are more of a support than other thing, loosing some of the impact of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this second season it's worst than the first one. I recommend it to you if you like the first one and you want to continue. If you didn't like the first, this would be worst to you.\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is the second part of the (currently) three-part series that falls under \"Tokyo Ghoul.\"  \r\nThis season is, overall, on par with the first season of Tokyo Ghoul.  The story was intriguing but nonsensical at times.  One major hindrance was the continuous swanning in and out of characters or lack of character follow-up.  You'll see a character for an episode or two and then... *poof* - they're gone.  Only to show up a few episodes down the line.  To make matters worse, most of the time, there is no explanation given for their disappearance and no realneed for their re-appearance.  Another constant issue with this show is the rushing and packing in of content.  Instead of splitting this season up into 20 or 30 episodes, it's still capped at 12.  This led to many missed opportunities of both storyline and character development expansion.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly generic and on par with the rest of anime's industry-standard.  Character designs are unique, no two characters look recycled or based off of a similar template.  The animations were fluid and not choppy.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English DUB of this show (again) and the quality was decent, comparable to the first season.  Voices felt natural for their respective characters and no voice seemed out of place.  Sounds and SFX within the show also felt well-made and not forced.  However, I would like to point out that the sound of leaking blood did feel over-emphasized.  For example, a few droplets of blood would be made to sound like a mini-waterfall.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters didn't seem to grow throughout the show.  This was a complaint that I had with the previous season as well.  Except for the last episode, even the main character, Ken Kaneki, had the exact same disposition all throughout the season.  His personality was static in Season 1 save for the last episode.  During the last episode of S1, Kaneki went through a major personality shift and from then on until the end of this season (S2), his personality remained static.  Yet again.  This was reflected in most of the other characters as well.  They all seemed comfortable in their respective bubbles and unwilling to change, reflect, or work on their character weaknesses.  In some cases, this led to severe consequences.\\n\\n\r\nJudging from what I've written above, it may not seem like it but I enjoyed watching this season - overall.  I became accustomed to the constant gore, bloodshed, and lack of character development.  Truly, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA is not a bad show.  But it's not an amazing one either.  It's one of those \"eh, I can't go wrong with this one\" type of shows. It neither amazes you, nor does it let you down.  It's \"average\" in every sense of the word.  I will admit that I am down to re-watch the show if I find some spare time.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'll find something new and exciting that I may have missed the second time around?",

And spoiler alert: they'll keep doing doing this until the end of the series. There just wasn't enough time and space to flesh out the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) : Some nice fights that get you pumped and great timing between scenes help the anime's rating by a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ( 6) : Could be a LOT better.

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul Root A is maybe not the AOTY 2015, but because I see it collects here only criticisms at best not very fair, I must restore the balance of the opinions.\r\nI think the problem, above all, is the state of mind with which we perceive this second season. Indeed, in the echoes which I received from Tokyo Ghoul, there was hardly only of three sorts: \"S1 is a little bit boring but in S2 it gets interesting\", then \"S2 is a waste which murders S1\", and \"S2 isn't canon compared to the manga since Pierrot has fucked it up\". And indeed, we have infront of us 2 seasons with different rhythm which do not have much in common between them. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, when we spoke to me about Tokyo Ghoul, in view of the name, the pictures, the first minutes of the first episode of S1 with a glowing Rize, and... a certain white-haired boy who can \"no longer see the world\", I imagined at once something bloody , violent, merciless; a persistent war between ghouls and humans until the annihilation. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, I felt an afterstate of slice of ghoul life, in front of a S1 which has certainly its moments of cruelty and tragedy, but which gets mainly down to show us that ghouls are as the human. They too have their ties, their pains, their hopes, their despairs...\\n\\n\r\nIt was not what I expected, but it wasn't unpleasant after all. It is necessary to be immersed, this season is essential to blur the manicheanism, make us wonder ourselves of which side we take place in this war.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes sense only because we know the battle arrives. The last episode of this S1, symbol of its depth, justifies everything, and represents a transition towards a more bestial S2 putting an end in this \"calm before the storm\".\\n\r\nBut let us bend over this S2. The answer is yes, it reigns a certain confusion... a certain lack of sense in the plot's structure. However, I would here want to bring a nuance: it's not inconsistent for all that. Those who didn't read the manga are certainly going to miss some information, and in order general the decisions of the characters are not clarified. But nevertheless, by making a little effort there, they can easily, and even with the few of elements they have, to understand what it takes place and why.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest riddle, of course, remains Kaneki Ken, our protagonist. It's maybe the one who seems most emotionally weak at first sight. However, you shouldn't forget as far as himself, in the situation, is not necessarily capable of being completely rational, having lost its innocence. Even if he makes a little bit debatable decisions, it works. It's not a plot weakness, but a will to let the public think about cogs. His character developpement is memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, it's a season much more turned to the action, with an anthology OST and a magnificent animation made by Pierrot which hits the score, and can show itself rather epic. The characters psychology is not aside left for all that, it's even more developed than in S1... But it's moved, expressed through flashbacks which often take 1/4 or 1/3 of the episodes (it's not inevitably a flaw).\\n\\n\r\nAccording to me, without saying about it too much, THE big flaw of this season is the end: excess of doors left open, too many tracks which we would have liked seeing exploited throughout the anime and which are dedicated to remain unsettled; despite of a conclusion endowed with a beautiful staging. But I saw it in so many series, and especially I saw so worse than that, I don't see of what complain here. It's less hateful than the disease from which suffer so much animes when, in two episodes of the end, they begin to hesitate absolutely anything, to accelerate things and arrive at a conclusion, which besides making no sense, most of the time solves nothing for all that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, it's time for the notation :\\n\\n\r\n-Story part : 4/10\\n\\n\r\n.An average pacing, too slow in S1, and too fast in this S2. (0,5/2)\\n\\n\r\n.A pretty good premise like S1, with an freshly enigmatic Kaneki. (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Complexity isn't really present.. Too much focus on the protagonist. (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Regarding Plausibility, there are some obvious plot holes. (0,5/2)\\n\\n\r\n.A conclusion which makes diverge passions, and disappoints me. (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n-Animation part : 9/10\\n\\n\r\n.Good production value. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Great use of shadows and darkness, good visual effects. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Memorable character design (Special mention to Eto. Spooky.) (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Well animated (Especially to the end of the show)and very good staging. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.A decent background, but there is a lack of details. (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n-Sound part : 8/10\\n\\n\r\n.High quality sound effects. (2/3)\\n\\n\r\n.According to me, an anthology OST (Special mention to White Silence which isn't integrated in the show : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NogZeIey-Jo... This is art.) (3/3)\\n\\n\r\n.A great voice acting (Special thanks to Eto again...). (2/3)\\n\\n\r\n.Good BGM, atmosphere is immersive. (1/1)\\n\\n\r\n-Characters part : 8/10\\n\\n\r\n.Acceptable presence, especially with the main characters. (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Very poignant catharsis, definitively. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.High quality character developpement, in particular in Kaneki and Amon. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Detailed and deep characters personality. (2/2)\\n\\n\r\n.Good but incomplete backdrop... (1/2)\\n\\n\r\n-Miscellaneous part ( doesn't count in the notation ) : 7/10\\n\\n\r\n.Good Rewatchability. (2/3)\\n\\n\r\n.Disappointing OP and ED contrary to S1. Just saying. (0/1)\\n\\n\r\n.Enjoyment is here. It'll stay in my memories. (5/6)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis S2 thus has nothing exceptional. It's true, it doesn't reach its full potential, but the whole thing remains effective despite of these frustrations.",

There was this sort of disconnect where the story line and character development became scattered at the start, and it became continuously difficult to grasp just where the plot was intending to go. It felt aimless episode after episode. The disconnect was furthermore enforced by the near nonexistent character growth of the MC,  Kaneki Ken. Aside from a few passing glimpses of his \"well-being\" throughout the season and thesudden personality flip, his development as a character seemed otherwise abandoned. I do admit that the only episode of the season that gave a truly awe moment was the connection between the last episode and the season's cover art--but, spoilers.",

            "content": "So Root A wasn't the best thing that ever came out of anime studios. For one of the most hyped anime of early 2015, a lot of anime viewers were sorely disappointed by the second season of Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nSTORY- 5/10\r\nSo the overall storyline is fairly interesting with some problems here and there (mainly why Kaneki would join the organization that kidnapped him a week ago), but looks decent if you read about it. But the execution of the plot was terrible, and in the first half (the original part), I was clueless to half the stuff going on. The ending was also a point ofcomplaint among many viewers, which is part of the reason why Tokyo Ghoul :re has a lot of readers now.\\n\\n\r\nART- 8/10\\n\r\nWell Tokyo Ghoul had good fights but Root A lowered the quality a bit in some areas (since Kishou Arima clearly has a pointed chin). Kaneki looks freaking amazing, better than in the manga IMO, some of the fights were kinda crappy (like Kaneki vs Shachi) while others were fairly good (although one in particular was obscured with fog, which was kinda a bad thing). Not a huge point to complain here.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 8/10\\n\r\nI really do believe Tokyo Ghoul's soundtrack, both seasons, are underrated. While Tokyo Ghoul's OST can't compare to Hiroyuki Sawano or Yuki Kajiura, it still has some outstanding tracks, and they really make you see the desperation of the ghouls as they are forced to fight for their survival. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 7/10\\n\r\nKaneki is a rather mixed character for me. On one hand, his development at the end of the first season was the biggest for a single episode of anime I've ever seen, but such a quick and dramatic change is met with some of his old behavior and we see why he joins Aogiri, but I still fail to understand why he just doesn't form a task force to shake Tokyo up (like he did in the manga). Other characters were decent, but Shachi from the first half really confused me as to why he acts like he does (I mean come on, why would you do what he did to a random guy?).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 9/10\\n\r\nI love this part of the review since I can say whatever I want to say about the anime and no one can say a thing about it. Okay, I freaking loved watching this anime, even knowing its flaws. The beautiful soundtrack, the (semi) great animation, the intriguing premise of ghoul society and how they  attempt to survive is really something worthy of praise. Sure there are plot gaps, but I liked this show so hahaha haters.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 6/10\\n\r\nContradicting everything I just said in the Enjoyment category, Root A was not a good anime due to all of its plot holes and dip in animation and confusing characters. I would recommend watching it but take caution (and for f***s sake, stop hating on this show so much, if you want a bad show, watch Gundoh Musashi or Pupa).",

            "content": "I hoped this review wouldn't be one sided but unfortunately this sequel to Tokyo Ghoul is (as a friend of mine told me) trash.\r\nFirstly this a review for the sequel alone so if you haven't seen Tokyo Ghoul then these are gonna be spoilers. The show picks up where it left off with the battle between Aogirii (a Ghoul faction in Tokyo) and the CCG (human counter measures for ghouls, 'ghoul police' essentially), while Anteiku (Kaneki's Ghoulfriends (ha)) attempt a rescue. This quick plot synopsis is necessary.\r\nFirst its essentially because these are last remnants of the first season. From this point there were problems. Beforethe story was about Kaneki finding out about the world of ghouls but now the focus is divided between Kaneki and what the impact of actions that occurred that day. Not bad since its called Tokyo ghoul not 'Kakneki Ghoul', but before the story before went semi-randomly into its plot in a natural and believable way but root A's plot really just seems to go from A to B for the sake that the plot has to exist. At least now there is more mystery but that's primarily because the plot just seemed to be setting up for 3rd season in a way I'm relatively okay with.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition the story is accompanied by some good  art and that's thanks in part to the increase in action and fight sequences but Tokyo Ghoul S1 didn't have that many fight scenes making them more enjoyable. The fights also didn't seem as meaningless as they do in root A. The style isn't that different from TK S1 and consistency is a good for shows like TK. However the Kagune designs became repetitive with the inclusion of all the background ghouls and there were a lot of them.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore root A DID do character development. Not so much from Kaneki's side which is not a good considering how much I like him and how he changed, but character development is still natural and somewhat enjoyable at times, even if it uses flashbacks. Root A also added more characters, which is to be expected of a sequel, and most were annoying which only helps any of the previous cast that wasn't that explored to be more interesting but comparison.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore the soundtrack wasn't very memorable in my mind. OP's and ED's only affect my score by .5 which didn't help root A considering how both were terrible. I watched the FUNimation Dub. I find this one of the rare cases where I didn't care at all whether the voice acting was good or bad because it really wouldn't add or subtract anything from a show of this 'caliber'. Which is a rare thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed in Root A was its ending and not even the ending itself but its 'principle' as it were. A mix of conclusion, open-endedness and a possibility of a sequel. Granted we went from the worst part of S1's ending being the fact that it was a cliff-hanger, to the best part Root A's ending being their use of S1's OP, even though they played a slower rendition and the voice they used was different and terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion root A is A sequel. It did a sequels job, continue the story. How it did that however was not an easy route (or a good one). If Tokyo Ghoul root A gave us anything it is the joke that it is the root of Awful. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS LATER IN THE REVIEW\r\nIf a book existed called \"How Not to Adapt Manga into an Anime: For Dummies\", no doubt Tokyo Ghoul Root A would be on the cover. Don't get me wrong, something doesn't need to be completely, faithfully adapted to be a fantastic anime. Sometimes, it doesn't need to be adapted from anything at all. Anime like \"Baccano!\" showcase how strong creative liberty can be. Other times, the anime can be better than the source material, like \"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid,\" and \"Kakegurui.\"\r\nTokyo Ghoul Root A is neither of those. \r\nFirst off, our protagonist from last season, Ken Kaneki doesthe exact opposite of what he was supposed to do in the manga. Instead of creating his own splinter group to combat Aogiri Tree, the renegade ghoul faction causing chaos and bloodshed in Tokyo, Ken JOINS them. Yes, you read that right. The exact same organization that brutally tortured him to the point of an insane mental breakdown is the group he decided to metaphorically tie the knot with. Granted, his reasoning and goal seem to be the same in both variations, which is protecting his friends. Despite this, he gives a pretty lousy explanation to Touka of why he joined. \\n\\n\r\nAnd more on Touka. She seems to have close to no physical presence in the duration of the run, at least not any presence that seems to have a lasting impact on the other characters. She's more or less just... there. From the end of last season to the end of Root A, she has not developed as a character at all. The creators took what was the cool and brooding \"no shit given\" part of Touka and threw it into the garbage.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring these, Root A is riddled with plot holes. We\u2019re given close to no more backstory on Rize, and we never find out the identity of the twins, the masked-bandaged girl, the One-Eyed Owl, etc., I could go on and on. These holes and lack of any meaningful development made the characters seem one-dimensional, boring and unrelatable (except maybe Juuzou).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound actually wasn't that bad. I mean, it was generic as hell, but it wasn't bad by any means. A good majority of Root A was scored pretty well. My main problem regarding the soundtrack was the choice in opening, both with regards to the song and the visuals. The opening is pretty monotonous and slow, pretty much getting rid of the intense and thrilling tone the Tokyo Ghoul series relies on. I don't often skip openings, but I found myself continuously skipping this one because of how little it contributed to the experience of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was pretty inconsistent. At times the animation was absolutely stunning, while at others being pretty mediocre. I mean, it's not as dreadful as the inconsistency in \"Juuni Taisen\", but still. The lack of coherency in the animation style was pretty distracting. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS START HERE:\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that the ending episode was horrendous. Hideyoshi (Hide) Nagachika, Kaneki's childhood friend, reveals that he knew that Kaneki was a ghoul SINCE NISHIKI ATTACKED THEM. Like, this dude has been mortally wounded, and he chooses to bring this information up now. Yeah, DON'T bother to let your suffering friend know BEFOREHAND, just bring it up at an emotionally opportune time. The whole cliche \"I'm just going to talk about a bunch of important and emotional stuff and conveniently get everything out that I want to tell you before I die\" didn't serve any meaningful purpose. And he doesn't even tell Kaneki everything either, like say, IDK, why the hell he joined the CCG, an organization that actively hunts down ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS END HERE:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch Root A, go right ahead. You can form your own opinions about whether or not this was a good season. Personally, I thought the abundance of plot holes in addition to the atrocious lack of character development and emotional tactfulness just ruined what was otherwise a pretty fantastic series.",

            "content": "After watching the first season of Tokyo Ghoul I was extremely pumped to watch the second season. The first season had done a lot of things right to make an enjoyable anime and I have to admit. I was actually excited to watch the second season. \r\nBut it kind of disappointed. \r\nThe main reason being, the story is barely built. Root A doesn't respect the material as much as the first season did. I think that itself was a huge blunder in the story. I had rated the first season 9, but I really can't give the second season more than a 7. \r\nStory (7)-\\n\\n\r\nThe story is too fragile. There is not enough reference material that allowed the story to build on its own. Actions and plots were not detailed enough and the whole season was very vague. The creators made the mistake of not focusing on the main character himself Kaneki. Half the anime is just Kaneki fighting. The first season had done the good job of portraying Kaneki's weak mentality as he fought against the urge of his half ghoul body. But this season barely showed anything of Kaneki psychology wise. Instead the story is more centralised around Anteiku. Big mistake that made the anime lost alot of its power. The darkness it once had suddenly disappeared and the anime became quite dull. The story at least. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8) -\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite decent in Tokyo Ghoul, the dark and evil color scheme of Tokyo Ghoul gives it an appropriate look. But one thing I wasn't really happy about is that they didn't seem to improve the animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6) -\\n\\n\r\nThe sound pissed me off. I was extremely disappointed with the background music of Root A. The background music really cut off alot as the first season had done well to emphasize emotions through its music. This season lacked extremely. First off, the powerful opening song was gone. But that's fairly irrelevant. The music was quite a let down and I have to say, they could've done a lot better job with the music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8) - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I have to give a lot of credit to. I was disappointed that Kaneki doesn't get too much screen time as he used to. But this series really developed the other characters in general especially Touka. You can start to see she has an interest in Kaneki which is a huge buildup to the last season. That they got right to develop Touka and especially the other members of Anteiku, including Himani. Even Kaneki faced quite a bit of development surprisingly and I have to say, the characters are fairly well thought out and quite likable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7) -\\n\\n\r\nI love the Tokyo Ghoul series and I have to say I did enjoy Tokyo Ghoul Root A, but nowhere near to the extent of the first season. There were quite a few lacking elements and nothing can be extensively done about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7) - \\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate Tokyo Ghoul Root A a 7/10. There are just too many problems with Tokyo Ghoul Root A. This season had elements that uplifted it, but it also had elements that ruined it. The story was the biggest. I don't usually rate an anime higher than the original story rating and I have to say, the story was filled with a ridiculous amount of plotholes. Don't get me wrong, plotholes can be effective to induce mystery and darkness in a story. But here there were just too many for me to enjoy it as much as I would've liked.",

Tokyo Ghoul's opening song was a perfect song that blended perfectly with the anime . BUT this one was boring....very boring . I have   always been into these  Anime Opening Songs but this one was NOT good. But Overall this anime is a Good one and i enjoyed watching this series. :D",

I cant say Tokyo Ghoul:A Root is bad, quite the opposite really but there is one slight problem this anime.\r\nThe story is good as usual with every character having an importance and you want no one to get killed. Everyone's story has a sad past and they really feel good. The animation was great and so was the sound. However, I enjoyed season 1's opening theme a lot more than this. Well there are more characters and they feel really fleshed out. They don't feel like something done in a hurry. HoweverI feel here are just too many characters introduced.\\n\\n\r\nWell, my only complain is the protagonist. I can say he is my personal most despised protagonist. I feel his character really shallow. I don't like the idea how he became so cold from someone who was really cheerful and yes wimpy. Also, he doesn't have much screen time. He said he wanted to protect by being stronger. I personally think that after being on the receiving end of the violence he would be like a peace maker or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is that \"always looking at your past and reflecting about it\" stuff pretty much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is great but it would have been amazing if Kaneki had more screen time or was dead altogether.",

            "content": "Oh, Tokyo Ghoul 2 season. After this, all the hype Tokyo Ghoul has magically dissapeared. The few remaining fans were or manga purits that claims that Studip Pierrot butchered the story and didn't followed the manga, and a few fangirls that refugee in reducts like tumblr or Goboiano, where they could clmly claim Kaneki is a precious baby that did nothing wrong. But, why? Why Tokyo Ghoul falls down so easily, with just 12 episodes? Well, let's take a look on it.\r\nFirst, analyse the problems the manga and the anime first season has:\r\n-Lacks originality. Tokyo Ghoul didn't do nothing new. The idea of a maleprotagonist half-monster that fight those creatures already appeared in Devilman, a manga made by Go Nagai, of Mazinger Z's fame. The theme was took again in Parasyte, a manga from the 90s. In the 2000s, they were released Elfen Lied and Kemonozume, the two most evident examples, in both we have organizations of humans that fight monstrs that kills humans, but these monsters are the protagonist. Actually, in Kemonozume, the monsters eats people too. And just few years after TG's we got Shiki, a show about vampires with the exact same dilemma, monsters that can't live with humns peacefully because they need to kill and eat humns to survive. So, if Tokyo Ghoul didn't have any original content, why it became so popular, even more than all the titles i've said before? Well, that's my next point.\\n\\n\r\n-Emo pandering. I was pretty emo when i was a teenager, and maybe thanks to that, i recognise when something is pandering to the poster child of teenage boys that cries nobody can't understand them. Tokyo Ghoul is basically this. I could compare the show in other elements with the other shows i mentioned, but i want to center in the show own merits, and in the worst reason for his appeal. This show play straight the card \"i hurt people because i born like this, but nothing is my fault, but nobody can't get it, and i feel lonely for that\". We see the poor, oppressed ghouls, that everyone hates because they need to kill humans to feed themselves, and are persecuted by the evil Inspectors. Sure, this show attemps to avoid the black and white morality showing there's evil ghouls that enjoy killing humans, and the human Inspectors are people too., but the message is still the same.\\n\\n\r\n-Extrem passive hero. Kaneki is one of the most passive heroes i've ever seen. Many people commented how, after the torture, he became such a badass, and i wonder where, where they see it. Kaneki is still beaten the shit out of him by every antagonist it crossed his path, and he didn't make any relevant decision or take any significant action. The only difference now is his makeover. Many people complain about passive shoujo heroines, and sometimes i think kaneki is one of them, that went to the wrong title and genre. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let's take a look on the only anime 2 season's flaws:\\n\\n\r\n-Given screentime to characters that, in the story's climax, play a minor role, or any role at all. Kaneki is the supposed main character, but most of the episodes he's just mentioned, or appears in few scenes. Hide, his human best friend, that gives Kaneki a motivation in the last epiosde to do something (the last scene is too ambiguous to know what's going on) has even less screentime. The characters that more screentime has a re Touka and Amon Koutarou, and i wouldn't mind it if it wasn't because Koutarou only has a brief fight with Kaneki, and we even know if he survived, and Touka whn she finally arrives is too late, and everyone's already dead.\\n\\n\r\n-Incoherent screenplay. In the first episode, Touka fights his brother, and he even bites her. With his teeth. Then Kaneki cames to the rescue, and we saw that Nishi is sitting nearby. I can't help but wonder, if he was always there, why he didn't help her? In the last episodes Touka is running away to the final battle, and despite she lives nearby and she runs since she heard, very soon, the battle has started, she arrived when it's already over, despite she could perfectly had arribe when it just get started. The way the screenplay screw with psychics and time is beyond my understament.\\n\\n\r\nNow, take a look at the characters. I've already said Kaneki is a doormant protagonist, but what about the secondary characters? I won't lie, some of them are interesting, charismatic, or sympathetic, and relevant to the story. But the show centers around Touka, whose subplot about how hard she study motivated by Kaneki could have been removed and we could have been more space to more important subplots. Amon koutarou, from the humans side, is probably the worst choice. He's a massive hypocrite, that killed innocent people just because they are ghouls, and according to this logic are monsters, despite they tried to help kill humans to surviv, and let live actually dangerous ghouls because his organization says so. I don't sympathyze ith him, is nor valid the \"he looks like one of the guys from swimming anime\".\\n\r\nAnd the Gourmet... he's annoying, people ship him with Kaneki despite he attemped to murder him multiple times, he's creepy, other characters trust him despite he has proven he's absolutely not trust-worthy...Dear God, he's a walking idiot plot. Fortunetly, he appears less, but damn, it's still too much.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my complaints, there's some virtues in this show. Like i said there's characters that are really lekeable, and has relevance to the plot, and are the most redeeming quality of this show, specially the coffe's owner and other employees that get little screen time the second season, and actually, it's a good thing they has more screen time.\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the best Studio Pierrot made until this date. The problem  is the censorship, less than in the forst season, still bothersome, but less, maybe because the audience has already get used to it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThe first season of Tokyo Ghoul was actually a pretty fun ride while also suffering from a few problems so hopefully season 2 would be able to solve these problems well guess what it didn't.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story immediately picks up where season 1 ended which is at least a good thing, but the first episode ends with Kaneki joining the bad guys and throughout the first half it concentrates on Aogiri and the CCG well more on the latter really and this wasn't that bad since the human characters didn't get that much focus, but it really diverts the story from our ghoulcharacters which sucked a lot.\\n\r\nThe second half of the series then turns into one big battle between Ghouls and Humans which was fun to watch for the most part, but the fact that most of this season mostly concentrates on action and battles rather than developing it's characters was a major step backwards along with the fact that once again the series ends on a cliffhanger that felt even worse than the first series cliffhanger.\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story didn't feel right either because there were a lot of sequences where we see something happen for a few seconds and then we don't go back to it for an entire episode like when Kaneki is battling his inner self for a few seconds then afterwards we just see the CCG guys for the rest of the episode and it was like this for the majority of the show it's like it didn't know who should have the focus and this is why to many characters were introduced in season 1 because Root A now has to struggle with who gets the story development and even then there isn't a whole lot.\\n\r\nPlus the story can be a bit confusing because we don't even know what Aogiri's main goal is since all we know is that they are trying to take over the wards, but the way Eto acts makes me feel like there is a much bigger end goal here however nothing about this is explained, true the story tries to fix it with it's rivalry between Human and Ghoul and that there might be a way for them to cooperate, but that worked well in season 1 here that isn't going to be enough to make a good story.\\n\r\nIf that's not bad enough for some reason Root A decides to deviate from the manga which probably explains why the story is pretty bad and confusing to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the problem that the first series had was that it introduced too many characters which meant that character development was going to be stretched and here it's even worse, ok at first it decides to concentrate on the human characters which I will admit was something that was needed, but the screentime we had for our main ghoul characters like Kaneki and Touka was actually very little hell Kaneki only spoke 1-5 words for the first few episodes and Touka was just running around the city during the final battle making all her scenes during this season feel null and void.\\n\r\nAt least characters like Amon and Juuzou actually got some good treatment and became better characters and with the introduction of Mado's daughter Akira who was actually a pretty good character much better compared to her father and there was even a decent relationship between her and Amon, but it wasn't enough to save the other characters who just all became forgettable objects.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle even felt a little rushed because I swear when Kaya was fighting against Chuu there was a split moment where I saw Chuu literally sliding into position like those chess statues from Harry Potter which kinda showed that this series was rushed out the door and it didn't help that there were more implements of CGI which was pretty damn bad and some really unnecessary censoring like when Juuzou threw a bunch of knifes into Kurona her whole body was pixelated and it didn't make any sense because seeing a girl getting multiple stab wounds is nothing compared to stuff from Elfen Lied, Corpse Party or even Kaneki's torture session from the first season which could've been the reason for this who knows.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't know what happened with the new op, but it sucks ass compared to season 1's op which is damn good and the lyrics made sense wherea's this op decided to throw in a bunch of random stuff that made no sense, at least the ed was alright.\\n\\n\r\nExtra's\\n\\n\r\nNow the biggest problem I have with Root A is the fact that the mystery and even the good story development is mostly thrown out the door for action and trust me probably 60-70% of this series is action and for a show like Tokyo Ghoul it shouldn't have to rely on action to make it interesting because what made it interesting in the first place is Kaneki and the rivalry between Human's and Ghoul's, but nope this season throws that away and gives up one battle after the next.\\n\r\nluckily these battles are good and entertaining to watch, but the action just takes over the series and doesn't help make any progress with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the second season of Tokyo Ghoul is mostly a disappointment aside from some good battles it just keeps the flaws from season 1 and makes them even worse so if you're going to watch this make sure to read the manga to make sure you get the true Tokyo Ghoul experience.",
