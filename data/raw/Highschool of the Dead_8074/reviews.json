            "content": "High School of the Dead is about a group of breasts trying to avoid getting eaten by zombies in whatever way possible. Tagging along with these breasts are 2 of our heroes, Kouta and Takashi. A couple pairs of breasts are even in on the action part when they're not bouncing across the screen like jello filled balloons hiding behind incomplete articles of clothing.\r\nBut in all seriousness, High School of the Dead has actually been very enjoyable overall. And I'm not a fan of fan service.\r\nStory: Here are some breasts, here are some zombies, and here are 2 guys to enjoy and protect the breastspretty much sums it up. With a show like this, do you really need a complex plot? Do you watch The Simpsons in the hopes that the characters will change and mature as time goes by? God no. Homer's still an ignoramous (all be it tainted by the Family Guy brand of humour) and Bart's still causing trouble. High School of the Dead operates in a similar fashion. You don't really expect much in terms of character development or plot. You expect a lot of fan service, and some action whilst fighting zombies. HOTD delivers on both. It's the \"how\" that sets it apart though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: So HOTD is well animated. Just putting that out there. The animation is clear, it's well done,  and it's eye-catching. The way they animate action scenes is high quality stuff. And they made sure that boobs would jiggle at every opportunity. So there's a good framerate going, and crisp clean artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like to think of the sound section as more than just opening and ending tracks. When we're talking about sound, we're talking about background music, sound bytes and effects, voice casting etc... HOTD has no characters whose voices don't suit them, and the voice acting is well performed. The drone of zombies does it's job. To be honest, I haven't really noticed background music in the episodes during action scenes. I can't tell you if the background music fits well or not, cause there may not be much. But what I can tell you is that what they're doing sound-wise in the show works. Where they choose to put music blends so well you won't be able to distinguish it from the animation. Where there is no music, it adds a suspenseful effect to help bring you the realization that we're in a zombie-infested wasteland of a city. So the sound department is definitely solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here are some boobs, sometimes they show butts too. Honestly, character is underdeveloped in HOTD. We've got a ditzy nurse, an egotistical girl, a somewhat selfish and reliant girl, a strong girl displaying leadership qualities, a macgyver who can work with any scenario, and the male leader. But most of that can be summed up as such. \" We have 4 pairs of breasts, one is useful, a Macgyver and a typical male lead. I don't mean to demean it or anything, but the other characters get so bogged down in fan service that you could seriously give them any archetype and the show wouldn't be much different. HOTD revolves around only 3 of the 6 main characters, and the only thing bringing it up from mediocre to fair (5 to 6) is our Macgyver. Kouta is not only epic and awesome in his practical knowledge, he's wonderfully written, funny, and someone our inner otaku can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really, really dislike fan service anime. You have to give me more than some panties and bras to make me want to watch a show. Thankfully, HOTD realized this. There is enough action to make it enjoyable on that aspect alone, but I really feel like Kouta saves the show from being a big flop. He's not the main character, nor is he the most important, but he's there as some comic relief, as well as an integral part of the main cast. You'll find yourself enjoying this show overall, and when you look back, you'll find most of the best parts involved Kouta getting a nosebleed, getting all excited over a weapon, or shooting zombies in the head with a nail gun. That's not to say you can't enjoy anyone else, Kouta just elevates it to be really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Amidst the incredibly overwhelming fan service, there's a lot of great stuff going on in HOTD. There's good action, there's some small romance, there's comedy, there's suspense and there's the reality of the situation in that the characters portrayed aren't really all that special outside their role in the group. We've got an assembly of people who rely on each other for survival, in a world crawling with danger. And overall, it's a pretty good show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a final note: Really, I don't mean to try and simplify a show beyond what it is, but HOTD is already pretty simple. Here are some Zombies, here are some boobs, enjoy.",

And as far as the plot goes, that about covers it. You could probably replicate it by watching The Walking Dead on mute next to a porn hub playlist.\r\nIn all seriousness, this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. Here is one of those anime that really struggles to understand what its trying to be.The mindlesssex and  violence, which is what it is, is constantly being undercut by  one of the worst harem anime plots I've ever seen. Character development is minimalist to say the least, and every time it tries to make a character even remotely interesting, it's undercut by how silly the whole thing is. One minute a girl is talking about how she's afraid of her inner, violent, dark side, and the next she's riding on the roof of a van wearing nothing but underwear and an apron while holding a katana. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime accomplishes virtually nothing. It fails at being hentai, it fails at being harem, and it doesn't add anything to either genre or any other. Would not watch again.",

            "content": "High School Of The Dead is a good anime. The tragedy is that it could have been a *great* anime if not for some horrible mistakes. \r\nLet me explain. The setup is awesome. Zombie apocalypse+ a renegade group of kids + anime? It's pretty much every nerd's wet dream. Unfortunately, the writers decided to focus on the \"wet\" part much more than the dream.\r\nA lot of people have been debating over HotD's overuse of fan service. Is it justified? I personally don't think so. Here you have a perfectly awesome setup for the apocalypse. People grabbing their guns, moraldilemmas, false messiahs, etc. HotD sets this up in a fairly realistic way and creates an immersive world that terrifies and fascinates the viewer. Then they give you episodes where 90% of the screen time is decided to naked women touching each other. Other episodes are more toned down, but the fan service isn't very subtle and it is very distracting and at times annoying. Shizuka, One of the main characters (who really isn't a character as much as she is a walking-talking fetish provider) has boobs that are literally larger than her head and does absolutely nothing besides acting stupid. She provides absolutely no other value to the show, and one has to wonder how she even gets out of bed in the morning. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the other characters also have the same kind of one demential personality. Then you have characters like Saeko, and Takashi, who end up being dynamic and very interesting to watch. These two characters provide the show character development, constantly walking the line between hero and killer. They are fairly fascinating to watch, especially given that the series never promoted itself as being thought provoking. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is tough to describe, because while it is a visually impressive show, some of the character designs are incredibly awkward. As I mentioned before, the breast proportions on the female characters are insane. Rei and Saya have very edgy and unattractive hair that makes their characters look a bit cheaper than the rest of the cast. Despite this, most of the illustrations are very beautiful and it's generally top notch animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to enjoy HotD is to expect very little from it and just go along for the ride. It has some terrible faults that might really ruin it for a lot of people, but watching the group survive the apocalypse is incredibly entertaining. It's a great mindless anime that is far better than any ecchi I have ever seen.  If you are looking for a show with well developed characters and tasteful character interactions, find a different show. I would say that its worth making the exception for HotD though.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is a show that knows a very, very base demographic and knows exactly how to pander to it. It aims to please simple-minded, uniformly male teenagers with base level action and lots and lots of large, jiggling breasts. Highschool of the Dead has quickly entered into the ranks of shows extremely popular, not for being well-written or emotive, but simply for being a barrel of big, dumb fun.\r\nThe problem is... it's not very good at it.\r\nAs the name would suggest, Highschool of the Dead involves a highschool and dead things. More specifically, the series begins in a highschool and revolves arounda bunch of highschool students, who happen to have walked into a George A. Romero film. In other words, they're surrounded by undead, bloodthirsty corpses... zombies. From here, the plot is about as simple as can be. The cast has to try and not die.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, it really speaks volumes that Highschool of the Dead manages to fuck up such a simple task, for a wide variety of reasons. But let's start with the most glaringly obvious one... the fanservice. OK, so considering the demographic the show is aiming for, it's hardly surprising that HotD uses a lot of fanservice. But Highschool of the Dead crosses the line of what an acceptable amount of fanservice would be repeatedly. Any scene that was otherwise good had an irritating tendency to shove some schoolgirl's underwear into the camera. And don't even get me started on the infamous \"Boob Matrix\" scene.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no matter how much fanservice is in a show, it would not destroy an otherwise good show. So let's get to the next reason HotD is an incredibly poor anime - the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's summarize the cast very quickly. The everyman, the ditz, the needy girl, the bitch, the action chick, and the nerd. Not one of these characters has any more depth than that. I have literally told you everything you need to know about the characters in the space of one sentence. Takashi is completely unremarkable, Shizuka is dopey and annoying, Rei is irritatingly helpless and inconsistent in her character, and Saya (probably the worst member of the cast) is a self-righteous bitch who has no consideration for anybody else and considers the rest of the cast below her. The only passable members of the cast are Kouta Hirano (named and designed after the creator of Hellsing, a MUCH better take on the same style), who manages to make his military obsessions at least entertaining, and Saeko, who manages to not be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Highschool of the Dead, though, is that for a show that tries to be simple and fun... it's very boring.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a survival horror really needs you to care about whether the characters live or die to work. At first, after a seemingly significant character is killed off, it seems quite possible that major characters will be killed off, and that the series will be a struggle to survive. And yet, after that, not one character we care about dies. It becomes quite clear that the entire cast is in no real danger, due to having that strange immunity from danger that being a main character grants you. This means that we are simply stuck watching these unlikeable characters do things we don't care about. It would have at least been passable if the action had been well-directed, but it really isn't. There are no fight scenes that really stick out (barring the aforementioned Boob Matrix, which sticks out for all the wrong reasons). The action is mediocre at best. All of this leaves it up to a plot that really doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this leave us with? A show that really doesn't have any positive points at all, really. It's watchable, I'll give it that much, and the first episode was quite good. But it really doesn't follow through on any of the potential it has. The themes in this show have been done before many times, and almost always better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Just watch a George A. Romero film instead. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 4/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Hellsing, Elfen Lied.",

            "content": "After seeing the long line of reviews on HotD, I thought I'd say my piece on here to what I think is a \"good\" show. Not a \"very good\" show, not even a \"great\" show, but a \"good\" show as it is. Of course this may change should the anime continue to be as entertaining as its been so far.\r\nHaving come with no expectations, seeing as that ecchi seemed to ooze the moment you watch opening credits(something people should have noticed when they started this series), I was pleased and amused to what it had delivered.\r\nStory - 6\r\nBefore I start I believe it my dutyto just add this trivial information for those asking about the plot since some say its lacking or that there are none. So what is plot?\\n\\n\r\nPlot: In fiction, the story of a play, novel, romance, or poem, comprising a complication of incidents which are gradually unfolded, sometimes by unexpected means. - ardictionary.com\\n\\n\r\nWhilst a 'subtle' plot does play in the background of a world on the brink of a zombie outbreak, one must understand that it will never be its main focus as we're lead by a group of high school kids and their ditzy school nurse. This series is about survival in its most basic whilst the 'subtle' plot unfolds. If they were to ever find a cure in this show, I don't think it'd be by any of the casting members as they're too bothered with who likes who, and who has bigger breasts then the other. They may not be 'teh best' cast to date(mostly mediocre), but what's wrong with that? There once was a reality TV show who had crammed a group of nobodies into a house full of cameras just to see how they'd react and called it Big Brother. Look how big that became as an entertainment medium. HotD is in the same class, but better as it sticks your clich\u00e9d anime archetypes into a world infested with zombies. \\n\\n\r\nNow for those not into reality shows are probably asking; why watch something if it doesn't even have a plot? We watch HotD for the 'over the top' reactions the cast get into when pitted with something that's out of the ordinary. I don't know about you, but that in itself is plot. The emotions and reactions executed are both hilarious and captivating at the same time, and to me is just pure entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nAnd are we entertained? Definitely. HotD is so entertaining, it's fanbase now consist of zombie-lovers(who tally the frags), ecchi fanboys(who howl at every moment of cleavage), action enthusiasts(who now has Kouta & Saeko in their favorites) and even whiners(who pretend to dislike the show and yet has kept up to the current episode). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art in HotD is crisp. From the well drawn scenery of a sunset backdrop that provides you that feeling of an impending doom, to the hack-and-slash execution of each action scene(which the zombie-lovers anticipate), one has to appreciate that HotD maybe a cut above the rest in terms of animation for this season. Coming from artists well known for their over-the-top ecchi(Daisuke & Sh\u014dji Sat\u014d), I hadn't expected anything less when I first seen their character design, and when I heard from HotD's anime director Tetsuro Araki(well known for DeathNote) stating in an interview :\\n\\n\r\nTell us what motivated you to make Highschool of the Dead?\\n\\n\r\n\"I\u2019m aiming for something I would have bought myself in middle school. At present, this would definitely have been a \u201cbuy\u201d for me. I can feel my schoolboy heart rejoicing even now.\"\\n\\n\r\n...I knew this was going to be a series dedicated to a lot of fan-service for a particular audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst some proportions may have been overdone, well hey...its anime. If you were expecting realism from a zombie-and-panty flick aimed at hormonal adolescents, then you're watching the wrong show .\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nSound is great with Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets \"HotD\" opening and the BGM sets the tone for every interaction within each episode, using rock as a theme. What's made me appreciate it even more is the director's choice of using Maon Kurosaki vocalize different lyrics for each episode which suits each ending very well. By the time the OST is out, I can guarantee it'd be number 1 for awhile in regards to downloads and music bought if your a fan of anime soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nUnfortunately what sets my rating back as a whole is the casting for HotD as they are mediocre at best. Due to the pacing of the show, any form of development that they try to achieve are ruined and only comes off as cheesy, making you realize that this really is just a zombie-and-ecchi show. For those expecting romance to blossom, may be waiting a while as even I don't know where these characters are headed. One stage it may look like your average romance but by next episode it builds to a triangle and then a harem! Seeing this in the span of six episodes is just bad writing and I believe they should just stick to what they were already doing best: the zombie killing and ecchi!\\n\\n\r\nTo describe each member's characteristics as best as I could, would be to say that they are on a thin line between 2D/3D due to following their stereotypical archetype which I had mentioned earlier, whilst trying to adapt to the rules of the zombie genre. This can prove frustrating at times as each cast can act a little too superficial when facing a dilemma. Whether the creator had seen to these flaws as intentional is open for debate, but I guess overall it's growing on me and is leading me to continue just to see what they'd do next.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nWell I won't lie to you, I have enjoyed the wild and bumpy ride that is High School of the Dead thus far(even with the ecchi) and now that we're over the half-way line(seeing as MAL & ANN has listed the series at 12), I can only hope that we aren't given a forced ending or have to wait too long for a second season so that the adaptation can provide more source. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nSo as I had mentioned, HotD is a good show. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise that it's overrated especially if they've rated a 9 or 10 for shows like Sailor Moon or any other mo\u00e9 blob. Whilst it's not a Death Note or TTGL or whatever others are comparing it to at the moment, what it is is pure entertainment...and isn't that the sole reason we watch anime?\\n\\n\r\nSo my only advice to those new to this series is: if you view the show with no expectation then you'll definitely not be disappointed...and if you can't handle the ecchi then get out of the kitchen, that's reserved for Saeko in her 'Hadaka' apron..",

So here it goes:\r\nThe first episode opens up with an outbreak of the zombie infestation in school and the school is quicklyturned into chaos. They tell--not show--the viewers how the zombies are killed and what obscure powers the zombies have which, in my opinion, is very condescending. None of the introduced characters in the first episode are very likable. We have a whorish girl who spits out insults at the guy who saved her and We have the guy who saved her: the wannabe baddass. \\n\\n\r\nIf the purpose of the anime is to deal with the chaos and primordial catharsis, it seriously hinders the experience by adding all of the ecchi upskirt panty shots and jiggling breasts. If it's to appease the Ecchi fans, why not just go all out and make a hentai?\\n\\n\r\nHigh School of the Dead tries to shoot the wire between two very different and difficult topic and does not succeed.

            "content": "Wow. As I'm watching the new anime shows of Summer 2010 season one by one, it seems like each one is better than the last. Well, it looks like this one is going to be my favorite show of this summer. Basically, H.O.T.D takes place in a post-apocalyptic world filled with countless zombies. What makes this show special is that it combines just the right amount of fan-service, horror, and goriness without being too excessive to spice up the show. In fact, all the panchira-like fanservice seems very superficial and you'll be surprised at how the atmosphere is very sad, serious, and even quite touching.Not only that, it features beautifully hand-drawn color background arts filled with great amount of details and it creates a bizarre effect when they are placed right alongside the hordes of gray zombies.\\n\\n\r\nJust to note, H.O.T.D is directed by Araki Tetsuo, who is also known for Madhouse's masterpiece \"Death Note,\" and both works seem to share a lot of similarities such as the opening theme and the very particular style of color selection (a lot of oranges and blues were used to create a feeling of insecurity). Also, you may notice that Madhouse has put a lot of effort on the music and sound effects in order to maximize the uncomfortable feeling that goes very well with the genre of this show. Anyway, H.O.T.D. did not fall short of  my initial expectations and I hope Madhouse and director Araki Testsuo is going to continue the show just as it is.",

            "content": "Warning: the following review contains spoilers and gratuitous amounts of pure, seething rage. Please don't be offended or take this review too seriously. I don't actually want to kill zombie fans. I just REALLY hate zombie media.\r\nOverview:\r\nHighschool of the Dead represents the latest in an endless string of attempts to cash in on Zombiemania. If there is one thing that makes me go blind with rage it is zombie media and the brainless IDIOTS that keep this cash train rolling. Shows, games, and movies that are decent or mediocre become \"OMG da best thing EVAR!\" thanks to moron zombie fans. Walking Dead is a mediocreshow, but zombie fans think it is Godlike. The Last of Us was a decent 3rd person shooter that stole some puzzle elements and escort missions from the vastly superior game Ico. Zombietards voted it game of the year and say it is the best game on the PS3! I own The Last of Us and enjoyed it somewhat, but I could name 20 better games for the PS3 off the top of my head without even breaking a sweat. These rabid, conformist fans are the only real zombies and I feel like one of the few lone survivors to not get infected by the zombietard virus!\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nZombies randomly start attacking and some bland Gary Stu and his harem of poorly drawn, badly proportioned, G cup babes must fight the zombies. Japan is quickly overrun and the world's governments decide to nuke each other with ICBMs. The US is able to shoot down all but one ICBM from China and Russia while completely destroying both countries with thousands of ICBMs. Yet, the blanket of radiation from the hundreds of missiles used to wipe out China has no effect on Japan, less than 100 miles away! Only the 1 missile that hit Japan has the minor effect of taking out the electric grid. The radiation is simply ignored. I am not even going to bother explaining why the US isn't capable of shooting down thousands of incoming hypersonic missiles with our current technology. I am thinking WAY too hard considering the average IQ of this fandom. Sadly, the only reason this series isn't rated an 8.5 out of 10 is that the fanservice angered Western female viewers. If this series had ditched its piss poor attempts at humor, toned down the fanservice, and taken itself seriously it would be called...Attack on Titan. Which Zombietards also think is \"da best show Evar\". They are so conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to have a kneejerk positive response to zombie BULLSHIT, that you can replace the zombies with drooling, stumbling giants and the positive response is the same. As long as everything else in the formula is left unchanged.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nYou fail human anatomy FOR EVER!\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very lacking. At least a horror series should have a creepty OST, but this one sucks shit through a straw.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI want to use a baseball bat and brain the production staff and everyone who worked on this lazy, mockbuster!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe massive production budget barely saves this one from the lowest rating, despite my overwhelming hatred of this series! Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to go read something good like The Brothers Karamazov. Then I will use the book's tremendous size to beat some zombie fans to death with it!",

            "content": "Zombies...\r\nNot a genre I've seen in anime very often, when they do appear its always in some upbeat anime, Like hey heres a zombie, and a vampire, and a succubus, and they all love this kid who happened to go to a school full of monsters... not really my ideal zombie.\r\nThis anime does a great job of displaying what a zombie apocalypse should be like. In recent years zombies have been transformed into allot of things, there bugs, there virus', there aliens. I say NO, zombies are the mindless undead, HOTD accomplishes that.\r\nIts hard to tell where this anime will go off of only 3episodes, I am excited for the ? total episodes, a zombie anime lasting for 200-300 episodes or more? i wouldn't mind.\\n\\n\r\nSo for my actual scoring (so far)\\n\\n\r\nStory: This feels like a human reaction to a horrible situation, none of the characters are super elite soldiers, they are average people who took up arms in a time of crisis. I like where the story is going so far, with the addition of new characters along the way this could have some great development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is modern, its clean, its sharp, the animation is done well, and the linear 300 style fight scenes are fun to  watch. I DON'T like how the goriest or ecchiest scenes are blocked by a fat black bar that takes up half the screen, but hey, thats why we by the dvd's isn't it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music and sound quality is pretty good, they did kinda steal the beat for some of there songs from other zombie things like 28 weeks later. I did enjoy the homage felling tho, like they were giving praise to zombies of the past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are pretty diverse in personality. I like some, I dislike others. One thing i don't understand is why it took so long for people to group up and work together. I know, the writers wanted to weed out the weaklings so they didn't have a army of armed, half naked high school kids marching down main street.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: BAM! 10, thats biased tho because I fucking love zombies. 'nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I believe this anime has potential, unfortunatly it has potential to be horribly bad too. They need to focus on a few things here. \\n\\n\r\n1: FUCKIN ZOMBIES - The zombies need to be around, if theres like 4 episodes in a row of random character development without the appearance of a few hordes of undead, why the hell am i watching this.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters, and SHIT HAPPENS - People have to die, if the same starting cast lives more than a whole season without being scared by some zombie related event, I'm done watching.\\n\\n\r\n3. Action - This is the hardest part, the action has to be different from time to time, you can only smash a zombie head so many times before you get sick of doing it that way, Dead Rising is proof of that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway thats my review, I'll revise after about 25 or so episodes, if it lasts that long, and hey if it doesn't I may change it up sooner.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is one of those shows that I find myself having to show all of my friends, but not for the reasons the creators would probably like.  Simply put, this show is bad.  It is bad on a rather insulting level too.  What could have been an enjoyable zombie romp had to be castrated with annoying characters, stupid plot moments, inconsistent logic (even within the realm of it's own universe), unbelievable amounts of fan service, and moments that just make you scratch your head and wonder how this ever made it into production.  Because it didn't just makeit into a TV series, it somehow got some of the best animation you'll find in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on lead shounen teen Takashi, who contains every example of a Mary-Sue character.  For those who don't know, a Mary-Sue is a character who is perfect at just about everything of value, is loved by everybody unconditionally, and is always right.  Out of all the characters in this show he can be the most annoying because he turns out to always be right, even when his decisions are clearly bad.  He is perfect at everything we see him do, going so far as to render the only positive input the only other male in his group provides (shooting guns) simply by receiving the instruction to 'shoot slightly above what you want to hit'.  He immediately becomes a marksman.  The only thing he's bad at is school, but guess what gets destroyed in the first episode?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters consist of Rei, one of the whiniest characters I've ever seen, who starts off the series telling Takashi he'll never be as good as her boyfriend, telling him her boyfriend is always right, and as soon as the boyfriend dies (fist-fighting a zombie is a bad idea? SHOCK!) she begins to immediately alternate between 'you wanted him to die, how could you?' and 'please make love to me, I've always wanted you'.  There's also a kendo girl who starts off being the only cool one in the series until a completely arbitrary revelation into her backstory turns her more into a dangerous psychopath (or it would, if they ever bothered dealing with it again).  They have the 'smart' girl, who in this case simply quotes common sense and the occasional piece of relevant information she read in a textbook somewhere (which on at least one occasion I double checked and found it was wrong).  There's a gun nut who I actually kind of like, in that unlike Mr. Perfect Takashi this guy only has one GOOD quality, and that is his skill with guns.  Until, again, Takashi gets one piece of advice from him and immediately becomes a sniper.  Finally, we have Boobs Mcenzy, a nurse who doesn't know medicine, can't seem to understand anything that's happening around her, and whose very existence seems to be justified entirely by 'well, she has even BIGGER boobs than the rest of the cast'.  Later on there is a kid and a dog, but I honestly can't remember anything she does other than go to the bathroom on Takashi's shoulders (yes, this happens).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's the completely insane, psychotic teacher who nobody in their right mind would trust, yet somehow everybody looks up to him simply because he's a teacher.  He oggles the girls while licking his lips, contorts his body into insane poses while detailing why they should relent to his authority (for their own good, of course!) and has some inexplicable desire to... keep the main girls as his slaves? I'm not really sure.  It's never really explained, or at least not in any satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nOne element that confuses me about this series is how it jumps about seemingly at random between 'let's analyze this situation using logic and real world physics' and 'batshit insane anime logic'.  For example, at one point Boobs McKenzy tells them that she cannot drive the bus over a small group of zombies because it would flip the bus.  Then, as soon as the plot calls for it, she hits the gas, runs over about 30 zombies, then plows through a METAL GATE and drives down the road like nothing is wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nThis might be salvageable if the zombies were remotely scary, but in this case they go out of their way to make them seem as non-threatening as possible.  \"How do they do this?\" you ask, unaware that not only am I clearly about to tell you anyways, but that I can't hear you and you are just wasting your time.  It's simple: in this world, zombies...sorry, NOT zombies... according to this show's logic, 'they cannot be zombies, because zombies only exist in movies, therefore despite sharing almost all the characteristics with movie zombies we cannot use that name as an easy reference point because LOOK HOW ORIGINAL WE'RE BEING YOU GUYS'.  Anyways, zombies in this show apparently CANNOT SEE OR FEEL THINGS.  I don't mean 'cannot feel' as in 'cannot feel pain'.  No, they cannot feel things like a wet cloth hitting the back of their head.  Logically one could assume that if they cannot see or feel anything, they would have no way of knowing when they had someone in their grasp, yet that never stops them from doing so.  Maybe this is because everybody ignores the fact that they can only hear, and starts screaming as soon as they see even a single zombie come down the road.  I believe the author came up with this idea for one scene and one scene only: Takashi walking slowly and silently through a herd of zombies.  It's actually a really good scene, and one that gave me hope for the future of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's immediately ruined because someone hits a pipe against a railing and, instead of saying 'make a noise somewhere else to distract them' or 'just keep moving silently so they don't know where you are' Takashi just begins screaming bloody murder and alerting all zombies everywhere to their presence.  The smart girl (whose name I cannot remember) points out that, yeah, that was a stupid f**king move, but we are lead to believe that Takashi is right somehow because then a zombie tries to attack her, which somehow invalidates her point... I think? I mean, she's right, and the zombie only attacked her because she was talking which ACTUALLY PROVES HER POINT YOU GUYS but anyways they just keep screaming and running which gets a lot of people killed.  Our heroes!\\n\\n\r\nProbably the funniest use of this new 'zombie logic' comes 3/4 of the way through the series.  Some of the characters leave a building to find the yard empty.  Then suddenly, Zombies come pouring up the stairs after them!  Takashi, in a moment of brilliance that I could not make up if I tried, exclaims 'But how did they find us? DID THEY HEAR THE LEAVES RUSTLING IN THE TREES?' \\n\\n\r\nI'm not making that up.  Zombies are attracted to leaves now.  Apparently, ANY sound is enough to alert them to your presence, unless the plot demands otherwise (like the previous episode where no amount of sound from another direction would deter them from attacking them).  Then, the Kendo girl goes into a killing frenzy against the zombies and declares that the combat has 'made her wet'.  Ick.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's a subplot about America wanting to nuke everybody because come on, what else are you going to do?  We spent good money on these bombs and they aren't just gonna launch THEMSELVES! \\n\\n\r\nI very nearly stopped watching this show at episode 6, where the fan service was turned up to 11.  They found a safehouse and, while the guys were doing things like plan their next move, maintain their weapons, keep an eye out for zombies, etc., the girls got drunk, took a group bath and fondled each other before attempting to get it on with Takashi (and only Takashi, for he is the ONLY man they could go for.. other than the other guy in the group, but he's fat and nerdy so it's completely understandable since looks DO apparently matter).\\n\\n\r\nThere is clearly so much wrong with this series that it almost hurts just how good it looks.  That is the only saving grace to this show: it is GORGEOUS to behold, and the theme song can get stuck in your head quite easily.  In fact, the opening theme made me think this show would be great simply because of the tone and atmosphere it set up.  It's a shame the show itself couldn't live up to it's own opening.\\n\\n\r\nI once sat some friends of mine down and we had a drinking game to this show.  The rules were simple: Any time we saw fan service we'd take a shot.  We quickly ruled out the opening theme because there's about 4 or 5 different shots in too rapid succession to drink and pour a new glass.  After that, we had to limit it to 'just scenes of up-close boob and ass jiggles' because we were on a dangerous road to alcohol poisoning already.  We quit after 4 or 5 episodes, because I knew the safe-house episode would kill them.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's Highschool of the Dead.  If you have friends over and want to watch something mind-bogglingly bad, then grab some bottles of alcohol and watch away.  If you are looking for something DECENT, however, then try watching something better. It wouldn't be hard to find.",

            "content": "Everytime I think of this title it conjures up an awful feeling in my gut. That uneasy queasiness that you get from a laughably shitty experience, which is only made worse when you realize what it contributed to the medium as a whole. Too fully grasp this feeling of comical disgust and disappointment I'll like to ask for your attention as I construct a made up story scenario.\r\nPicture this, you're in class with your fellow students but you're the only one who watches anime as a storytelling medium. Your teacher then announces that we'll have show and tell and the subject will be different formsof media. This immediately caught your attention as you thought this would be a perfect time to share what anime has to offer with your fellow peers. Your teacher says to everyone  \"gather up stories from different genres of the medium of your choosing and you'll present a selected story of my choosing to the class\".. With that said you immediately rushed home and gather your collection. For a war epic you have your Legend of the Galactic Heroes. For thrillers you have your Death Note. For mystery you have your Monster. For action your Black Lagoon.. and the list goes on and on.\\n\r\nSo after gathering your collection, you sit bottled up with excitement as everyone presents the genre their teacher asks for. Finally it's your turn and she turns to you and say \"give us a zombie story from your selected medium\".. So you frantically dig through your collection looking for the criteria..Then when you realize you ONLY have 1 title that fit that requirement your heart sinks.. And with that ladies and gentlemen I hope you can begin to understand how this dreadful title makes me feel, as we shamefully present to the World anime's only contribution to the zombie genre. \\n\\n\r\nToday we're going to take a look at Highschool of the Boobs, an anime about our MC and a group of titts trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.... and also his struggle to keep his dick in his pants.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/All that \"plot\": 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is your standard fare zombie story that you've seen countless of times before. The only difference being the abundance of titts and panty shots thrown at you every 5 seconds. With that said it is the most immersion breaking show I've had the displeasure of watching. You're not sure if the show is trying to give you an adrenaline rush or a fucking boner. After a point you forget you were watching a zombie flick as it steadily becomes a harem. It's hard to build tension when hoards of zombies are eating someone while the camera focuses on a crotch shot. Don't get me wrong,  fanservice is nice if it serves a purpose or don't take away from the show's overall experience. But when it's constantly bombarding you with it it's hard to care about anything when they focus more on the \"plot\" instead of the plot. Speaking of \"plot\" this story ends up going nowhere with a very anticlimactic finale that leaves many question left unanswered, it was too ambiguous for its own good. This further puts a damper on a show that's already borderline garbage. \\n\\n\r\nmilk jugs/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n2 words: MATRIX BOOBS\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if this counts as an accomplishment but the art and animation for HOTD is shamefully amazing. The cinematography is top notch and feels like you're watching a blockbuster action flick. This coupled with unique camera angles and panning shots shows that the people behind the project are well versed in their field of work. Also worth noting that Tetsuro Araki, the lead director, would later take this experience to later create the jaw dropping choreographed \"spiderman\" scenes in shows like Attack On Giant Naked People. Needless to say the man knows how to take regular shows and turn them into a orgy of A-grade directing. Too bad this effort is downgraded seeing that it's still all about MATRIX BOOBS.\\n\\n\r\nSound(of boobs): 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the catchy opening song not much praise can be given to the soundtrack. It's simply muddled in the background and none of them really grabs your attention, they're typical tracks found accompanying thriller/action flicks . They  serve their purpose but not something deserving of a stand alone listen. \\n\r\nThe voice actors were all fine, they all fit their characters given straight fairly well. This is also a rare case where watching it dub is better since it doesn't take itself as seriously. Standouts being Mark Laskowski as Hirano for being able to switch from wimpy to sociopath at the drop of a hat and Maggie Flecknoe as Takagi for capturing the right amount of tsundere. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: BOOBS(1)/10\\n\\n\r\n2 guys accompanied by walking titts is basically the cast in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nWe have:\\n\\n\r\nA bitch with titts\\n\r\nA ditz with titts\\n\r\nA throw-a-fit with titts\\n\r\nA psycho skits with titts\\n\r\nA loli with little bits\\n\\n\r\nand of course Takashi Komuro & Kouta Hirano as the guys to lead the harem cast to safety. \\n\\n\r\nI would of gone into ore detail but they're simply archetypes you've seen countless of times before and don't really count as \"characters\" in my humble opinion. More like fanservice with legs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 faps /10\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy this show but everytime it proceeded to get decent it opt out to throwing  titts and panty shots in my face. The contradictory tone felt too lopsided to really give a fuck and I found myself watching it only to complete it after a few episodes in. If you watch it with friends you might get a few awkward laughs but as a means of entertainment you might as well watch a Michael Bay film since that's essentially what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an A-grade blockbuster budget anime with B-movie level entertainment look no further as this anime seem to have found a odd but effective balance of pulling it off. If you can get pass the insane amount of fanservice and mediocre script who knows, you might actually find something to like here. For everyone else wanting a decent zombie show don't even bother as it really boils down to a harem with zombie for flavoring. \\n\\n",

            "content": "HoTD is one of those anime which fanservices are proven far more annoying than any arousing. Naked female zombies, girls' panties being reveal as they are eaten, and female zombies in one of those 'fetish costume'(eg.nurse) did not turn me on in the slightest bit(and I'm a straight guy with average hormone level) and is rather highly disturbing. The mangaka's demand on how to 'put in as many jiggly boobs and panties as much as possible' sounds sick, and yeah he still make lots of money from it.\r\nOne thing I dislike of any zombie fiction is how the story is carried out, it simply bringout way too much questions, so a group of 5-7 average people with minimum battle expierence can handle infinite zombies coming at them? If that is true then why are the well-trained soldiers get munched on routinely despite having all the advantages in the world(except number) given to them? Why did the zombies that can't even run and would be killed with the slightest tap to the head manage to take over the world in the first place? Let alone doing that in TWO DAYS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\n- Takashi, doesn't really have any reason to be the leader, but as the protagonist he would be assigned so anyway, and again he's one of those protagonist who get all(almost in this case) the girls without any apparent reason.\\n\r\n- Rei, despite how many fans have loathed her for bitching unendingly, I find her decent as how she act is the most natural reaction any real girl would in that situation. Don't deny it even if you're male you would bitch like that too, so unless your boyfriend/girlfriend was munched by zombie before I hope no one bring up an arguement on this. I'm not saying everyone would do it, but as the survival of most of you and your loved ones are never really tested, I prefer you to not skip to conclusions that you won't, believe me, 1 week before this mess happened Rei wouldn't believe she would bitch like that either.\\n\r\n- Saeko, on the other hand, may be liked by many but not by me, as she is one of the most unnatural characters in the series(wearing only apron to fight zombies? what kind of logic was she using? oh of course its fanservice again)\\n\r\n- Saya is simply too self-righteous and annoying, her intellegence demonstrated by observation and planning skills didn't meet up with her self-claimed 'genius' title at all\\n\r\n- Kouta, I don't have anything against him. I agree with everyone that he's the most bearable character in the cast, but as the fat-sidekick guy living with another guy with his harem, its simply sad he's cursed not to get any girl (*SPOILER* the girl who develop romantic feelings for him is soon killed before the party proceed to the following arc)\\n\r\n- Shizuka, despite being a teacher and the oldest member of the party, she demonstrate near to none maturity, leadership, or decision making skill. Her actions are like any other girls in the story, her logic being stripped bare from her for the purpose of fanservice, but with her case she would do it often time just to demonstrate how much her IQ is.\\n\r\n- Alice, her character is the most illogical of all the cast, she became a cheerful girl some few hours after her father's death. As far as I'm concerned no 7 years old girl with a healthy relationship with her family would do that, she would be scarred for life and become a total emo, but yes they have to make her the moe-source of the story so she has to be all happy with sugary rainbows in a zombified planet! yeah right\\n\r\n- Any minor and/or supporting characters joining the party are killed or dismissed(presumably killed) at the end of each arc, just to ensure the party go along by themselves and even with 3 hindrance characters, all will survive the apocalypse. Many minor characters are made to be specificly killed anyway but there are many that deserve to live, they just don't happen to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of both the manga and anime is great, only if the author is less absent minded with his fantasies and write the story with a more sane and realistic setting it would have been good, which is unlikely for a man who work his part-time drawing ero-doujins despite having his own animated series. It is best that the author knows their dream anime is good, but suddenly turn bad when the dream became wet, moist is acceptable but the author should have been ashamed of the drenched mess he made, instead of being proud of it.",

            "content": "There's enough reviews out there and enough information to debate over as to if Highschool of the Dead is a masterpiece or an abomination. This review is not about trying to convince you that one side is right, I'm just laying down the facts as I saw them.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nTo put things into perspective, I want you to review in your mind, all the zombie media you have ever seen - maybe it's none (maybe you're a veteran). That being said, as far as zombie media goes, the story behind HOTD is not awful. A virus hits the world, an infectious one, that spreads on contactfrom host to host. Introduce a cast of whimsical characters whose problems are limited to being outcasts in the lunchroom, here we have the typical zombie-pocalypse plot meets anime. Could the premise of running around Japan beating the already dead once over with baseballs bats and katanas be better? Sure, but if you want to watch Highschool of the Dead, that's what it's about. \\n\\n\r\nTakashi is a depressed high school student when a random zombie walks onto his school campus and everything starts from there. He and his classmates end up trying to escape said 'Highschool of the Dead' and end up running around Japan trying to survive the zombie infested nightmare by any means. That about sums up the overall plot of HOTD.\\n\\n\r\nIt's excessively violent, it's excessively suggestive, it's excessively dramatic, and for the most part the anime exists to fulfill it's fans with guns, sex, and everything else your inner-preteen-male desires. It does not deserve to be held high as a triumph of the industry nor does it sink low as being the worst invention of mankind. If you enjoy top quality action scenes then hey, you've stumbled upon a great anime!\\n\\n\r\nSome disappointments in the storyboard would be in the episode four \"half episode\" recap of the first three episodes. Another big problem would most likely be the ending, which although fulfilling, it is indeed a non-end. Seeing as the manga is still publishing and a HOTD OVA has recently been announced I'm sure a follow up to the story will come soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMe oh my, the backgrounds are delectable, the costuming is mouth-watering, the CGI is marvelous, and the action scenes are intense! Madhouse delivers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are debatable (some people love them, some people hate them), but I didn't have a real problem with any of them - even the nurse whose character design is /her whole character/, I'll touch on that in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Akeboshi Rockets perform \"HIGHSCHOOL OF THE DEAD\" and it's one of the best openings I've ever had the fortune of listening to. Even if you don't end up watch HOTD, I recommend giving it a listen - it's really great! It brings all the tension and action right to your eyes, and the visuals that accompany it in the anime really just make you want to watch HOTD. Numerous insert songs throughout (all played at such perfect times) and even a rendition of \"Row row row your boat\" (\"Shoot shoot kill them all\") pops up in the anime. The BGM is scary. Hellsa scary - and it just simply works. Of course there are cutesy tracks too (for the fanservice episodes and \"laughter moments\") but that music is chump change in comparison to the rock tracks used during the battle scenes. The voice acting is also really good - the voice of Archer (from F/SN) is Takashi and Kitmura Eri as the tsun~tsun~ Takagi. Sawashiro Miyuki (the voice of Celty from DRRR!!, Perrine from Strike Witches, and Shinku from Rozen Maiden to name a few) voices Busujima and does an excellent job. We also have some TTGL going on in this anime - Inoue Marina (Yoko) voices Rei, and Hiyama Noyubuki (Viral) voices Hirano. The voice acting rivals the soundtrack and is just as superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nYeah yeah yeah. Everyone knows. If you're watching HOTD, you're not watching for the character development. Takashi is bland, Rei is bland, the nurse is roleless, and the loli barely has two lines. \\n\\n\r\nBut on the opposite end of the spectrum we have the dynamic and exciting Busujima who crosses the line between murderer and defender of justice. Busujima, accompanied by Hirano, the military expertise who creates much humor with his dual personality that changes from meek geek to powerful slayer.\\n\\n\r\nThe very worst part about the characters would be the nurse. I often forget about her existence due to the fact that she has no character development at all. She is stupid beyond imagination (even as far as anime stupidity goes in ecchi anime, she may take the cake), and should have been the very first person killed when the zombie breakout occurs. On the other hand, her assets are great, so apparently we can just write that off as a logical reason for her survival.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed HOTD. I wasn't particularly fond of the over-the-top fanservice sequences, but I definitely had fun watching it. There were indeed moments where I cared about the characters, as flawed and stupid as some of them may be. Highschool of the Dead is a fine show and no it is not intelligent. But I don't want to give the illusion that if HOTD were intelligent or scripted to be so that it would be good. It would be a trainwreck and it was never meant to be anything more than super violent show about bashing zombies and making love to beautiful girls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThere's no serious question posed at the end of this anime. HOTD does not ask you to continue thinking about how we should live our lives or how we take what we have for granted. It's not made to be deep, it's made to be fun. It's very easy to slam HOTD for being all about violence and sex, because it is. There's subjugation of women and the glorification of man too, so if you're offended by such things, I wouldn't get too involved with this series.\\n\\n\r\nAll aside, Highschool of the Dead is a success in my opinion. It provides the viewer with enough laughs and adrenaline to keep them watching. Not once did I check the clock for when this anime was over. That's to say that HOTD is not boring. Not boring at all.",

            "content": "\"This is the way the world ends- not with a bang, but a whimper.\" - TS Eliot\r\nPreface: \r\nOh, Tetsuro Araki, how you've divided anime audiences since you introduced yourself to the world with Death Note, and look where we are now!\r\nI'm going to make this plain and simple: Highschool of the Dead is boob, butt, and fanservice city. You want bouncing breasts? Check. You want upskirt shots? Check. Do The Matrix inspired scenes of fatty mammary issue jiggling and waving in slow motion like grass in the wind excite you? My friend, you have come to the right place. \r\n(Note: I'm going to rate thison both the fanservice and my regular scale)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9 {Fanservice: 10 Bouncing Boobs out of 10}\\n\\n\r\nSome might be surprised to learn that MADhouse animated HOTD, and with it comes the excellent quality that MADhouse brings to the table. It looks great, and with Araki's eye for direction, it's a stellar show to gaze upon, in between boob shots, that is. The 3D animation is really quite good, and the standard animation is very fluid and fast. Highschool of the Dead is very cinematic, lots of sweeping camera angles, strategically (in more than one way) placed views, and lots of establishing shots. The camerawork and character details are undeniably Araki. (The creepy teacher even does the Light Yagami pen-arm swing!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8 {Fanservice: 9 Sexy Moans out of 10}\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead, much in the same vein as Panty and Stocking and Mad Bull 34 is just one of those that must be seen in English. The extra bits thrown in, the pop culture references, the strong-er language- they all really spice up the cliche ridden script. All is not lost though, Highschool of the Dead is genuinely funny- and the script is actually quite nuanced at times, at odds with the very brick-dumb zombie survival plot. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Monica Rial, the entire voice cast was new to me, which was refreshing to hear some different voices. \\n\\n\r\nThe music. The music in HOTD is really fantastic. The eponymous OP is one of the best I've heard in terms of fitting well with the visuals and setting the tone for the show. The various EDs are also quite great. BGM fits well with low haunting tones and riffage when appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6 {Fanservice: 8, two boobs for each main female}\\n\\n\r\nTakashi is our MC- he's accompanied by his girlfriend and spearmaster Rae, his childhood friend, genius, and whiny loudmouth Takagi, the silent strong type Saeko, fat gun-nut otaku Hirano, and ditzy fanservice machine Miss Boobs. The 5 students and Miss Boobs are fairly typical characters from a high school type show, but with a few exceptions. 1) They aren't stupid, and 2) they understand (4th WALL ALERT) how the zombie apocalypse works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 {Fanservice: 8, the amount of butt and boob shots in every scene}\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it, in every single zombie apocalypse show you've got two routes: \\n\\n\r\nRoute 1 is the bullshit, pseudo-scientific garbage about some infectious disease that turns the living in to the living dead, replete with dubious explanations and factually incorrect medical jargon some writer stole from WedMD. \\n\\n\r\nRoute 2  is where the zombie outbreak happens for no explained reason, and needs none. Everyone knows it's fiction, who the hell cares? It's just a plot device to get some action going. (Until you get into the Walking Dead territory of lame-ass soap opera. Yeah, I went there.)\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead takes Door #2, and to good effect. It let there be more fanservice and more characterization. Surprisingly, each character does get a fair amount of backstory about their past, their relationships with each other, and how that affects where they are now, and how they got there. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it begrudgingly, but HOTD does actually stray away from some of the conveniences of the ubiquitous zombie genre, and plays off some horror tropes at the same time. It didn't take the characters a whole season to figure out how to kill the walking corpses, and just as soon as it happens, they've got a plan and act on it. \\n\r\nTakagi is also always around to give us explanations of biology, mechanics, and answers to general knowledge/common sense questions that pop up, such as, but not limited to: \"Why is the power still on?\" \"Why is the water still working?\" \"Why do our phones not work anymore?\" \"What is it that the zombies are actually capable of?\" \"What is the government doing about this, how is there still rule of law?\". Small details like that show that at least some thought was put into the writing that wasn't female body measurements. Thought was also given to the world at large, outside of the tiny scope of our 6 characters. The world governments falling, imminent global thermonuclear war breakout, and even SPAAAAAAAACE!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 {Fanservice: 10 Oversexualized Female Leads out of 10} \\n\\n\r\nI'm not an ecchi man by any stretch of the imagination, I think it's typically a least common denominator way to garner views, but HOTD took it a step up. When it's not flashing its disproportionately sized anatomies at you, Highschool of the Dead is honestly just pure, dumb fun. I grinned practically the whole time, I laughed at the dialogue, (there's even a 4th wall smasher! \"Why are you such a ditz?\" \"Oh, it's just my character!\") the visuals were appropriately dark and violent, and the dang thing is just plain entertaining. I was impressed with the strong language and not pulling punches when it came to the violence, as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 {Fanservice: 9 Ultraviolent Bloody Zombie Dismemberments by Beautiful Girls}\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to say here; if you're looking for a humorous, boob filled romp through an overused horror plot trope, this one is for you my friend. Just turn your brain off for 23 minutes at a time, stuff some popcorn in your grubby face and chuckle along with it. Ignorance is bliss, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nSure, why not. Fanservice galore, mediocre plot and characters wrapped up in a snappily animated bloody action fest. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My boobs are killing me because you used them to balance an AK-47!\" -Rae\\n\r\n-Basically sums up the whole show.\\n",

But I will try anyway since I feel the reviews so far are heavily (and unfairly) one sided for what the anime is. \r\nIf you havent seen any episodes yet then I suggest watching the opening sequence, it'll give you a pretty accurate view of what to expect the first episode: Violence, zombies, and pantyshots. Not that I didn't guess this from the poster image on this page. So I wasn't exactly surprised. \r\nSo far we've been introduced to most of the main characters, though two werevery brief (the samurai girl and the nurse). The character design is quite cute, even appealing, and the animation is pretty high quality. I was impressed by these two factors. Though the inconsistency of the main character bothered me slightly (massive eyes in one shot, then very thin manly ones the next.). But I'm just being picky there. The only thing I don't enjoy about the visuals are the random close ups of girls underwear, or very smoothly animated boob bouncing. I know it's an anime so it isn't all that strange, but surely that's pushing a lot of potential viewers away? \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, even though the anime seems to be heading for a violent/dramatic harem setup, it was still fairly enjoyable thanks to how well the action was animated. I just doubt I'll be watching it for any story or character development. Worth checking out, but don't get caught up in any of the hype.",

            "content": "Fan Service and zombies. That's all this show is. So I suppose that any review has to cover both of them. Ladies first I guess.\r\nThe opening titles alone has a dozen crotch and boob shots. None of them serve any purpose. Throughout the show you are constantly plastered with this given the slightest opportunity. Or even when they have to create an opportunity. The number of dialogue scenes where the camera slowly goes down to focus on their panties averages out to at least two an episode. Probably more. The worst episode by far is episode six. In it the girls all bathe together, withpredictable fondling and lesbianism, while the two guys sit in the other room and talk about guns. That's the whole episode right there. Oh, except for the fact that all the girls try to sleep with the main guy. I'm assuming that they got drunk somewhere in there because they all act it after the bath. Either it's just assumed or that's just how this guy thinks girls act when they let all their crazy feminine emotions out.\\n\\n\r\nThis is symptomatic of the treatment of the girls in general throughout the series. All of the girls (with one exception) offer nothing but an opportunity to show off their bodies. There are four main girls. I can't be bothered to remember their names so I'll just identify them by their hair color. Pink is a total b*tch. She says she's a genius at every possible opportunity although she never demonstrates any proof of it (many of her 'facts' are wrong and the ones that are right she cannot possibly know), and she enjoys belittling people for it. The blonde girl is a complete bimbo. She's the school nurse but she has giant breasts and the IQ of a five year old. The high point of her introduction is the 'comedic' moment where a male student is devoured alive protecting her and she's so indifferent she can't even remember his name. She never speaks except to whine or fawn all over the main character who is I might point out, actually an underage student. I suspect she works at a high school for a very specific reason... Brown hair is also obnoxious and likes to go on about how great the guy's friend was even though he's still traumatized from killing him. At one point she's thrown from a car and she just lies there for at least 3-4 hours (it goes from midday to sunset) while everyone else protects her. She's not hurt or anything, she just gets up and walks it off when the plot feels like advancing. Naturally she's the main love interest. The last girl is purple haired and she's the only semi-good one. She's a master with swords and genuinely loves killing zombies. Her competence and professionalism do not prevent her from being used as yet another sex doll for them to display. It is made quite clear that even the competent girl can do nothing without a guy to lead her. More than that the girls cannot think for themselves and constantly put everyone's lives in danger because of their uncontrolled emotions and lusts. It really is a disgustingly misogynistic and exploitative show.\\n\\n\r\nSo now the zombies. Zombies are cool right? How can they mess them up? Well first off they never call them zombies. They seem to think this makes them realistic somehow. Secondly they bind them with stupid rules and then constantly break them. These zombies are cannot see, smell or touch. The only sense they have is hearing. Sounds interesting right? So naturally they'll be quiet and sneak around to prevent the zombies from hearing them. Except they don't. They run around screaming with zombies all around ignoring them and then one of them will bump into a pole, or drop a bat, or the wind in the trees will make noise and suddenly the zombies are attacking them everywhere. I want you to think hard about that last one. The wind in the trees attracted the zombies. THE WIND IN THE FRIGGIN' TREES!!!!!! So having established by the second episode that zombies need sound to hunt they then proceed to ignore it until it is convenient to the show for them to be in danger. How can there be any actual sense of danger when they ignore their own rules whenever it's convenient?\\n\\n\r\nThe two guys are there too. That's really all that can be said of them. The main guy is basically how the author views the perfect guy to be. He has no real flaws and is fawned over to an obscene degree by all the women. The other guy is a fat nerd and a gun buff. He's probably the most interesting character there since he's extremely competent at one thing and enjoys it immensely. Naturally he's treated with contempt by all the girls, who are nothing if not superficial.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the good things...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI'm drawing a blank here. I suppose that technically it's an impressive series. The animation is quite good and the character designs aren't bad at all. The main theme's pretty catchy too. Apart from that zip. Zilch. Nada. This show has no redeeming features whatsoever. I suppose that if you're a 12-year-old boy or can't figure out how to search for hentai on the internet this might be a good show for ya. I have to say that I enjoyed it immensely, though not for the reasons the creators intended. The sheer stupidity and horribleness of the show alone make it worth watching if you like that sort of thing. My brother and I played a drinking game to it based on taking a drink whenever we saw fan service, but we couldn't repour fast enough to get through the opening titles.",

            "content": "Hello there fellow anime lover, and welcome to yet another review of the REALLY hyped anime called Highschool of the dead (or HOTD for short...). In this review I'll be pointing out why you should (or you should not) watch this, but before I start let me say one thing: If you don't like high-end ecchi animes then this series is NOT for you. That said, let's get on with it.\r\nHOTD is yet another one of Japan's attempts to take on the \"zombie fighting\" scene, this time following six survivors as they try to... well... survive through the apocalypse. Does it remind you of something?I don't know about you but it sure does remind me...\\n\r\nIt all starts when one day an infected person (which we don't know how it got infected) knocks (literally) the door of a highschool and bites a teacher. Then, guess what... An apocalypse breaks and in about an hour or so half the city has gotten infected!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the whole series is nothing out of the ordinary. 6 survivors trying to survive as the whole virus spreads and more and more people become zombies. While it is good at the first half (till the sixth episode), it then starts to get more and more (and more) of a high-end ecchi rather than an apocalypse. This killed the mood for me, as the story at that point suddenly got into the ecchi side, without leaving room for the apocalypse to really shine, as a zombie fan would expect.\\n\r\nWhile the story is good till the first half, then it starts having many plot holes and twists, with many characters breaking out of nowhere and joining (and later leaving) the group of the initial 6 survivors and helping them. All of this happens in only 6 episodes (the second half), which makes the story REALLY undeveloped with no room for any development character wise, but I'll get into that later... If the whole high-end ecchi thing got tossed then it would be a great anime action-wise.\\n\r\nScore: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn terms of main characters, the whole group of the six survivors consists of 2 guys and 4 girls. While the initial cast was interesting in terms of personalities, then (at the second half) becomes what you would expect of a high-end ecchi, where more and more (and more) skin is showed. All of that happens within an episode and thus lacks of proper development. While some characters do develop, it is still not enough.\\n\r\nIn all that, let's add the sudden appearence of side-characters who \"help\" (and some even go against) the group, which again lacks of proper development and leaves way too many holes.\\n\r\nScore: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the pros if you want to watch the show. It is smooth and detailed, and covers all the action in a good way. The shading is done well and the whole atmosphere is good enough for the whole apocalypse. Nothing more, nothing less!\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the second pro of the whole show and it adds perfectly to the action and the atmosphere of the apocalypse. The opening and the many endings are well done and fit perfectly into the show. If I was expecting something whenever an episode would end, that was one of the many ending songs.\\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRecap:\\n\r\nWhile HOTD has a really strong promise as an anime, it then fails to achieve the title of \"Great\", simply because of the whole twist into a high end ecchi. It IS good if you want to watch some zombie slaying, all with a great atmosphere and a great soundtrack (and if you want to take a look at some boobs...), but if you expect a story well developed and a good cast, you will be disappointed eventually. \\n\r\nScore: 6/10",

            "content": "An anime about zombies with lots of fan-service thrown in.\r\nFirstly I should point out that I'm not the biggest fan of fan-service animes however I am a huge fan of zombie films and generally all things dead but living. \r\nHigh school of the Dead follows a group of high school students and their attempt to survive the sudden worldwide zombie apocalypse. The anime has been faithful to the manga which is always a plus in my eyes however it seems almost too faithful at times, as there has clearly been a lot of effort made to ensure that each episode of the anime covers exactlyone chapter of the manga. Due to this the pacing of the anime seems a little stretched at times and there have been episodes which could very easily have been made to cover 2 chapters of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe Artwork of HOTD is very good and really it does have a good music selection throughout the anime, but for some reason it doesn't feel dark or apocalyptic enough for me, possibly a bit too much emphasis on breast physics then on what I imagine would be the mood of a zombie apocalypse. As for the main characters themselves, there are less developed and less 3 dimensional characters around but there aren't that many of them although I will concede that as the story hasn't progressed far character development may arrive later. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is probably a bit harsh as there are some moments which have been fun but overall I have too many small issues to give this a good score. If the episodes were paced a little less rigidly to the manga, the mood darkened slightly (even at the cost of some of the fun), a little less breast physics and a bit more character development this would have been a solid 7/8 or higher in my book.\\n",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is based at the beginning of the zombie apocalypse, centered around the lives of five teenagers, a teacher and a small child - accompanied by her dog - in their quest to find their families.\r\nThe plot/story-line provided a good basis for the anime itself, giving many different directions to be taken and to keep the anime ongoing for several series. However, it quickly becomes clear that the story-line, while still obvious and in play, appears to fade into the background in a few episodes, the idea of teenage drama taking over. Yet, the plotline is a constant and this is akey feature throughout the entire anime.\\n\r\nThe art style for this anime could be classed as original but commonly falls into the style of hentai and ecchi styled characters. Every female character, excluding the child, is sexualized to the point where the watcher has to double check they aren't actually watching hentai. The design of the zombies is brilliant however, but still doesn't make up for the poorly-drawn anatomy of the female protagonists.\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is effective, well done and the best thing about the anime. The intro and outro are good choices of music, fitting well with the apocalypse theme of the anime. Not only that, but the sound effects used throughout the anime effectively created the effect of a realistic apocalypse, silence rarely occurring with sirens in the distance, wails of the dead, etc. Even the voice acting was well chosen and fitted well with each of the characters.\\n\r\nHowever, the character development in this anime was poor for the majority of the characters. Granted, there was a good distribution in the attitudes of the characters, there was little to no character development for the main male-protagonist and many others. The characters only occasionally acted realistically to the stress of the situation; one turning abusive and another having a break down at one point.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was decent, but is discontinued. And in many ways, this is most definitely a good thing.",

I have nothing against on the art when it comes to HOTD. For me this anime has the greatest art on summer anime lineup. The characters are well drawn and of course the zombies\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe opening really rocks. I\u2019m listening to it when I was writing this review.The seiyuu also fits the characteristic of the character it\u2019s near perfect if only the male protagonist wasn\u2019t shouting a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is no development overall. When you\u2019re watching this you will only see this factor. Boy accepts who or what the girl whose with him whether it\u2019s a bad or a good personality. There is nothing happening when boy + girl is stuck to a certain area. They are not even maturing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy some fan service scenes panties showing at the right time. But nothing follows. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nInstead of wasting your bandwidth and time for this anime go download/watch hentai instead. This is one of the \u201cwasted\u201d anime on summer line up this year, it has a great impression at episode 1 and got good music/bgm and the art was best but after episode 5 nothing more. It\u2019s up to you if you want to watch a fan service suspense anime that nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\n Episode seen : 5/12\\n",

            "content": "High School of the Dead is about a group of breasts trying to avoid getting eaten by zombies in whatever way possible. Tagging along with these breasts are 2 of our heroes, Kouta and Takashi. A couple pairs of breasts are even in on the action part when they're not bouncing across the screen like jello filled balloons hiding behind incomplete articles of clothing.\r\nBut in all seriousness, High School of the Dead has actually been very enjoyable overall. And I'm not a fan of fan service.\r\nStory: Here are some breasts, here are some zombies, and here are 2 guys to enjoy and protect the breastspretty much sums it up. With a show like this, do you really need a complex plot? Do you watch The Simpsons in the hopes that the characters will change and mature as time goes by? God no. Homer's still an ignoramous (all be it tainted by the Family Guy brand of humour) and Bart's still causing trouble. High School of the Dead operates in a similar fashion. You don't really expect much in terms of character development or plot. You expect a lot of fan service, and some action whilst fighting zombies. HOTD delivers on both. It's the \"how\" that sets it apart though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: So HOTD is well animated. Just putting that out there. The animation is clear, it's well done,  and it's eye-catching. The way they animate action scenes is high quality stuff. And they made sure that boobs would jiggle at every opportunity. So there's a good framerate going, and crisp clean artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like to think of the sound section as more than just opening and ending tracks. When we're talking about sound, we're talking about background music, sound bytes and effects, voice casting etc... HOTD has no characters whose voices don't suit them, and the voice acting is well performed. The drone of zombies does it's job. To be honest, I haven't really noticed background music in the episodes during action scenes. I can't tell you if the background music fits well or not, cause there may not be much. But what I can tell you is that what they're doing sound-wise in the show works. Where they choose to put music blends so well you won't be able to distinguish it from the animation. Where there is no music, it adds a suspenseful effect to help bring you the realization that we're in a zombie-infested wasteland of a city. So the sound department is definitely solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here are some boobs, sometimes they show butts too. Honestly, character is underdeveloped in HOTD. We've got a ditzy nurse, an egotistical girl, a somewhat selfish and reliant girl, a strong girl displaying leadership qualities, a macgyver who can work with any scenario, and the male leader. But most of that can be summed up as such. \" We have 4 pairs of breasts, one is useful, a Macgyver and a typical male lead. I don't mean to demean it or anything, but the other characters get so bogged down in fan service that you could seriously give them any archetype and the show wouldn't be much different. HOTD revolves around only 3 of the 6 main characters, and the only thing bringing it up from mediocre to fair (5 to 6) is our Macgyver. Kouta is not only epic and awesome in his practical knowledge, he's wonderfully written, funny, and someone our inner otaku can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really, really dislike fan service anime. You have to give me more than some panties and bras to make me want to watch a show. Thankfully, HOTD realized this. There is enough action to make it enjoyable on that aspect alone, but I really feel like Kouta saves the show from being a big flop. He's not the main character, nor is he the most important, but he's there as some comic relief, as well as an integral part of the main cast. You'll find yourself enjoying this show overall, and when you look back, you'll find most of the best parts involved Kouta getting a nosebleed, getting all excited over a weapon, or shooting zombies in the head with a nail gun. That's not to say you can't enjoy anyone else, Kouta just elevates it to be really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Amidst the incredibly overwhelming fan service, there's a lot of great stuff going on in HOTD. There's good action, there's some small romance, there's comedy, there's suspense and there's the reality of the situation in that the characters portrayed aren't really all that special outside their role in the group. We've got an assembly of people who rely on each other for survival, in a world crawling with danger. And overall, it's a pretty good show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a final note: Really, I don't mean to try and simplify a show beyond what it is, but HOTD is already pretty simple. Here are some Zombies, here are some boobs, enjoy.",

And as far as the plot goes, that about covers it. You could probably replicate it by watching The Walking Dead on mute next to a porn hub playlist.\r\nIn all seriousness, this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. Here is one of those anime that really struggles to understand what its trying to be.The mindlesssex and  violence, which is what it is, is constantly being undercut by  one of the worst harem anime plots I've ever seen. Character development is minimalist to say the least, and every time it tries to make a character even remotely interesting, it's undercut by how silly the whole thing is. One minute a girl is talking about how she's afraid of her inner, violent, dark side, and the next she's riding on the roof of a van wearing nothing but underwear and an apron while holding a katana. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime accomplishes virtually nothing. It fails at being hentai, it fails at being harem, and it doesn't add anything to either genre or any other. Would not watch again.",

            "content": "High School Of The Dead is a good anime. The tragedy is that it could have been a *great* anime if not for some horrible mistakes. \r\nLet me explain. The setup is awesome. Zombie apocalypse+ a renegade group of kids + anime? It's pretty much every nerd's wet dream. Unfortunately, the writers decided to focus on the \"wet\" part much more than the dream.\r\nA lot of people have been debating over HotD's overuse of fan service. Is it justified? I personally don't think so. Here you have a perfectly awesome setup for the apocalypse. People grabbing their guns, moraldilemmas, false messiahs, etc. HotD sets this up in a fairly realistic way and creates an immersive world that terrifies and fascinates the viewer. Then they give you episodes where 90% of the screen time is decided to naked women touching each other. Other episodes are more toned down, but the fan service isn't very subtle and it is very distracting and at times annoying. Shizuka, One of the main characters (who really isn't a character as much as she is a walking-talking fetish provider) has boobs that are literally larger than her head and does absolutely nothing besides acting stupid. She provides absolutely no other value to the show, and one has to wonder how she even gets out of bed in the morning. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the other characters also have the same kind of one demential personality. Then you have characters like Saeko, and Takashi, who end up being dynamic and very interesting to watch. These two characters provide the show character development, constantly walking the line between hero and killer. They are fairly fascinating to watch, especially given that the series never promoted itself as being thought provoking. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is tough to describe, because while it is a visually impressive show, some of the character designs are incredibly awkward. As I mentioned before, the breast proportions on the female characters are insane. Rei and Saya have very edgy and unattractive hair that makes their characters look a bit cheaper than the rest of the cast. Despite this, most of the illustrations are very beautiful and it's generally top notch animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to enjoy HotD is to expect very little from it and just go along for the ride. It has some terrible faults that might really ruin it for a lot of people, but watching the group survive the apocalypse is incredibly entertaining. It's a great mindless anime that is far better than any ecchi I have ever seen.  If you are looking for a show with well developed characters and tasteful character interactions, find a different show. I would say that its worth making the exception for HotD though.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is a show that knows a very, very base demographic and knows exactly how to pander to it. It aims to please simple-minded, uniformly male teenagers with base level action and lots and lots of large, jiggling breasts. Highschool of the Dead has quickly entered into the ranks of shows extremely popular, not for being well-written or emotive, but simply for being a barrel of big, dumb fun.\r\nThe problem is... it's not very good at it.\r\nAs the name would suggest, Highschool of the Dead involves a highschool and dead things. More specifically, the series begins in a highschool and revolves arounda bunch of highschool students, who happen to have walked into a George A. Romero film. In other words, they're surrounded by undead, bloodthirsty corpses... zombies. From here, the plot is about as simple as can be. The cast has to try and not die.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, it really speaks volumes that Highschool of the Dead manages to fuck up such a simple task, for a wide variety of reasons. But let's start with the most glaringly obvious one... the fanservice. OK, so considering the demographic the show is aiming for, it's hardly surprising that HotD uses a lot of fanservice. But Highschool of the Dead crosses the line of what an acceptable amount of fanservice would be repeatedly. Any scene that was otherwise good had an irritating tendency to shove some schoolgirl's underwear into the camera. And don't even get me started on the infamous \"Boob Matrix\" scene.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no matter how much fanservice is in a show, it would not destroy an otherwise good show. So let's get to the next reason HotD is an incredibly poor anime - the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's summarize the cast very quickly. The everyman, the ditz, the needy girl, the bitch, the action chick, and the nerd. Not one of these characters has any more depth than that. I have literally told you everything you need to know about the characters in the space of one sentence. Takashi is completely unremarkable, Shizuka is dopey and annoying, Rei is irritatingly helpless and inconsistent in her character, and Saya (probably the worst member of the cast) is a self-righteous bitch who has no consideration for anybody else and considers the rest of the cast below her. The only passable members of the cast are Kouta Hirano (named and designed after the creator of Hellsing, a MUCH better take on the same style), who manages to make his military obsessions at least entertaining, and Saeko, who manages to not be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Highschool of the Dead, though, is that for a show that tries to be simple and fun... it's very boring.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a survival horror really needs you to care about whether the characters live or die to work. At first, after a seemingly significant character is killed off, it seems quite possible that major characters will be killed off, and that the series will be a struggle to survive. And yet, after that, not one character we care about dies. It becomes quite clear that the entire cast is in no real danger, due to having that strange immunity from danger that being a main character grants you. This means that we are simply stuck watching these unlikeable characters do things we don't care about. It would have at least been passable if the action had been well-directed, but it really isn't. There are no fight scenes that really stick out (barring the aforementioned Boob Matrix, which sticks out for all the wrong reasons). The action is mediocre at best. All of this leaves it up to a plot that really doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this leave us with? A show that really doesn't have any positive points at all, really. It's watchable, I'll give it that much, and the first episode was quite good. But it really doesn't follow through on any of the potential it has. The themes in this show have been done before many times, and almost always better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Just watch a George A. Romero film instead. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 4/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Hellsing, Elfen Lied.",

            "content": "After seeing the long line of reviews on HotD, I thought I'd say my piece on here to what I think is a \"good\" show. Not a \"very good\" show, not even a \"great\" show, but a \"good\" show as it is. Of course this may change should the anime continue to be as entertaining as its been so far.\r\nHaving come with no expectations, seeing as that ecchi seemed to ooze the moment you watch opening credits(something people should have noticed when they started this series), I was pleased and amused to what it had delivered.\r\nStory - 6\r\nBefore I start I believe it my dutyto just add this trivial information for those asking about the plot since some say its lacking or that there are none. So what is plot?\\n\\n\r\nPlot: In fiction, the story of a play, novel, romance, or poem, comprising a complication of incidents which are gradually unfolded, sometimes by unexpected means. - ardictionary.com\\n\\n\r\nWhilst a 'subtle' plot does play in the background of a world on the brink of a zombie outbreak, one must understand that it will never be its main focus as we're lead by a group of high school kids and their ditzy school nurse. This series is about survival in its most basic whilst the 'subtle' plot unfolds. If they were to ever find a cure in this show, I don't think it'd be by any of the casting members as they're too bothered with who likes who, and who has bigger breasts then the other. They may not be 'teh best' cast to date(mostly mediocre), but what's wrong with that? There once was a reality TV show who had crammed a group of nobodies into a house full of cameras just to see how they'd react and called it Big Brother. Look how big that became as an entertainment medium. HotD is in the same class, but better as it sticks your clich\u00e9d anime archetypes into a world infested with zombies. \\n\\n\r\nNow for those not into reality shows are probably asking; why watch something if it doesn't even have a plot? We watch HotD for the 'over the top' reactions the cast get into when pitted with something that's out of the ordinary. I don't know about you, but that in itself is plot. The emotions and reactions executed are both hilarious and captivating at the same time, and to me is just pure entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nAnd are we entertained? Definitely. HotD is so entertaining, it's fanbase now consist of zombie-lovers(who tally the frags), ecchi fanboys(who howl at every moment of cleavage), action enthusiasts(who now has Kouta & Saeko in their favorites) and even whiners(who pretend to dislike the show and yet has kept up to the current episode). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art in HotD is crisp. From the well drawn scenery of a sunset backdrop that provides you that feeling of an impending doom, to the hack-and-slash execution of each action scene(which the zombie-lovers anticipate), one has to appreciate that HotD maybe a cut above the rest in terms of animation for this season. Coming from artists well known for their over-the-top ecchi(Daisuke & Sh\u014dji Sat\u014d), I hadn't expected anything less when I first seen their character design, and when I heard from HotD's anime director Tetsuro Araki(well known for DeathNote) stating in an interview :\\n\\n\r\nTell us what motivated you to make Highschool of the Dead?\\n\\n\r\n\"I\u2019m aiming for something I would have bought myself in middle school. At present, this would definitely have been a \u201cbuy\u201d for me. I can feel my schoolboy heart rejoicing even now.\"\\n\\n\r\n...I knew this was going to be a series dedicated to a lot of fan-service for a particular audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst some proportions may have been overdone, well hey...its anime. If you were expecting realism from a zombie-and-panty flick aimed at hormonal adolescents, then you're watching the wrong show .\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nSound is great with Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets \"HotD\" opening and the BGM sets the tone for every interaction within each episode, using rock as a theme. What's made me appreciate it even more is the director's choice of using Maon Kurosaki vocalize different lyrics for each episode which suits each ending very well. By the time the OST is out, I can guarantee it'd be number 1 for awhile in regards to downloads and music bought if your a fan of anime soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\r\nUnfortunately what sets my rating back as a whole is the casting for HotD as they are mediocre at best. Due to the pacing of the show, any form of development that they try to achieve are ruined and only comes off as cheesy, making you realize that this really is just a zombie-and-ecchi show. For those expecting romance to blossom, may be waiting a while as even I don't know where these characters are headed. One stage it may look like your average romance but by next episode it builds to a triangle and then a harem! Seeing this in the span of six episodes is just bad writing and I believe they should just stick to what they were already doing best: the zombie killing and ecchi!\\n\\n\r\nTo describe each member's characteristics as best as I could, would be to say that they are on a thin line between 2D/3D due to following their stereotypical archetype which I had mentioned earlier, whilst trying to adapt to the rules of the zombie genre. This can prove frustrating at times as each cast can act a little too superficial when facing a dilemma. Whether the creator had seen to these flaws as intentional is open for debate, but I guess overall it's growing on me and is leading me to continue just to see what they'd do next.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nWell I won't lie to you, I have enjoyed the wild and bumpy ride that is High School of the Dead thus far(even with the ecchi) and now that we're over the half-way line(seeing as MAL & ANN has listed the series at 12), I can only hope that we aren't given a forced ending or have to wait too long for a second season so that the adaptation can provide more source. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nSo as I had mentioned, HotD is a good show. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise that it's overrated especially if they've rated a 9 or 10 for shows like Sailor Moon or any other mo\u00e9 blob. Whilst it's not a Death Note or TTGL or whatever others are comparing it to at the moment, what it is is pure entertainment...and isn't that the sole reason we watch anime?\\n\\n\r\nSo my only advice to those new to this series is: if you view the show with no expectation then you'll definitely not be disappointed...and if you can't handle the ecchi then get out of the kitchen, that's reserved for Saeko in her 'Hadaka' apron..",

However, reading all of the 9s and 10s on this show made me furious. This show is not that great. Period.\r\nWhat is this show about? It's another cliched apocalyptic world, but here's the twist! It's Ecchi! Wooo. Not.\r\nIf reviewers are allow to review and praise this series after one or two episodes, I'm allowed to criticize it. Am I not? So here it goes:\r\nThe first episode opens up with an outbreak of the zombie infestation in school and the school is quicklyturned into chaos. They tell--not show--the viewers how the zombies are killed and what obscure powers the zombies have which, in my opinion, is very condescending. None of the introduced characters in the first episode are very likable. We have a whorish girl who spits out insults at the guy who saved her and We have the guy who saved her: the wannabe baddass. \\n\\n\r\nIf the purpose of the anime is to deal with the chaos and primordial catharsis, it seriously hinders the experience by adding all of the ecchi upskirt panty shots and jiggling breasts. If it's to appease the Ecchi fans, why not just go all out and make a hentai?\\n\\n\r\nHigh School of the Dead tries to shoot the wire between two very different and difficult topic and does not succeed. It is not a horrendous P.O.S. but if you're looking for a High Quality Anime, you're looking in the wrong direction. If you just want to watch half-naked girls beat the crap out of zombies, this is your show.",

            "content": "Wow. As I'm watching the new anime shows of Summer 2010 season one by one, it seems like each one is better than the last. Well, it looks like this one is going to be my favorite show of this summer. Basically, H.O.T.D takes place in a post-apocalyptic world filled with countless zombies. What makes this show special is that it combines just the right amount of fan-service, horror, and goriness without being too excessive to spice up the show. In fact, all the panchira-like fanservice seems very superficial and you'll be surprised at how the atmosphere is very sad, serious, and even quite touching.Not only that, it features beautifully hand-drawn color background arts filled with great amount of details and it creates a bizarre effect when they are placed right alongside the hordes of gray zombies.\\n\\n\r\nJust to note, H.O.T.D is directed by Araki Tetsuo, who is also known for Madhouse's masterpiece \"Death Note,\" and both works seem to share a lot of similarities such as the opening theme and the very particular style of color selection (a lot of oranges and blues were used to create a feeling of insecurity). Also, you may notice that Madhouse has put a lot of effort on the music and sound effects in order to maximize the uncomfortable feeling that goes very well with the genre of this show. Anyway, H.O.T.D. did not fall short of  my initial expectations and I hope Madhouse and director Araki Testsuo is going to continue the show just as it is.",

I don't actually want to kill zombie fans. I just REALLY hate zombie media.\r\nOverview:\r\nHighschool of the Dead represents the latest in an endless string of attempts to cash in on Zombiemania. If there is one thing that makes me go blind with rage it is zombie media and the brainless IDIOTS that keep this cash train rolling. Shows, games, and movies that are decent or mediocre become \"OMG da best thing EVAR!\" thanks to moron zombie fans. Walking Dead is a mediocreshow, but zombie fans think it is Godlike. The Last of Us was a decent 3rd person shooter that stole some puzzle elements and escort missions from the vastly superior game Ico. Zombietards voted it game of the year and say it is the best game on the PS3! I own The Last of Us and enjoyed it somewhat, but I could name 20 better games for the PS3 off the top of my head without even breaking a sweat. These rabid, conformist fans are the only real zombies and I feel like one of the few lone survivors to not get infected by the zombietard virus!\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nZombies randomly start attacking and some bland Gary Stu and his harem of poorly drawn, badly proportioned, G cup babes must fight the zombies. Japan is quickly overrun and the world's governments decide to nuke each other with ICBMs. The US is able to shoot down all but one ICBM from China and Russia while completely destroying both countries with thousands of ICBMs. Yet, the blanket of radiation from the hundreds of missiles used to wipe out China has no effect on Japan, less than 100 miles away! Only the 1 missile that hit Japan has the minor effect of taking out the electric grid. The radiation is simply ignored. I am not even going to bother explaining why the US isn't capable of shooting down thousands of incoming hypersonic missiles with our current technology. I am thinking WAY too hard considering the average IQ of this fandom. Sadly, the only reason this series isn't rated an 8.5 out of 10 is that the fanservice angered Western female viewers. If this series had ditched its piss poor attempts at humor, toned down the fanservice, and taken itself seriously it would be called...Attack on Titan. Which Zombietards also think is \"da best show Evar\". They are so conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to have a kneejerk positive response to zombie BULLSHIT, that you can replace the zombies with drooling, stumbling giants and the positive response is the same. As long as everything else in the formula is left unchanged.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nYou fail human anatomy FOR EVER!\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very lacking. At least a horror series should have a creepty OST, but this one sucks shit through a straw.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI want to use a baseball bat and brain the production staff and everyone who worked on this lazy, mockbuster!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe massive production budget barely saves this one from the lowest rating, despite my overwhelming hatred of this series! Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to go read something good like The Brothers Karamazov. Then I will use the book's tremendous size to beat some zombie fans to death with it!",

            "content": "Zombies...\r\nNot a genre I've seen in anime very often, when they do appear its always in some upbeat anime, Like hey heres a zombie, and a vampire, and a succubus, and they all love this kid who happened to go to a school full of monsters... not really my ideal zombie.\r\nThis anime does a great job of displaying what a zombie apocalypse should be like. In recent years zombies have been transformed into allot of things, there bugs, there virus', there aliens. I say NO, zombies are the mindless undead, HOTD accomplishes that.\r\nIts hard to tell where this anime will go off of only 3episodes, I am excited for the ? total episodes, a zombie anime lasting for 200-300 episodes or more? i wouldn't mind.\\n\\n\r\nSo for my actual scoring (so far)\\n\\n\r\nStory: This feels like a human reaction to a horrible situation, none of the characters are super elite soldiers, they are average people who took up arms in a time of crisis. I like where the story is going so far, with the addition of new characters along the way this could have some great development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is modern, its clean, its sharp, the animation is done well, and the linear 300 style fight scenes are fun to  watch. I DON'T like how the goriest or ecchiest scenes are blocked by a fat black bar that takes up half the screen, but hey, thats why we by the dvd's isn't it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music and sound quality is pretty good, they did kinda steal the beat for some of there songs from other zombie things like 28 weeks later. I did enjoy the homage felling tho, like they were giving praise to zombies of the past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are pretty diverse in personality. I like some, I dislike others. One thing i don't understand is why it took so long for people to group up and work together. I know, the writers wanted to weed out the weaklings so they didn't have a army of armed, half naked high school kids marching down main street.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: BAM! 10, thats biased tho because I fucking love zombies. 'nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I believe this anime has potential, unfortunatly it has potential to be horribly bad too. They need to focus on a few things here. \\n\\n\r\n1: FUCKIN ZOMBIES - The zombies need to be around, if theres like 4 episodes in a row of random character development without the appearance of a few hordes of undead, why the hell am i watching this.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters, and SHIT HAPPENS - People have to die, if the same starting cast lives more than a whole season without being scared by some zombie related event, I'm done watching.\\n\\n\r\n3. Action - This is the hardest part, the action has to be different from time to time, you can only smash a zombie head so many times before you get sick of doing it that way, Dead Rising is proof of that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway thats my review, I'll revise after about 25 or so episodes, if it lasts that long, and hey if it doesn't I may change it up sooner.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is one of those shows that I find myself having to show all of my friends, but not for the reasons the creators would probably like.  Simply put, this show is bad.  It is bad on a rather insulting level too.  What could have been an enjoyable zombie romp had to be castrated with annoying characters, stupid plot moments, inconsistent logic (even within the realm of it's own universe), unbelievable amounts of fan service, and moments that just make you scratch your head and wonder how this ever made it into production.  Because it didn't just makeit into a TV series, it somehow got some of the best animation you'll find in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on lead shounen teen Takashi, who contains every example of a Mary-Sue character.  For those who don't know, a Mary-Sue is a character who is perfect at just about everything of value, is loved by everybody unconditionally, and is always right.  Out of all the characters in this show he can be the most annoying because he turns out to always be right, even when his decisions are clearly bad.  He is perfect at everything we see him do, going so far as to render the only positive input the only other male in his group provides (shooting guns) simply by receiving the instruction to 'shoot slightly above what you want to hit'.  He immediately becomes a marksman.  The only thing he's bad at is school, but guess what gets destroyed in the first episode?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters consist of Rei, one of the whiniest characters I've ever seen, who starts off the series telling Takashi he'll never be as good as her boyfriend, telling him her boyfriend is always right, and as soon as the boyfriend dies (fist-fighting a zombie is a bad idea? SHOCK!) she begins to immediately alternate between 'you wanted him to die, how could you?' and 'please make love to me, I've always wanted you'.  There's also a kendo girl who starts off being the only cool one in the series until a completely arbitrary revelation into her backstory turns her more into a dangerous psychopath (or it would, if they ever bothered dealing with it again).  They have the 'smart' girl, who in this case simply quotes common sense and the occasional piece of relevant information she read in a textbook somewhere (which on at least one occasion I double checked and found it was wrong).  There's a gun nut who I actually kind of like, in that unlike Mr. Perfect Takashi this guy only has one GOOD quality, and that is his skill with guns.  Until, again, Takashi gets one piece of advice from him and immediately becomes a sniper.  Finally, we have Boobs Mcenzy, a nurse who doesn't know medicine, can't seem to understand anything that's happening around her, and whose very existence seems to be justified entirely by 'well, she has even BIGGER boobs than the rest of the cast'.  Later on there is a kid and a dog, but I honestly can't remember anything she does other than go to the bathroom on Takashi's shoulders (yes, this happens).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's the completely insane, psychotic teacher who nobody in their right mind would trust, yet somehow everybody looks up to him simply because he's a teacher.  He oggles the girls while licking his lips, contorts his body into insane poses while detailing why they should relent to his authority (for their own good, of course!) and has some inexplicable desire to... keep the main girls as his slaves? I'm not really sure.  It's never really explained, or at least not in any satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nOne element that confuses me about this series is how it jumps about seemingly at random between 'let's analyze this situation using logic and real world physics' and 'batshit insane anime logic'.  For example, at one point Boobs McKenzy tells them that she cannot drive the bus over a small group of zombies because it would flip the bus.  Then, as soon as the plot calls for it, she hits the gas, runs over about 30 zombies, then plows through a METAL GATE and drives down the road like nothing is wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nThis might be salvageable if the zombies were remotely scary, but in this case they go out of their way to make them seem as non-threatening as possible.  \"How do they do this?\" you ask, unaware that not only am I clearly about to tell you anyways, but that I can't hear you and you are just wasting your time.  It's simple: in this world, zombies...sorry, NOT zombies... according to this show's logic, 'they cannot be zombies, because zombies only exist in movies, therefore despite sharing almost all the characteristics with movie zombies we cannot use that name as an easy reference point because LOOK HOW ORIGINAL WE'RE BEING YOU GUYS'.  Anyways, zombies in this show apparently CANNOT SEE OR FEEL THINGS.  I don't mean 'cannot feel' as in 'cannot feel pain'.  No, they cannot feel things like a wet cloth hitting the back of their head.  Logically one could assume that if they cannot see or feel anything, they would have no way of knowing when they had someone in their grasp, yet that never stops them from doing so.  Maybe this is because everybody ignores the fact that they can only hear, and starts screaming as soon as they see even a single zombie come down the road.  I believe the author came up with this idea for one scene and one scene only: Takashi walking slowly and silently through a herd of zombies.  It's actually a really good scene, and one that gave me hope for the future of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's immediately ruined because someone hits a pipe against a railing and, instead of saying 'make a noise somewhere else to distract them' or 'just keep moving silently so they don't know where you are' Takashi just begins screaming bloody murder and alerting all zombies everywhere to their presence.  The smart girl (whose name I cannot remember) points out that, yeah, that was a stupid f**king move, but we are lead to believe that Takashi is right somehow because then a zombie tries to attack her, which somehow invalidates her point... I think? I mean, she's right, and the zombie only attacked her because she was talking which ACTUALLY PROVES HER POINT YOU GUYS but anyways they just keep screaming and running which gets a lot of people killed.  Our heroes!\\n\\n\r\nProbably the funniest use of this new 'zombie logic' comes 3/4 of the way through the series.  Some of the characters leave a building to find the yard empty.  Then suddenly, Zombies come pouring up the stairs after them!  Takashi, in a moment of brilliance that I could not make up if I tried, exclaims 'But how did they find us? DID THEY HEAR THE LEAVES RUSTLING IN THE TREES?' \\n\\n\r\nI'm not making that up.  Zombies are attracted to leaves now.  Apparently, ANY sound is enough to alert them to your presence, unless the plot demands otherwise (like the previous episode where no amount of sound from another direction would deter them from attacking them).  Then, the Kendo girl goes into a killing frenzy against the zombies and declares that the combat has 'made her wet'.  Ick.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's a subplot about America wanting to nuke everybody because come on, what else are you going to do?  We spent good money on these bombs and they aren't just gonna launch THEMSELVES! \\n\\n\r\nI very nearly stopped watching this show at episode 6, where the fan service was turned up to 11.  They found a safehouse and, while the guys were doing things like plan their next move, maintain their weapons, keep an eye out for zombies, etc., the girls got drunk, took a group bath and fondled each other before attempting to get it on with Takashi (and only Takashi, for he is the ONLY man they could go for.. other than the other guy in the group, but he's fat and nerdy so it's completely understandable since looks DO apparently matter).\\n\\n\r\nThere is clearly so much wrong with this series that it almost hurts just how good it looks.  That is the only saving grace to this show: it is GORGEOUS to behold, and the theme song can get stuck in your head quite easily.  In fact, the opening theme made me think this show would be great simply because of the tone and atmosphere it set up.  It's a shame the show itself couldn't live up to it's own opening.\\n\\n\r\nI once sat some friends of mine down and we had a drinking game to this show.  The rules were simple: Any time we saw fan service we'd take a shot.  We quickly ruled out the opening theme because there's about 4 or 5 different shots in too rapid succession to drink and pour a new glass.  After that, we had to limit it to 'just scenes of up-close boob and ass jiggles' because we were on a dangerous road to alcohol poisoning already.  We quit after 4 or 5 episodes, because I knew the safe-house episode would kill them.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's Highschool of the Dead.  If you have friends over and want to watch something mind-bogglingly bad, then grab some bottles of alcohol and watch away.  If you are looking for something DECENT, however, then try watching something better. It wouldn't be hard to find.",

            "content": "Everytime I think of this title it conjures up an awful feeling in my gut. That uneasy queasiness that you get from a laughably shitty experience, which is only made worse when you realize what it contributed to the medium as a whole. Too fully grasp this feeling of comical disgust and disappointment I'll like to ask for your attention as I construct a made up story scenario.\r\nPicture this, you're in class with your fellow students but you're the only one who watches anime as a storytelling medium. Your teacher then announces that we'll have show and tell and the subject will be different formsof media. This immediately caught your attention as you thought this would be a perfect time to share what anime has to offer with your fellow peers. Your teacher says to everyone  \"gather up stories from different genres of the medium of your choosing and you'll present a selected story of my choosing to the class\".. With that said you immediately rushed home and gather your collection. For a war epic you have your Legend of the Galactic Heroes. For thrillers you have your Death Note. For mystery you have your Monster. For action your Black Lagoon.. and the list goes on and on.\\n\r\nSo after gathering your collection, you sit bottled up with excitement as everyone presents the genre their teacher asks for. Finally it's your turn and she turns to you and say \"give us a zombie story from your selected medium\".. So you frantically dig through your collection looking for the criteria..Then when you realize you ONLY have 1 title that fit that requirement your heart sinks.. And with that ladies and gentlemen I hope you can begin to understand how this dreadful title makes me feel, as we shamefully present to the World anime's only contribution to the zombie genre. \\n\\n\r\nToday we're going to take a look at Highschool of the Boobs, an anime about our MC and a group of titts trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.... and also his struggle to keep his dick in his pants.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/All that \"plot\": 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is your standard fare zombie story that you've seen countless of times before. The only difference being the abundance of titts and panty shots thrown at you every 5 seconds. With that said it is the most immersion breaking show I've had the displeasure of watching. You're not sure if the show is trying to give you an adrenaline rush or a fucking boner. After a point you forget you were watching a zombie flick as it steadily becomes a harem. It's hard to build tension when hoards of zombies are eating someone while the camera focuses on a crotch shot. Don't get me wrong,  fanservice is nice if it serves a purpose or don't take away from the show's overall experience. But when it's constantly bombarding you with it it's hard to care about anything when they focus more on the \"plot\" instead of the plot. Speaking of \"plot\" this story ends up going nowhere with a very anticlimactic finale that leaves many question left unanswered, it was too ambiguous for its own good. This further puts a damper on a show that's already borderline garbage. \\n\\n\r\nmilk jugs/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n2 words: MATRIX BOOBS\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if this counts as an accomplishment but the art and animation for HOTD is shamefully amazing. The cinematography is top notch and feels like you're watching a blockbuster action flick. This coupled with unique camera angles and panning shots shows that the people behind the project are well versed in their field of work. Also worth noting that Tetsuro Araki, the lead director, would later take this experience to later create the jaw dropping choreographed \"spiderman\" scenes in shows like Attack On Giant Naked People. Needless to say the man knows how to take regular shows and turn them into a orgy of A-grade directing. Too bad this effort is downgraded seeing that it's still all about MATRIX BOOBS.\\n\\n\r\nSound(of boobs): 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the catchy opening song not much praise can be given to the soundtrack. It's simply muddled in the background and none of them really grabs your attention, they're typical tracks found accompanying thriller/action flicks . They  serve their purpose but not something deserving of a stand alone listen. \\n\r\nThe voice actors were all fine, they all fit their characters given straight fairly well. This is also a rare case where watching it dub is better since it doesn't take itself as seriously. Standouts being Mark Laskowski as Hirano for being able to switch from wimpy to sociopath at the drop of a hat and Maggie Flecknoe as Takagi for capturing the right amount of tsundere. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: BOOBS(1)/10\\n\\n\r\n2 guys accompanied by walking titts is basically the cast in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nWe have:\\n\\n\r\nA bitch with titts\\n\r\nA ditz with titts\\n\r\nA throw-a-fit with titts\\n\r\nA psycho skits with titts\\n\r\nA loli with little bits\\n\\n\r\nand of course Takashi Komuro & Kouta Hirano as the guys to lead the harem cast to safety. \\n\\n\r\nI would of gone into ore detail but they're simply archetypes you've seen countless of times before and don't really count as \"characters\" in my humble opinion. More like fanservice with legs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 faps /10\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy this show but everytime it proceeded to get decent it opt out to throwing  titts and panty shots in my face. The contradictory tone felt too lopsided to really give a fuck and I found myself watching it only to complete it after a few episodes in. If you watch it with friends you might get a few awkward laughs but as a means of entertainment you might as well watch a Michael Bay film since that's essentially what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an A-grade blockbuster budget anime with B-movie level entertainment look no further as this anime seem to have found a odd but effective balance of pulling it off. If you can get pass the insane amount of fanservice and mediocre script who knows, you might actually find something to like here. For everyone else wanting a decent zombie show don't even bother as it really boils down to a harem with zombie for flavoring. \\n\\n",

            "content": "HoTD is one of those anime which fanservices are proven far more annoying than any arousing. Naked female zombies, girls' panties being reveal as they are eaten, and female zombies in one of those 'fetish costume'(eg.nurse) did not turn me on in the slightest bit(and I'm a straight guy with average hormone level) and is rather highly disturbing. The mangaka's demand on how to 'put in as many jiggly boobs and panties as much as possible' sounds sick, and yeah he still make lots of money from it.\r\nOne thing I dislike of any zombie fiction is how the story is carried out, it simply bringout way too much questions, so a group of 5-7 average people with minimum battle expierence can handle infinite zombies coming at them? If that is true then why are the well-trained soldiers get munched on routinely despite having all the advantages in the world(except number) given to them? Why did the zombies that can't even run and would be killed with the slightest tap to the head manage to take over the world in the first place? Let alone doing that in TWO DAYS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\n- Takashi, doesn't really have any reason to be the leader, but as the protagonist he would be assigned so anyway, and again he's one of those protagonist who get all(almost in this case) the girls without any apparent reason.\\n\r\n- Rei, despite how many fans have loathed her for bitching unendingly, I find her decent as how she act is the most natural reaction any real girl would in that situation. Don't deny it even if you're male you would bitch like that too, so unless your boyfriend/girlfriend was munched by zombie before I hope no one bring up an arguement on this. I'm not saying everyone would do it, but as the survival of most of you and your loved ones are never really tested, I prefer you to not skip to conclusions that you won't, believe me, 1 week before this mess happened Rei wouldn't believe she would bitch like that either.\\n\r\n- Saeko, on the other hand, may be liked by many but not by me, as she is one of the most unnatural characters in the series(wearing only apron to fight zombies? what kind of logic was she using? oh of course its fanservice again)\\n\r\n- Saya is simply too self-righteous and annoying, her intellegence demonstrated by observation and planning skills didn't meet up with her self-claimed 'genius' title at all\\n\r\n- Kouta, I don't have anything against him. I agree with everyone that he's the most bearable character in the cast, but as the fat-sidekick guy living with another guy with his harem, its simply sad he's cursed not to get any girl (*SPOILER* the girl who develop romantic feelings for him is soon killed before the party proceed to the following arc)\\n\r\n- Shizuka, despite being a teacher and the oldest member of the party, she demonstrate near to none maturity, leadership, or decision making skill. Her actions are like any other girls in the story, her logic being stripped bare from her for the purpose of fanservice, but with her case she would do it often time just to demonstrate how much her IQ is.\\n\r\n- Alice, her character is the most illogical of all the cast, she became a cheerful girl some few hours after her father's death. As far as I'm concerned no 7 years old girl with a healthy relationship with her family would do that, she would be scarred for life and become a total emo, but yes they have to make her the moe-source of the story so she has to be all happy with sugary rainbows in a zombified planet! yeah right\\n\r\n- Any minor and/or supporting characters joining the party are killed or dismissed(presumably killed) at the end of each arc, just to ensure the party go along by themselves and even with 3 hindrance characters, all will survive the apocalypse. Many minor characters are made to be specificly killed anyway but there are many that deserve to live, they just don't happen to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of both the manga and anime is great, only if the author is less absent minded with his fantasies and write the story with a more sane and realistic setting it would have been good, which is unlikely for a man who work his part-time drawing ero-doujins despite having his own animated series. It is best that the author knows their dream anime is good, but suddenly turn bad when the dream became wet, moist is acceptable but the author should have been ashamed of the drenched mess he made, instead of being proud of it.",

            "content": "There's enough reviews out there and enough information to debate over as to if Highschool of the Dead is a masterpiece or an abomination. This review is not about trying to convince you that one side is right, I'm just laying down the facts as I saw them.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nTo put things into perspective, I want you to review in your mind, all the zombie media you have ever seen - maybe it's none (maybe you're a veteran). That being said, as far as zombie media goes, the story behind HOTD is not awful. A virus hits the world, an infectious one, that spreads on contactfrom host to host. Introduce a cast of whimsical characters whose problems are limited to being outcasts in the lunchroom, here we have the typical zombie-pocalypse plot meets anime. Could the premise of running around Japan beating the already dead once over with baseballs bats and katanas be better? Sure, but if you want to watch Highschool of the Dead, that's what it's about. \\n\\n\r\nTakashi is a depressed high school student when a random zombie walks onto his school campus and everything starts from there. He and his classmates end up trying to escape said 'Highschool of the Dead' and end up running around Japan trying to survive the zombie infested nightmare by any means. That about sums up the overall plot of HOTD.\\n\\n\r\nIt's excessively violent, it's excessively suggestive, it's excessively dramatic, and for the most part the anime exists to fulfill it's fans with guns, sex, and everything else your inner-preteen-male desires. It does not deserve to be held high as a triumph of the industry nor does it sink low as being the worst invention of mankind. If you enjoy top quality action scenes then hey, you've stumbled upon a great anime!\\n\\n\r\nSome disappointments in the storyboard would be in the episode four \"half episode\" recap of the first three episodes. Another big problem would most likely be the ending, which although fulfilling, it is indeed a non-end. Seeing as the manga is still publishing and a HOTD OVA has recently been announced I'm sure a follow up to the story will come soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMe oh my, the backgrounds are delectable, the costuming is mouth-watering, the CGI is marvelous, and the action scenes are intense! Madhouse delivers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are debatable (some people love them, some people hate them), but I didn't have a real problem with any of them - even the nurse whose character design is /her whole character/, I'll touch on that in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Akeboshi Rockets perform \"HIGHSCHOOL OF THE DEAD\" and it's one of the best openings I've ever had the fortune of listening to. Even if you don't end up watch HOTD, I recommend giving it a listen - it's really great! It brings all the tension and action right to your eyes, and the visuals that accompany it in the anime really just make you want to watch HOTD. Numerous insert songs throughout (all played at such perfect times) and even a rendition of \"Row row row your boat\" (\"Shoot shoot kill them all\") pops up in the anime. The BGM is scary. Hellsa scary - and it just simply works. Of course there are cutesy tracks too (for the fanservice episodes and \"laughter moments\") but that music is chump change in comparison to the rock tracks used during the battle scenes. The voice acting is also really good - the voice of Archer (from F/SN) is Takashi and Kitmura Eri as the tsun~tsun~ Takagi. Sawashiro Miyuki (the voice of Celty from DRRR!!, Perrine from Strike Witches, and Shinku from Rozen Maiden to name a few) voices Busujima and does an excellent job. We also have some TTGL going on in this anime - Inoue Marina (Yoko) voices Rei, and Hiyama Noyubuki (Viral) voices Hirano. The voice acting rivals the soundtrack and is just as superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nYeah yeah yeah. Everyone knows. If you're watching HOTD, you're not watching for the character development. Takashi is bland, Rei is bland, the nurse is roleless, and the loli barely has two lines. \\n\\n\r\nBut on the opposite end of the spectrum we have the dynamic and exciting Busujima who crosses the line between murderer and defender of justice. Busujima, accompanied by Hirano, the military expertise who creates much humor with his dual personality that changes from meek geek to powerful slayer.\\n\\n\r\nThe very worst part about the characters would be the nurse. I often forget about her existence due to the fact that she has no character development at all. She is stupid beyond imagination (even as far as anime stupidity goes in ecchi anime, she may take the cake), and should have been the very first person killed when the zombie breakout occurs. On the other hand, her assets are great, so apparently we can just write that off as a logical reason for her survival.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed HOTD. I wasn't particularly fond of the over-the-top fanservice sequences, but I definitely had fun watching it. There were indeed moments where I cared about the characters, as flawed and stupid as some of them may be. Highschool of the Dead is a fine show and no it is not intelligent. But I don't want to give the illusion that if HOTD were intelligent or scripted to be so that it would be good. It would be a trainwreck and it was never meant to be anything more than super violent show about bashing zombies and making love to beautiful girls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThere's no serious question posed at the end of this anime. HOTD does not ask you to continue thinking about how we should live our lives or how we take what we have for granted. It's not made to be deep, it's made to be fun. It's very easy to slam HOTD for being all about violence and sex, because it is. There's subjugation of women and the glorification of man too, so if you're offended by such things, I wouldn't get too involved with this series.\\n\\n\r\nAll aside, Highschool of the Dead is a success in my opinion. It provides the viewer with enough laughs and adrenaline to keep them watching. Not once did I check the clock for when this anime was over. That's to say that HOTD is not boring. Not boring at all.",

            "content": "\"This is the way the world ends- not with a bang, but a whimper.\" - TS Eliot\r\nPreface: \r\nOh, Tetsuro Araki, how you've divided anime audiences since you introduced yourself to the world with Death Note, and look where we are now!\r\nI'm going to make this plain and simple: Highschool of the Dead is boob, butt, and fanservice city. You want bouncing breasts? Check. You want upskirt shots? Check. Do The Matrix inspired scenes of fatty mammary issue jiggling and waving in slow motion like grass in the wind excite you? My friend, you have come to the right place. \r\n(Note: I'm going to rate thison both the fanservice and my regular scale)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9 {Fanservice: 10 Bouncing Boobs out of 10}\\n\\n\r\nSome might be surprised to learn that MADhouse animated HOTD, and with it comes the excellent quality that MADhouse brings to the table. It looks great, and with Araki's eye for direction, it's a stellar show to gaze upon, in between boob shots, that is. The 3D animation is really quite good, and the standard animation is very fluid and fast. Highschool of the Dead is very cinematic, lots of sweeping camera angles, strategically (in more than one way) placed views, and lots of establishing shots. The camerawork and character details are undeniably Araki. (The creepy teacher even does the Light Yagami pen-arm swing!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8 {Fanservice: 9 Sexy Moans out of 10}\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead, much in the same vein as Panty and Stocking and Mad Bull 34 is just one of those that must be seen in English. The extra bits thrown in, the pop culture references, the strong-er language- they all really spice up the cliche ridden script. All is not lost though, Highschool of the Dead is genuinely funny- and the script is actually quite nuanced at times, at odds with the very brick-dumb zombie survival plot. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Monica Rial, the entire voice cast was new to me, which was refreshing to hear some different voices. \\n\\n\r\nThe music. The music in HOTD is really fantastic. The eponymous OP is one of the best I've heard in terms of fitting well with the visuals and setting the tone for the show. The various EDs are also quite great. BGM fits well with low haunting tones and riffage when appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6 {Fanservice: 8, two boobs for each main female}\\n\\n\r\nTakashi is our MC- he's accompanied by his girlfriend and spearmaster Rae, his childhood friend, genius, and whiny loudmouth Takagi, the silent strong type Saeko, fat gun-nut otaku Hirano, and ditzy fanservice machine Miss Boobs. The 5 students and Miss Boobs are fairly typical characters from a high school type show, but with a few exceptions. 1) They aren't stupid, and 2) they understand (4th WALL ALERT) how the zombie apocalypse works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 {Fanservice: 8, the amount of butt and boob shots in every scene}\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it, in every single zombie apocalypse show you've got two routes: \\n\\n\r\nRoute 1 is the bullshit, pseudo-scientific garbage about some infectious disease that turns the living in to the living dead, replete with dubious explanations and factually incorrect medical jargon some writer stole from WedMD. \\n\\n\r\nRoute 2  is where the zombie outbreak happens for no explained reason, and needs none. Everyone knows it's fiction, who the hell cares? It's just a plot device to get some action going. (Until you get into the Walking Dead territory of lame-ass soap opera. Yeah, I went there.)\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead takes Door #2, and to good effect. It let there be more fanservice and more characterization. Surprisingly, each character does get a fair amount of backstory about their past, their relationships with each other, and how that affects where they are now, and how they got there. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it begrudgingly, but HOTD does actually stray away from some of the conveniences of the ubiquitous zombie genre, and plays off some horror tropes at the same time. It didn't take the characters a whole season to figure out how to kill the walking corpses, and just as soon as it happens, they've got a plan and act on it. \\n\r\nTakagi is also always around to give us explanations of biology, mechanics, and answers to general knowledge/common sense questions that pop up, such as, but not limited to: \"Why is the power still on?\" \"Why is the water still working?\" \"Why do our phones not work anymore?\" \"What is it that the zombies are actually capable of?\" \"What is the government doing about this, how is there still rule of law?\". Small details like that show that at least some thought was put into the writing that wasn't female body measurements. Thought was also given to the world at large, outside of the tiny scope of our 6 characters. The world governments falling, imminent global thermonuclear war breakout, and even SPAAAAAAAACE!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 {Fanservice: 10 Oversexualized Female Leads out of 10} \\n\\n\r\nI'm not an ecchi man by any stretch of the imagination, I think it's typically a least common denominator way to garner views, but HOTD took it a step up. When it's not flashing its disproportionately sized anatomies at you, Highschool of the Dead is honestly just pure, dumb fun. I grinned practically the whole time, I laughed at the dialogue, (there's even a 4th wall smasher! \"Why are you such a ditz?\" \"Oh, it's just my character!\") the visuals were appropriately dark and violent, and the dang thing is just plain entertaining. I was impressed with the strong language and not pulling punches when it came to the violence, as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 {Fanservice: 9 Ultraviolent Bloody Zombie Dismemberments by Beautiful Girls}\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to say here; if you're looking for a humorous, boob filled romp through an overused horror plot trope, this one is for you my friend. Just turn your brain off for 23 minutes at a time, stuff some popcorn in your grubby face and chuckle along with it. Ignorance is bliss, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nSure, why not. Fanservice galore, mediocre plot and characters wrapped up in a snappily animated bloody action fest. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My boobs are killing me because you used them to balance an AK-47!\" -Rae\\n\r\n-Basically sums up the whole show.\\n",

But I will try anyway since I feel the reviews so far are heavily (and unfairly) one sided for what the anime is. \r\nIf you havent seen any episodes yet then I suggest watching the opening sequence, it'll give you a pretty accurate view of what to expect the first episode: Violence, zombies, and pantyshots. Not that I didn't guess this from the poster image on this page. So I wasn't exactly surprised. \r\nSo far we've been introduced to most of the main characters, though two werevery brief (the samurai girl and the nurse). The character design is quite cute, even appealing, and the animation is pretty high quality. I was impressed by these two factors. Though the inconsistency of the main character bothered me slightly (massive eyes in one shot, then very thin manly ones the next.). But I'm just being picky there. The only thing I don't enjoy about the visuals are the random close ups of girls underwear, or very smoothly animated boob bouncing. I know it's an anime so it isn't all that strange, but surely that's pushing a lot of potential viewers away? \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, even though the anime seems to be heading for a violent/dramatic harem setup, it was still fairly enjoyable thanks to how well the action was animated. I just doubt I'll be watching it for any story or character development. Worth checking out, but don't get caught up in any of the hype.",

            "content": "Fan Service and zombies. That's all this show is. So I suppose that any review has to cover both of them. Ladies first I guess.\r\nThe opening titles alone has a dozen crotch and boob shots. None of them serve any purpose. Throughout the show you are constantly plastered with this given the slightest opportunity. Or even when they have to create an opportunity. The number of dialogue scenes where the camera slowly goes down to focus on their panties averages out to at least two an episode. Probably more. The worst episode by far is episode six. In it the girls all bathe together, withpredictable fondling and lesbianism, while the two guys sit in the other room and talk about guns. That's the whole episode right there. Oh, except for the fact that all the girls try to sleep with the main guy. I'm assuming that they got drunk somewhere in there because they all act it after the bath. Either it's just assumed or that's just how this guy thinks girls act when they let all their crazy feminine emotions out.\\n\\n\r\nThis is symptomatic of the treatment of the girls in general throughout the series. All of the girls (with one exception) offer nothing but an opportunity to show off their bodies. There are four main girls. I can't be bothered to remember their names so I'll just identify them by their hair color. Pink is a total b*tch. She says she's a genius at every possible opportunity although she never demonstrates any proof of it (many of her 'facts' are wrong and the ones that are right she cannot possibly know), and she enjoys belittling people for it. The blonde girl is a complete bimbo. She's the school nurse but she has giant breasts and the IQ of a five year old. The high point of her introduction is the 'comedic' moment where a male student is devoured alive protecting her and she's so indifferent she can't even remember his name. She never speaks except to whine or fawn all over the main character who is I might point out, actually an underage student. I suspect she works at a high school for a very specific reason... Brown hair is also obnoxious and likes to go on about how great the guy's friend was even though he's still traumatized from killing him. At one point she's thrown from a car and she just lies there for at least 3-4 hours (it goes from midday to sunset) while everyone else protects her. She's not hurt or anything, she just gets up and walks it off when the plot feels like advancing. Naturally she's the main love interest. The last girl is purple haired and she's the only semi-good one. She's a master with swords and genuinely loves killing zombies. Her competence and professionalism do not prevent her from being used as yet another sex doll for them to display. It is made quite clear that even the competent girl can do nothing without a guy to lead her. More than that the girls cannot think for themselves and constantly put everyone's lives in danger because of their uncontrolled emotions and lusts. It really is a disgustingly misogynistic and exploitative show.\\n\\n\r\nSo now the zombies. Zombies are cool right? How can they mess them up? Well first off they never call them zombies. They seem to think this makes them realistic somehow. Secondly they bind them with stupid rules and then constantly break them. These zombies are cannot see, smell or touch. The only sense they have is hearing. Sounds interesting right? So naturally they'll be quiet and sneak around to prevent the zombies from hearing them. Except they don't. They run around screaming with zombies all around ignoring them and then one of them will bump into a pole, or drop a bat, or the wind in the trees will make noise and suddenly the zombies are attacking them everywhere. I want you to think hard about that last one. The wind in the trees attracted the zombies. THE WIND IN THE FRIGGIN' TREES!!!!!! So having established by the second episode that zombies need sound to hunt they then proceed to ignore it until it is convenient to the show for them to be in danger. How can there be any actual sense of danger when they ignore their own rules whenever it's convenient?\\n\\n\r\nThe two guys are there too. That's really all that can be said of them. The main guy is basically how the author views the perfect guy to be. He has no real flaws and is fawned over to an obscene degree by all the women. The other guy is a fat nerd and a gun buff. He's probably the most interesting character there since he's extremely competent at one thing and enjoys it immensely. Naturally he's treated with contempt by all the girls, who are nothing if not superficial.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the good things...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI'm drawing a blank here. I suppose that technically it's an impressive series. The animation is quite good and the character designs aren't bad at all. The main theme's pretty catchy too. Apart from that zip. Zilch. Nada. This show has no redeeming features whatsoever. I suppose that if you're a 12-year-old boy or can't figure out how to search for hentai on the internet this might be a good show for ya. I have to say that I enjoyed it immensely, though not for the reasons the creators intended. The sheer stupidity and horribleness of the show alone make it worth watching if you like that sort of thing. My brother and I played a drinking game to it based on taking a drink whenever we saw fan service, but we couldn't repour fast enough to get through the opening titles.",

            "content": "Hello there fellow anime lover, and welcome to yet another review of the REALLY hyped anime called Highschool of the dead (or HOTD for short...). In this review I'll be pointing out why you should (or you should not) watch this, but before I start let me say one thing: If you don't like high-end ecchi animes then this series is NOT for you. That said, let's get on with it.\r\nHOTD is yet another one of Japan's attempts to take on the \"zombie fighting\" scene, this time following six survivors as they try to... well... survive through the apocalypse. Does it remind you of something?I don't know about you but it sure does remind me...\\n\r\nIt all starts when one day an infected person (which we don't know how it got infected) knocks (literally) the door of a highschool and bites a teacher. Then, guess what... An apocalypse breaks and in about an hour or so half the city has gotten infected!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the whole series is nothing out of the ordinary. 6 survivors trying to survive as the whole virus spreads and more and more people become zombies. While it is good at the first half (till the sixth episode), it then starts to get more and more (and more) of a high-end ecchi rather than an apocalypse. This killed the mood for me, as the story at that point suddenly got into the ecchi side, without leaving room for the apocalypse to really shine, as a zombie fan would expect.\\n\r\nWhile the story is good till the first half, then it starts having many plot holes and twists, with many characters breaking out of nowhere and joining (and later leaving) the group of the initial 6 survivors and helping them. All of this happens in only 6 episodes (the second half), which makes the story REALLY undeveloped with no room for any development character wise, but I'll get into that later... If the whole high-end ecchi thing got tossed then it would be a great anime action-wise.\\n\r\nScore: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn terms of main characters, the whole group of the six survivors consists of 2 guys and 4 girls. While the initial cast was interesting in terms of personalities, then (at the second half) becomes what you would expect of a high-end ecchi, where more and more (and more) skin is showed. All of that happens within an episode and thus lacks of proper development. While some characters do develop, it is still not enough.\\n\r\nIn all that, let's add the sudden appearence of side-characters who \"help\" (and some even go against) the group, which again lacks of proper development and leaves way too many holes.\\n\r\nScore: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the pros if you want to watch the show. It is smooth and detailed, and covers all the action in a good way. The shading is done well and the whole atmosphere is good enough for the whole apocalypse. Nothing more, nothing less!\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the second pro of the whole show and it adds perfectly to the action and the atmosphere of the apocalypse. The opening and the many endings are well done and fit perfectly into the show. If I was expecting something whenever an episode would end, that was one of the many ending songs.\\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRecap:\\n\r\nWhile HOTD has a really strong promise as an anime, it then fails to achieve the title of \"Great\", simply because of the whole twist into a high end ecchi. It IS good if you want to watch some zombie slaying, all with a great atmosphere and a great soundtrack (and if you want to take a look at some boobs...), but if you expect a story well developed and a good cast, you will be disappointed eventually. \\n\r\nScore: 6/10",

            "content": "An anime about zombies with lots of fan-service thrown in.\r\nFirstly I should point out that I'm not the biggest fan of fan-service animes however I am a huge fan of zombie films and generally all things dead but living. \r\nHigh school of the Dead follows a group of high school students and their attempt to survive the sudden worldwide zombie apocalypse. The anime has been faithful to the manga which is always a plus in my eyes however it seems almost too faithful at times, as there has clearly been a lot of effort made to ensure that each episode of the anime covers exactlyone chapter of the manga. Due to this the pacing of the anime seems a little stretched at times and there have been episodes which could very easily have been made to cover 2 chapters of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe Artwork of HOTD is very good and really it does have a good music selection throughout the anime, but for some reason it doesn't feel dark or apocalyptic enough for me, possibly a bit too much emphasis on breast physics then on what I imagine would be the mood of a zombie apocalypse. As for the main characters themselves, there are less developed and less 3 dimensional characters around but there aren't that many of them although I will concede that as the story hasn't progressed far character development may arrive later. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is probably a bit harsh as there are some moments which have been fun but overall I have too many small issues to give this a good score. If the episodes were paced a little less rigidly to the manga, the mood darkened slightly (even at the cost of some of the fun), a little less breast physics and a bit more character development this would have been a solid 7/8 or higher in my book.\\n",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is based at the beginning of the zombie apocalypse, centered around the lives of five teenagers, a teacher and a small child - accompanied by her dog - in their quest to find their families.\r\nThe plot/story-line provided a good basis for the anime itself, giving many different directions to be taken and to keep the anime ongoing for several series. However, it quickly becomes clear that the story-line, while still obvious and in play, appears to fade into the background in a few episodes, the idea of teenage drama taking over. Yet, the plotline is a constant and this is akey feature throughout the entire anime.\\n\r\nThe art style for this anime could be classed as original but commonly falls into the style of hentai and ecchi styled characters. Every female character, excluding the child, is sexualized to the point where the watcher has to double check they aren't actually watching hentai. The design of the zombies is brilliant however, but still doesn't make up for the poorly-drawn anatomy of the female protagonists.\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is effective, well done and the best thing about the anime. The intro and outro are good choices of music, fitting well with the apocalypse theme of the anime. Not only that, but the sound effects used throughout the anime effectively created the effect of a realistic apocalypse, silence rarely occurring with sirens in the distance, wails of the dead, etc. Even the voice acting was well chosen and fitted well with each of the characters.\\n\r\nHowever, the character development in this anime was poor for the majority of the characters. Granted, there was a good distribution in the attitudes of the characters, there was little to no character development for the main male-protagonist and many others. The characters only occasionally acted realistically to the stress of the situation; one turning abusive and another having a break down at one point.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was decent, but is discontinued. And in many ways, this is most definitely a good thing.",

I have nothing against on the art when it comes to HOTD. For me this anime has the greatest art on summer anime lineup. The characters are well drawn and of course the zombies\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe opening really rocks. I\u2019m listening to it when I was writing this review.The seiyuu also fits the characteristic of the character it\u2019s near perfect if only the male protagonist wasn\u2019t shouting a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is no development overall. When you\u2019re watching this you will only see this factor. Boy accepts who or what the girl whose with him whether it\u2019s a bad or a good personality. There is nothing happening when boy + girl is stuck to a certain area. They are not even maturing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy some fan service scenes panties showing at the right time. But nothing follows. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nInstead of wasting your bandwidth and time for this anime go download/watch hentai instead. This is one of the \u201cwasted\u201d anime on summer line up this year, it has a great impression at episode 1 and got good music/bgm and the art was best but after episode 5 nothing more. It\u2019s up to you if you want to watch a fan service suspense anime that nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\n Episode seen : 5/12\\n",

Its hard to be bored in this fast paced anime where something is always happening. The story basic but one that can be good as long as done right. There's plenty of action to be found and this anime and its not half bad. The zombies weren't PERFECT in my opinion, they were slow and apparently deaf and blind, but they weren't terrible. There were times were I did laugh occasionally, and I think if you just want a zombie horror anime with bloodand violence, and not a whole lot more to it, you may enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad [And there's a lot];\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the fanservice. Now, I don't hate fanservice, especially if there's more then just guy fanservice [most animes like this are to cater to guys, but a girl can dream D:] but this anime takes it to a whole new [very annoying] level. Even if you like fanservice, I'm sure you don't want it to be taking the spotlight during the actual action, but there were times were something intense was supposed to be happening, but all you could see was unrealistically huge boobs jiggling and panty shots dominating the scenes.In a comedy anime/scene, sure, let them jiggle! But it happened so much in times that were supposed to be dark/serious and it just made it irritating. I mean, if all I wanted to see was boobs, there's lots of hentai out there. I came for high school kids being chased by face eating undead monsters! [And no matter how much you may like fanservice, I don't think ANYONE needs to see a zombie's panties. Hm!]\\n\\n\r\n And all the characters are pretty unlikable and cliche on top of that. There was one chubby nerd character[his name slips me for some reason] who was slightly amusing, but still not as likable as he could be. Everyone else was either stupid/bland or wanted very badly to be a badass, but they just come across as kind of forced, and not in a humorous way. o.o\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was basically just your generic gory zombie anime, and while it's ok if that's what you're looking for, there are still parts that just piss me off regardless of what it's trying to be. So in the long one, no I did not like this anime, I thought it was terrible. But don't let that deter you from watching it!",

            "content": "Welcome back to horror anime month. This week we're going to look at a zombie apocalypse anime, Highschool of the Dead. An anime from Madhouse based on the manga by Sato Daisuke. It's also one that I've been avoiding because every clip and image I've seen makes it look ridiculously exploitative and overly fan-servicey. So, of course, I've gotten a request to review it. I can only hope that it's better than it looks because if it's exactly what it looks like this is going to be painful. Let's dig into Highschool of the Dead and find out. Okay, now that I've watched it Ican say that it's not as bad as it looks. It's much worse. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story. Normal life gets interrupted by an outbreak of the undead. A small group of survivors runs around seeking refuge/their families. You know, the same story that gets used in virtually every zombie apocalypse story ever. Highschool of the Dead offers nothing unique or new, just the same tired cliches that most of us have gotten bored with already. If you've seen or read any zombie apocalypse narrative then you can predict absolutely everything that happens, unless you fail at basic pattern recognition. As a consequence of the cliches, or possibly the characters but I'll get to them in a moment, the whole thing is really boring, when it's not infuriatingly misogynistic, because we've seen this done to death and done with far superior execution. There's not a single original thought or scene in the whole anime. Those stretches that aren't mindless action are mostly used for highly problematic fan-service instead of anything story or character developing since Highschool of the Dead is against that sort of thing. Why have depth when you can have mindless T&A?\\n\\n\r\nNow, I said I'd get to the characters. This is another aspect that fails utterly. Like the story, there's nothing original here. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes with roughly the same depth as a puddle that's been evaporating under a hot sun for several hours. The best thing about them is that they occasionally move to two dimensional stereotypes but it's barely an improvement. There's no likable or sympathetic character to be found. The most interesting character is the dog and the dog does virtually nothing. This isn't Cowboy Bebop or Sailor Moon, there will be no animals that are also intriguing characters here, or any intriguing characters for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and action scenes could've been good. There's just one humongous problem, the entire anime is over-run with tasteless, exploitative and highly misogynistic fan-service. The action sequences are frequently broken up by random shots of bouncing breasts and panties. Class, there's as much here as there is depth. Which is to say none whatsoever. I can just see the process behind this, Artist: \"I've gotten the scene done! I think it's nice and intense with plenty of violence. The mindless action crowd'll love it.\" Sleazy douchebag: \"There's too much action. Throw in five or six panty shots and pan to bouncing breasts here, here, here, here and here.\" Artist: \"But that'll make the whole thing disjointed and it'll look terrible.\" Sleazy douchebag: \"I said do it.\" Yeah, the action scenes are disjointed with the flow being constantly interrupted for fan-service. The only major female character without breasts that had to have gone through several surgeries to get that large is the small child. The zombies look pretty bland. They look like just about every horde of zombies in media. I know, they did nothing new and it's shocking. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music are the best part of the anime. It's not that they're good, but they aren't bad either. They're just kind of mediocre. There's nothing that really stands out about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 5/10. There are some very detailed les-yay scenes involving some of the minor characters. They're used for... you guessed it, mindless and exploitative fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead is atrocious. The story and characters are completely cliche. The art is full of absurd and exploitative fan-service, which also interrupts the flow of the action sequences. It gets, do I even have to say it at this point, a 1/10. I will give it some credit. It is scary, not because of the plot or generic zombies, but because it has a fanbase. I don't know if people just love cliches or if there are that many people who are just entranced by the fan-service, but either way this pile of excrement having fans is pretty scary. All in all, there's not a facepalm hard enough.",

            "content": "I honestly couldn\u2019t be any happier with this one. It was a great show that I just absolutely had to finish in a day. The need to know what was going to happen next was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t want to stop watching it for a minute, because I was so interested in what would happen. Now true, the story is a very simple one: zombie apocalypse, find your friends who are coincidentally big breasted and love you, get out and find your family. It\u2019s what is expected when there\u2019s a zombie apocalypse, right? But it\u2019s made much more interesting then that when you get tomeet the eccentric and weird characters. Though most other zombie anime made the genre boring, this one was different. It was about blood and gore AND the relationships between the characters (though the latter is less defined). Other zombie anime, sadly, are all about the mushy love/romance that flourishes from the desperation of the situation. Again, it makes the setting seem irrelevant and like it could just as easily be a space centered anime and it could still work perfectly fine. But this, High School of the Dead, was great. Just about everything was important and relevant to the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhile zombie and horror anime may not be anything new, it is on the rise. There is a growing demand for these kinds of productions, be they animation or a definitive film (I\u2019m still waiting for 28 Months Later, should it come out). The story in this anime is simple, as I\u2019ve said before. Nothing that you wouldn\u2019t expect out of a zombie apocalypse horror anime. But it\u2019s not that simple. True, most if  not the majority of the situations are predictable, and that is a problem, but you\u2019re so focused on the blood and death that may come out of the situation that you don\u2019t stop to realize that there may be a (vague) romantic scene/situation. I will say, however, that the story has some faults of its own, that I will discuss later on. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art production value for this anime was THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF. Not that the characters or people look anything great, but the shots of scenery, and the way they choose to show the surroundings were amazing. The series, as a whole, was not exceptional. But just watch the first episode. You\u2019ll get how much thought and how much work was put into that final scene and throughout the entire episode. I was thoroughly delighted when I saw that. I was assured that the animation values would stay the same throughout, and it did. The zombies look ok, and the characters were all thought out. Their proportions aren\u2019t ridiculous (minus Saeko\u2019s) like in most anime, but I will complain that they used any excuse, ANY excuse to fit in a perverted scene. You\u2019re waiting for some action, and all of a sudden somebody\u2019s shirt is wet and transparent, or they\u2019re jumping out of a truck for dire need to save their life, and you get a very explicit panty shot (and maybe even some garter). The fan service is through the roof also. While I am by no means a fan service fan, it seems as thought the fan service was there just to lighten the mood up a bit. And at a time when all hell breaks loose, sometimes, it\u2019s nice to see some.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much I could complain about the sounds. I didn\u2019t particularly like the opening song, and the ending wasn\u2019t much better. Even though I can usually recall the song used in a fight scene from an anime quite well, I don\u2019t even remember there being any. Which is isn\u2019t good. Because that just tells me that the music either didn\u2019t fit the story, wasn\u2019t exciting or at all memorable, or my head is fucked up. Either way, it doesn\u2019t sound good. But, we can look past it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAhh, the characters. Sure, you\u2019ve got the usual big breasted friends who like the protagonist, a weird otaku, a ditzy over chested teacher, and *SPOILER* a tragic hero *END OF SPOILER*. The teacher is a lovable though childlike teacher. Her mental age is extremely low, and she seems to be very unaware of what\u2019s going on at first. She doesn\u2019t fight \u2013 in fact; she\u2019s more of a critic of the fighting. She\u2019s usually just in the background talking. However, she does carry significant information throughout the story. Though, the size of her breast is ridiculous. Too big man. Bigger then the dudes whole head. Even in the real world, its rare for them to be that big. But, the other characters all have their strong points. Saeko is sexy and mature, Rei is adorably helpless just to get attention, Saya is smart in a hot way, and the otaku is just a gun freak lol. The cast compliment each other well, and the relationships that develop between them is evident through out the story \u2013 you clearly see who cares for who, and who is accepting of who. But, the story isn\u2019t all about hot babes. The story is about the decisions made in the situations they are put in. Honestly, if you were to be put in these situations, I\u2019m sure you probably would\u2019ve made the same choices they did. \\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nWhat got at me, though, was when it appears that Takagi slept with Saeko. At the end, he says he did it to survive. It\u2019s understandable that to survive, you need all the people in your group to be level headed and stay sane throughout the experience, so that in case you get through it, your friends don\u2019t turn into murderers in it for the thrill of the kill. However, it didn\u2019t sit right with me that he sort of used her. He took advantage of her helplessness, even if he WAS helping her by comfort. Still, I just don\u2019t think it was right of him to say that. But, it\u2019s just a show, so no need to get all worked up over it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime to the fullest. It always kept my attention, because I was very curious to know how they would react to the deaths of characters they know, or the decisions they would make when they are faced with a heavy situation. They did a good job of not losing the flow of the anime. They didn\u2019t drift episodes that were focused on romance, or gore alone. Every episode had some kind of character development, except maybe that stupid half recap episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Faults:\\n\r\nOverall, it was amazing. The whole story kept me wanting more. And I seriously hope they can get a second season going soon. I think this was a really well received anime that is probably (in my opinion) perhaps the best anime of the 2010 Summer/fall season. My biggest, BIGGEST complaint about this series, however, is that it end SOOOOO open ended that the problem of the story isn\u2019t answered. You know that they are on the way to discover the answer, but you don\u2019t get any more then that. The point was to know if they\u2019re family was ok. You only find the family of a semi-supporting character. Then, when they go to find the rest of the groups families \u2013 the anime is over. DONE. Nothing else. What I loved about the ending was the quote. I won\u2019t ruin it for those that haven\u2019t seen it yet, but it is something extremely memorable and fits the show SO perfectly, that had you known the quote, you would have fit it to this show first thing.  I\u2019d go so far as to say that this quote DEFINES the show itself. Because though the end of the world is huge, the problems of a group of kids are miniscule. But don\u2019t think for a minute that it\u2019s irrelevant. This show is one for record books.\\n",

            "content": "There comes a time when I was a little girl, I watched an old zombie movie with artificial flesh floating around thin air and zombies munching brains and muscles of people. Astounding, Awesome and Appealing. 3 Amazing A's.\r\nFirst off, I am not a pervert and psychopath girl who watch nude people and women with huge breasts. I love watching different genres of anime (except yaoi and yuri) as long as they have high ratings and lots of people love them, I have various perspectives and my mind is open for everything. (except porn)\r\nWhat is HOTD? and why do people associate it with porn, nudity, boldand other ecchi stuff? The truth is I didn't have the guts to search this anime in google so I bought its DVD (guilty) not knowing anything about its background. \\n\\n\r\nAll I know is that I loved its magnificent quality, ideal story line and it is affiliated with zombies. After watching and completing the anime serie and OVA, here are the words that I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is concentrated on a virus being spread around a school which include the main characters such as, 1 annoying child, 5 students and 1 school personnel. The virus can basically turn anyone into a zombie (like all other movies). Almost all of the students were affected and transformed into a human eating machine but the characters successfully survived (not telling any spoiler because I didn't tell you how many of them continued living). Harem is also present within the characters and also a love story. I like d the fact that HOTD presented more on the killing, bashing and terminating of zombies than the superficial romance. What bothered me was the overly huge sized boobs of females that were distracting and far-fetched. I'm a girl and it bothers me.. UGH. It was between sexy and disgusting. I'll even tell you a secret, I remembered that there was one love scene but I didn't liked it at all. It was a super filler that wasn't needed to complete the story. I give it a 5 because I didn't believe that it was unique at all and the fan service ruined the whole thing for me. Especially that ridiculous infamous shotgun scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt has a different sense of style. Tall people with little heads. Gorgeous girls that has inhuman body parts. What guys dream of. \\n\\n\r\nSound looks undeniably simple and unmemorable for me. The opening has its mild rock theme and some saxophone filled sound effects for the ecchi parts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were not likable in my opinion. Takashi, the fat guy with glasses and Saeko were my favorites in the show but didn't stand out in my perspective while watching bunch of other animes after this one. I guess I didn't feel that \"Oh My God! That's him/her\".\\n\\n\r\nI only desired some parts like the brutal massacre of zombies and having the idea of action-packed scenes with magnificent tools! I liked the mop weapon, baseball bat and the stapler gun! Those were my absolute favorite parts of this show. Kind of makes me wonder what I'll use when a zombie apocalypse tried to engage in our school. I\"D LOVE THAT! It's a shame that only minimal jokes were funny and good. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like this at all. Its too much bold and nude. Some people often calls this porn. It's a shame that when people make one of the characters in HOTD your profile picture, people will discriminate you and develop a sense of disgust. In my opinion, I only want to see it because of its zombie apocalypse theme (true story) I've been wanting to watch a zombie anime genre for years and I wished it had that great feeling when I used to watch a zombie movie when was I kid but sadly it was flat and all over the place. I long for its less nudity and more on the killing stuff and also execute love stories properly without putting sexual opportunities. I give this anime 3 P's: Porn, Profanity and Poor. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch it, please don't. But if you are a pervert and you enjoy big breasted women and their underwear scooting all over your screen and moaning sexual words. That's okay too. If you're up for it then go.",

Well that dream is granted to us by HotD (Highschool of the Dead)! \r\nStory:6  (WARNING: If you can\u00b4t tolerate fanservice and gravitational boobs just don\u00b4t try watching this]\r\nWell the zombies theme, it really isn\u00b4t a very creative theme as we all western viewers know. Zombies have been one of the most overused themes in western civilization not just in movies and tv shows they\u00b4re everywhere! But the anime that kinda had the first shot at this popular theme is HotD, now the producers had 2 options, the first one being toaim for a serious plot focusing on social crisis and how the world turns more and more into an anarchist society each time bringing human kind to the edge of extinction, or plan B focusing on a group of teenage girls wearing half \u201cclothes\u201d (yeah that shit can\u00b4t be called cloth), an Otaku that is really addicted to FPS games and our main hero/leader. Is a very average plot what can I say nothing amazing but gets the job done for the genre (don\u00b4t expect nothing amazing from the plot,). Boobs + zombies \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:6\\n\r\nWe have pros and cons about the characters; we have our pretty generic characters the hot dumb chick, the fat otaku, the little girl, etc. But this is not all that bad, although characters were clich\u00e9 I really liked the cast (except from the retard blonde teacher). But the good things of the cast were 3 characters Takashi, Saeko and Kouta they just make up to the best scenes in the show and without them HotD wouldn\u00b4t be worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:8\\n\r\nWe have some pretty solid animation and really colourful vibrant art style in this anime, but you really see its full potential in the action scenes they were just super fluid making these scenes. Also I have to give them props to invent new boobs gravitational movements, is like if the boobs in this show could be accepted to be protagonists in matrix! \uf0e7==== moving aside all the jokes they did a very remarkable work with the animation is eye-catching and it really works for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nFirst I will like to talk about the OP and ED\u00b4s, I found the opening to be really good showing some great action scenes with hot chicks always works! Talking about the ending, the good thing about it is that it had a variety of tracks in each episode some better than others but no one really stood out. Now the show didn\u00b4t had a lot of OSTs and I don\u00b4t think it needed them because this silent moments where the ones that built the suspension atmosphere in the anime, the only thing I can say about the soundtracks is that they had the job done.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:9\\n\r\nArguably I could be a little bit biased talking about HotD I\u00b4m a teenager I like girls, guns and badass action scenes! But apart from that I think Highschool of the Dead is one of those anime that can be finished in a few hours without knowing, is really enjoyable and that\u2019s what it aims for.\\n\r\nSo if you like action scenes, hot girls and war humbys I totally recommend you HotD !\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n",

            "content": "High School of the Dead... Where to begin but at the obvious... Fan service out the ass. Seriously, so much fan-service by the end you're completely immune. Honestly, at times the fan-service is almost insulting, I don't ever need to see a panty shot of a girl being eaten alive. Yet, I still give this show a 9. Why? Because almost every moment of this anime was pure enjoyment for me. There was some unrealistic but kick-ass action. Some of the funniest dialogue I have ever had the pleasure to hear (well, English Dub at least). And quite frankly, I enjoyed the hordes of zombiesvs. our hero, his nerdy friend, and a cast of girls there mostly to provide titillating imagery (Note: I do say mostly). This show is a popcorn flick guys, plain and simple. But for a bit more in-depth analysis, here you go:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nA cliched story? Yeah, but it was still very well done. I liked how the general panic was displayed, as well as the moral collapse, and that drive to survive. Was it masterfully done? No, but it was surprisingly a well done zombie story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWhat can I say but that Madhouse came through once again. Top notch animation, truly. The action scenes though unrealistic, were a definite high-point.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nA very enjoyable OST. I thought the tracks were very fitting and helped to set the tone and atmosphere of a scene. I really enjoyed the opening, listened to it for most of the episodes. The variety of ending themes were good, but I honestly skipped them first time through this show, more intent on seeing the after-credits scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe weakest part of this show. They're fairly generic with little real development between them. \\n\r\n We have Takashi Kumoro, a rather common spiky haired male protagonist with a slightly dour disposition. He is better than most however as he is decisive and has a spine. \\n\\n\r\nWe then have Rei... Damn this girl was annoying. She is the childhood friend who bounces back and forth between being kind and in need of a protector, to a stuck up little brat.\\n\\n\r\nSaeko, my personal favorite character. She is strong willed, kind, respectable, and loyal. She also has fun throwing innuendo into her dialogue, so that's a plus in my book at least.\\n\\n\r\nSaya Takagi... She's an intelligent bitch... Nothing else to say here...\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kouta Hirano, the one and only bad-ass nerd who makes every moment he is on screen enjoyable. Holy hell I loved this guy.\\n\\n\r\nOh, then there's the busty ditz. I believe her name was... Oh let me see... Shizuka! She really is bland enough as a character to be remembered not by her name, but rather the role she served, that being a busty ditz. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really did love every minute of this show. The dialogue had me laughing my ass off one minute, and I was enthralled the next by the hordes of zombies getting annihilated. And yes, the fan-service was at times enjoyable. Did it go way over the top with it? Hell yes it did, but as I said, you sort of develop an immunity to it. That's not necessarily a good thing, but it never hindered my enjoyment, though I know it did for many others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nYes, I am saying this was a great anime. It accomplished exactly what it set out to do. This is a popcorn flick and should be watched as such. I went into the show expecting nothing but zombies, breasts, and action; but I surprisingly got a decent zombie story with characters that I enjoyed watching. Take this show for what it is and you may just like it, though it is understandable if the fan-service is a turn off. But honestly, I considered this to be an excellent 4 hours spent.",

Easy enough, right? And of course, this being \"Highschool\" of the dead, there are high school kids with high school level minds - at first. The story, though one may think otherwise, is pretty darn interesting. Looking past the overly distractive boobs and butt, you can actually glimpse a seriousness that isn't half bad. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, there was a plot, and yes I thoroughly enjoyed it. This wasn't a typical shoot-em-up sort of anime, nor was it a \"shoot one zombie then have sex for an hour.\" No, this actually delved much deeper into the human condition and even morality, integrity, honesty, and other lessons of life. Instead of shallowly portraying the characters as stupid, gung-ho sort of idiots that kill just for the sake of killing, the story develops in a way that each character deals with latent problems he or she doesn't realize until the zombies destroy everything they knew and cherished in their old lives. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm a guy, this may biased, but hey - who doesn't love a skinny girl with boobs bigger than her head and a waist that would make an anorexic person gag with jealously? I mean, this was obviously going for a parts of a male brain we cannot consciously control. Other than that, everything was so fluid and dynamic. The zombies were drawn so accurately it scared me - vestiges of clothing of former students and the average citizen and such. Most movies I see, zombies are clothed in raggedy old clothing, or they simply do not wear clothes. Here, it shows the gravity of the situation - your friends and relatives are zombies. Do you have the courage to pull the trigger? Not only that, but there wasn't just \"night scenes\" or \"day scenes\" - the anime covered everything in between, like early morning, late night, and early dusk - beautifully drawn colors with the sun behind and everything. It was gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, trying to ignore the moaning and groaning of that one scene (you'll know what I mean if you watch it), the sound was fantastic. The OP was so darn catchy - an instant download and hit in my book any day. The voice acting was meh, except at certain, key moments, which is why I think I rated the sound high. I didn't care too much for some of the EDs, though they changed every time, which was refreshing. The sound effects of the fighting is why the score is so high - oh my, the zombies exploding in thick ichor, the sound of the weapons, the cars and - ahh, too much gushing. Tl;dr: meh voice acting, amazing sound effects, ok OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, if it wasn't for some of the minor characters (and even some major ones!), I would've rated this top notch. The character arcs were absolutely phenomenal - I don't want to spoil too much, but of the main characters, several reveal their darkest secrets which makes the characters dynamic, and in a way, refreshing. I hate when characters remain unchanged in a series - it really irks me. Most of the characters did become dynamic - but a handful remained static. Still, overall, it was beautiful work, and the character interactions were stellar. Sigh. Ok, I know I have to mention it: Boobs and butt. There I said it. That seems to be THE way to characterize the characters: this girl has purple hair but these slender ones....\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. If you do not like ecchi or fan-service, DO NOT PICK THIS UP AND PLAY. You will not just be thoroughly disappointed, but probably disgusted. This also isn't for the light-hearted; the blood and gore is excessive, and there are some innuendos in here....But generally, this was entertaining, fast-paced and engrossing all the same. The violence and cleavage (though somewhat excessive) melded pretty well, and the characters did progress somewhat, so I'm happy. But that depends. Because sometimes, you just need a good ol' baseball bat....",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead: An overall entertaining horror anime with a strong emphasis on action and at times, an even stronger emphasis on fanservice. \r\nThe plot is quite simple and never gets too complicated. Throughout the series, the story follows a group of young students and how they adjust to life when a zombie apocalypse is thrust upon them, in a new world where society begins to crumble. The first episode introduces a zombie outbreak at their Japanese highschool and from then on the plot moves at a steady pace, with the focus on survival and searching for families rather than on discovering the causeof the outbreak. Nearly every episode is heavy with action, gore, and not least fanservice; for every zombie that's shot down, there's likely to be a close-up shot of a girl's breasts, or underwear, or both. The inclusion of several battle scenes against the undead makes this anime exciting to watch for much of the time, featuring a variety of weapons from guns, melee attacks and even boobs which defy the laws of physics. The manga hasn\u2019t finished, so the lack of a proper anime ending could mean a second season is possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Highschool of the Dead is good, which helps to bring out the best in the numerous and over-the-top action sequences (with characters jumping incredible distances and the undead beaten high into the air). There's plenty of blood being sprayed about as large numbers of humans and zombies are killed. The character models are sharp and varied, with each character having their own unique looks and hairstyles. Female clothes are especially given a lot of detail whenever they're soaked wet.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the background music is generally fast-paced and loud, which fits the anime well. The same can be said of the opening credits, which grows on you after each time it plays. The ending themes, sung by the same person and usually quite melancholic, changes after each episode; this provides variety and some of the songs are great at finishing an episode, but unfortunately this means they are also easily forgettable unless you have the soundtrack. The voice actors are competent and do a good job, and the dialogue is mostly decent.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several characters featured in Highschool of the Dead, though the number is significantly reduced if you exclude the ones who are just zombie food. The main character, Takashi, is a determined and clear-headed guy who's able to motivate and lead his fellow students effectively; clich\u00e9d, but it can\u2019t be helped as otherwise he'd make a poor leader and they wouldn't survive long against the undead. Four other highschool students, as well as a school nurse with the largest breasts in this anime (quite an accomplishment as the majority of the females are quite busty) make up the rest of the main cast. All of them are likeable enough, with Saeko and Kouta being my personal favourites for their cool personality and comedy respectively. Thankfully there is a bit of character development for the group (except for the nurse who exists purely for fanservice), mostly in the form of how their moral views and attitudes change when survival becomes the main priority. Other characters who have extended roles in the storyline are introduced throughout the anime, including a small girl and a perverted teacher. The undead themselves act as you would expect, though a little inconsistently; at times they are quick and able to descend upon someone in seconds, whereas at other moments they are slow and easy to avoid. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I enjoyed watching Highschool of the Dead, though I was in no rush to make my way through it. I usually don\u2019t mind it, but the fanservice/ecchi moments here are quite excessive, seeming at times as though it's thrown in your face (one episode features naked women and little else); luckily, I learned to appreciate this anime for what it is and not what's missing. The story is quite interesting although there aren't any real major developments, the characters are suitable enough for a show like this (didn\u2018t expect them to develop much in truth), and the action never slows down too much. Something that I found annoying was half an episode being used as a recap of previous events; it's a waste, seeing as how the series is only 12 episodes long and that there were enough manga chapters to animate.\\n\\n\r\nI won't recommend Highschool of the Dead to all, as it definitely won't be to everyone's tastes. Those who dislike ecchi will probably hate the show, regardless of how good the action or horror elements are. Deep characterization, a multi-layered plot and memorable drama is difficult to find here. MyAnimeList advertises the genre as being action/ecchi/horror/supernatural, and the anime does these things superbly, but nothing more (except for a small amount of romance). This leads me to give credit to this series for putting its full weight behind what it does best, which I believe is better than several other anime which try to be clever but end up doing a half-ass job. Although the anime version is slightly more condensed, it\u2019s still a pretty close adaptation of the manga. In the end, it all boils down to what you\u2019re looking for in this anime, how much the fanservice annoys you, and how realistic your expectations actually were after reading through the synopsis. Fans of action and zombies should definitely give Highschool of the Dead a chance and judge for themselves how enjoyable it is. \\n",

It's a show that knows its audience and has become stupidly popular as a result, and you know that saying right? If it's popular, then it's good! Highschool of the Dead is popular. Thus, Highschool of the Dead is a fucking masterpiece, correct?\r\nFirst things first, the premise is absolutely amazing! Notonly is it in the most intelligent and least lazy setting (a fucking highschool), but it's also got zombies! So it's basically an extremely dire situation that the characters have to go through? Oh my god, the story has to be really serious then! This story is really serious!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also great! The zombies are 3D animated, and we all know how advanced Japan is in 3D animation. So there totally won't be any mishaps in the shitty zombie placement or the logic of the art and animation or anything. Especially that slow motion air time! Great pacing!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also well fleshed out and developed! The relationships between the main character, who is so unique from every anime protagonist out there, and the heroines, who are sooooooooooooo unique, get a lot of development. After all, since it's a zombie apocalypse out there, due to the serious nature of the story, the characters have to think about preserving the human species as their first priority. Thus, the ecchi moments are totally justified. This show has some gripping realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is just top notch material, especially the English dub voice acting!\\n\r\n......... sorry I can't even joke about that. I almost died.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a must watch, and I'm not even joking. It's a must watch since well... it's a good subject to talk about, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: It's like an eHow on how to hook up with girls using zombies.",

Once I heard that there would be an anime based off of the High School of the Dead manga, I gotreally pumped up and started watching it once it was released. Despite how much I personally enjoyed the anime, I ended up concluding, sadly, that it wasn't as good as the manga. I'm not saying that the anime itself was bad, I'm saying that it could have been better. Without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nAs far as stories go, there haven't been a lot of unique ones out there. All of them have to do with the world facing one of two options: being eaten alive by hordes of the undead, or standing up and fighting. In High School of the Dead, that is practically what the whole point of the story is. A group of High Schoolers and their teacher with like a bust of 99 are off to survive this apocalyptic event, while looking for their families in hopes that they are safe and sound. That's what a crisis will do to you, you want to spend every moment with people you care about in sudden realization that your days on earth may be numbered. I haven't seen many zombie animes before, but I can safely say that this is definitely one of the more popular ones out there, and there is surely a reason for that, and the story might be one of those reasons. The manga is still going right now, so the story has obviously not been completed, so hopes of a season 2 might not be impossible.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed artwork, great but unrealistic character art, and awesome action scenes and effects. For an echii/action genre anime, High School of the Dead delivers in both departments. The mixture of blood and boobs actually mix perfectly for some reason, despite them being 2 different characteristics. The effects were well made, the blood seemed like a realistic amount when the fight scenes come around, and it isn't such a huge amount that people might get sick when you see it.\\n\\n\r\nI have not watched the Japanese Dub. I have only watched the English Dub. Therefore I cannot tell you the difference between the two. However, the English Dub cast was nearly perfect. I know how people feel when it comes to this kind of stuff, usually people prefer the subs just because they can't stand the english voice actors, but this time it's actually watchable to my surprise. There was maybe one character that didn't really fit too well, but overall the dubbed cast did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nBoobs and turtles. That's what I got from the characters in the show. If you haven't already figured it out, this anime has jiggle physics beyond belief. It's like every time a girl moves on this show, their jugs bounce around like they were on trampolines. It's not just bouncing, but for all I know, these boobs could have minds of their own, they could be living beings. Oh, and the turtles also have to do with boobs. Now that we've described all the main characters, lets get into some of the minor characters. Oh, wait, technically the characters I am about to talk about are the main ones, but you could never tell, because there could be a character called \"Saeko's Boobs\" or \"Rei's Boobs\" or \"Miss Shizuka's Boobs\". Jokes aside, the male protagonist of the show, Takashi Komuro. At first glance, he's just your average teenager that skips class and seems to be fairly popular with the ladies. All of this is true. But once the zombie apocalypse starts, he turns into a man of action and starts taking them all down. Next is Rei. You might know her from other characters, such as Rei's Boobs from High School of the Dead. Anyways, childhood friend of Takashi, but for some reason they kind of split apart after a few years, but obviously there's chemistry between the two of them. Apparently very skilled with a metal pole, if you know what I mean... yup, she's awesome at martial arts. Next there's Saeko. Don't mess with her. Despite the fact she has a wooden sword, she can use it with deadly force. So stay away, especially when she gets her hands on a real one, then you're screwed. Next is turtle boy, Kouta. To keep his character bio short, he's an otaku that knows his guns. Maybe next time everyone that bullied him will know to stay away, cause this fat tub of lard will shoot you. Takagi is the smarty-pants-tsundere in the group. Her hobbies: calling people fat otakus and whining. God she was annoying... Miss Shizuka, the nurse that all the guys seem to fall in love with for one reason. What might that be you ask? Her caring personality? Her good looks? Nope. Boobs. Lastly, there's Alice. The one normal girl in the group. She may be like 10 years old, but she's definitely one of the characters you'll be able to stand the most, I can assure you.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. My friends enjoyed this anime. We all enjoyed episode 6, you don't have to lie about it. We all enjoyed the OVA for High School of the Dead. No one has to lie about that. Overall, I can say that I really enjoyed High School of the Dead. If you aren't a fan of zombies, boobs, blood, boobs, action, boobs, or boobs, don't watch this. Cause there's a lot of that. Especially boobs. So many boobs. Boobs. Boobs everywhere... hopefully, if there is a next season, they might take the jiggle physics down a notch and actually focus more on the story, but that's just me. Oh, and one last thing, boobs.",

            "content": "High School of the Dead is as what the title implies. A bunch of high students have to fight off a load of zombies and make it to safety. That's it. If that already doesn't sound like your cup of tea, than perhaps you should not read ahead. If it does, perhaps you should read on. \r\nPROS\r\nI think anyone who watches HOTD will first notice the beautiful animation in the series. From the very opening credits, all the way to the closing credits, each episode looks like a moving painting. This should be no surprise to those who know of Madhouse, the studio involved inmaking HOTD. There previous efforts have been of great quality and continues here. Honestly, the animation is flawless. I have no problems with it at all. \\n\\n\r\nWith the great visuals comes a fantastic soundtrack. Just a great way to spend watching an anime like this. It fits perfectly with every situation and never lets go. I think, alone, the soundtrack would be a waste, but going hand in hand with the anime - it is fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the gore in this series is over-the-top. Everything you would want, if you're a gore hound, is in this anime. Bones broken, head exploding, etc... It's all there and quite amazing. I was surprised just how bloody the show was as it went along. Great stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nThere has been a lot of debate about the fan service in this anime. My thoughts on it are simply this. Does it distract a lot from the story? Yes. Does it make the anime unwatchable? No. It shows up a bunch of times throughout the series, but I think some people are over-exaggerating it a bit much. It's not as bad as other anime shows that have come out the past few years, but it is a bit much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story to this anime simply sucks. Don't expect any twists or turns in HOTD. There are none. It's pretty straightforward from start to finish. But again, I watched it to have fun, not for a great story. With a title like High School of the Dead, I am surprised that some viewers predicted a deep story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is really poor too. Once you learn about a character, they stay the same throughout the series. No characters evolve or become different people by the end. Surely though, that is not why anyone would watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nHOTD is a stupid anime for people who want to lay back and relax. The story isn't interesting at all and the characters are completely bland. Yet, the over-the-top action makes this anime worth it, despite all of this. It's just a fun anime that knows that it wants to be and succeeds in every aspect.",

There is just no anime where you can see bullet going through boobs in slow motion or what happens when you use boobes to support and shoot a large sniper rifle. The guns recoil and the boobs rebound almost made me choke from laughter.\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nI would recommend to watch this anime to everyone. Why? Because it is a great horror anime with a good story and interesting characters. Don't watch this only if you hate any kind of fan-service.",

            "content": "I'll make this short and sweet. Take out the fan service, and you've got a great anime. Take out Rei, too, for that matter - or put Hisashi back in. The creator of this series does hentai, too, just as a warning - there's not much nudity in this, except for the episode where the girls bathe, but that was in the manga too.\r\nHowever, here's my take on this. Watch the anime before reading the manga. The anime skipped some chapters and rearranged them, as well. The manga is much better than the anime, and has less fan service - so if you don't likethat stuff, skip the anime and head straight for the manga scanlation sites.\\n\\n\r\n------ READ ON IF YOU WANT MORE ------\\n\r\nStory: For the most part, it's very good. I'd even say great. This is how a zombie apocalypse should be. Very rarely has an anime done it right - actually, I don't believe they've ever done it right. Only video games and live action movies have, but never an anime - at least, not from my experience. With that being said, it's nice to see an anime depict monsters how they really are. Zombies were meant to be mindless creatures who only cared for more bloodshot - the only thing that came close to that was the Rosario+Vampire version of a ghoul, but I'm not even going to talk about that here. However, not only do they depict the zombies, or \"them\" (as the anime calls them), how they should be depicted, they also manage to keep it more realistic by mentioning the government issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art's fantastic from my point of view. Sure, I'd rather not look at Kouta on my computer screen, but that's just me being a horny female whenever I see Takashi. That being said, they could have made the females a little more realistic. Not every 16-18 year old girl will have big breasts. Shizuka's appearance was understandable, what high school boy doesn't want a hot nurse? None, I tell you - unless he's gay, but that's not the point. I'm not surprised by the unrealistic depiction of women in this anime, since the creator works with hentai - but I'm slightly offended. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I only liked the OP, personally. The EDs were decent though. Won't comment on the character's voices, though, as I watched the dubbed version.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters were pretty well-developed, with two exceptions. Shizuka is too much of a ditz. I know there's the whole \"dumb blonde\" stereotype, but this took it too far. She sees her clothes being as important as her like, and let me tell you, not even the dumbest blonde in real life would risk her life for a damned skirt. The other character that needed more work would be Rei - and I'm not just saying this because Saeko's my favorite female character. She's a little too dependent on Takashi. Then there's the fact that she yelled at him for killing her boyfriend when said boyfriend had been turned into a zombie. The beginning of the first episode gave me high hopes for her, but they died by the end of the same episode - and each new episode only made me dislike her more. I'll admit she has some good points to her, but most of those only show when she's alone with Takashi - and even then it's rare. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime very much. It's definitely worth it if you haven't seen it already. However, it would have been better if it wasn't so short. There's more action in the last two episodes than there is in the first ten combined, in my opinion. They could have fit a lot more into this series if they hadn't been doing one episode per chapter - and they didn't even do them in the right order.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great anime. I would definitely re-watch it. Despite the fan service, it's very enjoyable. Like I said earlier, it's a zombie apocalypse done right.",

            "content": "We've had this setup numerous times be it movies, video games, or even a good example of this, \"The Walking Dead.\" I'm not going to waste my time comparing Highschool of the Dead to other media. That would be a waste of time and besides, we both know what you're here for. Is this anime worth watching? I have mixed feelings about it the same as most reviewers, but here is my opinion. \r\nStory: 5\r\nLike I said, the story isn't a hundred percent original. Still, It's quite rare to find it in anime. I actually think this is the only anime about a zombie outbreak.Still, the good thing about these kinds of stories, is that you're able to manipulate it into anything you want. Personally, I find a fast paced survival story to be the best route.Highschool of the Dead did do this, but the whole apocalyptic setting and turmoil of possibly being turned into a zombie snack seems to wear down as the plot continues. Was there action? Yes. Was there horrific flesh eating? Of course. Did it happen to anybody important? Anyone we even care about? No, no, and no. The main flaw within the plot is that nobody we truly get to know gets killed. Nobody in the main cast really gets that close to dying. For me, that made the story a little too predictable to have the characters always be in the right place at the right time while their poor background characters are doomed. I feel that the story would be better developed if the writers were willing to sacrifice their cast a little. It makes the whole outbreak a lot more terrifying to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI admit, this anime did have some great artwork. All of the characters have unique and attractive appearances. The scenery is even better. One scene in particular are the characters in a truck, driving through the city. There are plenty of blossom petals and shots of the sky throughout and it does get you involved in the peaceful moment. The lighting is very well done as well and the animation surely is brilliant. Every bit of action is animated at its best through each splash of blood and sword swipe. The only downfall of course is the fanserivce. Fanserive is everywhere in this anime. No matter how well drawn, all the girls having humongous breasts and incredibly airy skirts that lift at the slightest movement takes away from whatever scenery there is. I'm going to go back on the truck scene again because this scene is pretty but is mildly ruined by the small panty shot given by Rei as she sits on the truck. There's also a very important scene between Takashi and Saeko that allows a bit of character development and is also intense. Still, this scene is riddled with fanserivce as well (one scene involving Takashi grabbing her breast for no reason at all). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe VA isn't anything fantastic, but they at least did a good job on emotion. The script wasn't pure gold or anything with great dialogue (cough, cough, Bakemonogtari). At most, it was okay.Still, the opening and ending music is pretty good. The opening is fast pace and really gets you into the action-adventure mood of the series. My only complaint is that the guitars gets a little too crazy at times and just sounds messy. The ending themes aren't much but are appropriately calming and slow paced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThere's honestly not much to the characters. Most are dull at best, not having that much of a personality or even likeable traits. The best character was probably Kouta who was a gun specialist. He had a lot more personality and was a major help to the group. Takashi is the usual leader/sane man/chick magnet. He's not bad, just not that memorable. Rei is overall pretty whiny, usual ending up in bad situations when she needs to be saved, though she does prove herself sometimes. Saya is pretty annoying, being a complete smartass throughout most of the story and not really changing as it goes. Saeko was the most complex of the girl characters, having an interesting back story of intense sadism. She was at least the most helpful and used her abilities for the best. Alice, was average though I admit you kind of have to feel bad for her. Then there's characters like Shizuka who you wonder why hasn't died since the first episode. This woman is useless and pretty much a walking pair of breasts for the animators to obsessively exploit any time they can. Besides her occasional nursing and driving, nothing she does really effects the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Highschool of the Dead does, it entertains you. It doesn't leave you hanging very long on climatic moments and each action scene is interesting even if it is filled with bouncing breasts and panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis anime isn't anything fantastic but it's not bad. It certainly will never be a must see or anything I'll consider re watching. It's a shame the sequel I skimmed over isn't even used to develop the plot. That entire OVA is to remind us once again of how big the girls boobs are...again. Highschool of the Dead is given a simple plot but instead of the willingness to sacrifice characters and delve deeper into the issue of how the zombie outbreak even started, they give you boobs, butts, and exploding heads.",

If you watched Mr George Romero\u2019s classic horror films, played first Biohazard games or something like that, you probably waited hard for this anime and now you got it.\r\nI have mixed feelings here. Highschool is definitely enjoyable only when it is enjoyable. Action scenes are nice, thrilling and overall well done. Music is catchy and exciting. But when it comes to writing and character development\u2026 Just screw that. I mean, even the children from kindergarten can come upwith those scenarios. Oh wait, no, back in kindergarten the children are still pure and innocent, so Highschool\u2019s writing is probably on the level of elementary school. For example, the creators came up with idea that zombies are blind, so they can only react to sound. That\u2019s okay, no complains, but why is it recalled only when the script writer needs it? The inner logic must always work, even when you cannot come up with a good idea of what to do next. Well, it is evident that plot and character development are playing the second role here. The main scene belongs entirely to the fanservice. (Yeah, zombie slashing qualifies as fanservice too.)  Like, what do you need to do when a girl you know is driven by suicidal thoughts? Just grab her breast and squeeze it as hard as you can, duh. I know that good action doesn\u2019t require good storytelling and all, but give me a break, guys. When somebody from the cast was going angsty or trying to speak seriously, I really wanted him to cut the crap and go kill some zombies already. And I think I\u2019ll use this moment to cut my own crap and move on.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I will say no more about bad scripts. I even won\u2019t mention that there is a recap in fourth damn episode. Let\u2019s better take a look on technical plane. I already praised the music, so the only thing needs to be mentioned here is animation. No major complains there, the show was good-drawn and has a nice art style. Hypersonic jelly boobies are the part I don\u2019t like about it but okay. Fanservice is fanservice, and nothing can be done here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd do you know what is the best thing about this show? It goes great with beer and pizza, so you can just turn off your brain and watch Highschool without any issues. Senseless dialogues are watering down, action becomes even more enjoyable\u2026 Seriously, I\u2019d give Highschool my Beer and Pizza Special Award, if I had any stuff like that. Watching the series in that relaxing atmosphere is certainly boosting its score high.\\n\\n\r\nAh, time to make final conclusions. Highschool was a zippy drippy creepy trap, and overall score for it is 6 points. Yep, so low one. But if you plan to watch it with alcohol (take care of your liver, guys), maybe in good company, or if you have a natural ability to keep your thoughts off, than you can safely increase the score to 8 or even 9 points. And that should do it, I think.",

            "content": "Woot, first review :D. Ok, here goes:\r\nSo this anime has been getting all sorts of feedback and I'de like to think I'm in the middle ground (I don't love it nor hate it (least, not enough to stop watching, lol).I'm going to try not to compare this anime w/ others (for instance, some guy tried to compare this w/ angel beats.....the heck?) Can't really think of anything else to say (im horrible at intro paragraphs :[) so we'll just move onto the middle ground\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI'm a huge fan of \"dark\" animes. So, naturally, the story drew me in. As for originality.....I'm not sure ifit's all THAT original. I mean, it's an apocalyptic world full of zombies. Feels like it's been done somewhere. There aren't too may plot twists so far. The story line seems to be quite simple. HOWEVER, the way it's presented is done very well. This anime does not beat around the bushes or try to hide anything (especially when it comes to girls, lol). They show you some gruesome scenes HOWEVER it isn't excessive gore (in my opinion). It's enough to get a point/feeling/mood across. You are shown a world thrown into utter chaos and discord. Law and morals are thrown aside and humanity's animal instinct to survive takes over. Hopefully this isnt much of a spoiler but, you watch as classmates abandon one another and even betray one another. You watch the victims get killed mercilesssly and friends killing the one's that were once human and/or classmates. It's quite psychological (and I love it). My only real complaint is (and im sure a few others feel the same way to) ....well...the fan service.  I don't have a HUGE problem w/ fan service (afterall, i somehow sat thru rosario vampire and to-love ru), but when you're trying to make me feel suspense and zombies are trying to rip out the protagonist's guts out, you don't just randomly throw in 3 panty shots in my face. The timing just doesnt make sense and it just ruins the mood a lot of the times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nLike most of the anime this season, the art/animation is very appealing . High School of the Dead, is no exception. In fact, in my opinion, it has some of the nicest animation in the summer 2010 line up ((especially the girls ._.). I mean, it isnt like \"ZOMGMYEYESAREINLOVE\", but no doubt I'm very impressed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nThe songs they use fit w/ the mood very well. The opening is quite catchy and  fitting with the mood and expresses what the anime is about. The endings are pretty good too, but I didn't really notice it too much\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nWell yeah, they don't really break away from your typical anime character archetypes. Only exception i guess may be Hirano (a nerdy badass: gotta love him). Everyone else is pretty typical. There isn't a ton of character development at this point (The most \"character development\" so far is seeing how many situations the girls can fan service -.-) I don't hate the characters i guess (I'm looking at you School Days >:[ ) but they aren't what I'd call \"memorable\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough th fan service in all honesty, is making this less enjoyable for me(yeah fine, question my position as a man; I this is just how it is), I really do enjoy this anime. The nice art and dark/ suspenseful mood is intense enough for me to overlook the (very random and distracting) fan service.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10:\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for an anime that doesn't require too much thinking w/ a lot of action, some gore, intense scenarios and a flurry of girls w/ bra sizes no smaller than C (lol, perfect anime for us guys",

            "content": "Well, first of all, let me get this out of the way.\r\nHave you ever played Left4Dead?\r\nIf so, this is basically Left4Dead but in show form and with lots of panty shots. Very ecchi.\r\nIf not, I guess I'll talk a bit more about it.\r\nFirst of all, the characters are kind of annoying in this show, no joke. Mostly the women are annoying though.\r\nCharacter:\r\nTakashi Komuro: the main character (a dude). He basically drops his balls in the second/third episode. He's the general easy to relate with character. Some character development.\r\nRei Miyamoto: the main characters woman (basically). She can be annoying (like most women in this show) butis at least able to defend herself adequately. Some character development.\\n\\n\r\nPink haired stuck up woman: She's reeeeeeaaaaaallly annoying. Pretty much the most annoying character I have ever come across in an anime (well at least for only having watched 4 episodes). All she does is talk about how smart she is and yells at everyone. She cannot defend herself. She is worthless. Let her die or make her have some sort of ability to kill. Seriously. Not very much character development.\\n\\n\r\nFat guy with pink hair: Makes a gun. Doesn't get pissed at pink hair. Saves pink hair a lot. Not much character development.\\n\\n\r\nNurse with big boobs: No development, just drives so far.\\n\\n\r\nWeird creepy teacher: Basically wants to be the leader, so far he has succeeded. Btw, he's really weird. Probably more character development later.\\n\\n\r\nGirl with long hair and sword: Saves the day, etc. etc. basically your average anime sword-mistress, overly powerful (although everyone is, seriously, just look at some of the scenes in the third episode). Possibly some character development.\\n\\n\r\nThose are the most important characters. Other than that just stock characters. The average high schooler. etc. etc. So far, a lot of the characters are annoying and there isn't very much development, 6, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nWell, it definitely looks nice. Nothing new when it comes to the eyes, but when someone walks, everything that should move moves (and somethings that move a bit too much, ahem, boobs?). Very good, but nothing new so 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWell, they did a good job on it. Unfortunately, I don't believe it accurately portrays how people would talk when they're like 10 feet away from a zombie,  especially when they just found out that sound attracts them. I give it an 8 because screams really sound like screams and zombies really sound like zombies.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's good enough. Story is something that needs time to develop and can't really be seen and is much harder to predict whether or not it will be good compared to things like character development. I enjoy it but nothing really new when it comes to zombie stuff, 8 because it's still a rarity among animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\n10. The tense atmosphere that is given off by this show is very apparent and very good. I am sucked into the episode I am watching and forget what's around me. I walked away from each episode trying to plan what I would do if a zombie Apocalypse were to ever occur. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, well maybe not everyone. If you hate women, or you hate zombie flicks where dumb people stay alive then this is not for you.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is probably the most unintentionally hilarious anime ever created. Never before have I laughed at moments when I'm not supposed to as many times as I did here. After all, how can you possibly tell a serious story when you have so much out of place boob jiggling and panty flashes?\r\nOkay, I'm exaggerating a little. The story is pretty typical for a zombie apocalypse, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I mean, how creative can you get when it comes to a genre where trying to survive is the only thing you really can do? Sometimes, I like topretend everything zombie related (The Walking Dead, Left 4 Dead, Lollipop Chainsaw, and of course this anime) take place in the same universe, so it does help stimulate my imagination.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story is actually well done. It's realistic (I guess), and it does bring up issues like human nature, coming of age, and whether humans are more savage than the zombies.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem though, is that while all that is going on, we're also given a constant barrage of fanservice. Barely 5 minutes can go by without a close up of breasts unrealistically bouncing across the screen. It doesn't mesh well with the plot at all, and it ends up taking a LOT of drama away from the plot, to the point where it becomes comedic. In scenes where this is intentional (like the infamous episode 6), it's not really a bad thing. But there are a lot of times where you're supposed to be growing attached to these characters, when you're not, because your focus is solely on the boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not too bad, for the most part at least. There's not really much in terms of development, but some of the character's personalities are kinda cool. I had a lot of fun watching Takagi's tsundere-ness, and Saeko's awesome sword skills. Kouta is another cool character. He develops from a whimpy nerdy kid to an extremely badass gun expert.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have characters like Shizuka, who's sole purpose on this show is to uselessly flail her boobs around, or Alice, who just acts cute and adorable in order to appeal to the lolicons. Nothing they do is significant to the plot in anyway. They could have been absent and it probably would have changed nothing about it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of scenes that don't involve ANY of the characters, and instead feature completely random people also caught in the apocalypse, kinda like The Grapes of Wrath, where every odd numbered chapter is a short story relating to the Great Depression. It gives off a haunting vibe that what's going on is affecting the anime's whole universe, not just the main cast. The one where a girl shoves her best friend at the zombies in order to get away was particularly impactful. However the problem they have is that there are simply too many of them, and they end up taking away time that could have been used to develop the characters more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. It's fluid, but hardly the best there is. The artwork is pretty good too. The character designs are a little weird though, particularly for the girls. They're not really anatomically correct in the breast area, which look more like bowling balls glued on their chest than actual boobs. I understand if the creator wanted them to look appealing, but massive boobs doesn't instantly equal hotness.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the mispronunciation of Alice's name (Arisu? Seriously?), the English dub is very well done. Takagi's voice is a personal favorite of mine. I was also surprised to see that Rei's voice actor, Jessica Boone, also does Chiyo from Azumanga Daioh. Needless to say, her vocal range is impressive, and she does a great job overall.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Highschool of the Dead. Not because it's a good anime, although it's hardly a bad anime either. I had a lot of fun watching it. You know those movies you go to see for the brainless, action-packed violence and funny actors? Highschool of the Dead is a lot like that. You pretty much watch it for the zombie-killing action and the hilariously out of place fanservice. They did genuinely try creating an interesting story, but it's because of those moments you end up enjoying that it ultimately suffers.",

            "content": "**This review is not polished. Please do not bother reading this**\r\nOne can easily summarize this series with boobies, zombies and bloodies. Highschool of the Dead is practically the first anime that fully adapts the western Walking Dead and World War Z style story. Tho one can argue Shiki and Gantz are also like this, but HSoD is the only one with survival of zombie apocalypses. \r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is very generic and predictable. Since the series is not yet finished, all the episodes are about how a group of high school student (and a teacher) try to survive the madness by using a bunch of zombiebattles in different settings. \\n\\n\r\nThis is does not mean that that plot has no meaning and message however. On multiple occasions, people with overwhelming amount of fear act irrationally, killing innocents and even preventing others from safety even they are not getting anything out of it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that there are some amount of \"meaning\" and \"depth\" in the show, they are not very well done. Most of the time it is some people's random monologue and crazy actions. Once they are over, they are over. No explanation, no development. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, I still think the plot is good enough as a zombie show. It's not like we should expect anything out of it. It is not a good plot, but it will do. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nUm, a typical protagonist is tagging along with a bunch of boobs and an otaku. All of them have boobs, yea I know dah. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is easy to tell that the author did try to create background stories and personalities to the characters, all of the effort seem to be overshadowed by the boobs. \\n\\n\r\nEfforts themselves aren't impressive either. All of the character designs feel really rushed and underdeveloped. The rich girl for example, sure she did suffer some mental issue from her family, but those issues are very unrealistic and irrelevant to the whole image of \"running away from the zombies\". \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are not well designed, and cliche. Little development with confusing motivations, characters are not where this series shins. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWell, the art is pretty good. not especially good looking, but the character models and backgrounds along with the objects do feel refreshing. Clear lines to separate the colors, brightness and shadows are very dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nOh and boobs, of course. I don;t dislike fanservice. As long as they serve some sort of purpose to the plot, (like kill la kill) I'm fine with it. The problem here is the show is showing us fan service for the sole sake of fan service. What's the point of showing girls in bathwater in the middle of fighting zombies? I just don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is directed by the same director of Attack on Titans, so the effort and quality is unquestionable. They are very smooth and action packed, rarely you see a image put idol for more than 3 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, we need to come to the realism here. As good the animations may be, they are just not acceptable. The boobs bullet dodging is simply.. yea you'll know what I'm talking about. Admit it, it is cool, but insane. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are watching this show for boobs and action, you are in the right place. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice, catchy songs, but they are not memorable to the least. OST are fitting, and they's all it is. They fit the scene, and carries the feel. Again, not memorable OST. \\n\\n\r\nNow here is the Sub vs Dub. Sub defenders tend to argue that a translated version will not get you the jokes you get from subtitles. I completely agree with that. However, this does not account to the recreation part of translating. In this show, the translator actually makes the dialogue interesting by sometimes completely change the dialogue to make it sound natural for native English viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nSince I don't speak Japanese, I can't say if the original audio is funny or not. But I certainly totally enjoyed the dub. They are funny, they are westernized and it is one of the few dub that I would actually recommend over sub for English audience. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike every zombie production, the story is usually not interesting. I did enjoy the animation and the action scenes tho, as boobilisious as they are. You would probably fall in to one of the three camps. One being the people who think the action is crazy and cool, two being the people who laugh at how stupid the actions are and three being the people who are just simply offended. Again, I think this is very enjoyable, people's opinion varies. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI think High school of the dead should be weighed leaning toward the animation. Since the plot isn't their sales point, what they have done is successful and appealing to its target audience, I give them credit for that. \\n\r\nTherefore I give it a VERY VERY generous 8/10, considering I tend to enjoy story over action. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review, and please give me some constructive feedback if you have the time, thank you. :)\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

It's okay at best. I have to admit that the beginning episodes were actually quite interesting. They managed to keep a somewhat serious tone for a while. As the story went on, it started to focus more on the characters rather than the zombie outbreak happening outside. The fan service became more frequent. I'm personally not against fan service. I like it if it's used for comedic purposes, but if the main focus is to tryto get the audience to masturbate... it's kind of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one episode where all the girls were taking a bath and trying to get Takashi's D. The only character actually focusing on the apocalypse during that time would be Kohta.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe was nice, I guess. I don't really criticize a show for being too ugly, but I guess you could say I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI didn't like the OP or ED. THe voice acting was okay. The music was nice. It fit some of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThe character development, as I suspected, was just awful.These types of characters are extremely similar to the ones used in 11eyes. There was only one character I truly liked and it was Kohta. For most of the series, he was Alpha. Saeko was a bit interesting, but I've seen sadists before. Rei is just another childhood friend who is annoying and was in love with the main character's best friend not too long ago, but he doesn't seem to mind. Saya is the rich girl who thinks she's superior to everyone in the group. Shizuka is a dumb blonde nurse with big boobs. Alice.. is just there for the sake of moe or something. Kohta is a gun otaku and is actually useful. Takahi is just a normal guy. He is pretty useless... He also looks a LOT like this guy.. http://myanimelist.net/character/3397/Kazuki_Muto\\n\r\nEvery other character is pretty much dead. It's not the best characters, but I guess it's a decent zombie killing team.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable to an extent. Some episodes were just boring. Some were interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nI have nothing to say other than.. disappointing.",

Judging only based on the first episode, I would recomend this anime to anyone intrested in genres similar to Hellsing, Elfen Lied, and Dance in the Vampire Bund. My understanding of the plot is, rescue people, discover source/reason why this happened and survival. For now, my hopes are high that this will continue to be a good anime tv series for the summer of 2010.",

            "content": "Ok, so the anime has ended, but the manga still continues, thought there have been a lot of recommendations for this anime none has come close. The closest that can be a good recommendation for this anime is the US TV series \"Walking Dead\" at FX channel and the 2004 movie \"Dawn of the dead,\" let's face it, there is just no anime nor manga to match it. Just like any zombie genre, there are no happy endings, the only endings were the main characters who were able to get away from a bad situation with the zombies, so it can only mean that theend of the world is still on going. I however do criticize the illustrator and the writer of this anime/manga for poor concept  about firearms. So, a proper trivial is in order:\\n\\n\r\nFrist let's tackle the firearms used by the charcters.\\n\r\n-The shotguns used by Takashi (Ithaca 37 and Benelli M4) has an estimated range of 110 yards, it is useful for small and fast moving targets, for military or law enforcement application it is used as a close quarter weapon. In order for him to be able to blow the heads of them living dead there should be at least a distance of 5 yards between them. This is because you would like all the buckshot to concentrated on the specific target, otherwise as the buck shots travel  will spread out  thus unable to effectively kill the zombie even if it get's hit. However, Takashi's first shotgun, Ithaca 37 is awkwardly drawn, this is because it is not suppose to be equip with an optic scope, the author seem to be not aware that a shotgun is a close quarter weapon that is not made  for precision shooting, instead it should be fitted with either a \"Red Dot\" sight, holographic weapon sight,  laser sight or a tactical flashlight. Also, the instruction which Kohta gave to Takashi is misleading when it comes to the recoil of the weapon, on the contrary with Takashi's body build handling the weapon's blow back is manageable unless you're Saya who's firing it.\\n\\n\r\n-The AR10 with optic sight  used by Kohta.The author or the illustrator can seem to distinguish the difference between an AR10 to an AR 16, this is because the AR10 is a 1950's design, it's buttstock  has a brownish color while the barrel is much slimmer and smooth design  while the AR 16 is a modern design, they  look alike, but completely different when i comes to the material and designed of the buttstock and barrel, in fact what Kohta is holding resembles more like a M16A2 SAMAR than an AR10.\\n\\n\r\n- The S&W37 Revolver used by the police, Kohta and Takashi, fact, the standard issue service pistol of the Tokyo Police Department is a Cal 37 Nambu Revolver which kinda resembles like a Colt 38 police revolver. In ep7 it is very odd for the police in the anime to use a gun which is intended  as a back-up weapon rather than a primary weapon.\\n\\n\r\n-M1A with Red Dot optic sight used by Rei, fired by Takashi. the gun is a semi-automatic weapon, so what the hell was the illustrator thinking by adding an extra picatinny grip below the stock receiver of the weapon? If it is an M1A then recoil won't be a problem for Rei to handle and for Takashi to fire it, however it looks more like an M14 DMR by the way Takashi used it ep8. Only assault rifles such as AR16 and AK47 can be equip with a picantinny rail grip for added control from recoil. \\n\\n\r\n-Crossbow, owned by Shizuka's friend Rika Minami, never used both in the anime and manga. Not very useful to kill the walking dead. But, it's useful if they intent to save ammo if they are dealing with people who have lost it.\\n\\n\r\n-Luger PO8  pistol with 32 round detachable drum, given to Saya by her mother, never used in the anime, almost used in manga. It's range is about the length of a football field.   \\n\\n\r\n-MP5 H&K to be used by Kohta soon in lthe manga. It is a close quarter sub machine gun, so, in order for Kohta to shoot them zombies in the head, he has to be at least 4 yards away, he should also has to put in semi automatic in order to be precise and save ammo. \\n\\n\r\nIf these character were to have a higher chance of survival, then the most logical thing for them to do is to head for the marina, find a boat and sail to some island to were the epidemic hasn't spread  (provided that any of them knows how to sail and navigate), instead going of the airport and hope to fly to some secured area . Co'z if they can't fly out then they can sail out just like what the character from the movie \"Dawn of the dead\" did. But it seems that the author of this manga/anime is intent of putting theses character on a mission to look for their  love ones (or what's left of them) or other encounters with the walking dead, so the question right now is, will there be a season 2 of this anime?  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I started Highschool of the Dead, I was already aware of the many clich\u00e9 scenes and overwhelming fanservice based on previous research. I have heard of the series before and yes, I held off on it because it didn\u2019t seem like my kind of anime. I was never fond of the High School Genre and Romance, especially when it tries to take itself seriously. I realized around 2/3 through the anime that I wasn\u2019t very far off on my expectations, but then again, I was a little surprised on why I was still watching it and hadn\u2019t dropped it yet. Something clicked with theanime but it still wasn\u2019t all that special even after all of the great review it had received.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the first thing I realized is the fact that this anime was trying too hard to be your ideal anime. When a zombie apocalypse breaks out, a \u201cperfect\u201d team is created of the master swordswoman and Kendo club president Saeko, the overconfident and way too brave protagonist, Takashi; His \u201cgirl\u201d Rei; a smart bitch, Saya; and a gun expert, Kouta. Then there\u2019s the ditzy school nurse, Mrs. Marikawa. They all form the expert zombie-killing group and manage to survive longer than the actual adults in the anime. Nah, too perfect. It just seems too clich\u00e9 to click. There would be a handsome, confident, ovary exploder with spikey hair that wants to get into the skirt of a hot, big \u2013breasted girl that won\u2019t stop crying about her dead boyfriend, but instead gets into the skirt of an equally sexy Tsundere swordswoman\u2026 I\u2019ve seen these elements in almost every school anime. It\u2019s as if this anime wants to be taken seriously, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not. There are just too many unbelievable and convenient events that take place. While this is the unavoidable truth, I think zombie apocalypse and supernatural animes develop a successful franchise altogether and I like the idea of combining an everyday school/slice of life anime with the zombie apocalypse genre. That developed and interesting plot and overall I think it was alright. \uf04a Unfortunately, I also realized that the plot didn\u2019t really lead anywhere. I got the fact that they were trying to find their parents, but there were just too many extra characters and elements that kind of drove my mind away from that main goal and kind of brought my head to believe that the main goal was for the main protagonist to get inside everyone\u2019s pants and kill as many zombies as he can while looking as cool as possible. Jk, but seriously, the plot strays a lot, and that kind of bothers me. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt is always a tough one to analyze in an anime because you\u2019re not just looking at the characters, but the design of the backgrounds, the animation, and the color scheme, etc. Character wise, I think they were all designed with a special thought to their character. Takashi, the protagonist was made especially cool and confident looking, Saya had glasses to mark her intelligence, etc. The fights and animation scenes were generally fantastic. There was great movement in the fight scenes and you could say that they were very \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cfun to look at.\u201d The setting design and color scheme kind of went together on this one. I noticed that not many scenes took place in broad daylight. It was always in twilight or nighttime; I think that was to add to the fear element and kind of gave the mood of the anime a boost in darkness. I liked that feeling and it worked well with the rest of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNormally, when thinking of sound, I review both openings, endings, OSTs, and also voice acting. To start, the openings and endings weren\u2019t that good. Normally, when I don\u2019t listen to it in its full every time I watch an episode, there\u2019s nothing special about it. The same went for the OST unfortunately. The voice acting, however, was hilarious. I watched dubbed for this anime and the voice acting definitely proved my point that this anime was trying too hard to be way too serious. Swears were thrown in at random and it definitely wasn\u2019t the best acting, but to tell the truth, if it were subbed, I can assure you that I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it as much as I did. The acting just added to the ridiculousness of the entire scene and made everything hilarious. I liked that about the sound, above everything else. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\n      The characters, of course, were too archetypical and there wasn\u2019t much to like about them, really. Normally, when writing a review about an anime, I look for what I liked before what I didn\u2019t like first, but the first thing I realized when I starting watching this anime, WAS the weakness of the characters. Many of them were pretty much useless and served no purpose to the plot whatsoever. If anything, the added fanservice completely took away from the plot, and I didn\u2019t like that at all. I find that the overwhelming \u201cover 9000 mark\u201d fanservice was completely distracting and once of the reasons why I didn\u2019t take the anime very seriously. Also, he personalities of the characters and their archetypes made it extremely hard to actually like a character. The only one I really had a connection with was Kouta, the fat, gun expert, and that was because he took everything seriously and looked at the world through realistic eyes, and that wasn\u2019t because he was coward either, it\u2019s because he\u2019s good at looking into the true meaning of things and only risking his life to protect what he cares for most. His friends. The other characters were God-awful. So, 6, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\n      I can\u2019t help but enjoy this anime. Even though it was trying to be serious, I found it more humorous and amusing to watch, mainly because of the unneeded elements that took away from everything else and added such that wasn\u2019t meant to be added. The action scenes were very fun and my favorite parts of the entire anime. I basically watched because of the action scenes and not the clusterfuck plot. It met my expectations and unfortunately didn\u2019t surprise me anywhere, but I found amusing enough to deserve a 9 in enjoyment.\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

            "content": "Zombies, actions and fanservice.\r\nThat\u2032s what you\u2032ll be witnessing through the whole series. Highschool of the Dead, is not just about Zombies. It\u2032s also full of ecchiness, when I say 'ecchi' it means like that. Just remove another piece of cloth after the other, it won\u2032t be just ecchi anymore. Still, Highschool of the Dead is also full of actions and fights, and that\u2032s what brought the anime. Compared to other zombie-themed anime\u2032s, Highschool of the Dead is a lot different, the thing that made Highschool of the Dead different, is it\u2032s mix of suspense thrill and too much fanservice. Set aside the fanservice, it\u2032ll bea great hit.\\n\\n\r\n- A disease which was easily passed through the whole city, and the cause is unknown or where the disease came from. Students rushing towards the exit, fighting each other for freedom, betraying your friend for your own good. That\u2032s how it works, when chaos and the beginning of the end is running towards you. Takashi Komuro, a normal highschool boy, who is living a normal life. But all of it changed with just one happening, that\u2032s when the chaos began.\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead or HOTD, was a really good watch from the start, the only problem here is the fanservice. To be honest, I\u2032m not a fan of ecchi or fanservice. If it\u2032s a comedy - ecchi anime, I might even look it up. But with just pure ecchiness, no. Seriously, there are zombies lurking around the whole city, and you even dare flirt around? Sigh. That\u2032s one of the flaws in Highschool of Dead, if the creators of HOTD wants ecchi involved in it, they should\u2032ve just made it 'light'.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the girls really do have large breasts, they\u2032re as big as a Watermelon, I\u2032m not joking. Panchi - a lot of scenes where their underwears are showing; I don\u2032t know if this is all  about surviving between chaos and death with these revealing bodies, underwears showing etc. Still, the actions are great.\\n\\n\r\n- HOTD\u2032s art, is one of the 'good' parts in the whole series. The art is great. But, not knowing it, I think it still has some flaws, but those flaws are not that big of a deal. But considering the, panty-showing and other ecchi-related stuffs here at HOTD, that\u2032s the things which I didn\u2032t like. The art, moving on to the 'breasts', they shouldn\u2032t have made it TOO BIG. By TOO BIG, I meant what I have previously said. The zombies are well-drawn, still, even though they are a zombie, there are still panty-shwoing method. Meh.\\n\\n\r\n- Now on to the next part. We are now at the Sound Section.\\n\r\nI really liked the one and only opening song of HOTD. It\u2032s a J - Rock, so naturally, it will be loud. About the ending songs, I rarely and barely listened to any of those ED\u2032s, so I probably don\u2032t have anything to review on those. Now we\u2032re on the BG\u2032s, then again, it\u2032s kind of there\u2032s no background musics. More like, the volume is too low. But there are still some few background sounds/musics which suits the scenes and mostly, the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects (i.e guns, zombie moans etc.) I\u2032d have to say, the sound effects were great, but not too great.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters, yes characters. What would an anime be without the characters? So from here, we have different characters with different personalities and traits. But of course, not like some 'crazy' personality. That\u2032s too much to handle. All the characters share the same goal - To stay alive, and to save their family. Some of the characters are nothing by annoyances; might as well not tell you. Nevertheless, some of the characters really knows how to fight.\\n\\n\r\n- Highschool of the Dead is an 'enjoyable' anime, if you put in terms of fanservice and ecchiness; but when you put it in terms of actions and zombies. Well, it\u2032s a really different matter. Depending on the watchers on which side they take. I am unsatisfied on the ending, many questions were still left unanswered, many things are still needed to be taken are of. And there\u2032s one important question that needs to be answered: How are they going to stop the virus?",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes. The story, art, sound, etc. were outstanding. At first I wasn't going to watch it because I'm not into ecchi anime, I also have never liked horror aside from elfin lied. However, after i was pressured into watching this by my friend, and i am glad I listened to her. I saw what I could have missed.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThis anime is not too scary, but not too boring.The story kept me on the edge of my seat constantly thinking \"what's going to happen next?\" In fact, since the anime is not complete, I am still wondering what's going tohappen. The one thing that caused me to almost take away a point is that this anime can be very predictable at times. But what made me keep that point was when i realized It's  not good to have everything be unexpected in an anime, and that they were right in putting in some scenes that were predictable. They also keep you wondering about one other thing. How did the zombie apocalypse start? How was the first zombie created? That is something that will put your imagination to the test.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art they used in this anime is my favorite type of anime. It is never done poorly, and they add in a lot of different guns and weapons. The color was great, and never too bright or dark. I was never distracted by other things on screen and was always drawn to look at the focus of the scene and listened to them as well. I was drawn in by the quality of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was great. I'm not sure what it is like in English Dubs, but the Japanese voice acting was some of the best I've heard. They always use the correct tone of voice in all situations. However, that's the one problem that caused me to take a point off. They use the right tone, which includes whispering. Because of the characters whispering in the first episode, I was forced to turn up the volume a tiny bit so i could hear properly. Other than that one mistake, their voice acting is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nSome of the characters didn't seem like they would survive, considering the fact that some seemed helpless and vulnerable. However, later in the series you understand how much some of them change, and you don't think the same. You can see how some of the characters who hated someone who liked them or characters who didn't know each other were brought together in order to survive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, this is an amazing anime and I recommend it for anyone who doesn't like serious horror, but likes things like zombies. This was/is my favorite psychological thriller and anime that i have ever seen.",

            "content": "(as written on The Hateful Anime Truth on Facebook)\r\nDisclaimer: The following review is opinion-only. You can take it with a grain of salt, just don't flame me over a frickin' OPINION... which apparently 99% of these people don't HAVE.\r\nOnce again, this'll be one-tier, short, because there really isn't much to say about it.\r\nWhat do you get when you mix Dead Rising and toss in one of its psychopaths in, Left 4 Dead with its 'move from point A to point B' style, and Resident Evil, with a story that... is non-existent... you'd probably get Left 4 Dead 3. Now add a Japanese high school setting.You get Highschool of the Dead... or Highschool of the Left 4 Dead Rising. Seriously, the story was pretty much, a giant outbreak of zombies from out of nowhere... so totally not Resident Evil, and thus a bunch of high school kids decide to fight through to save themselves from the zombies trying to turn them into one of their own.\\n\\n\r\n...but really, who cares about that stuff when 80% of this anime is PANTYSHOTS, PANTYSHOTS, BOOBSHOTS, PANTYSHOTS! There's a reason I'm one tiering this review, and it's because of the almighty works of FANSERVICE. I cannot watch an anime that has a pantyshot or a boobshot every 3 minutes or so. I may be exaggerating, but the moment you get to the bath scene you will understand WHY this anime is so bloody overrated.\\n\\n\r\nZombies? Really? Forget that, let's give you another pantyshot! That always fixes things.\\n\\n\r\nLike in my Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. review, I have to give this a fair to poor rating. I'll be lenient on this one and give it a 6. While the story and the concept of the whole anime is good, and the art style and music choice well done, along with the characters being superb, the fanservice just kills it for me. It almost went into Ikkitousen territory... OR WORST.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can out-pantyshot Kampfer, seek therapy.",

There's a scene that uses fanservice in one of the stupidest things you will ever see outside of a Michael Bay film. If you've seen this series, I think you know what I'm talking about. The most notable thing I can make a connection about about it is the use of a Romero-style outbreak. However, I can say that this story has spot-on pacing. It never feels like it drags on too long.There's also some creepy stuff involving social darwinism and a bus.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an incredibly well-animated series in a way that makes you ask (at least I asked) \"Was there anything else people could throw tons of money behind that season?\" This looks excellent all around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe english dub is amazing...\\n\\n\r\n...as in amazing how often they use foul language. There is a swear or other dirty word about every other sentence. If you don't want that, skip the english and go for the sub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is where I have a problem with this anime. The characterization of the female cast is not strong enough to balance out the sexualization and fanservice, resulting in me not taking them seriously as action heroines. Sekirei and Kill La Kill managed to do fanservice-heavy combat this right by having extremely strong characterizations of the female cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this anime. Not because of the fanservice, but because I was just enjoying watching the action and visuals.\\n\\n\\n",

And the main character, Takashi, behaved how I was hoping he'd behave. Near the end of the first episode Takashi's love interest, Rei, freaks out on him because he had to kill his best friend, and her boyfriend, because he turned into a zombie. She tries to blame him for what happened, and accused him of hating Hisashi because he dated her.\r\nTakashi then feels like a bother, and says he'll just head out of their protected area and kill asmany of the zombies as he can. Rei thinks he is joking at first, but he nearly climbs over their constructed fence before she grabs onto his leg crying and begging him not to leave her.\\n\r\n*end spoilers*\\n\\n\r\nThat ending was exactly how I wanted it. When she started saying those things to him I thought \"Man. What a bitch. I'd just think about leaving if I was him\", and then there he went!

Zombies are taking over the world (not literally, although I'm not gonna lie, I'd probably poop my pants if that were the case) and I couldn't be happier. Why? Because they are finally in anime too!\r\nHighschool of the Dead is pretty easy to explain because you all heard it before. There's some epidemic that turns people into zombies. After one is seen on campus and bites one of the staff, the disease now has the ability to be spread through the school. How? By bitingthe crap out of people. The other part of the story would be about Takashi, a normal high school student hesitant to confess to his crush, who gets tired of waiting and goes out with his best friend. After that same friend is turned into a zombie and killed by Takashi, his crush, Rei, and him are forced to work on their relationship in order to survive. Along with them are a group of survivors who all use teamwork in order to stay alive. Its quite simple, but the added high school drama makes it a bit more complicated, mainly because God knows that high school girls are a complex creature. This combined with zombies was a unique experience, but seemed to putter out. After a while it become confusing, and I began to not care about the drama anymore and actual hoped they'd get there head out of there butt and start killing zombies. Besides that, its your average zombie flick.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was VERY surprising to me. I wasn't expecting much because of the honestly lame title, buy it was the first thing that caught my mind. The visuals were extremely sharp and smooth, and the action seemed to carry those same visuals over nicely. The character designs were fantastic too, ESPECIALLY the women. It is the only time I found an anime girl truly sexy, and it took me off guard a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very fitting for the show, and I couldn't ask for more. Although I wasn't a big fan of the ED, the OP was completely badass and set the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters impressed the hell out of me. Each one had the personality of an actual person, and didn't feel artificial in anyway to me. Also, since the circumstances change people, the desperation that some of the characters experience felt very real for me (remember drill gun scene).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story is common, zombie killing will always be one of the best forms of entertainment, and this show deserves to join the ranks with the big boys, like Call of Duty (lol). I recommend this to people who love zombie slaying and can handle gore. If this is you, this show will be a blast.",

            "content": "We all are familiar with live-action zombie films like Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and etc.  Then we have really comical spin of the zombie apocalypse like Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead.\r\nAnd now, we have this, a zombie apocalypse anime that takes place in Japan in the perspective of highschool students.  I'm pretty sure there were many older zombie apocalypse anime in the past that I may not heard about, but this one have gotten a lot of attention from many western viewers.  Apparently, since The Anime Network was making the episodes available tofree registered users for a limited amount of time during the holidays (which they usually have most of the episodes limited to paid subscribers), I took this opportunity to watch Highschool of the Dead legally.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't really special from other zombie apocalypse films, a group of characters trying to find weaponry and food and survive against the zombies and not being eaten alive.  The zombies are the \"traditional\" zombies, slow, cumbering, and mindless zombies in hordes that mostly react to sound and anyone biten by one will become a zombie within minutes.  What makes this show unique is 1) it is an anime, 2) the setting takes place in Japan instead of either United States or a western country, and 3) the show's perspective is on a group of teenagers (along with an airhead nurse, a young girl, and a dog) instead of adults.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in note that the setting in Japan is quite important for viewers, as laws regarding to the legal minimum driving age, drinking age, gun ownership, and criminal punishment regarding to \"juvenile delinquency\" is much different than United States, along with the Japanese society's respect on law and authority.  So many of what Takashi and his friends are doing to survive against the zombies may be seen to be unacceptable by many Japanese people.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't really that special or interesting, I could say the it best described to be a struggle between \"gray\" and \"black\" morality.  The \"gray\" morality will be the main characters, Takashi and his friends.  They are willing to steal, use guns, drive underage, and other things as means of surviving.  In addition, they are willing to preform \"mercy kills\" on their fellow classmates and teachers who were bitten so they won't turn into zombies and hurt others (as well as killing those who are already zombified).  The \"black\" morality are probably a bunch of yakuza and thugs who take advantage of the lawlessness for their own enjoyment, and a few survivors and conspiracy theorists who already knew something bad is going on, but choose to deny the full threat as well some who think the zombies aren't really dead but are brainwashed living beings.  But the biggest winner of the \"black\" morality will be Kouchi Shidou, a cruel, egotistical teacher.  The characters' personalities, hobbies, and backstories are important to how they handle the zombie apocalypse.  For example, Shidou's egotistical personality and being a son of a corrupt politician makes him want to establish himself as a new leader in a new society as well as willing to sacrifice his students to the zombies for those who challenge him or those he deem to be \"unworthy.\"  Kohta being a gun otaku makes him a valuable member to the team when it comes to handling firearms, and Rei's relationship with Hisashi made Rei a bit bitter towards her childhood friend Takashi for the first few episodes when Takashi had to kill zombified Hisashi.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the anime does have a few political undertones in it (such as Shidou's father being investigated for political corruption, a group of conspiracy theorists who think the zombie apocalypse is the work of the Japanese and U.S. government, world leaders starting a nuclear war instead of trying to solve the zombie apocalypse, and far-right ultranationalist groups like the uyoku dantai).  It's probably really surprising that someone is willing to show uyoku dantai in anime, considering that the uyoku dantai are very controversial in Japan.  Regardless, the uyoku dantai have some neutral depiction in Highschool of the Dead to avoid too much controversy.  The politics in Highschool of the Dead didn't really hurt my enjoyment a lot, as many of zombie apocalypse films in the past (particularly the ones during the Cold War) are meant to give out a political message.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a small unique twist of the zombie apocalypse into an anime, I wouldn't rate this any higher than 4 out of 5 stars in terms to enjoyability.  This is mainly because Highschool of the Dead is largely filled with fanservice and moe which makes the show less scary as a zombie apocalypse is meant to be.  In fact, fanservice and moe actually makes the zombie apocalypse a bit funnier and less serious.  I personally don't mind a few fanservice and moe, but I think these two common anime tropes and zombie apocalypse theme should be separate from each other, as the purpose of zombie apocalypse films are meant to scare the crap out of you.  On the other hand, the show is enjoyable due to the incredibly cool zombie killing scenes (and probably the ONLY enjoyable part of the show).  But then again, the Japanese have their unusual styles of taste here.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does not have an English dub...yet.  In a very surprising move, not only the Anime Network announced they were simulcasting the show, but Section23/Sentai Filmworks also announce a DVD license AND plans to have an English dub for the series right out of the bat.  So dub fans, this is something of a good news for you guys, but don't expect Crispin Freeman to be in it, though.  In regards to the voice acting, Highschool of the Dead does use a few veteran seiyuus like Junichi Suwabe, Marina Inoue, and Eri Kitamura as well as a few younger, newer, and recent ones like Ayana Taketatsu.  The show also have it's own original soundtrack along with songs from other zombie movies (yes even the infamous \"In The House - In A Heartbeat\" from 28 Days Later is used in there as well).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are an anime and zombie fan looking for a zombie anime series with lots of blood and gore, I would recommend this show.  Other than that, you probably may not a single bit of Highschool of the Dead to be scary due to fanservice and moe, but the zombie killing scenes are crazy awesome.",

No, I take that back because I know the answer, 3words.                                                                                                                   \\n\\n\r\n                                                    Tits & Ass.                       \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fan service here is extremely excessive and unnecessary. It distracts and takes you out of the show. Clearly the creators of this anime are strong believers in the whole \"sex sells\" mentality. In all seriousness though, the ecchi genre and fan service in general needs to die because it embodies everything that\u2019s wrong with anime. Crap like this continues to enforce negative stereotypes about anime and it's fans. Like how anime fans are all nerds, losers and have no lives. Fan service and ecchi\u2019s are also the reason why anime isn't taken seriously as a true art form and is mocked at and looked down upon. When non-anime fans think of anime, do they think of tragedies like Berserk, Rurouni Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal or Grave of the Fireflies? How about thought provoking philosophical anime like Ghost in the Shell and Serial Experiments Lain, maybe the multi-layered complex plotting of  Monster or 20th Century Boys. No, none of them do, because they think it\u2019s either stuff like pokemon or trash like ikkitousen and this god awful thing that I\u2019m reviewing. It\u2019s such a shame, because anime in my eyes deserves a better reputation then what it has. Sorry that's enough of my ranting.     \\n\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Now wait, let me step back and look at this show from an objective viewpoint.......eh, it\u2019s still horse s**t and here\u2019s why.       \\n\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Excluding all the unnecessary fanservice, from a story telling standpoint, High School of the Dead is nothing new nor innovative. We've seen this s**t before a million times; the story is incredibly formulaic and mundane. It follows this exact formula: a Zombie outbreak happens, a group of survivor\u2019s band together, they fight their way from one safe house to the next and that\u2019s pretty much it. If you\u2019re a fan of George A. Romero\u2019s work like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead, then this anime has nothing new to offer. Don't get it confused, in no way is this piece of sh*t on the same level as those brilliant films. It's just story wise this anime borrows from those movies. To top it off, it doesn't even have a proper conclusion, it just ends. The manga is still ongoing, which is to be expected, but still, they could have given it a standalone ending.       \\n\\n\r\n Ah now the characters, arguably the worst part of the show. Now yes, I know that this is meant to be a mindless popcorn action show, so I shouldn't expect the characters to be incredibly complex and have massive amounts of depth. But that\u2019s not my problem; it\u2019s the fact that none of them were the least bit likable, entertaining, memorable, funny or interesting. They can all be described as being annoying, disposable and were nothing more then caricatures. I should at least have something to latch onto so I can care about them. Take Shizuka Marikawa for example, she perfectly fits the slutty blonde stereotype and is an air headed bimbo who probably has the largest pair of breasts in the group. Then there\u2019s Rei Miyamoto, a moody stuck up whore of a character who deserves a good b**ch slap now and then to keep her in check. Back and forth, back and forth, she goes from being a bitchy heroin to a needy damsel in distress. Saya Takagi is next, she\u2019s also a stuck up shallow b**ch  (yup, women like this don\u2019t deserve to be called women, we call 'em b**ches) who only cares about her looks and nothing else. But hey, thank god the creators gave them big tits to compensate for the lack of depth. - _- In terms of voice acting, you decide between dub vs. sub, both were pretty average, same thing goes for the OST.                                \\n\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    High School of the Dead has got to be one of the worst animes I have ever had the displeasure of watching; it\u2019s bland, generic, trashy, tasteless, clich\u00e9d and is devoid of any redeeming qualities (excluding the animation and visuals which were probably the best part about the show). I recommend it to fans of low budget grind house exploitation flicks and chronic masturbators.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead was an anime that I honestly wanted to like more than I did. It follows a group of high schoolers who have found themselves in a zombie apocalypes. I was interested from the get-go, as while the zombie apocalypse trope is overused in western media, I haven't really seen any zombie apocalypses other than this one in the anime world. Probably the greatest drawback to this anime is the fanservice, and it's not something that can easily be ignored, but it can be ignored. The characters also just feel bland and lifeless, like cardboard cutouts of various popular tropes. The artand sound, however, are top notch. The style of the anime is very much suited to the art style, and what I mean by that is that the over-the-top gravity-defying way-to-satisfying action. There's not a track on the OST that I don't like, though my favorite has to be Cold Bullet Blues. Highschool of the Dead is an anime that could benefit from more developed characters and a more fleshed-out story, but honestly, it's a zombie apocalypse. What do you expect?",

First off, do not watch this anime if you're looking for compelling story and characters. Sure, you might be like, \"I hope her boobs don't get cut off!\" a few times, but you're not really going to \"care\" for the characters that often. The characters are straight up zombie flick cliches. The modest main character, his hot girlfriend, this other hot chick, guns guy, bitchy girl, little girl. Oh, did I forget to mention the one that's only there for fanservice? Oh wait, that's every singleone of them. But, The art and soundtrack is absolutely fantastic! You can almost feel the gigantic breasts touch your face as they jiggle. It really makes up for the stain in the story and character portion. Also, the animation is very slick, which is unexpected for an anime of this low demand. The fight scenes are exciting with smooth movements and interesting battles. This is definitely a good watch.",

It actually gives you the horror feel, despite being an Anime, similar to Elfen Lied.

            "content": "Tits, Guns, and Zombies... what could go wrong? \r\nAbsolutely nothing. Are you tired of boring and pathetic ecchi/harem animes whose plots make little difference in the end? Highschool of the Dead is the anime for you! In all seriousness, it takes your typical ecchi/harem elements and throws all the boring shit out. Now you have zombies instead of slice of life, guns of instead of homework... and really big tits ... well they are always there regardless.\r\nOur protagonist, Komuro is no longer a totally oblivious guy to romance nor is he an apologetic wimp. He has courage when needed, just a lil' humility to takeit to the bank, and enough badass-ness to pull it out in the end. And there's always his sidekick of course, Hirano whom I nominate for best sidekick. Usually we have sidekicks that just pull off the comedic stunts required for the series to progress forward. Hirano on the other hand is pathetic until you hand him a gun, then he becomes a psycho maniac that enjoys mowing down zombies.\\n\\n\r\nGirls... well I feel the female cast for the most part are just used as tits props with the exception of Busujima. She's a bloodthirsty cold hard bitch who enjoys asserting her power. She's nice enough to call a friend but once that blade gets going, nothing is in her way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is absolutely gorgeous. You can't have cheap effects when clombering zombies, no no, you have to see the splatter of their brains. Each action scene for the most part is individually animated rather than using fractal backgrounds (not sure what everyone else calls them). Choreography is great, tits movement is great, and there are enough panty shots to satisfy your average ecchi. Camera scenes are especially well implemented, bullet time, bullet moving between tits, shaky camera scenes, zoom ins, it feels like this series has the budget of a movie. Not only that, sound effects is some of the best I've heard. Everything is cohesive and nothing sounds cheap.\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, onto panty shots.. they are the most tasteful panty shots incorporated into an anime that I've seen unlike others (I'm looking at you Rosario Vampire). They aren't exactly in the way of enjoying zombie killing scenes and they are done usually in the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise... no one really cares. If we wanted some complex plot or romance or mystery there are many other animes to satisfy that. It's only once in a while that such a tasteful zombie, guns, and tits anime comes around and this certainly is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nI nominate Highschool of the Dead for having the best first episode. Not many animes can pull off a good first episode, and to me, the first episode is incredibly important in getting my attention. Along with that, the opening is total awesome.  If you don't like the first episode, then you will not like this anime since the first episode sets the pace and mood so well for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward to the OAV and second season... sadly the manga is not keeping up.",

Mediocre story nothing different from how a hentai would treat a story. Ecchi is the foremost selling point of this series way over story, character, coherency od story etc. So obviously art and animation should be top notch. I guess that's the only commendable thing to look out in the series. I wonder what purpose ecchi ever serves, in most series use ecchi in a fashion that just irritate viewers, never understood why in every episode wind blows arbitrarily right under theskirts. So that would make wind the most important character. For any ecchi story the settings and story have to be such that ecchi fits right in, and HOTD ecchi could sit right in because the whole point of this series is to show how ecchi can it get with zombies taking over the world. So if you have that kinda fetish or are just curious about it i'd say this series is just for you.",

            "content": "Oh dear god! What the hell are their breasts made of for them to jiggle like that!?!? I\u2019m not kidding, this is my first thoughts. This is one big jiggles and ass horror flick. It\u2019s dark look and feel brings out the really creepy vibe that all dark horror shows should have but then the breasts and almost hentai scenes feel as though its just comical. That added onto the hentai like scenes is the language where everyone is yelling fuck you and shit every other word. \r\nIt surprises me that the students are so good at figuring out how to stay alive with mostof them not really knowing how to survive basic outdoor stuff. Most of the personalities are really odd, rather one sided almost though they do show that they have more in depth personalities but that happens later on in the series sort of. There are times that I just wanted a person to get bitten. For instance, Koichi Shido who is pretty much scum of the earth. I hated him when he first kicked a student back to the zombies after he had sprained his ankle. I really couldn\u2019t stand him at all.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters feel just like they are fan surface, like the little Lolita, nurse, or the nerdy pink haired girl. They don\u2019t really seem to have much of a point though at least the nerdy girl is smarter then the nurse. I\u2019m not sure why but in almost all shows like this, the teachers and adults are the stupidest people in it and it\u2019s the students that are smarter. They know exactly what to do and though it might be because they watch the zombie shows, I don\u2019t think they would really know how to aim a gun and actually fire it without a bit of training. \\n\\n\r\nThis definitely has the feel of a harem in that the main character ends up with each girl in different situations. The girls all fall in love with him but I actually couldn\u2019t blame the girls for this since I feel it\u2019s more of the bad boy love interest. Each girl has their times they brake down during the fight and so each time, they have the main character to lean on. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the story seems to have a rather deep storyline to it even for how crazy and out of control it is. The idea of who the characters were and what they are now comes up a couple times, mostly near the ending of the show. \\n\\n\r\nQuestion, why do we even need a filler episode looking back on only three episodes? We have one happening at episode 4 and it doesn\u2019t explain anything more then what we already know. I\u2019m glad they added more to it, but still, we don\u2019t need all of this after the first 3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork jumps around a lot, showing beautiful fight scenes, rather pretty sexualized ones, and beautiful drama though then we get \u2018jiggle fest\u2019 right after breaking the mood of the show and making it almost comical. I give props that they did the pretty artwork but they lose points for having breasts that look like jell-o. I am a girl with a rather nice rack, and I have shot a gun before (At targets of course) and my breasts have never, and I mean NEVER, jiggled how badly they do for the girls in this show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good in the opening, though it sounds a bit too sweet for the type of stuff that is going on in this anime. It throws me off a little. The chanting music actually sounds perfect during the times that it has a gentle reflective nature to them. The English voices of the characters sound like they are from a really bad horror flick that revolves around bad language. It works though for this show. It has so much gore and fan service that it just feels right for how stupid it looks. Other then the very loaded script, The voices actually fit the mood of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, this doesn\u2019t actually end. The show leaves a open ending to the show that I wish it had a second season. I hate the read the Manga storytelling.",

            "content": "Taking place in a Japanese high school, several school board members are attacked and bitten by a man at the front gates. Immediately, those whom are thought to be dead rise up and begin biting whomever is next to them. A student by the name of Takashi witnesses all of this. He rushes back to his class to spread the news. Eventually, the entire school is thrown into chaos with students being mauled and killed by their own classmates and faculty. Takashi along with two of his friends, Rei and Hisashi, arm themselves with bats and other things in a desperate attempt to survive theseattacks and find out what's going on. -summary\\n\\n\r\nHigh School of the Dead is a prime example of an anime that possessed potential to become something special and memorable for the right reasons; but it was held back by a childish writing team. This series was probably the biggest disappointment for me as a fan of zombie media. My imagination simply goes wild when I think of what this could have been had all the nonsense been left on the cutting room floor.\\n\\n\r\nNow zombie media has been done to death by this point, and outside of the genre's originators with a few small exceptions, you won't see too much in story and plot complexity. Therefore, it can either be a mindless comedic romp or a serious social commentary; but the areas it must succeed in has to be its characters and especially the gore. The kills must be sick and some main characters have to die. High School of the Dead wants to have its cake and eat it too in regards to premise, while at the same time perform poorly in those latter areas.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a group of students just trying to survive the zombie outbreak and make it from point A to B in one piece, hoping to find some type of rescue along the way. The series begins with a good spark by making great use of its horror element, and paints a great picture on the possible end of humanity as we know it. It's rather unclear initially how far the outbreak has spread and even what caused it. This always works when setting up a zombie takeover and I like it here. The very first group of characters are put through a traumatic experience which definitely helps in their development, and I thought this was a great move to set the mood of the series. The viewers get a good idea on what to expect at first with some brutal action scenes that definitely deliver, along with a creative weapon put together by a class geek to add some variety in the kills.\\n\\n\r\nThe motley crew of characters creates a rather interesting team of death dealing destruction. They're made up of a kid whom arms himself with a bat and has unknown leadership potential, a girl whom can use a spear, a female kendo master, and the geek who's a master with any type of firearm. Then you have the brains of the outfit with a serious ego, and the oldest of the group which happens to be the school nurse. These characters are developed enough personality wise and the viewer will get to know them well. I can see plenty of folks falling for this group and they may consider them to be memorable. Personally, I didn't care for all of them, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the horrible demise of several. The so-called genius grated on my nerves quite often, while the \"elder\" of the group came off as nothing more than an infantile dunce.\\n\\n\r\nThe series introduces a very dark and nightmarish setting which carelessly dabbles different genres. The fan service and tonal shifts clashes badly with everything, and I mean everything. It wrecks the action sequences, drama, and romance. It was very annoying for me. There's just something that really bothers me when I'm watching girls in the middle of a fierce battle and there's panty shots in just about every scene. The series comes up with some of the most ridiculous reasons for fan service. I thought Najica Blitz was bad at this, but seriously, the fan service is so distracting and it doesn't stop there either. The annoying school nurse is incredibly big breasted, and to maker matters worse there's this \"boing\" sound almost whenever she moves around, and her breast separate in different directions. The comedy features the same old unfunny jazz, with geeky boys getting nose bleeds whenever he sees boobs or butts, and the main lead who is completely terrified of the female naked body. It really didn't need this.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes a stab at the thought provoking by introducing certain themes such as government conspiracies, and questioning who could possibly be the worst threat; man or monster. There are good moments that stand out such as putting mankind's fear of an unexplainable situation on display. Like one predictable scene of a family killing a man they don't know with intentions on only protecting themselves. Underneath the stupidity there are traces of intelligence. Unfortunately, the stupidity heavily outweighs the brilliance, and it highly damages the quality of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are definitely the selling point but these are average at best. For the most part it's nothing but flashes of hits and quick shots to the head or whatever. There's no real creativity in the kills, and zombie media's bread and butter is the merciless in your face carnage. Had the series' writers put as much effort into flesh devouring as opposed to pleasures of the flesh then this would have been a great title for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nProduction values are solid here and the animation brings out the very best in the fan service. There appears to be a great amount of detail put into the character designs. All the females are very close to busty and engulfed in major sex appeal. I have nothing against this, but it's just handled too much in a childish manner. Outside of the opening J-pop theme I enjoyed the BGM, and most of the ending themes. The soundtrack is something worth listening to, and I enjoyed the English cast which contained quite a bit of profanity here and there; and the only moments I found funny took place in some of the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of things dragging it down. There are even moments of clumsy writing along with plot holes. I will admit that it does have a decent ending and somewhat decent second half, but the nonsense is through the roof to the point where it's impossible for me to enjoy this. If you enjoy heavy fan service in your anime or if you seen Najica Blitz and liked it, then this is for you. If you need plenty of action and don't care how it's delivered then again, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nHighs: Visuals and soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nLows: Careless meshing of genres and heavily distracting fan service",

            "content": "In my opinion - Highschool of the Dead is great when you want to watch something ecchi but still get some good action. It gives you about 50/50 of both and delivers it in pure entertainment.\r\nAt first I have to say I watched Highschool of the Dead/HotD because I was looking for some action/ecchi, something which isn't that difficult to follow, an anime where you don't have to pay attention for whole 24 minutes - just typical ecchi. So I brought myself to give HotD a try and I ended up -surprisingly enjoying it a lot + giving it more attention that I actually hadplanned. \\n\\n\r\nHotD is known for having a shitload of fan service so I kinda got worried at first that it will be just another boobspam anime like all the other I have watched so far of this genre but it turned out that the story was kind of decent and specially the characters grew on me. The fact about the fan service kinda confirmed itself through the series but HotD managed to hold the balance between boobies/panties flashing and action pretty well. I have to be honest that I skipped some of the hardcore fan service parts (like the bath scene) but hey I didn't start watching it for the titties. \\n\r\nThe action scenes were pretty well made and had some nice eye catcher and thrilling enough to concentrate on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story surprised me the most - I was expecting a simple anime which actually focus on the fan service to cover up the bad story (you find a lot of those animes inside the ecchi genre - a lot) but nope, HotD isn't like a normal ecchi. Ok, the plot is not something new, we have seen a lot of zombie-themed series being released in the past few years so it might appear at first as a tryhard in this genre by making it extra fan service-heavy. Or on the other hand - being a tryhard ecchi with some super cool zombies... When you give this anime a try you will find out really fast that all the half-naked-school-girls thing is just a part of this anime and only here to attract certain people to get interested. The story isn't that deep to get you emotional involved into it but keeps you interested enough to continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite thing about this anime is the well-made character development. Each character has its own personality to pay attention to and special skills (even though Takashi seemed a way too overpowered to me like why does he suddenly was able to ride a motorbike like a fucking pro, how old was this dude again? oh wait.. almost everyone of them were overpowered since none of them seemed to have the past of a normal student). You still get to know about the characters without having annoying fillers or longass flashbacks - it was enough for them to tell a bit about their past/family. Ok, I have to admit you find the typical anime character cliche in this anime like a Tsundere or the useless big-chested clumsy woman but it's tolerable since the interesting characters get enough screen appearance to cover up the weak characters. For me personally stood Hirano out the most. At first I thought he might be end up as your stereotype fat pervert but I was wrong - really wrong (Marginal note: He became almost the main reason why I was enjoying this anime so much). It was also the first time that a cast of an anime didn't annoy me for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSome parts annoyed me though and made me facepalm a lot: the reaction of the population during the zombie invasion - seriously? How is a high school student able to analyse the enemy so far and fight against them but some trained police man isn't? It's like that suddenly all the people with an IQ above 100 disappeared. Everyone else just broke out in panic and acted useless. That made it seem like only our group of zombie-fighting-teenagers are mental developed enough to fight.. like they are some kind of overlords or something - what I didn't like at all. The contrast between the main characters and the normal population was just too high. Sometimes I even found myself yelling at my screen due the retarded behavior of some civilians there.. The whole situation was a mixture of trying to be realistic with an huge amount of exaggeration on a high level. \\n\\n\r\nExaggerated were also the physics of some boobs that bounced within this anime. It's like the boobs got their own physics that even bullets can fly through them at the right timing. However, since when do animes with such an amount of fan service care about realism?!\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say much about the fan service except the \"exaggerated part\". As long the females in HotD wore decent clothes it was far more enjoyable for me to continue watching instead seeing them fighting in bras and shorts. But it has to be said that I am not really a part of the original target audience - which is male.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't commented a lot of the art so far - maybe because of the fact that it's so unexpectedly well made that it even shocked me on a positive way while watching the series. The animations and the backgrounds were outstanding and nice to see. Also, the character design works perfectly with the certain personalities. Although the body proportions of some girls made you questioning about the human body and its limits (I literally got mental back pain after seeing the nurse and her meat watermelons). I don't want to focus only on the \"living\" cast of HotD at this point here - the zombies look like zombies should look.\\n\\n\r\nLike the art, my opinion is the same on the sound. The voice acting fits pretty well, same with the background sounds during specific scenes. I cannot say anything about the OP/ED though since I usually skip them. But importantly: I cannot remember any ear-cancer-causing voice in HotD, which is a very very good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, \"Highschool of the Dead\" didn't feel like watching a typical harem/fan service/boobplot anime to me. It felt more like watching something with the right balance of everything. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I am still having the feeling that HotD could have done a lot better without being put into the ecchi genre and focused more on the story instead of the pink panties of high school girls. The plot and the production had enough potential to create a successful anime without being based on giving boners. You know, less is more. But that's a thing that I should rather criticize the manga about.",

            "content": "If you like Zombies, head-smashing, and half-naked chicks, Highschool of the Dead is the anime for you. However, if you're an innocent, shoujo-loving fangirl, I'd suggest you stay away from HOTD, because this anime is certainly not for the weak of heart. \r\nHighschool of the Dead starts out in a normal private school somewhere in Japan. But things don't stay \"normal\" for long. Soon enough, someone gets bitten by a man standing outside the school gates, and all hell is let loose. The man apparently has some sort of epidemic (at least that's what they think at first) which literally causes the host to dieand come back to life as a mindless zombie who's only goal is to spread the epidemic they have across the entire earth. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the school goes into a mass panic, chaos ensues, best friends use eachother as human shields for the zombies, blah, blah, blah. Most of the school is bitten and infected, but a small group of two boys and four girls (including the school nurse) manage to escape, and somehow acquire mad zombie-pwning skills and insane weapons in the process. Now, it's up to these six people to fight their way through the city, busting heads, exhibiting LOTS of fanservice, and jacking a heap of cool stuff in the process. \\n\\n\r\n--Animation--\\n\r\nI was quite satisfied with the animation quality of Highschool of the Dead. Being a small series, the artists probably had more time to put effort into the animation, because it is rarely ever subpar. The character designs are unique, and it's easy to tell the characters apart. Fight scenes, as often as they occur, are done quite spectacularly. Backgrounds are given the attention they deserve, and turn out nicely. The blood does seem a bit too dark, but that's hardly something to complain about. However, several characters ARE drawn quite disproportionally. Well, their boobs are, at least. But hey, during the Zombie Apocalypse, I guess everyone needs some ginormous boobs to brighten things up. \\n\\n\r\n--Character Cast--\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead includes your stereotypical group of Zombie Apocalypse survivors: Komuro Takashi, your average highschool punk and hero of the story; Rei Miyamoto, Takashi's childhood friend, crush, and HOTD's main heroine; Saeko Busujima, the hot, badass, zombie-pwning chick; Saya Takagi--rich, smart, and snobby; Kouta Hirano, the Military Otaku; Arisu Marisato, a seven year old that the group rescues; and Shizuka Marikawa, the ditsy, big-boobed nurse. Occasionally, Rei can get a little annoying, but other than that, I wasn't strongly opposed to any characters. \\n\\n\r\n--Voice Cast--\\n\r\nHOTD has in fact been dubbed in english quite recently, so I was one of the first to hear the dub. I'm impressed, I must admit, and that's quite something coming from a Sub-preferring otaku. This is an anime that is very dramatic and action-packed, and the VA's do a good job keeping up with the pace of the story (meaning they don't sound like they're trying not to fall asleep in a Sunday sermon while their character is killing zombies) unlike SOME animes *cough*BLEACH*coughcough*. Would I recommend watching the dub? Yes, yes I would. \\n\\n\r\n--Soundtrack--\\n\r\nBeing only twelve episodes, Highschool of the Dead has the same opening all the way through. I never found the introduction boring, however, or got tired of seeing it at the beginning of each episode. The rest of the soundtrack was not notably good, nor was it notably bad. \\n\\n\r\n--Rating--\\n\r\nI'll go along with videogame ratings and give this one an 'M' for Mature. HOTD displays some suggestive content, lots of violence, some blood but not too much gore, one scene of nudity (apparently not in the sub, though), a lot of cussing (particularly in the dub), and the fanservice--oh, the fanservice!--let's just say that a certain, er, physical attribute of the female anatomy is put into the spotlight quite often. Kids 12 and under, stay away from HOTD in order to preserve your innocence. \\n\\n\r\n--Final Review--\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead was a pretty good anime. It was fast paced and action packed; something that keeps you awake, and is rarely ever boring. The characters were easy to get used to and altogether likable. The plot was understandable and you could easily keep up with it. One of the only problems with the anime is the lack of questions left unanswered; How did this disease start? How can it be stopped? AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, WILL THERE BE A SECOND SEASON SO WE CAN SEE IF SHIZUKA AND HER GIANT BOOBS MADE IT OUT ALIVE?!? Another common problem (which I didn't really mind) is the overused amount of fanservice. If you're not big into fanservice, you'll hate HOTD. Nonetheless, I'd say it's made it into my Top 20 list, if not Top 15 or even Top 10.",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first review so please go easy on me. I've seen how bad ecchi animes can get when the only thing the anime is about is seeing up the girl's skirts and this isn't exactly an exception... sort of. But let's start off with the basics.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is a whole lot like many apocalyptic animes and games when there is a band of people trying to survive a massive hoard of zombies while the entire world is going to hell, simple been-there-done-that. The twist is that there's a whole lot of bouncing breasts and nice little shots of their behinds and panties.Nothing much else is very original but the story itself still works. Usually the anime moves between scenes of gore and blood-fest to the fan service which can easily cut off the mood of horror that you're supposed to be feeling. This can either be a saving grace for people who want to take a break from the bloodbath or a real killer for those that want to keep it.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt was definitely this series' high points with nicely drawn out characters but you better be very good at taking fan service or the female characters are going to give you headaches with their breasts the size of mountains. Other than that the CG is fine and the background works well.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are just general J-Pop songs and most of them aren't really memorable but they aren't really that bad either. Background music I don't really pay attention to very much but the sound effects fit well with the actions. The voice actors are the main reason why this category is above a 5. With voice actors Junichi Sawabe, Marina Inoue, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Nobuyuki Hiyama, the characters become far more enjoyable and believable when expressing their emotions. None of the other characters have bad voices in general.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters are rather generic and as far as I've watched, none have grown in personality or matured in anyway. For the character types, it's a lot like a video game. The hero, the sword user, the ranged man, the spearman, the tactician, and the medic. In terms of personality though, you have a generic main character, the only woman that actually fights well, the love interest of said hero, the otaku, the useless bratty girl, and the useless ditsy woman whose only there to service our needs of huge breasted fan service. There are two saving graces. One is that when you feel pissed off that the character is being too slow or too stupid, you really want to slap them or just leave their whining ass to be eaten by zombies. Luckily, the anime hears your cries and the characters actually slap or leave the annoying one which leaves you in a nice state of satisfaction. The second grace is the otaku which I found to be a rather lovable character and providing most of the comical relief that's actually funny. From the nosebleeds to his sudden mood-swings when seeing guns, he is by far the most fun character in this anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said, I'm used to fan service and after Rosario Vampire, Queen's Blade, and Ikkitousen, all in which I'm not very proud of watching, this fan service which actually succeeds in looking good, comes as a relief. The action scenes with the gore and death was able to raise my pulse a bit and the switches between the ecchi and the action didn't really phase me. The otaku is a nice addition and the art for the girls is very well done.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDon't expect any real emotion or something your going to cry to; go for Samurai X Trust and Betrayal. Don't expect something that you feel will change your life; go for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. This is for some mindless entertainment with zombies, hot chicks, cool fights, and nothing too deep for one to grasp. If that's not your cup of tea, consider the anime that I just listed. But for me, I have finally found an ecchi anime that doesn't suck.",

            "content": "Well, there's really not much I can say in this review, seeing as how I've covered almost everything from the show in my review of the manga on youtube.\r\nThe anime adaption of the manga, \"High School of the Dead\", follows the manga almost to a \"T\", but there are a few differences. One key example is the fact that Busujima no longer has her katana at the beginning. Instead she starts off with a bokken, and while at first this annoyed me, I grew used to it pretty quickly. After all, who takes an actuall katana with them whenever they go to school?\r\nNow when itcomes to changes in the series, that's pretty much all there is to it so far. However there are only 4 episodes out at this current moment in time, so that may be subject to change.\\n\\n\r\nOk, now to get to the more technical aspects of the show. First and foremost, I feel that anyone watching this review will prefer to wait for the uncensored DVDs. This is mainly because the extremely gory scenes have had a slight shade added to them, making it to where, while you know what's going on, you don't see all of the violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe producing stations for this series are Madhouse Studios, which has also produced such series' as, \"Death Note\", and, \"Chobits\". And Sentai Filmworks, which has also produced the series, \"Mahoromatic\". Both of these stations have been working extremely well together on this series, and have made the animation feel both dramatic yet simple at the same time. Which allows it to keep this horror film and comic book feel.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the voice actors and their previous works:\\n\\n\r\nKomuro, Takashi is voiced by Suwabe, Junichi. Who has also voiced many well known characters from other series'. Key examples of his other works are: Grimmjow from Bleach; Greed from Full Metal Alchemist; Archer from Fate Stay Night; And Fuuma from the Series, \"X\".\\n\\n\r\nMiyamoto, Rei is voiced by Inoue, Marina. This voice actress is known for quite a few roles, but us americans will more than likely have only seen one of her roles. Her key works are: Yoko from Gurren Laggan; Ushiromiya, Jessica from Umineko no Naku Koro ni; And Tachibana, Wataru from Hayate no Gotoku (AKA Hayate the Combate Butler)\\n\\n\r\nHirano, Kouta is voiced by Hiyama, Nobuyuki. This has got to be my favorite voice actor for this series because he has voiced most of my favorite characters in other series'. His key works are: Balmung from .hack//; Black WarGreymon from Digimon; Shiro Amada from Mobile Suit Gundam the 08th MS Team; Hayato from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam; Orson from Record of Lodoss War Chronicles of the Heroic Knight; And Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho.\\n\\n\r\nBusujima, Saeko is voiced by Sawashiro, Miyuki. This voice actress has a great talent for getting a characters emotions across while making them seem cool, calm, and collected. Her key works are: Xia, Yu Lan from Full Metal Panic the Second Raid; Mint from Galaxy Angel; Springfield, Nagi from Negima; And Cammy from Street Fighter.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi, Saya is voiced by Kitamura, Eri. This voice actress definitely has a talent for playing the smart, angry, or insane characters. Her key works are: Saya from Blood+; Myousai, Kakouen from Ikki Tousen; Juri from Street Fighter; Siesta 410 from Umineko no Naku Koro ni; And Rima from Vampire Knight.\\n\\n\r\nMarikawa, Shizuka is voiced by Fukui, Yukari. This voice actress has the least amount of roles out of all the main voice actors, but don't let that fool you, she's bloody good at what she does...Pardon the pun. Her key works are: Nono from Gunbuster vs Diebuster; Kuribayashi, Yayoi from Mouse; Sara from School Rumble; And Nia Teppelin from Gurren Laggan.\\n\\n\r\nWell folks, that's all there is left to tell you about the anime adaption of this series. All in all, I think it would be best for people to wait for the uncensored DVDs, but all in all I give this series, yet again, 4.5 stars out of 5. This is Alberio signing out, and reminding you to keep that trigger finger itchy.",

            "content": "First of all, this is my first ever review in MyAnimeList. I'm very enticed to write a review on this particular anime because even though cliche as it may seem, it actually has a feel to it. Highschool of the Dead or H.O.T.D. is your typical zombie-killing, gore series, but because of the changes in major elements such as characters, art, sounds, and execution, I give it a perfect 10. The plot is, of course, cliche (yes, we understand that--all of us understands that), but what really invites the audience to the movie is not the content of the movie itself, but the execution, theart, the sounds, and the characters themselves. Even if you have an overused plot, as long as you change the major elements and make it presentable, it should have a good effect on the audience especially with the upcoming generations.\\n\\n\r\nI would give the story 8 because of its cliche. The art would be 10 because it seems that it was taken off from Katekyo Hitman Reborn (and I like that anime as well). The sound suits the anime itself--zombie-bashing, blood-spilling, and ecchi. The characters is of course 10 because of Hirano Kouta. You mostly see only fit guys roaming around, killing zombies, but now you get to see a chubby, nerd guy killing zombies as well. Apparently, enjoyment depends on those factors, thus I'd have to give it a 10. Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nLet's just hope that this series won't go like Kampfer (it got destroyed in the end).",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is an anime that should be taken with a grain of salt if you want to enjoy it at all. This show is quite a hard one to review because of all the aspects that make it what it is. It's atmosphere is good at points but gets ruined by obnoxious fanservice and dumb characters. If not for good animation and the atmosphere when it isn't being violated by bouncing boobs across the screen, this show would not be worth watching at all. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story in Highschool of the Dead is quite the standard zombie outbreak scenario, although throughout theanime they refer to the zombies as \"them\" for reasons unknown to me. The story gets a 6 because of the atmosphere it creates. The characters never have a clear goal at any given point, their goal is to survive. The kind of tension this creates is great for the show as it gives the viewer a reason to keep on watching to see what happens to the group of characters in the next episode. It also suits the show well because their objectives are in line with what kind of people they are, they're regular civillians, they're not trying to stop the outbreak or find a cure, they're trying to SURVIVE. The comedy is decent, at one point a character breaks the fourth wall, probably one of the only funny jokes in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is very crisp and fluid. The characters all look different and have distiguishing characteristics (if not for that to be ruined by the fact that all the females have large breasts). The CG sequences are well done and have a nice look to them. Nothing much to comment on as other then the female character designs, the series looks great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing terribly good or bad. I didn't really like the OPs or EDs but they were not really my favorite kind of music. I don't really remember hearing any backround music, if there was then it must not have been that memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf not for one character this probably would have been lower. The characters in this show are absolutely one sided and and any attempts at romance or otherwise fail because of this. The only memorable character is Saeko seeing as she is probably the only non dumbass character in the whole anime; And the only one to show remorse for what she is doing in both the past and present. One character in particular is pretty much there only for fan service and to drive the cast around whenever they are in a vehicle, not a very good character and does nothing to drive the non existen plot forward. All the other characters are forgetable as they have no other use then to kill the millions of zombies waiting to eat them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the actual lack of a plot, and the dumb and useless characters, this show is actually kind of good. The action is well done and the tension the setting provides really gives them the sense that they will die one way or another in this zombie apocalypse. Even then, you will have to wade through the absurd amounts of bouncing tits and upskirt shots to enjoy the show. Do not let this bi-polar review keep you from watching it though, it is a decent show even with its flaws. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had heard about H.O.T.D. from my friend who had watched it already, and he pretty much got me hyped about it. With all the zombie video games and films coming out, an anime is to be expected I suppose. And why not? Zombies are interesting and can easily be used in something very good. All I knew about HOTD was that it was about zombies. Meh, good enough reason to watch, can't be that bad, right?\r\nThis anime, like all new anime, are gorgeous. They look spectacular. Everything is great to look at, with the intimidating zombies to the attractive girls. The sound effects, voiceacting, and bgm are all high quality as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, sadly, isn't really worthy of the great animation and sound. For a twelve episode anime, I can't really say very many things happened. A lot happened in episode one, a little too much actually, and then later episodes had little to no action or plot development. The zombies come, the characters fight them, some people get eaten, the characters escape. Rinse repeat ~twelve times. \\n\r\nIt begins to feel forced after a while, specifically one time point. The characters arrive at an apartment loaded with weapons, food, and water, and they spend whatever amount of time there, and then leave. I'm still not sure why they leave, but I have a hunch they were just getting bored and wanted to be around more zombies.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this anime is its focus. Its supposedly about zombies, but by the finish of the twelve episodes, I knew no more about the zombies then I did after episode one (except that these zombies have no senses except for hearing, which makes no sense. How do they know they're eating people?!). Instead of the zombies, the anime decides to focus on the many girls in the anime. The anime decided that all viewers watching zombie flicks must all be extremely horny and all want lots of fan service, fan service, fan service. As a guy, I can wholeheartedly say that I greatly dislike fan service in anime. If I wanted to jack off, then I would just go look at some real stuff. There really is no need for it in the anime itself. However, I don't mind the occasional panty shot or breast bounce, as long as its minimal. This anime, however, went waaaaay overboard. In episode one alone, there was a whopping seventeen panty shots! thats almost one every minute. Like seriously, how can I take the zombies seriously if the anime is too busy approaching porno?\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the anime is its pace, as it seems to speed up at times where it shouldn't, and slow down at spots which I wouldn't mind skipping. For example, the very first episode has a lot of events packed into one episode and an insane pace. As soon as a seemingly important character is introduced, he is then bitten and then zombified and killed. All within ten or so minutes. In comparison, another episode has the many characters in an apartment taking showers and whatnot, wasting time. The anime's pace starts off too fast, and then the last half of the anime has a pace that's far too slow. There's an easy explanation for this, however. There simply wasn't any more plot left by episode six or so. They had to spread a single square off butter unto six loafs of bread.\\n\\n\r\nThe final problem with the anime is its characters. There is simply just too many of them. For a twelve episode anime, seven main characters is far too many. It just spells disaster. All the characters end up having very little character development, and they all just feel one dimensional by the finish. Take a great anime for example, Toradora. It has 25 episodes, and has only five main characters. By the finish of the anime, all five characters have been very well developed, and I can wholeheartedly say they all feel very real and complex. This anime doesn't accomplish that, and its simply because there's too many characters to cover.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime could have easily been really good if it actually focused more on the zombies. Instead, it feels like another  harem anime with shallow characters and an extra zombie gimmick.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is an anime that caters to it's audience perfectly and if you're interested in violence, zombies, and ecchi then you'll find this will fill your time brilliantly. If you're after some complex and in depth analysis of the human psyche and complain because you can't find it, then go watch something else.\r\n(6) Story:\r\nThe story is simple enough to make sense while not too stupid. Essentially it follows the first few days of a zombie apocalypse as seen by a young Japanese teenager and his friends. It's not exactly throwing out plot twists so you'll know what'll happen, but it's not likeit tries to overcomplicate itself so I suppose it could be worse. Though at the time of writing there is no real ending so yeah, be wary of that.\\n\\n\r\n(8) Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe art works brilliantly and the animation is mostly flawless, at least for what it's aiming for. Again I've mentioned that HOTD is a very simple anime that just fits itself in where it needs to. It's not got anything AMAZING that you can point to and call a defining moment, but it's not got anything that makes you laugh because it's so horribly bad. Again, could be worse but I find it functional.\\n\\n\r\n(8) Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe dubs for both English and Japanese are fantastic and easily watchable regardless of your preference. The actual sounds other than that are fitting and you never find yourself going, 'Uh wait that's not a gun sound' like I could mention in other anime...\\n\\n\r\n(6) Character:\\n\\n\r\nThis is ecchi, so they're pretty cookie stereotypical. But just as a hint, the two main leads are going to remind you of Kirito and Asuna, apart from them being just older versions of their characters. (They actually aren't though so yeah)\\n\\n\r\n(9) Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhat? I liked the show. The characters were somewhat relatable and I liked the comedy. And also I'm a guy so episodes 6 and 7 (which contain most of the ecchi parts) were pretty hilarious to me. Though I tend to skip them when I re-watch it every so often. I also like the characters themselves and I like how the show doesn't try and take itself too seriously. It's light hearted at times, and sure it has serious moments but overall it's an upbeat show. You finish it in a good mood.\\n\\n\r\n(9) Overall: Honestly this show is great if you just want what it is, and what it is, is a short, funny, ecchi/comedy/action series with some likeable characters and some zombies.",

            "content": "7.7/10\r\nThe story was excellent. The main characters were quickly introduced, and the action, a.k.a the problem, was shown very early in the anime. The plot was very gripping, with lots of fan service. But I personally think it was too much because they tried to add it in any way possible, especially during the action sequences. The horror part of the anime might be quite scary to a young viewer, but it adds in to the story. You see some characters die off quickly (FYI not a spoiler because I don't say who, and it happens right in the beginning) and it was very goodto watch as the group of high school kids had to fight right at the beginning. It was a very action oriented anime, so there was rarely a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. I really liked how they drew each individual character, as well as the zombies. Each character had their art style, making it more easy to remember their faces, as well as their own \"trademark\" such as a sword, a gun, a spear, glasses, and so on. The artists also drew guns very well. The guns were drawn well in SAO, but HOTD drew them more realistically and it felt more real because there was a huge recoil when the characters shot them, unlike when guns were shot in GGO. Anything found in real life was drawn exceptionally well, such as helicopters, motorcycles, and bridges. In the action scenes, the artwork was clear and sharp. It is high quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is quite good, and they change the ending song very often. The opening is filled with vivid colors and the synchronization of the pictures/frames were timed really well. It starts off slow, but then increases its speed, while giving plenty of fan service. For the ending, it was just a bulletin board filled with pictures of the characters enjoying themselves. It was a good moment to unwind with because the songs were usually more mellow. It can be a bad thing, though, because after an action filled episode, when it suddenly goes to a mellow song, it can kind of ruin the mood. However, the graphics were great, with the creators changing the first photo depending on where the characters were, or where the story has ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development starts immediately, with them changing from average high school kids to zombie killers in a matter of episodes. They also reveal parts of their past as well as their parents' occupations and in Hirano's case, his grandparents as well (which incorporated some good comedy). I enjoyed watching the characters split up every once in a while, as well, because it reveals more and more about them. My only complaint about them was that 4 out of the 6 were really annoying. Hirano and Saeko were really good characters, but Takashi was, in my opinion, useless and was just there to give a decent pep talk. The nurse, just, *sighs and face palms* she doesn't heal anyone from what I've seen, so she's pretty damn useless. There's Takagi, who has such a bad personality that I want her to be eaten by \"them\" And Rei...she just needs a man but she's really needy. I'm not a fan of those.\\n\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed it. I was reluctant at first because I'm not a big fan of female fan service (I'm a girl) but I really enjoyed watching it. The action scenes were fast paced, some lives were lost, noble moments, and vulgar moments, it all came together into a great action and horror anime.",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead can be easily summarized in two words; fan service. The show had the potential to do great things, but then the writers decided that they should take the typical zombie script and throw breasts all over it, and they do it an incredibly large amount of times. But did I enjoy the show? I would be a liar if I said I didn't, so let's break down what is H.O.T.D. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nInitially, the show follows the typical zombie apocalypse genre with your ragtag group of characters thrusted together in order to survive. While the main premise of the show is survivalagainst a man-eating horde, much of this is overshadowed by all of the gravity defying jiggling, awkward low angled shots, and blatant borderline hentai. It's obvious that this show was designed with fan service in mind because both the plot, especially near the end, and the dialogue suffered greatly. Granted, people didn't flock to this show in hopes of a catching story, but simply breasts and zombies.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where HOTD really shined. The animation was clean and the action sequences made me want to continue watching in hopes of more of the gore and brutality that the previous episode left me. Really, the only thing that is keeping me from giving it a 10/10 is the awkward camera angles. At times, it really took away from what was happening just because they wanted to fit one more shot in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI didn't really notice much of the soundtrack, not because I was so engrossed in what was going on around the protagonists, but because it wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't bad and what was noticed helped with the drama and made the action a bit more intense, but there were times where I just didn't realize music was playing. HOTD did have a killer opening theme, as well as, some good ending songs, which were different for each ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis was probably my least favorite part about the show. While the story was underwhelming, I didn't watch for the story. They took the idea of a ragtag group with varying personalities and decided...well, let me just tell about them. The end of the world brings out someone's true nature, but I think they might have taken a bit too much creative liberty. You have Takashi Kumuro, our main protagonist, who is the leader of the group who finds that the best way to silence someone is to smack them, grab them by the collar, or casually make out with them. Rei Miyamoto is one of Takashi's best friends, but she is essentially Navi from the Legend of Zelda: OoT. Saeko Busujima is a kendo master who essentially believes that the best battle armor is the most seductive battle armor, keeping the female MMORPG armor alive. Saya Takagi, the whiny know-it-all who doesn't do much except boast about how smart she is. Kohta Hirano is a picked on school nerd who happens to turn into a trigger happy psychopath whenever you put a firearm in his hands. And finally, Shizuka Marikawa, who is simply there for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs the saying goes, \"sex sells.\" I sat down and was brought to the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Was such and such going to die? How are they going to get out of this mess? The action was great, what more do I need to say?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show does what it was intended to do. It mixed zombies and fan service and created a decently entertaining show. If you are looking for a serious zombie show with a chilling plot and a stellar cast, turn back now. This is not the show for you. But if you are looking for an action packed show full of jiggles and giggles, well step right up.",

            "content": "When I started to watch this anime I expected from its title a typical zombie story. A zombievirus gets spread, some people manage to survive it and fight together for their lives.\r\nI got exactly what I expected.\r\nThe Story - begins quite interesting somehow because it starts out in the action and afterwards shows kinda how the virus actually started to spread out and then it continues in the normal zombiestory manner.\r\nMindless gore, people try not to get bitten and stuff. It's nothing special but if you are a fan of zombies then I'm sure the story won't disappoint.\r\nThe Characters  - are the biggest critiquepoint and the worst part of the whole Anime. You have this typical school theme which just won't allow anything non-stereotypical and cliche character-wise. The main characters only purpose seems to look badass while giving fan-service and bathing in blood. None of the characters develop in any sort of way throughout the story, nor do they give you surprises. All of their actions seem predictable and dull, yet something a very young audiance might enjoy if they like these \"don't think, just shoot\"-kind of cool people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound  - is one of the best things about the whole anime, it's representing the mood of the current situations overall mostly well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art - never is to everyones taste, but it sure looks well drawn, detailed as much as smoothly moving. Moving animations and the whole action scenes make the anime look very alive and this is certainly the strength of the anime, because the art gets you in the mood to watch on and makes kinda up for the unbelievably monotone choice of characters and the repetetive scenes of boring fanservice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy watching this anime. I can't say that it's a bad anime however. It does offer the typical things you would expect from a title that has \"school\" in its name and zombies as its theme. But if you are expecting some really good story plot, interesting characters or some sort of deeper philosophical meanings built into the story or even variety, this anime won't give you any of these. So my final result is, I go re-watching Higurashi or Death Note or some other anime that makes sense if I find nothing new and you should do the same. \\n\r\nIf you are a Haruhi fan or just like zombies, then give this anime a try, it will most likely fulfill all of your cliches that you want to see.\\n\\n\r\n~Flevalt",

Most people say that the story is unoriginal to what is seen in everyday american tv.\r\na group of people surviving as a team and trying to escapedeath while certain primal and savage instincts kick in, i.e. people having sex, people killing each other, people having sex while killing each other, ext. \\n\r\nThe originality compared to other anime, however, is as ironic as getting hit by a dodge. ITS TECHNICALLY ORIGINAL IF NOBODY HAS EVER DONE IT.\\n\r\nwith the lack of zombie shows it is arguably an untapped market along with werewolfs, real fucking ones not just chicks with dog ears and a tail. It was very suspenseful at the end of each and every episode leading me to watch the entirety of the show in 1 sitting, all six times i rewatched it.\\n\r\nThe opening just appealed to me in an orgasmic sense, but thats just pure preference.\\n\r\nnow onto the art; even thought i have already said it there are boobs.\\n\r\n................\\n\r\nokay yea thats a bit of an understatement but still unless you are too young for boobs or it just for some reason bothers you like if 2 foods on your plate (anime and porn) were to touch then this is not for you.\\n\r\nThe art is actually not bad at all with very detailed, actually some of the best, backgrounds i have ever seen.\\n\r\nCharacter development within the group is not perfect but its well done for a 12 episode series. The group dynamic consist of: the leader, the bitch girlfriend, the bad-ass chick, the brains, the gun geek, the mascot, and the medic. I will admit that most people will just say: the leader, boobs, boobs, boobs, NUEERDD, loli with her pet, and boobs^2 \\n\r\nIf you have been paying attention then u have realised that this is actually one of my favorite animes and while some might wonder why, ill just tell you, its very fucking enjoyable. enjoy-ability is the whole reason i watch anime so of course something so enjoyable to me that everytime i rewatch the series i have to leave my day clear to finish it in one sitting is one of my favorites.\\n\r\nI honestly think this is an outstanding show and if some would just look past the matrix-like, physics fucking, dividing-by-zero type boobs and fanservice, you might find yourself really enjoying yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend",

That being said, the best way to describe this anime is fun, and isworth watching.",

Basically, if you ignore the zombies, it's just a harem anime with unusually shallow characters and an extraordinarily stupid script.\r\nIf you want gore, check out Elfen Lied or Gantz, and if you want fanservice, I'm sure you'll know where to look.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nThis is one of the best looking anime I have ever seen. The graphics and visual effects are just stunning!\r\nToo bad the character designs are not as top notch. Most people look dull and uninspired. And the actual animation isa little stiff. But still, High school of the dead looks great, there's no denying that.\\n\\n\r\n...but why do all the boobies behave like balloons filled with clabber?\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nOpening and ending themes are really bad. I FF:ed through it to spare my ears. Background music is also pretty meh. Sound effects are great though. Awesome gunshot samples and the zombies sound really zombie:ish.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is also really good. Too bad no one is ever saying anything worth paying any attention to...\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nShort version: Stupid.\\n\\n\r\nLonger version: Stuuupid! How a studio can throw money on graphics and voice talent while letting a cow write the script and dialogue is beyond me. The first episode was very promising, but soon the dreaded irrationality that many anime share took over completely. \\n\\n\r\nEvery scene is filled with and based on irrational and unbeliveable behaviour which makes all credibility go out the window. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also no backstory; both the metaplot and the characters are incredibly shallow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nReally shallow and stereotypical characters here. Nothing we haven't seen before in just about every bad harem anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, they all act stupid beyond belief.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nThe Coalgirls fansub was not that bad. Constantly lousy timing, but I could live with that as it didn't really matter what anyone said anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWill not watch again.",

That's why I've re watched it a couple of times.\r\nThe general story is pretty poor by itself, its another zombie like viral infection that isn't explained not one bit. Zilch. But the story of the characters and their adventure together is very nicely portrayed. In the beginning I hated the girl with the pink hair, but at the end I was so bonded with the story I felt her character. If that's notbeing hooked onto something, idk what is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is kind of different than your usual anime, the characters aren't portrayed in a \"real\" manner, but there is more reality to the drawing, less bulgy crystal eyes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I can see the harem in it, its less of a fight between the girls for the guy because of their desire to survive, which is awesome IMO. Because you get the harem, but no bullshit from the characters who are lining up for senpai to notice them. \\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend it.",

So yes my fellow ecchi lovers if you are a bit of a pervert then you will be rewinding and re-watching some of the scenes in this anime over, and over, and over again. Sometimes I wonder if the director thought how far can I go until I make this a hentai? Anyway, like I said, the story isn't amazing.\r\nNeedless to say this anime starts off with a bang. All hellhas broken loose and even though it's a bit odd how this whole thing started, we don't care because there's hot chicks running around and dudes bashing up zombies. The fight scenes were awesome, between the slow-motion, the awesome sound track and bouncy boobies it's no wonder 22 minutes per episode went by so fast. \\n\\n\r\nIn some places this anime made me laugh, and unexpectedly so. I cannot reveal as to which parts, but people who have already viewed this anime will know what I'm talking about. I loved the characters and in a way I'm kind of glad the MALE protagonist for this first time in an ecchi seemed to have made his mind up on which female he liked! And it was also finally a female character that I actually liked! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series isn't something you'd watch for it's plot or deep storyline, i'm so sick of people reviewing this like \"Yeah it's got zero plot\" as if they were comparing it to something like Angel Beats or Another. (both great animes Go watch them by the way) \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to see sexy chicks in skimpy clothing fighting off zombies and laugh at just the sheer ridiculousness of some of the generic (yet funny) characters in this anime. Then go and watch HSoTD.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is a good anime that could have been a great anime if only it had taken itself seriously. Its story is solid and well paced, the art is fantastic, and the characters are introduced in a way that makes you care about them although very little background is given (though considering this is only a 12 episode anime thats fine).\r\nStory: 7\r\nWhen I first started watching this anime, based on what I had heard I expected it to be an anime about breasts and panty shots that just so happened to have zombies in it. While the anime does have enough pantyshots and breast bounces to embarrass Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, the story is all about the zombies. The way the zombies are introduced to the plot is nice. Almost each episode has the characters trying to accomplish a goal in an effort to reach their long-term goal of surviving. The plot is well paced and fits nicely in the 12 episodes of the series. Another thing I appreciated about the story is there are not a lot of plot holes left by the end of the season and much of the story is plausible (once you accept the whole zombie premise). \\n\\n\r\nThe main problems with the story is that at times it tries to get deep and you start to take it seriously from a psychological perspective...and then just when you are about to be drawn into a scene the animators go \"LOOK BOOBIES!\", and the spell is broken.\\n\\n\r\nI wont spoil much about the ending but really I thought they could have done more with some earlier plot points to make the ending more memorable. Suffice it to say the way the show ends basically demands that it get another season or at least an OAV.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I was not expecting from this series was the spectacular art. Computer animation is used really well in some scenes, particularly actions sequences. The scenery is pretty too and really adds to the whole \"end of the world\" tone of the story. One last note on the art...some of the breast physics really do put Dead or Alive to shame. Not only are most of the camera angles centered around showing of the guns that the women are carrying and those that are attached to their chests, there are some moments where the boobs look like they have themselves achieved sentience and are fleeing the zombies all on their own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand was mostly so-so. The voice actors all did a decent job (including Eri Kitamura as Saya Takagi...what is it with her and characters named Saya). The opening theme had some neat moments but I found myself skipping it most of the time. The music in the show itself was forgetable for the most part. I mean it worked with the action scenes and the sad scenes and what not but there wasnt any time in this anime where the music really blew me away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nLike all good zombie apocalypse stories, each character in High School of the Dead serves a function that aids in the survival of the group: \\n\\n\r\n-We have the main hero who starts out all whiny and emo and then starts to grow and mature towards the end while the others look up to him.\\n\\n\r\n-We have the main heroine who made a promise to the main character when they were kids and then (for reasons that are vaguley hinted at late in the series) ends up with another guy...oh and she can use a spear really well.\\n\\n\r\n-We have the typical mostly stoic but mature and attractive katana wielding high school girl who acts like a big sister by cooking meals (wearing ONLY an apron) and cutting apart zombies when she isnt doing that.\\n\\n\r\n-We have the bitchy genius girl who its hard to like at the beginning but who grows on you by the end of the anime. (as usual Eri Kitamura plays this type of character very well).\\n\\n\r\n-We have the Otaku who is useless in the real world but in the Zombie Apocalypse he is an awesome weapons expert who turns a nail gun into a nail gun gun (no literally, he adds a stock and uses it like a rifle to kill zombies in the second episode).\\n\\n\r\n-We have the little girl who shows up about halfway through the series and whose three primary functions are to look cute, bring ammo to the otaku, and keep the main characters from making out when she is on screen.\\n\\n\r\n-And finally we have the designated driver, in this case a klutzy, borderline retarded nurse who does not actually have breasts but is in fact smuggling a pair of watermelon-sized marshmallows under her shirt. Her functions are to drive cars, provide comic relief, and to be in charge of fan-service...because if there is one thing this anime didnt have enough of, its fan service (heavy sarcasm).\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I found myself liking most of the characters by the end and you do really hope that most of them live through the zombie apocalypse which is absolutely necessary for this kind of story. Also the characters are mostly believable too. Other than the Otaku, none of the other characters are able to pick up a gun and score headshots from the word go. In fact there is a lot of misses and fumbling around with ammo early on to remind you that these are high school kids. Of course then the katana-girl shows up and makes it look easy but I will forgive that because she looks so darn good while doing it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fun anime to watch. However its really disappointing that the anime fails to take itself seriously. There was SO much room for psychological twists or character growth but this was all filled in with breasts and panty shots. Now this being an anime, breasts and panty shots sort of go with the territory and to the anime's credit, these common shots do not distract from the story too much...MOST of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne action sequence in particular I have taken to calling \"booby-bullet time\". The hero has to fire a sniper rifle off the breasts of another character (for a contrived reason that technically works but you know the only reason they did this was to cause the girl to moan every time the weapon fires). As the hero fires the rifle we get a slow motion sequence where the katana girl backflips to the side to dodge the shots. In slow motion we see her breasts flopping in mid flip  and the bullet goes in front of the first breast and then behind the second one...that sequence all by itself kept this anime from getting a 8 rating. There is fan service and then there is not even trying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is a good anime and I recommend that you watch it if you like this kind of genre but it could have been a great anime if it had only taken itself seriously and toned down the boobies.",

            "content": "If you like zombies and hot girls than this anime is all you ever wanted.\r\nI can be very short about this anime, it has no deeper plot (it's a zombie invasion) but it doesn't need a bigger plot. It is about those high school kids trying to survive and kill as many zombies in order to get to the beach and rescue their parents.\r\nThe story:\r\nThe story is nice, I mean a zombie invasion and some people trying to survive, it has been done for a million times. But this anime differs itself from normal zombie films/series. First of the blood and gore are amazing, peopleget eaten alive etc. This really gives you the adrenaline of fighting those zombies yourself. \\n\r\nThe second thing about this anime is that the zombies, aren't that slow or that weak, normally zombies die after one blow to the head and their quantity is their real strength. In this anime the zombies are actually very strong and they won't be knocked back if you hit them (although they are brain dead). The last thing witch really amazed me was the incredible scenery, we see so much from the city they live in. Although the title said high school they are only in this high school for 2/3 episodes. After they leave this high school they enter the world of madness created by the zombie virus. And in their quest to find their parents and to find a save place they learn to know each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing really points out right away. The fan service in this anime is close to hentai, we see bouncing boobs flying skirts and even a bathtub orgie at one point. The anime gives you so much fan service that I sometimes checked for the door hoping that my parents wouldn't walk in asking me questions I could not explain. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say about this fan service, well I don't care for it. It is nice to have it and to watch it. I mean who doesn't want to see zombies beat up by hot chicks. It is the same as in movies as transformers were Megan Fox plays for a sex symbol. \\n\\n\r\nBut back to the topic, the characters.\\n\r\nThe main character is a smart boy witch is very angry most of the time. He travels with a obese nerd who loves weapons and who can turn from a nice shy boy into a zombie mass murderer within the second he holds a gun. The girls in the anime are amazing. They each have their own personality and certain beauty or style in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the control freak who has a rich background, witch you will learn during the series.\\n\r\nWe have the hot ninja girl witch is pretty cliche but she looks hot and you get to learn her past as well. And of course we have the ex-girlfriend of our main character, witch is a nice and fierce girl but also shy and cute, well to get to the point. The characters have it all.\\n\\n\r\nOne exception is the school nurse who is annoying as hell, she cannot do a single thing, she is oversexed and well I wonder how someone like her could ever be a school nurse. Ah well.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nI truly loved this amazing ride, the zombies the woman, the blood and gore. Everything a boy can dream of. But what I liked most of all in the entire anime, is the music and one song in particular. The opening song is so amazing that I cannot stop listing to it! Normally I skip trough the intro of a episode but with this anime I watched it every time. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is amazing and the ending gives hopes for a second season, the violence and the fan service make this anime to be one of a kind in the blood and gore section. I advice everyone to watch this anime, but please close your doors or it will lead to awkward questions.\\n\r\n Sigh parents..\\n\\n\r\nCheers Lucid.",

            "content": "Takashi is skipping class when he notices someone in the courtyard getting bitten. Sensing something bad is about to happen, he then proceeds to go slap a couple bitches, grab a couple weapons, and kick some undead ass. From there boobs fly, tits jiggle and you have yourself \u201cHigh School of the Dead\u201d in a nutshell.\r\nThe core of the anime however tackles some more serious tones. It shows the desperation and development of the cast as they are forced to adapt to the changing world, where anarchy takes the streets, and comfort is but a fleeting dream. It shows the concerns for their families, friends,and cohorts while challenging the very morals they grew up with. Having said that, it is quite hard to take this anime seriously when the amount of fan service presented throughout is enough to freeze over Egypt (get it? Fan?). \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to get a feel for what this anime is like. Just imagine high school, but with guns\u2026 and tits, and zombies. Actually, despite being an anime with the word \u201cHigh School\u201d in its title, the majority of the anime takes place elsewhere, where they seek shelter in various locations and settlements while searching for their family members and a safe haven. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my gripes with watching this show is, the main villain teacher guy\u2026 douchefag. Who happens to be a condescending, arrogant, and manipulative twat\u2026 who also happens wears a dick on his head. Guess what happens to him in the end? *spoiler* They let him go\u2026 Oh For Fucks Sake. \u201cCome on! Shoot his ass Lee! If you ain\u2019t gonna shoot him, kung fu his ass or something!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere were a couple things in this anime that didn\u2019t register with me; like how Hirano conveniently took shooting lessons in America, how Shizuka\u2019s friend happened to be a special forces operative, how Takagi\u2019s parents happened to be Batman and Wonder woman, why all the breasts seemed to be shaped like NFL footballs, and how Saeko\u2019s breasts seemed to be two completely separate entities (heh titties) that seemed to defy the very laws of physics. \\n\r\nHowever because this anime was so over the top, you could just enjoy it for its entertainment value and level of ridiculousness. The action scenes were extremely over the top as was the amount of fan service . Meanwhile there\u2018s a decent amount of humor, ideology, and character development spread throughout. The first season however, doesn\u2019t resolve everything and leaves it up for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is, the manga has been put on indefinite hiatus for just over a year now, and plans for a second season are nowhere in sight. Apparently, despite the overwhelming popularity of the anime (currently #27), it was so controversial that they had to put it on pause. \\n\\n\r\n(Meanwhile, \u2018To Love-Ru Darkness\u2019 is apparently \u201cSafe For All Ages\u201d. http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2012/06/03/to-love-ru-darkness-escapes-ban-now-safe-for-all-ages/ (Warning: 18+))\\n\r\nWho the fuck decides this shit, the fucking pedobear?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of; fan service, zombies, footballs, panties, over the top action, and boob physics, then this is an anime I would recommend. Who knows, if you like it, tell your friends, sign a petition or something in hopes that Shoji Sato will take a break from drawing hentai and get back to this series. (Then again with the current rating system, his hentai might even be more \u201csafe\u201d than this series.)\\n\\n\r\nI hoped you enjoyed this review, and as always, thank you for reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A quick guide for the unbeknownst.\r\nHighschool of the Dead is: \r\nA Harem\r\nHighschool of the Dead is NOT:\r\nA Horror\r\nIf you like \"harem\" and that sort of sexual fantasy mixed with sitcom-y type of shows, then give'r a watch. Try to imagine a little less comedy and more hyper \"manly\" action than your typical harem story. That's probably what you're in for, but I'm not too sure, I don't like harem so you probably know more than I do.\r\nDon't bother reading the rest. \r\nThese aren't the droids you're looking for.\r\nIf you're like me then hopefully you can use this review to bypass this show and do somethingbetter with your time. \\n\r\nThe \"fan-service\" is immense here.\\n\\n\r\nDon't understand the concept of \"harem\" or \"fan-service\"?\\n\r\nA quick mostly-spoiler-free description of what I saw:\\n\\n\r\nThis show has all the straight-male fantasy found in typical 80's action flicks magnified by twenty, only instead of a super-muscular 30-something dude its a slim somehow-really-skilled handsome teen dude, and then add more innuendoes and more awkward teenager dialogue.\\n\r\nMost of the (sometimes) thought-provoking commentaries on society found in zombie classics like Romaro's Dead series is tragically absent. Occasionally there's a glimpse to some interesting human interactions but, for the most part, the show focusses on the handsome somehow-really-skilled teenager and his survival group with one unhandsome male \"dork\" and several female stereotypes with oversized boobs. \\n\\n\r\nLike, really, really big boobs. Unrealistically big and perky boobs. \\n\r\nIn this universe, Japan makes a shit-ton of money from breast-enhancement surgery. \\n\\n\r\nOne (maybe two if you're pushing it) of the female characters is skilled in combat and she's a confident person, which seems nice considering, but it's quickly revealed that she ultimately depends on the lead male character and is often used as a tool for the harem storyline. It's personally difficult for me to take a show seriously when some one who's supposed to be a badass finds herself wearing almost no clothing or participating in a wet t-shirt voyeur, just 'cause.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that's all a bad thing, necessarily. Some of the tropes and styles are really enjoyed by certain audiences, and harem stories are quite popular in Japan for a reason. However, I do not personally find harem and this sort of sexual fantasy interesting. If that's all a show is going to offer then why don't I just go watch some porn, or even better, a live-action erotic film that isn't so over-the-top and childish?\\n\\n\r\nI was warned of the harem aspect before I started watching the show...\\n\r\nI was just hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would offer something else. Something that zombie-flick fans might enjoy or find interesting. Something a little deeper or scary than your average harem story. Unfortunately, the sexual fantasy aspect is really all that's there. Any time the story looks like it could turn interesting it never follows through and then goes right back to the hilariously unrealistic fantasies. Sometimes characters will go through (what should be) horrific experiences then within a couple scenes they're totally fine because they need to bolster the male leads.\\n\r\nPriorities, am I right?\\n",

            "content": "I watched only the first two episodes, after which I had to stop. My reason? The upskirts were just too much. I have no problem with nudity or sexualisation in media, but I feel that HOTD's treatment of this often contentious issue completely missed the mark;\r\nIn any reasonable quality film or show, nothing is accidental. Especially in the case of anime, where everything is drawn (or computer generated, or whatever), every aspect of every frame is there because someone put it there. This should seem obvious. The problem with HOTD's frequent upskirt shots is that they are completely gratuitous. They serve no purpose and existonly for their own sake. These sorts of shots do have a place in film-making and anime, but they would usually be used to expand the feel of the world (usually to represent the sleazier undertones of humanity, think sin city or similar), or to further the exploration of a character (maybe to present vulnerability, or to expand a promiscuous character trait). The upskirts and jiggling breasts in HOTD do not mean anything. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, a point could be made that not every anime has to be 'smart'. Some exist for pure entertainment and are shallow by nature. In such a light, sexualisation doesn't need to be meaningful. Which brings me to my second point, frequency;\\n\\n\r\nWe're not talking about an upskirt here and there, the sexual undertones and suggestive camera angles are pretty much through the whole show. HOTD feels like it's trying to pay homage to the classic zombie/teen slasher flicks of yesteryear, and those were known for often frequent nudity. The difference is that those films considered 'frequent nudity' to be 3-4 scenes in a whole 90 minute film, not 20 upskirts in a 20 minute episode. It became so frequent in the first two episodes alone that it was distracting from the main action and detracted considerably from the feel and flow of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHOTD insults women by presenting them as sexual objects in completely unreasonable situations for such a presentation. It insults men by assuming that's what they want to see. And finally, it's a kick in the teeth of anime being seen as anything approaching artistic. It's material like this that has attached such a social stigma to watching anime in the first place.\\n\r\nI went in expecting a popcorn slasher about zombies. I was expecting violence, sexualisation and one dimensional characters, but it was just too much. If you don't mind an upskirt shot literally once a minute, maybe there's a cool show to be found here. Maybe I'm missing something, but to me it was the anime equivalent of a teenager drawing dicks in his notebook.",

            "content": "Story: HSotD is a pretty standard \"survivors must escape the zombie hordes\" series, only this time our intrepid heroes are a bunch of high schoolers seeking safety while also trying to discover the fates of their families. I always find it intriguing to watch how groups would react when society completely collapses, even more so when it's a bunch of young students trying to fully grasp what this means for them and their futures.\r\nArt: When the action gets going, be prepared for sheer physics defying psychosis forms of entertainment. However, at times the creators go lazy and pull \"shaky cam stills\" in some of thestrangest places, such as a girl jumping off a bus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound is pretty much what you would expect from a zombie horror series. I give props to a really good intro song, though I must also warn it is the best song played throughout the series. You may stab your ears out at some of the Engrish sung in the ending scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are fairly standard tropes for the genre: the popular guy protagonist, his love interest, best friend, sullen female badass, the \"geek that inherited the earth\" badass. Some character development, but nothing that makes them stand out. (Seriously, I can't remember any of their names).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Herein lies the rub. The sum of the parts, while nothing extraordinary, would have made for a fully enjoyable series on their own merits. However, the creators also decided flood the series with so much fanservice it nearly derails the entire thing. By flooding I mean it looks like they added MORE in post production. This isn't some prudish attitude of mine; there's at least one panty or chest shot every 30 seconds or so. It is so prevalent that when you get to the requisite \"chicks in a bathtub\" scene, you are so numbed you actually don't care.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 HSotD would have scored higher for me were it not for the excessive and honestly unnecessary amounts of fanservice thrust at you. I won't give a full out recommendation to watch it because of it, but if you are curious the action scenes will melt your brain with their insanity, and you'll find a decent story to boot.",

            "content": "High School of the Dead is more or less something of a parody of zombie movies as a group of high schoolers fight for their lives with the zombie apocalypse hitting the Japanese populace. The anime mostly relishes in the spectacle of seeing zombie hordes getting slain in various ways, the populace struggling with moral inhibitions to ensure self-preservation and plenty of T&A going around thanks to the anime's copious amounts of fan service and ecchi content it shows off. Visually, the anime is one of the better animated 2010 anime titles to be made making creative use of camera positions and effects such asbullet time, zoom shots and swooshing angles to depict the intense zombie-killing action that unfolds, with scenery shots looking vast and well-detailed when the camera pans out to show them off.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series is a rarity for anime in being a zombie survival title, it doesn't have much to offer in terms of depth with the plot and characters to High School of the Dead are rather paper-thin. The plot is mostly repetitive as our group of high schoolers have to regularly fight through zombie hordes, find shelter for a period of time, wind up fleeing when their shelter is breached and repeat. It also often disregards proper logic for the sake of its spectacle as characters are known to not make smart decisions regularly in this series and details such as proper government action and ammo supply are often disregarded.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not much better as they are mostly archetypal and get little in the way of development, most notable of these characters being an otaku who is seemingly a representation of a stereotypical otaku with his enjoyment of shooting his way through zombies and usually relishing in the women that are within his group. Speaking of the women, High School of the Dead has them purposely designed to be well-endowed and sporting a good number of fan service/ ecchi moments with panty shots, breast jiggling, revealing attire, clothes changing scenes, a bath scene and an orgy. The mentioned fan service is mixed in at many points during the zombie battle scenes, with the series clearly aimed at fans of gory action and ecchi titles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, High School of the Dead mostly gets by with the style it emphasizes with its presentation and premise, while lacking quite a bit on the end of substance. If you don't mind some mindless entertainment, this would make for a decent rental. But if you are looking for more substance or are not a big fan of gore and ecchi content, then this isn't a title worth picking up.",

            "content": "Highschool of The Dead was an alright anime in my opinion. Not terrible, but not great.\r\nStory: The story had a lot of potential. Zombie Apocalypse...sounds pretty sick. But, instead the group of kids in the Highschool decide on trying to find their families. I don't know, I didn't really like that as much as I expected. The story was also quite boring towards the end of the series for me (episodes 10-12). I give it a 6/10\r\nArt: The art was great. The zombies were all drawn very well and nothing looked odd.  Only complaint I have is the girls' hairstyles...I thought they looked stupidhonestly. But I still give the art a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was cool. I liked the openings and the BGM's as they all fit within the show. Each episodes ending was a different song, so that was something cool. The English Dub is honestly quite different from the Japanese version including much more profanity and a lot of the lines were different than what they should of been. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I didn't really like any of the characters much except for Saeko to be honest. The cast is all pretty sterotypical (Normal leader, bratty girl, stupid girl, normal girl, sadistic girl, comic relief guy etc)\\n\r\nNo one really stood out a whole lot except for Saeko in my opinion. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Besides the OVER-EXCESSIVE USE OF FANSERVICE, I enjoyed it. Even though the end was quite slow in my opinion, it was okay. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal thought: Highschool of The Dead is a goodish anime. It's not very memorable (except the fanservice) and won't be in your \"Wow that was one of the best animes I've seen!\" list. It's worth watching however, since it's only 12 episodes.",

            "content": "Breasts,Guns and Zombies! Those are the three words that sum up High School Of The Dead, and trust me that isn't a bad thing. HOTD is one of those anime that doesn't really care what it does with itself, it'll throw you all the fan-service it wants and all the kick-ass zombie slaying it wants. HOTD really is the definition of an action anime.Though not done perfectly, HOTD really is one of the best at what it does.\r\nThe story really isn't anything to write home about, it's your typical zombie plot where you have a group of survivors trying to stay alive in a worldinfested with zombies. It's something i'm sure we've all seen countless amount of times in a movie or TV show. However, like I said before, that isn't at all a bad thing, it's actually one of the things that makes HOTD shine. HOTD has such a basic and braindead plot(see what I did there, he he) that you can focus more on the action and comedic elements of the anime than instead having to focus on a uber complex plot. That's one of the best parts of this anime. Again, it's an anime that you cannot take seriously or else you'll hate it because of all the clear flaws it has when it comes to the story. HOTD does one thing really well when it comes to the story and setting, it has a great presentation of how the world would be if it became littered with zombies. HOTD shows the chaos that would erupt if a zombie apocalypse did occur. This is something that I love in HOTD.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in High School Of The Dead is pretty well done, the animation is attractive and every scene involving the desolation of zombies is so awesome to watch. Out of everything in HOTD I enjoyed the action sequences the most just because they were so bad-ass and executed so well.\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have with HOTD's action is the fact that in nearly every action scene there are huge, jiggly boobs flashed around everywhere like confetti on New Years Eve. However, I will say eventually you'll get accustomed to the crude amount of fan-service in this anime that is literally every where in High School Of The Dead. I also must say that HOTD has an amazing soundtrack that really compliments all of it's zombie killing. Not to mention that HOTD has a breathtaking Opening that got me excited for every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in High School Of The Dead are a clear weak point in the anime. Unless of course you like every single one of your female protagonists to pack ginormous tits, than of course you might actually like the cast in HOTD. Our main character Takashi Komuro is at first the standard whiny main persona, Until later where he is forced to evolve into the honorable leader of his zombie survival squad. Takashi isn't really a cool character and is rather bland for the most part. Rei is the love interest of Takashi and is also the one person he vows to protect at all costs. Rei is unfortunately your run of the mill tsundere until they obviously end up together, at least somewhat.\\n\r\nSaeko has to be the second most bad ass character in HOTD, she's a super agile, sword wielding, freak who will tear anything that stands in her way.\\n\r\nShe also has probably the most interesting back story of all the characters and has the most skill in slaying zombies. Kohta is the last person that is worth mentioning in this review. He's an otaku that has a wicked passion for guns and killing things. If the group didn't have Kohta, they'd honestly all be toast! Saya Takagi is a quite annoying character that stays like that from beginning to end.She's the smartest of the group but is the most bitchy and almost is a detriment to the ring of survivors. Shizuka rocks the biggest breasts in the anime and is there for pure fan-service. She's the worst character in the anime and I really did want her to eventually die. Alice is the little girl the whole squad valiantly rescues in order to protect her, sadly she isn't so important to the overall chances of survival within the whole group.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Did I enjoy High School Of The Dead? Yes! I enjoy this anime because it doesn't try to hard to succeed. As dumb as it sounds, the rashness of this anime and the pure recklessness should be enjoyable to anyone. This is the perfect anime if you just want to kick back and have a whole lot of fun.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Zombies fans you are in for a treat.  Highschool of the Dead is a by the book zombie apocalypse that we all know and love except in anime form.  Its not setting new grounds or innovating, but it certainly is entertaining.\r\nThe story starts with our protagonists at school at least until the first zombie comes knocking at the school gates.  Everything goes down hill from there and what ensues is a frantic scramble for survival.  Friendships are tested, emotions run high, and zombies are subjected to various forms of trauma before the survivors find a quiet niche to contemplate, relax orotherwise have some downtime.  This repeats throughout, ensuring time for characterisation with the repetition supplemented by scenes of the fall of global society.  It might seem boring but it is well paced.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may or may not know, the source material tends towards visual fidelity and gratuitous fanservice.  The anime does not disappoint with great detail spent animating ridiculous fights that defy the laws of physics.  Not to say that the quieter or more rousing scenes suffer.  They don't and some of the picturesque backgrounds do a great job in contrasting the living dead apocalypse.  Characters themselves are given similar treatment, though the fanservice may seem excessive to some.  Arguably, the show was never meant to be that subtle about it given an interview the director (correct me if I'm wrong) gave early in series.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the sound work done in to the series.  Not only do the blows seem visceral but the guns do sound realistic as they were.  Supported from below by the background music, the fight scenes really do gain that edge.  In fact, even the opening gets you in to the mood to see more zombie carnage while the ending highlights the sadness of having to wait until the next episode for more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves I do want to say I love some of them. I appreciate how each character has their own, well, character.  Some of them are overplayed however, but really I should have expected it.  Especially the ditzy nurse.  Surprisingly enough, its the side characters that clearly show some of the best examples of hypocrisy that I like the most, but that's probably only because they get eaten by zombies.\\n\\n\r\nComing out of the last episode, I must say I enjoyed following our intrepid survivors as they journey along and look forward to the next instalment (there's even a brief glimpse of a future character at the end).  The violence and fanservice is gratuitous.  Coupled with the depiction fall of global civilisation, there's nothing a zombie apocalypse fan wouldn't want.",

I have listened to it time and time again and the opening song is by far my favorite opening theme in any anime I have watched because It is very energetic, and quite easy to remember.  The intro is also theperfect length where some anime openings take too damn long.\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nthere are a total of seven main characters, two guys and 5 pairs of breasts, I mean girls.  I find the characters to be quite well done.  Although you can only relate with a few of them (I think).  I thought they did a pretty good job with character progression.  I personally like all the characters.  My absolute favorite would probably be takashi (obviously) and Saeko.

It is an entertaining anime to watch because it combines a lot of different genres. For example, there are zombie battles that combine violent action with horror, but then bits of comedy and fan service will be thrown in mid-battle. At least I find it humorous when they throw in fan service mid-battle. This anime was a fun watch all the way through. It is a shame that Japan is not into zombies as much as America, otherwise we may have had a secondseason.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: Zombies are your thing.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: Fan service is not your thing.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: There is no shortage of creativity for zombie killings in Highschool of the Dead.",

However, as you should be able to tell by the opening credits, this show devolves into a brainy stew of zombies and fan service. While this combination may seem fine, the show fails to execute, in that, it takes it's self too seriously whilst delivering a mediocre story with little to no character development outside of the one brilliant character of the series, Saeko, the rest of the cast serve as cardboard cutouts compared to her.\r\nWhat the series lacks of in story, it excels in the art department (Gravity defyingboobs aside) animation is both slick, and vapid, while offering up a great color palette to contrast the brilliant blood streams.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sure HoTD pleases a majority of it's viewers, and it is an enjoyable viewing experience if you can get over the awkward fanservice and don't expect a serious plot. The most disappointing aspect of the series is that it offers an otherwise fascinating insight into what people would do if a zombie outbreak were to happen, however these instances of fascination are few and far between and takes a backseat to the series' main goal, pandering to it's teen male demographic. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a mindless zombie slaying experience then HoTD is for you, otherwise don't get your hopes up.",

While it certainly isn't original, it does what it set out to do, and that's to be a zombie apocalypse adventure. Action packed, pure awesome fight scenes with chicks who know how to kick some ass!!! It's ecchi, so yeah there are a lot of boobs, which may or may not be a bad thing. \r\nThe art style wasn't anything special but it had great gore, lots of blood and no censoring, which matched the music quite well and created a great fight scene atmosphere. \r\nCharacter development ispresent but barely. The characters are definitely stereotypical and lack depth to say the least, however the cast is relatable, they enjoy - to some extent - what's happened just as many teenagers wish the zombie apocalypse would just happen already. Which, in my opinion, is all that this show needed them to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just want to sit back and watch some hot teens kick the ass out of some zombies this is an excellent pick.\\n",

            "content": ".:: Story ::. \r\nThe story in Highschool of the Dead is pretty straightforward and obvious.  It revolves around a world that's been quickly corrupted by zombies.  A group of teenagers band together to escape the school and survive the apocalypse.  The story was for the most part, good, but I wouldn't say it was the greatest. The first few episodes were interesting, but things start straying away the further you travel into the series. Overall, I give the plot a score of 6/10 {Fair} \r\n.:: Artwork ::. \r\nI really love the character designs and art styles used in HSOTD. The animation isreally good. It's  vivid in color and detailed. Also the fighting scenes  are done in a creative matter, so it adds it's own personal flair that sets it apart from other shows that have zombies.  for artwork I give it a 9/10 {Great!}  \\n\\n\r\n.:: Sound ::.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes are very good.  I found myself singing a long to them :]. The background music is also nice, it's not too distracting or overused and it fits the mood, as well as well timed sound effects. I watched both sub & dubbed versions (I'm not picky about dubs), I find both versions to have good voice acting. I think the English dubbed voices actually suited the characters more then the Japanese dubs, but I like both. I have nothing to complain about.  I give sound & music a score of 9/10 {Great!} \\n\\n\r\n.:: Characters ::. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a couple of interesting characters introduced in High School of the Dead, but for the most part there isn't much character development throughout the series. I love many of the characters, although many of the girls are bitchy, I give them props for having some spunk! That's what I love about them. I give this a score of 6/10 {Fair}\\n\\n\r\n.:: Enjoyment ::. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching the series. However, this Anime contains a lot of fanservice moments.  There is a lot of boobs bouncing and pantyshots.  Since I'm a girl myself, honestly fanservice never really bothered me. But in HSOTD it can get pretty distracting since they put heavy empthasis on this. It shows up A LOT.  At times it can be a real mood killer. I wouldn't have minded much I'd they didn't give us an overload.  In a way, large boobs jiggling and skirts flying up during fights gives off a realistic feel. \\n\\n\r\n.:: Overall ::. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this Anime is 7/10 {Good}",

            "content": "If you are looking for an anime with a complex storyline and intriguing characters, you need to keep looking. This anime is silly and uses any excuse to show breasts  that bounce up and down with every foot step. However Highschool of the Dead is just a fun show to watch. There is no need to get to into the plot, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. The action in HOTD is awesome, heaps of blood and some bad-ass weapons. If you are into zombies, you will love this anime.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in HOTD is nothing special. A group of highschoolkids and a ditzy nurse with giant breasts trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. Although some relationships are formed, they are weak at best. Aside from that, it is still an enjoyable story that is enough to keep you watching. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in HOTD is done very well done. It has a dark art style that fits nicely with the theme of a zombie apocalypse. The characters look good and so do the zombies. 9/1\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI didn't even notice the sound in HOTD which means one thing. It fitted each seen well. That being said, the sound wasn't memorable and I don't think I remember one song from the show. The sound does well to assist the scenes overall feel. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in HOTD were average apart from Kouta. Kouta is a nerdy gun maniac that you can't help but love whilst watching the show. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHOTD is not something you should expect a lot from. You just need to sit back and enjoy what it has to offer, which is guns, zombies, blood and titties. If you watch the show like this, you are guaranteed to enjoy it. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nHOTD is an enjoyable anime to watch. As long as you don't take it too seriously, I recommend you give this anime a go.\\n",

            "content": "\"This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.\" - T. S. Eliot \r\nUnderneath all the blatant fanservice and mindless bloodshed, Highschool of the Dead digs deep into the psychology of the human mind, showing us the lengths of cruelty and inhumanity us humans can go to in order to save ourselves. During times of chaos, the disgusting and selfish core of human beings are fully exposed for all to see, and the world which was once keen on peace and unity transforms into one of corruption and division. True, the story depicted in the anime is just that -a fictional story and nothing more - but it does serve as an entertaining way to foreshadow the possible state of the world if a similar international crisis were to happen. However, as this is an anime review, other factors besides the story must also be taken into account. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, the artwork was done quite well. The animation during action-packed scenes was fluid and easy to watch. The zombies were interesting to see given that the animators had no real model to base their work off of. The grotesque features and lethargic, swaying movements of the zombies replicated what I had in mind almost perfectly. On the other hand, I found the character designs to be a bit plain and unoriginal. If this only applied to the side characters, I wouldn't have minded, but when even the main characters look like characters you've seen before, then there's have a problem. In the end, the good cancels out with the bad, resulting in an average score. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\r\nHonestly, I was disappointed with the characters. With the exception of a few scenes, I felt there wasn't enough character development. One would think that, in the situation the characters are in, that there'd be plenty of it. However, all that really happens throughout the series is killing, fleeing and resting. There isn't much dynamic dialogue to contribute to the development of the characters. One specific example of failed characterization is unsurprisingly the school nurse, Marikawa Shizuka. At times, I wondered whether she was there just for the sake of fanservice (as if there wasn't enough already). Despite all this, there were indeed some parts where character development was evident. As an example, when comparing Takashi's character from the start to the end, the changes he has gone through are a testament to his strong, composed and leader-like personality. Similarly, the other main characters have, to a slightly lesser degree, gone through the same. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nFrom the amusing groans of the zombies to the flurry of mediocre ending themes, the sounds and music used in this show were generally poor. However, the fast-paced opening was effective in pumping me up for each and every episode. Also, the seiy\u016bs did a great job of voicing their characters. The emotions of the characters were conveyed well through their voices, making scenes more realistic and believable. Lastly, the BGM was not memorable; I can barely remember any of the tracks despite having just finished the series. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nAt first glance, Highschool of the Dead is another one of those typical, post-apocalyptic stories centered on the concept of \"survival of the fittest\". While this does end up being the case, there were also other messages placed throughout the 12 episodes. Furthermore, even though it'll most likely be useless information, the anime makes an indirect attempt at educating viewers about what might happen if the real world were to end up like what was shown. Personally, I liked how the story was about the journey of a group of high school students trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, even if there was some unrealism to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nFor those who don't mind a repetitive show that features several large-breasted girls (and two regular, teenage boys) slaying zombies, then by all means, give Highschool of the Dead a try. This is one of those shows that don't require one to think too hard about what's going on (in fact, not thinking is probably the best choice as many things that push the limits of reality are shown). It's a surprisingly popular show, nonetheless, so even if you don't fit into the description of the target group, there may be a chance that you'll still like the show. As for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having also read the manga, I'm glad that there's still material left for the possibility of the second season. To sum it all up, HOTD is essentially your run-of-the-mill fanservice anime.",

I have all of George A. Romero's movies on DVD, originals and remakes. I read the Walking Dead comics. I play lots of zombie video games. I read lots of zombie books.\r\nEven zombies couldn't save this show for me. The premise is pretty cool. Students in a high school when the zombie apocalypse starts have to use the resources on their campus the survive.The zombies are pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are abysmal and the show is blatantly sexist. I get fanservice. I get that horror often exploits sex (uh, I read the Walking Dead, remember?), that doesn't excuse how EVERY SHOT in this show is fan service, the character designs are awful, no woman wears a bra (who needs one when your school uniform has boob socks! Seriously, show, boobs don't work that way), and all the female characters are unlikable or constantly needing to be saved.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I seriously doubt zombies are into groping. This is like one degree away from hentai. Nothing against porn, but the porn needs to stay in the porn section and hentai is usually uncomfortably rape-y anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThere is exactly one competent female character and she's a yanki stereotype, which distances her from being a \"normal\" girl so those \"normal\" girls get to stay sexual objects that get saved because they are sexual. Good job, show.\\n\\n\r\nEven if it gets better--I'm not going back in to find out--that doesn't excuse how awful it was to start out and how utterly alienating it was. All the \"girl's are weak and dumb\" subtext coupled with constant bouncing boobs and panty shots when these girls are in mortal danger was a neon sign saying \"This is not for you, this is for teenage boys\".\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if a woman is being attacked (even by zombies), we should be worried for her, concerned, rooting for her to win, interested in her as a character and her ability to get out of the situation. We should be feeling for her, not oggling her and seeing every attack as another opportunity to see some of her clothes get torn off.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is bad and the creators should feel bad.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the music sucks.",

I've watched (and enjoyed) shows put out by Sentai Filmworks in the past, such as Dusk Maiden of Amnesia, Log Horizon and Knights of Sidonia, which I rated 10, 8 and 8 respectively, so I knew there would inevitably be fan service in this anime as that is simply what that company does. But mannnnnnnnnnn, this is on an entirely different level! The fan service in this anime is beyond excessive. It is constant, it is shoved down your throat and it is not the tiniest bitsubtle. It's to the point where it's arguable that the fan service is priority number one for the show and everything else, including the plot, is a secondary priority.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, and with my wife and I both certainly not being the target demographic for the unrelenting fan service, we both actually quite liked this anime even though we both felt like we should not have given how unbelievably juvenile it is. Some of the things it does well include loads of action, uptempo pacing with no boring or slow stretches, energetic and fast paced music (which fits nicely with the fast paced, action oriented nature of the show as a whole) and a comparatively believable plot.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly truly if they had simply toned down the fan service- I'm not even necessarily saying get rid of it completely, just tone it down a bit- this was probably a 9. But it really is to the point where it feels like the point of the anime is to show you boobies and there happens to be zombies and stuff going on in the background.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not bothered by fan service, or if you're a teenage boy who actively enjoys it, you'll likely have a good time with this show. Otherwise, while you may still have a good time, as we did, you'll inevitably be rolling your eyes quite frequently and thinking to yourself \"enough already\". Know what you're signing up for before watching.\\n\\n\r\n+Jumps right into the thick of things- no slow buildup\\n\r\n+Loads of action\\n\r\n+Fast paced, engaging and energetic\\n\\n\r\n-RELENTLESS AND CONSTANT fan service, more so than any other anime I've ever seen\\n\r\n-Unsatisfying ending that lacks resolution\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Really hard to say as it probably varies wildly based on what demographic you fall into, but I'm going to say a 7.5\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8.5",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead review\r\nBoobs that defy the laws of physics, matrix boobs.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nWhat can I say about the story in this anime is one simple truth: The girls boobs had more screen time than the main characters. This is a zombie genre anime where a deadly virus turns everybody into living corpses who walk.The idea and concept is good the only problem are the characters and how the story was executed. The execution is more of a hentai anime instead of a horror -post -apocalyptic anime with matrix boobs.The logic this anime abords is also insane and exaggerated on the human body capabilities .I will explain now everything.\\n\\n\r\nFirst this is your standard fare zombie story that you've seen countless of times before. The only difference being the abundance of tits and panty shots thrown at you every 5 seconds.You're not sure if the show is trying to give you an adrenaline rush or a fucking boner. After a point you forget you were watching a zombie flick as it steadily becomes a harem. It's hard to build tension when hoards of zombies are eating someone while the camera focuses on the boobs bouncing story. Don't get me wrong, fanservice is nice if it serves a purpose or doesn't take away from the show's overall experience. For example monogatari series is a abundance with fanservice but that fanservice has a purpose and meaning for the characters and the influence they have over the story. In Hotd is used as a stereotype to attract the viewers and make them hard.\\n\\n\r\nSecond let\u2019s take a look at the characters actions and reactions faced with a crisis situation. Most of us will be afraid if something like a zombie apocalypse will happen in a split of seconds in our school. But look at the main character everything for him is natural, he fights zombies like he trained in a military facility and his purpose is to save mankind. Yeah well this is bullshit thrown in the face of the viewer. \\n\r\nAlso why do I need to see the ass and panty shots of the girls when fighting the zombies? It\u2019s more confusing and gives the anime a tone of ridiculousness and the plot a simple-minded impression.\\n\\n\r\nThird is about the story and its progression it\u2019s awfull and has no conclusion at all, the events that happen across the story are chaotic and the characters have a 180* personality change. Lets take a example to justify what I said, Rei a girl who is whining about her boyfriend who died , and then when she meets Takashi she finds out that she really wanted to get rid of her boyfriend(to be killed by zombies) and falls for Takashi and wants him to make love to her. Are you serious? Where was the shock value that the anime wanted to give to the characters if she can take a 180* turn in her personality\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnother character Boobs McKenzy tells them that she cannot drive the bus over a small group of zombies because it would flip the bus. Then, as soon as the plot calls for it, she hits the gas, runs over about 30 zombies, then plows through a METAL GATE and drives down the road like nothing is wrong.All we need is a 80\u2019s song on the background to make her character look more badass.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have the zombies ladies and gentlemen who are used as plot devices all show long, and we have no explication how they are so smart and can find the characters where they are hiding. The show only gives us a stupid reason that they are attracted to sound but that is contradicted by the characters actions from this anime. The scene were Takashi walks through a crowd of zombies and the suspense is high but some other characters make a pipe sound and the zombies start reacting , but wait the screaming from the chased girl doesn\u2019t alert them \u2026anime logic\u2026..Fine this justifies the explication but now lets take another scene where they leave a empty building and go into the yard and then the zombies start coming in rows on the stairs. Takashi declares that the zombies are attracted to the sound of the leaves from his logic but the sound they made with their steps nobody takes that in account.Why did they left the building? Because the katana killer psychopath is now used as a plot device for the story. Of course she kills all zombies and then she declares she is wet . What a shitty( no hate just a fact) scene and useless killing to captivate the simple minds of the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs a opinion from a viewer perspective as myself I wonder why they didn\u2019t have sex ? That would make the atmosphere more real and give a tone of maturity to the show. Otherwise is just teasing and only give a boner and halfway hopes for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nWe have a diversity of characters and hentai stereotypes characters all across the show. This is practically a harem in a post apocalyptic scenery and the boob size is what makes the characters unique traits. Also we have fanservice , why not and bath scenes and the transition between fights and the fanservice is a mess. I am also wondering how a bunch of high school students can fire arms and fight like professional killers.The logic behind their actions is full of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nTakashi the main character who has a lot of plot armor. Why because with only a simple advice he became a expert in weapons and his accuracy in killing a target, even most of the assassins who trained are jealous. A lot of plot conveniences for him and across the story for other characters he interacts.\\n\\n\r\nRei is just a doll who can only depend on guys and cant take a proper decision the whole show. Her boobs are more interesting than her character.\\n\\n\r\nSaya a typical tsundere and a clich\u00e9 stereotype this show uses , she is annoying and again her boob size is ridiculous , about her influence she has a late development in the last episodes where she decides to help the group and we found something about her story.\\n\\n\r\nSaeko this is a 180* turn of personality character who enjoys killing and gets wet after that. This is clearly the worst possible character this show could came up with her purpose is as a plot device to kill zombies when the situation becomes dire.\\n\\n\r\nThe only decent character is that gun maniac who acts as a normal person in this situation and gives a tone of comedy to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nThose boobs camera angles are fascinating and the way they avoid the bullets at the last seconds is pure matrix bullshit(a fact) . Also the fanservice is more focused than the characters. Beautifull colors, useless killing and boners delivered to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nThe opening song is the only good thing this anime has.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nWhy would I enjoy a show that is supposed to deliver suspense and thriller and fails in that concept and everything turns into a hentai where teasing and characters interaction give me a boner. Also the boob size is over normal common sense and logic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10 \\n\r\nIf you want to see badass fights with no logic or explication , matrix boobs , characters who have 180* turn change, teasing, panty shoots , more boobs , bath scenes , this anime is perfect to get you a fine boner. Otherwise if you are looking for a story and characters with a decent plot don\u2019t bother you will waste your time and will get only a halfway boner.",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - The art for this anime didn't really stand out to me that much but that being said, it is definitely not a bad art style.  The art was very unique, I can say that for sure.  The characters chins could have very well been used to slice and serve butter but instead of doing that the creators decided to give 90% of the character models boobs that outweighed a sumo wrestler andonly for that fact can I give art a 10/10.  LOL just kidding XD!   I really though that the art in this anime had a very typical art style but on the other hand, there were things that made it stand out a little more and for that I'll give a 6 for art.\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound - I was very surprised by the songs in this anime.  It really took me off guard and for a show that's known for it's excessive amount of fan service, that's very impressive.  Of coarse the opening is just fricken' hype, but what really took me off guard was the ending songs.  For all 12 of the episodes the endings were different and that mystified me, here's why.  A lot of people don't even listen to the ending songs and it mystifies me that they spent so much detail on the ending songs when that is an apparent fact... maybe thats why there was only 12 episodes.  The opening and ending songs for this anime were very good, but for the OST I can't say the same.  The rest of the OST never added anything to the anime and that is a bit frustrating.  That is why I can say it's almost an outstanding soundtrack, in other words a 9.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - Well.... I'll be honest about the characters.... they were completely non-lovable.  They never provoked any emotion in me and the only time I enjoyed the characters was when I was laughing at them.  That being said, they ARE NOT THE WORST.  When something stupid or funny happened to the characters I found myself laughing my head off, but in reality they still kinda sucked.  Enough said, I'll give character a 5.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - I'm sorry for this but I'm going to be very technical with the term \"story\".  Is the story how an anime depicts it's self, or is it the idea of it's self that is the story.  In this anime I believe the second.  It's completely true that this anime was riddled with bad characters and to much fan service, but technically the story itself was very good.  Now, I know you must be banging your head on a desk right now but hear me out: The subject of zombies in anime is very much avoided in Japan out of respect for the dead and the way Japanese culture is and this anime takes a innovative swing at the subject.  If you tear away the fan service and horrible depiction of this story it becomes something a lot different than what I watched on my screen.  It is not original in western media but in the east that's another story.  I was very entertained when I saw a clash of zombies and Japanese culture and I felt that the story hit the ball out of the park in that way.  It was a very innovative thing for anime in general and now I can see new anime about zombies coming out that are following this trend.  For the story of this anime I would give a 10 but for the poor depiction I can only give it a 9. \\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyement - Since the depiction of this story was very weak I tried not to focus on the story, and when I did that it turned out to be very enjoyable.  It was a lot of fun and I didn't have to exhaust myself by getting into another super hardcore anime; it was very relaxing.  I think that if people watch this anime it should not be to watch seriously.  If you stay relaxed and have fun watching this anime you will love it.  I enjoyed HOTD at a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 8.\\n\\n\r\n*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\\n\\n\r\nCaution:\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has nudity.\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has intense gore.\\n\\n\\n",

The transition from manga to anime went by a lot more smoothly then expected when it comes to anime containing gore and high amounts of fan service. I was expecting a little bit more off the top gore but this series showed more then other animes dare to lately so I give them my gratitude for not watering this down. Only problem I had was that the episode was over in a flash. I thought the voices were very fitting of each characters shown in this episode. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the greatcast in action. If this anime keeps the course it will only get better. Enjoy the anime and don't forget to read the manga if you're left wanting more.",

I say watch the first 2episodes and then make your decision the first one was a little slow but the second one sets the pace and the rhythm for the rest of the anime",

            "content": "At the height of the post-apocalyptic zombie horror phenomenon, Highschool of the Dead happens to be a very relevent anime.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nHighschool of the Dead's story can best be described as half zombie gore and half fan service. This is the story's fatal flaw, the large emphasis on fan service often serves as a distraction from the main plot, it was pointless, when their should have been more focus on the characters. The story takes on a fast pace, however, with the minimal amount of progression in the story the pacing felt offbeat.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe art in Highschool of the Dead was simply breathtaking. The inclusion ofcherry blossoms shedding their flowers was beautiful. The characters were drawn exceptionally well and the zombies looked very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe quality of the sound was very good, one of the best examples can be found in an early episode, that features a teacher dropping a piece of chalk to the ground, that gives off a sound as it shattters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nDue to the excessive amount of fan service, most characters didn't recieve any real development. Takashi, the main protagonist, whilst competent and compassionate, didn't really seem to have any other character quirks and at times I found him to be kind of dull.  As for the female characters, I had a polarizing opinion of some of them. The female characters include: an indecisive sometimes annoying red-head (with big boobs), an annoying, bitchy pink-haired know-it-all (with big boobs), a dumb blonde doctor with tits larger than her brain, and a cute little girl. The one female character who had any sense and was different from your average teen high school girl was Saeko. Saeko was this anime's saving grace in the character department, a sword-wielding badass, she was by far the most interesting and least stereotypical character in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nFor all its flaws, Highschool of the Dead was very entertaining, and despite finding the fan service to be excessive, I found it to be enjoyable at times. This happened to be my first anime, and since rewatching it I still find it to be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead is great for people that are fans of the zombie genre and fan service. It is also great for those first timers out their. Overall it was a decent anime, it had some gripping zombie fighting sequences, and some decent character moments, but I stil feel that had the amount of fan service been limited, and the length had perhaps been slightly longer, it could have been a better anime than it was.",

            "content": "What can I say? A fantastic series...\r\n-[Warning - Some Spoilersl]-\r\nThe story revolves around a number of highschool pupils that find themselves in the middle of a worldwide zombie apocalypse without any word of its cause.  The highschoolers group together and bond with each-other's differences and share each one of their specialities to each other in their bid for survival.  \r\nTakashi Komuro is the main protagonist who is projected to be a 'dropout' in the future however when the zombie up rise he starts to gradually change for the better.  He shows natural talent to be a looked up 'leader' of the groupdisplaying an 'all-round' style of combat particularly with the bat and eventually a shotgun.  The other characters Rei Miyamoto, Saeko Busujima, Kouta Hirano, Saya Takagi and Shizuka Marihawa all show their talent in the group varying from swords, staffs, guns, intellect and medical care.  \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist (besides the zombies) is Shidou Koichi, a creepy teacher obsessed with creating a 'new world' by intimidating followers into 'religous cult' like group.  Despite is overpowering prowess over most of the characters , the main characters can see right through him and show no mercy when pushed.  Since we know what the others have been through in terms of surviving he personally avoids it as much as possible, which explains his scare when Hirano turns on him.   \\n\\n\r\nThe initial objective in the series to go to each of the main character's houses to check on their family and along the way we meet some interesting characters; some psychopaths and some good willed individuals that want help even if they are prone to losing their life.  As it progresses to its conclusion it leaves you in a position that greatly shows its encouragement to show much more.  I think its story is definitely a refreshing idea compared to the conventional idea of a world gone upside down.  Even adding ecchi and comedy moments in a world where all is lost.\\n\\n\r\nMy Review: I gotta say this series got me by the end of the seat.  The first few episodes are pretty serious showing alot of graphic gore of the apocalypse of students from zombies biting them, students hurting others to escape and even betrayal of supposedly solid friendships.  Overtime the series loosens up despite the chao's to show some hinted romance and even comedy moments while maintaining the serious atmosphere from the undead.   The music I thought was a masterpiece, face paced industrial music combined with errie suspense underscores to really drives the story\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not a horror fan (in fact I don't like it), but this series was fantastic and well structured to be an enjoyable series to watch and I pray that a 2nd season will be made.  ++MUST WATCH!++",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime. There are only 12 episodes so it gets to the point and, after watching Elfen Lied (an anime infamous for its \"gore\" which I was unimpressed by), I'm pretty happy. \r\nStory: The story is pretty typical. Students at high school who don't normally interact come together as a united front against a mysterious zombie attack. I didn't realize it was an ecchi before I started watching it, but I've seen ecchi before. It got pretty annoying at times when you'd see shots of panties and boobs would bounce everywhere, but that's what I get for watching ecchi so I'm notupset. Also, the story starts out very strong. The characters get into intense battles with the zombies. You can see every detail in the fights, but it starts to fizzle after awhile.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really enjoyed the art. It was clear, the shading and environments were nicely done and, I have to say, the gore was pretty amazing. I gave it the highest score mostly because of how impressed I was at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was nicely done. They make sure the zombies moan and groan like they are supposed to. The music was haunting and ominous at first(even gave me chills a couple of times), the screams really freak you out at times, but I think they started to tone that down with the action as well. I think they even \"borrowed' the Resident Evil theme song...?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I gave this a Fair score because, while the characters had their own stories, it was mostly bouncing boobs and panty shots. They didn't delve too deep into their pasts or relationships in the sake of ecchi related scenes, but again... its to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. The only reason its not higher is because of the in-your-face ecchi (which got uncomfortable at times) and how the rawness of everything just started to fizzle out as it went on.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone who likes zombies and girls (or girls who can get past the pervertedness like me). It was really well done in my opinion and I definitely think its worth a watch at some point.",

            "content": "You're sitting in school one day, skipping class. Your genius friend comes to berate you for being so stupid, your childhood crush is dating your best friend, your grades aren't great and you don't have much direction in life. In other words, a usual day. Suddenly you see an undead monster bite a teacher, and from there you can see what happens - all Hell breaks loose, literally, and your first instinct is to save your friends who haven't been treating you all that well recently. Now you have to deal with relationship drama and zombies attacking from every angle; fun, right?\r\nHighschool of the Deadis nothing if not simplistic. It has just about every cliche one might expect from a zombie story, so anyone looking for something they have never seen before should look elsewhere. However, it is quite a bit of a breath of fresh air in the anime genre; Western stories are filled with zombie apocalypse scenarios, so much so that one must be exceptional (or a decent comedy) to stand out. Anime, on the other hand, hasn't had the same oversaturation of the zombie genre, so the sort of generic anime antics are applied to what one might think is a worn-out idea to bring about something more interesting than at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nGratuitous ecchi is rampant in Highschool of the Dead. Understandable, as the artist Sh\u014dji Sat\u014d is quite used to drawing for h-doujinshi and the like. Luckily for him, this artstyle of his fits seamlessly into the world of Highschool of the Dead, and Madhouse did quite an impressive job in translating his art to an anime form. As a result, the adaptation is almost panel-for-panel correct, with only a few creative liberties taken by Madhouse, and this is definitely something to be thankful for as there really wasn't anything to change to make it work.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, as I said before, is simplistic to the point of being very predictable. While this might normally be a bad thing, it actually adds some charm to the series for a few reasons. One is as I said above - anime doesn't have zombie stories around too often if at all, so from that perspective there isn't much that can be generic for the genre. Another is that the normalcy is almost welcome in the zombie genre at this point; too many zombie stories have been written recently using irony, over the top comedy, and post-modernism in order to avoid the inherent silliness of a zombie movie. Fortunately one of anime's high points is that it rarely takes itself too seriously unless it really wants to, and on the other side of the spectrum it is almost never afraid to go the whole nine yards with an aspect before giving into the absurdity of it all and attempting to add other unnecessary things such as irony in order to appear more \"edgy.\" Perhaps that is the reason that the entirely normal and reasonably simple storyline of Highschool of the Dead is still very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final reason Highschool of the Dead is an enjoyable addition to anime is that the genre actually does lend itself to things anime rarely sees other than zombies - male protagonists that can stand on their own two feet. Takashi, the main character, begins the story appearing to be a normal dejected anime lead, but as soon as the situation gets serious he takes things into his own hands and begins protecting the people around him without hesitation. He still has some of the issues with girls that most anime characters do, but he doesn't whine about them, he deals with them, and when an issue arises he deals with it himself. The other male lead, Hirano, is another anime stereotype-breaking character. He's overweight, wears glasses, and is a gun freak; being obsessive and overweight almost always makes you absolutely useless in anime. However, he takes his chance to shine and from there becomes one of the biggest offensive forces in the group, as well as earning the respect of even the most judging people around him.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Highschool of the Dead may not be the most original anime ever, and it may not have the best written story. But it is truly entertaining for various reasons, the biggest of these being its uniqueness when considering the plethora of endlessly rehashed anime that appear so often. In this regard, it is definitely worth at least checking out.",

            "content": "Lately, there has been a sudden interest in zombies and multiple TV shows, movies, and novels have been made on this topic. The well-known \u201cHigh school of the Dead\u201d tells a story of a group of high schoolers surviving a zombie outbreak. Because there have been multiple successes with this type of show (ie. The Walking Dead), it grabbed a lot of attention fast. Even though the concept promised success, the result was poor. Outrageous characters, random story development, nonsense back stories, and poorly timed fan service all made the show worse than it should have been.\r\nBut before I criticize it, I\u2019ll start with someof the positive things. Throughout the show, there are small side stories told about the people outside of this high school group. They tend to be more realistic and believable. Because they are realistic, probable situations, they are more interesting to watch than the main story itself. They also manage to evoke emotions and set the mood the show was meant to present. In addition, the animation runs quite smoothly. The fight scenes are exciting and not at all choppy (with the exception of few). Another interesting part of the show is the unique method they chose to present humans. The writers chose to show both light and dark side of humans. Unlike most characters in shows, everyone in HOTD acted like a human. They weren\u2019t always good, and they weren\u2019t always evil. It was able to portray what people would actually do during a crisis.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the positives are out, I will talk about the negatives of the show. I\u2019ll start off with the characters. It seems that characters were created in a way to allow writers to have an easier time explaining situations. This made for characteristics that are ridiculous and over-the-top. This may sound all right, but as the show progresses, their characteristics seem to amplify and become more and more ridiculous. In addition, the backstories that come with the characters are far too unbelievable. From being a daughter of an insanely rich family to being trained by a soldier in the US, they come out of nowhere and expect the viewers to comprehend them. The overall story is not much better. Every time they are stuck in a sticky situation, something miraculous occurs to help them out. Every solution is too convenient, ending up making the whole scene anticlimactic. The final, most obvious, mistake of the show is the timing of fan service. Fan service can be found in most anime so it is expected. But intentionally showing them in the middle of an intense scene takes away the seriousness of the situation. I am not necessarily saying that fan service ruined the show and there shouldn\u2019t be any, but the timing producers chose to put them in is just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone. There are some interesting side stories, but that one factor cannot redeem other failing parts of the show. HOTD is simply not worth the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(When I talk about this with my friends, they all say it is an anime and it is expected to be ridiculous. I do not have a problem with ridiculous shows, but I believe when a show starts out with the intention of being realistic, they should stick with it.)\\n",

HOTD had that perfect blend of gore and ecchi, that a lot of people enjoy. I really hope they reboot the anime or create a second season but sadly, I don't think that will happen. This is one of the anime that I consider people to watch.\r\n[What I disliked]\r\nThe Downside to this anime are the characters I thought that the characters were very stereotypical and weren't very original.\r\n[Recommendation]\\n\r\nIf you enjoy this anime I suggest you go play Lollipop Chainsaw or Dead Rising because this anime really has a lot of things in common with those games.\\n\\n\r\nOR....\\n\\n\r\nGo watch Attack On Titan or High School DxD because those anime's are the only two that come to the top of my head that are similar.\\n\\n\r\nP.S this is my first-ish Review",

He's not too wimpy or too stupid and all his actions are realistic yet admirable.

The show goes out of its way to give us panty-shots, even if they have to follow the corse of a bullet as it zooms between a girls legs, then between anothers boobs... just gives us that up close and personal feel. Or putting a gun on a girls chest so that the kick from it has to jiggle her boobs(this givesus the funniest line from the show though, \"my boobs are killing me becaue you used them to balance an ak-47!) Or putting the girls in white tops, and then driving a vehicle into the river! I mean im all for meaningless camera time spent on boobs, but cmon isnt this a bit much... nah.\\n\r\n   Sure there is alot of action and adventure and stuff too... action in a bathtub, and adventure into a girls blouse... In all seriousness though, theres a good fair bit of fight scenes, and the story itself is fairly interesting, it keeps you interested at least.

The characters themselves actually have far more depth than i would have figured on when i started watching, and the animation is wonderful!\\n\r\n  I say that this is my favorite anime to date(thats really saying alot) heres how intrigued i was by it, i went online and watched the first 3 minutes of episode one and before i knew it, I had placed an order for it on Amazon. So yeah, really good, cant wait for season 2.",

            "content": "High school of the dead is pure Hollywood which is a good and bad. The anime is filled with fan service, gore, and extreme situations which makes ever episode pretty damn cool a bit like Hollywood movies which are usually senseless but cool to watch. Your not going fall asleep watching HOTD your actually going to be drawn in by the very first episode. Each episode is morally twisted where characters are faced with crippling decision for example decisions like 'should i ditch my friend to die and live or should i help them'.\r\nI wont lie, this show is primarily trying to get viewers throughechi meaning its filled with half naked girls. On top of the girls you have blood thirsty zombies who can turn others into zombies if they happen to bite you.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nOur lead character is Takashi a boring teen age dude who gets lucky to be stuck with a bunch of Hot teenage school girls. Along with takashi, you have Hirano who has a fetish for guns, then you have Busujima a kendo master, Rai a spear girl, a nurse and other females who have different talents. A cool thing about the anime is seeing how the girls use their very different skills to survive. \\n\\n\r\nThe story goes as a virus breaks out, people start to become zombies everywhere taking over japan. A group of students fight their way through hoards of zombies which are now crawling all over their school. Now this groups of teens has to mature fast and learn to adopt to this new ugly world where Men are becoming zombies and others are becoming insane. The story does a good job in showing what human society becomes like when chaos devours society.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has probably been done before but i find it actually refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\r\nGood and Good\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nA little bit annoying at times, this is one of those animes where the girls are confident and strong while the guys are cowards and weak, so its kinda hard to root for the male characters. ON the other hand the female characters are pretty cool. Each is different and funny in their own way. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nGreat anime if you just want to have fun!!! HOTD is for anyone that simply wants to see a good zombie based story line. I also recommend the manga which is just as good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Highschool of the Dead is an anime inspired by the manga of the same name containing ecchi and horror elements, launched in 2010 by Madhouse studio (the same as Death Note and Devil May Cry), with 12 episodes and a short OVA. In the plot, a sudden zombie outbreak begins to ravage the world where Komuro Takashi and other students (Miyamoto King, Takagi Saya, Hirano Kouta and Busujima Saeko) and Marikawa Shizuka nurse will have to confront the plague together and surviving initially to a escape from the devastated school. As the situation worsens, this group will witness the collapse of society, the outbreak ofother survivors and the breakdown of the old moral values.\\n\\n\r\nH.O.T.D. awakens the attention and interest not by ecchi elements (the \"sensuality\"), but the theme involving the popular zombies, of course, because even the manga and anime have joined this trend. Adhering some pretty classic clich\u00e9s and relying on some elements themselves, creating a story not very unique compared to productions that include zombies and similar creatures, but well traveled and very interesting and varied characters, without a little freshness and centered, ie without much freshness. It is a heavy and a lot of blood anime.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying a small group of characters, and the relatively small number of episodes (remember my theory that most short animes are good), we have a more efficient contact with this story. Of course there is not enough room to deepen with each of the main characters, but did their best without making it tedious, long or too intimate, however, focuses clearly on Komuro Takashi, who unintentionally ends up playing the leading role the group, which incidentally is well composed. No one but the little Alice, is helpless, let alone Kouta, the chubby team, which specializes in firearms.\\n\\n\r\nYes, lightly following the Harem, there is romantic tension between much of the female members and the young protagonist, and even being heavy and full of action, does not give up a dose of humor to relieve tension. It is a story of survival in an interesting format, not resembling the popular American series The Walking Dead, but with elements that slightly resemble games like Resident Evil, Lef 4 Dead and Dead Island. Although not mention any specific title, HOTD makes it clear that has inspirations in zombie films released by Hollywood, even not playing or parodying a scene from a particular movie, at least apparently.\\n\\n\r\nI do not deny, it is a violent anime, however, if they so demand is best to try Mirai Nikki. Also do not expect a high dosage of terror. Honestly, it's another shonen action, horror almost confined to violent deaths and zombies, that is, does not even scare. There is a good tension, not deny, but it is the least that can be required in this case. I also do not deny that a few times and a half absurd elements, however, which can be relevados, one of them is that each episode (or act) has the DEAD word in the title. As I said, I note that in most cases can be relevados, but others generate a certain gap when not to generate mood.\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead (yes, now I did not use the abbreviation) follows much the line of ecchi, ie breasts and panties whenever possible, but not distracting nor blurs both the story presented. Not a anime distasteful, as I myself have thought being, however, is not the kind that pleases everyone, but it quite apena watch and still get a taste of \"I want more\". No, it's not an anime that stands out too much or that ooze creativity, however, can engage the viewer and arouse our sympathy with his young characters in search of survival. Anyone who has watched several films, series and other stories involving zombie apocalypse will not be impressed, and this is an unfortunate truth about Highschool of the Dead.",

            "content": "The Written Review of my Video Review of Highschool of the Dead\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nHighschool of the Dead has a rather basic, typical Zombie romp storyline. It starts off as a normal day in the life of Takashi Komuro just casually skipping class, when he notices an incident happening at the school's front gate. Immediately after a few teachers get killed, he goes onto warn his friends there something going on, they grab a few weapons and zombies overrun the school, in a matter of minutes.\r\nAlong the way we meet a few other survivors, and they decide the best way to survive a zombie apocalypse iswork together. They, all together, this merry group of misfits decide to go back into the city, check on the their families and improvise from there, while rescuing survivors in need of help along of the way. It\u2019s really basic, don\u2019t expect anything complicated, although they do establish is it better to travel with a few people or lots of people, which became an interesting plot in itself, but it happened very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to elaborate on the story, it\u2019s a bunch of people just trying to survive by getting from point A to point B. The problem I have with the story. Spoiler Alert. Like a typical zombie flick or horror flicks, the ending is left opened, so it makes you watching this feel, kind of cheated.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are seven characters who make up the band of survivors. \\n\r\nTakashi Komuro, was a typical laid back high school student, until the zombie outbreak happened. Where becomes a leader character, leading his group through the zombie apocalypse by any means necessary. From the very start it shown he has feelings for Rei Miyamoto, so he tries of course save the one he loves, but as the series progress he starts to get along with everyone else in the group. What I do like about his character, is isn\u2019t overpowered, he comes off as second best when it comes to close and long range combat. However he is that person who is willing to step up to the plate, when called for, trying to be the hero, while surviving the apocalypse and his harem. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Harems.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Rei Miyamoto, tsundere number 1, plays the role of Takashi\u2019s child friend and main love interest. She comes off as the person who tries to help, but usually becomes the one who needs saving, although she can fight, Takashi always seems to help her in some way. She is rather selfish always bringing something up that annoys Takashi, when he is suffering just as much as she is. Her main choice of a weapon are spear like weapons, as she was part Sojutsu club. Throughout the series, all she really does is interact with Takashi, and really relies on him to pull through.\\n\\n\r\nTsundere number 2 is Saya Takagi, the brains of the group. She is the most stubborn and arrogant member of the group, because of her intellectuality. She usually doesn\u2019t fight, but however she does use her brains to strategize for the group. She is usually seen criticising Kohta, however grows respect for him over time. She is the megane of Takashi\u2019s harem.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s throw in a teacher/school nurse to Takashi\u2019s harem. Shizuka Marikawa. Despite being the only adult in the group, she is rather ditzy and becomes completely oblivious to her surroundings often not helping out, and being rather useless. Oh wait, she drives for them. She\u2019s not all useless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly of our harem, is the badass of the group, Saeko Busujima, who uses a wooden sword. She is the most reliable fighter of the group, because of her combat skills, also she\u2019s cool, calm and collect. Saeko kind of serves as the protective big sister for everyone, who also has it out for Takashi. She is given an interesting back story, as she does have something that contrasts the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nEvery group needs a child character, so Alice Maresato fills that role. As the hope of innocence in the world. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we have, ourselves, representing Otaku\u2019s everywhere, Kohta Hirano. Despite looking like a typical stereotypical fat useless nerd, he is sort of a badass. Give him a gun, and he\u2019ll headshot for days. Because of his appearance he is kind of mistreated in the group, especially by Saya, who he seems to have a crush on saving her numerous time, but not getting lucky.\\n\\n\r\nNow one problem of the anime is the lack of proper character development. There isn\u2019t enough interactions between the characters to keep it interesting. They all kind of just accept who they are, and immediately trust each other in battles. Another thing I have a problem is after literally episode 2, the main survivors have turned from ordinary day people into, professional zombie killers, like they seen a zombie movie before. Oh wait they did establish they\u2019ve seen zombie movies. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the elephant out of the room. Highschool of the Dead has an obvious thing for fan service. It\u2019s everywhere in your face, big breast that seem to have a physics engine itself, a lot of panty shots and shots around the chest area, even when it\u2019s not even need. Groping and let\u2019s not forget the full fan service episode 6 and OVA. Every female character, except Alice, has big tits, and you wonder how do these girls move so well while carrying that. I wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a girl.\\n\\n\r\nBut aside from the overflow of fan service, the anime actually has really good, over the top zany action sequences. It\u2019s so out there, it is really entertaining to watch. It\u2019s well animated, and moves smoothly, even when scenes really out there. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the fan service is just way to much sometime, and really takes away some of the drama or serious scenes in the anime. It\u2019s also kind of disturbing at times. It\u2019s kind of obvious the anime doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously with the overabundance of fan service in your face. Just look at the opening song.\t \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws with its rather basic storytelling, and lacking in character development, it is I say enjoyable. There\u2019s just something about the zombie genre, that I like. I think it has to do with the action scene and how they kill zombies in different creative ways, which they don\u2019t use overpowered weapons of some sort, and how they work together to do some of the killings. Yes there is a lot of fan service, and if you love fan service, you\u2019re going to love Highschool of the Dead, if you don\u2019t and get easily offended by that sort of thing, you\u2019re not going to love it. If you\u2019re looking for a zombie romp, Highschool of the Dead plays it really well in terms of typical zombie storyline and characters. I did liked it because of some of the fun action scenes in the anime, and I must admit, being a guy, I did enjoy some fan service here and there, but not all the time. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead, does a great job in following the zombie genre. It does a good job of gripping you to see which survivors will survive and which will not, and there is small character development, but not enough to make the characters that interesting and likeable. It\u2019s well animated, even though some of the fan service does really get in the way. I\u2019m going to give Highschool of the Dead a 7/10. Despite its basic premise, it does a really good job at executing a typical zombie romp. It\u2019s fun to watch, even though the fan service can get overused.\\n\\n",

While there is frequent and blatant fan service, there are themes presented that are very identifiable.\r\nFor starters, HOTD is one of the few high school geared animes that capitalizes on the irony of its protagonists being high school students. This irony is exploited to its fullest in a dramatic fashion that binds itself to the plot.\r\nSecondly, the \"who will MC-kun choose\" conflict is resolved within the first season. The fact that this show chooses a path and sticks to it makes this show stand above any harem comedy/drama/dramaedy I've seen to date. If you wantromantic development, HOTD is the only harem anime that delivers outside of School Days.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the show does not revolve around the protagonist. There are frequent intersections between main and sub plots that leave any viewer guessing as to what will happen on their first viewing.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on for days, but it boils down to this: DO NOT LET THE ECCHI CONTENT AND BAD RAP OF THIS ANIME MAKE YOU THINK IT LACKS DEPTH. It seems that most people who review this anime just jumped on the Hate Train. There is seriously a lot to appreciate here, and that comes from someone who has watched hundred of hours of anime in the same and similar genres.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot believe this show never got the second season it deserved when you have shows like Infinite Stratos becoming best sellers. Seriously, Angel Beats barely manages to develop deeper characters in much more time, and you can't tell me that AB isn't riddled with fan service. That being said, HOTD goes way overboard with the ecchi. It distracts from the good writing in a bad way.",

The colorful animation, simple yet interesting story, the blood and guts, and the hot anime babes are something that make this show very enjoyable.\r\nI would like to say that HOTD gets hated on by the dumbest reasons. Many people who've seen this show simply give it crap because of the fanservice. I find this to be pointless because it's a damn ecchi anime, what are you expecting? If your not into anime with tits and ass then look elsewhere because that's what anecchi anime like HOTD is all about.\\n\\n\r\nIn HOTD we a very simple story of a group of teenagers surviving the worldwide zombie outbreak. I'm giving HOTD credit for being the first anime to go with the zombie outbreak story unlike other shows. Idk if any other anime have done this type of story but HOTD seems to be the most well known zombie anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all different in personality and looks (except for boob size I guess) but the girls are all sexy, and even badass at times. Even the male characters Takashi and Kota are pretty cool dudes that just want to make it out alive with some hot girls while their at it ;) Saeko Bushijima is still one of the greatest female characters in any anime I've seen, for her good looks and awesome katana wielding skills. It's the perfect woman!\\n\\n\r\nSadly this series seems like it will never get a proper ending, since the manga has been on a hiatus forever, and the anime still hasn't gotten a second season even after multiple reports and rumors.\\n\\n\r\nIf want an anime with fanservice, bloody moments, and a simple yet cool story then give HOTD a watch because it's one of my favorites to this day.",

Sorry that it's short.\r\nStory: So far only four episodes in it's not safe to judge, but overall the story is progressing at a great rate leaving me never bored, but also never questioning (okay except the \"Where did zombies come from?\" thing but that I don't expect to know.) This seems like what would really happen in a zombie apocalypse, so they're hitting the story dead on. If I have to critic it then that would be on the overall cliche feeling of it. 9/10\r\nArt: This is top notch. I heard they have a nice sized animation budget. Ithas to 2006+ feel to it. The fight scenes are fluid and smooth. They give an awesome actiony feel to it. The backgrounds are splendid and it's overall very good. A downside, way to much fan service. The first two episodes we're really bad, but these last two have seemed to be a little better. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay it falls a bit short here. The OP is pretty good, and I like how they animated to the song. I don't care for the ED. The OST music is... okay, some anime have a lot better but this one isn't bad. The voice acting is.. Well I say it's pretty good, I don't like the nurses voice acting but it does fit her character. I'm not that keen of Japanese voice acting though. I don't speak it. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I like watching how this is going. They are acting like how you an I would act (well maybe, you might just get eaten.) I can connect to them in a way. Of course I'll chose flight over fight in this situation (being a tracuer and all) but it feels right, like they're real people. Well almost at least. The romance is a bit meh, almost like they felt they had to put it in there but didn't want to. I guess it's not horrible though. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Of course this section is very varied for each person. I have been enjoying this anime and anticipating it's next episode through the whole week only to get drawn in even more since episode one aired. I've always been a fan of zombie survival things. Friends and I spend hours talking about what we'd do in a zombie apocalypse. To top it off these are my zombies, they fit every aspect. I'm not a major fan of the fan service as I said, it's more distracting than anything. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is doing what it set out to. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind violence, gore, or fan service.\\n\r\n41/50\\n\r\n8.2/10\\n",

            "content": "As popular as zombies have been over the last decade, you might expect to find at least a few anime about a zombie apocalypse. But aside from some vampire-themed series where zombies (or ghouls) play a supporting role (Hellsing, Blood+), there hasn\u2019t really been one about people trying to survive hordes of the living dead, until now. While Highschool of the Dead is standard fare as far as zombie stories go, it\u2019s also the first anime of its kind, well-made, and tons of fun.\r\nIt\u2019s also fast-paced and occasionally terrifying. Within the first ten minutes, the story shifts from the calm of everyday life to zombiemadness. And by focusing on the students\u2019 mental states as they realize what\u2019s happening and desperately try to escape, the first episode delivers one of the scariest moments of any anime (extra points if you\u2019re afraid of zombies like me). This is the rare true horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the series is far less frightening but no less engaging. By the second episode, it becomes clear that the zombies, while innumerable and deadly, are also slow and feebleminded, and our main characters are badasses, wielding swords, bats, drills, nail guns, and basically anything they can their hands on to beat some zombie ass.\\n\\n\r\nWith the zombies losing their ability to invoke fear, the story shifts to developing the cast and plot, following the group as they escape the school and seek refuge amidst the chaos. What fear remains comes from the suspense of not knowing what will happen next. Occasionally the focus turns to events elsewhere in the world \u2014 Washington, D.C. burning, or a reporter signing off from the news for the last time \u2014 that add to the sense of global despair. The story also intermittently considers larger issues like quarantine, citizen unrest, and anarchy, and how they might play out during a zombie outbreak. The main characters are cliches, but they\u2019re cliches done right \u2014 each one is likable, and each has a useful part in the story. Above all, Highschool of the Dead is simply fun, with a great balance of fright, action, humor, romance, and (yes even) fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series falls short is not really in dispute. This is a show that is unabashedly about three things: zombies, tits, and ass. It\u2019s a standard horror story that falls into the standard horror story pitfalls, all while flashing bras and panties in increasingly novel ways (at one point, someone shoots a bullet at a zombie, which passes between Saeko\u2019s bouncing tits as she does a samurai leap through the air). And so there are plenty of stupid decisions and unfortunate coincidences to keep the zombies threatening and the plot going, as well as loads of fanservice shots that will alienate some people. Even if you aren\u2019t bothered by the fanservice and consider it a welcome distraction, episode 6 is pure soft-core porn that will only appeal to those horned-up teenagers who are watching for that moment. Most problematically, the series is incomplete. While the recent resumption of the manga is promising, for three years and counting the anime has been an unfinished product, and given its relative lack of success in Japan, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\\n\\n\r\nSetbacks in story aside, Highschool of the Dead\u2018s animation is gorgeous, especially the scenery. This creates an interesting contrast between the often awe-inspiring backdrops and the carnage taking place in the foreground, cherry-blossoms fluttering in the wind as someone is ripped to shreds. The animation also excels in the action and ecchi scenes, which manage to capture every detail, be it a bat crashing down on the head of the zombie or a boob jiggling as a girl runs for her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, by contrast, is so-so. The orchestral pieces are completely forgettable, but the J-Rock OP and ED songs are excellent, and the use of a different song from Kurosaki Maon for each ending is refreshing. The English voice cast is great, with noteworthy performances by lesser-known actors Leraldo Anzaldua (Takashi) and Maggie Flecknoe (Saya), but the dub has some disappointing edits, making gratuitous use of profanity (\u201cFuckin A\u201d) and pop culture references that are clearly meant to add to the \u201ccool/fun\u201d factor but come across as trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever your views on zombies, ecchi, or gratuitous fanservice, Highschool of the Dead is an important series. It fills a void that desperately needed filling and does a nice job at it, featuring strong production values and direction that results in one of the few truly frightening yet still enjoyable anime. While the common criticisms are entirely warranted, they don\u2019t change the fact that the series is the only zombie epidemic anime around and, even for many of its detractors, one hell of a fun show.",

            "content": "Zombies, boobs, and more zombies. What more can really be said about Highschool of the Dead? I have to say, though, HotD did it better than I expected it to.\r\nStory: 5\r\nNot much in terms of story. Immediately from the start, we have zombies (for unknown reasons) out to eat a bunch of people. Other than that, it is just the characters running around and surviving. What is interesting to watch is their interactions within their group and with people outside it. Even though most zombie shows or games have done it, it is intriguing to see the casts' morals come into play in various situationspitted against them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation in HotD is superb. The action scenes are well-detailed, as for the fan service too. Now, I'm not a big fan of fan service, but I can't deny that every boob-bounce is animated extremely well. Other than a couple of awkward CG moments and mobs of zombies being animated lazily, (can't really blame since animating hundreds of zombies on-screen is surely a pain and money-sink) one could tell that time and care was taken into the actual animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nWow. 12 ED's. That's a lot. Honestly, the sound effects, voices, or the music never captivated me, but that's not to say that it wasn't bad. It just wasn't memorable. As far as I can tell, nothing sounded awkward or out-of-place. The casts' voices matched up with the characters they portrayed, and the music fit in just fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nMeh. All the characters were just... meh. I mean, it is hard to develop any of them in 12 episodes. The strengths are the interactions between them and their zombie-infested world, not the characters themselves. Out of all of them, Kouta is the most interesting with the lead, Takashi, being the least. Every other characters' main purpose is fan service, albeit the girls do have more unique characterizations than most other female anime characters whose sole purpose is to give the male audience a boner.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe big selling point of HotD is the excitement and suspension it brings. There are scenes that will make you sit forward in your seat. I found that my eyes were fixated on the screen at all times with no intention of giving my attention to anything else. The amount of fan service being shown feels like it should be overbearing, but, strangely enough, it isn't. The anime is meant to be for mature audiences anyways. There is also an extremely healthy amount of action that is choreographed exceptionally well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nHotD is an anime that is meant to be enjoyed. It is not an anime with a powerful theme assisted by symbolic references or motifs. It is anime that captures your attention with zombies, fan service, and beautifully animated and choreographed action scenes. My advice, when you are done watching that highly-acclaimed anime about mankind vs. nature, give HotD a watch. It will excite you to the end without having to think too hard.",

(Although if you don't like much blood and brutality - rather DON'T.)\r\nAfter this two episodes it goes worse and worse and evetually becomes much less interesting. There are many many stereotypical ideas, so much dumb but not funny ecchi that it's boring sometimes, often lack of logic, so unreal and unlogical actions that it begins to hurt eventually and (SPOILER:)I counted on some interesting not-the-same-as-in-all-zombie-movies ending at least, but there's practically no story ending at all.

On the other hand main characters relations - wich are more important - are often unlogical, unexplained and left in the middle of their evolution.\\n\r\nArt and animation: are pretty.\\n\r\nSound: You can't complain.\\n\r\nCaharacters: are in my opinion strong side of this anime.

It was an enjoyable and very nice watch but by the time I finished it, I was kind of disappointed. Let me tell you why:\r\nIt started off with a bang. Immediate zombie killing action. It grabbed me and had me wanting more. I had high hopes this could go on to be one of my all time favourites. This wasn't the case, unfortunately 'fanservice' reared it's head. There was even a whole episode,in a short anime at that, dedicated to fanservice. In the middle few episodes, it was fanservice and more fanservice. The anime was in danger of falling very low. Luckily, it managed to pick up again.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA group of high school students frantically escaping zombies using swords and bats? Oh the potential! The story showed a lot of promise  but because of the middle episodes, it was like the story had run out of time. Maybe if the series was longer, the story could have been great but the sort of rushed vibe I got from the last few episodes means it was decent, not epic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was fabulous. The zombies were designed perfectly and the characters looked very sharp and were well defined. The backgrounds were very nicely defined and the art was really excellent. Though the breasts were excessively large lol\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRealistic sounds when the zombies had their heads bashed in. Very nice ending themes...... the opening was EPIC! I loved it and still have the full version on my ipod. The sound really added to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMixed bag. Takashi and Kouta were great. I really liked their characters and they seemed kinda badass when they fought. The girls...... meh. Takagi annoyed me with how she treated Kouta, Shizuka was fun at first but then grated me a bit, Rei was awesome at first but then kinda turned pointless towards the end. Though her relationship with the creepy teacher was  interesting. Saeko was good. She would have been one of my favourites if it wasn't for the whole, 'fighting turns me on' thing. Takagi's parents were kinda cool, liked them. The teacher I hated. He actually seemed like a complete bastard. All in all, a mixed bag.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I gave it a good score. The art, sound, the fights, the enjoyment factor, were all plus points. The sad thing is that the excessive fanservice means that instead of being a 'Masterpiece', this anime is just very good.",

And for GODS SAKE! what's wrong with ecchi and sex?  Not everything needs to be a Masterpiece to be entertaining.\r\nNow granted the gargantuan boobs on the nurse were over-the-top.  If you've ever seen someone like this in real life you'd find that they're not all that attractive (or at least to me and most of the mature males I know.)  Still, to each their own.\r\nWhat absolutely blows me away is that this series was dropped afterone 12 episode season.  What happens after the escape from the mansion?  When does \"Otoku Boy\" lose it and start shooting the undead?  And of course the big question; When do the girls start pulling each others hair out in an all-out cat fight over Takashi?\\n\\n\r\nI would like to see a continuation of this series, but also possibly a strong ecchi or perhaps even a soft-core hentai version.",

            "content": "High School of the Dead is an anime that I recommend for teens. I say that because of the constant gore, ecchi, and profanity.\r\nHigh School of the Dead is fairly new, and 12 episodes. I enjoyed this anime, but some parts weren't so good. Too much fan service in my opinion. I can't say I expected any less from a zombie anime, but still.\r\nI watched it while it was still in subs, as the dubs of it are new. The voice acting is great on both parts, but the Japanese version is still my favorite. \r\nThe anime revolves around teens who have survived a zombieattack. Beginning at their school, and spreading further throughout Japan and the world. Takashi, the main character, begins to the animes opening, and like most animes, there isn't a single episode without him. He although is amazing, and cool, he seems like a player. You'll find out why. Although it consists mainly of teens, Saeko manages to save the Nurse after a brave student puts himself in front of her to protect the nurse. There is also some other adult characters, but they come in later.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime/mangas where it takes place in ONLY Japan, this anime shows more. It shows America, for a while with the president.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, this anime has a weird starter as the reporters say 2 million have been taken over, they fail to realize that Japan has about 100 million people living there ALONE. So basically, it isn't as much as you think.\\n\\n\r\nHOTD also has some pretty stupid people. Like in, I believe, episode 6, many people are along the bridge, but one woman's child has been bitten. She tries to save it, but, it bits her in the neck( hence a pun, kids are a pain in the neck). Plus, the police must think:\\n\r\n\"Anyone who tries to leave will be shot! That way people will calm down!\"\\n\\n\r\nSeriously. It was stupid.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to the story. This plot line has been overused I admit, with the sex scenes and zombies. But it IS well put together and actually makes sense.I can't express how much an service there is, and I swear it can get BORDERLINE Hentai. So I don't recommend it to little kids. Plus all the violence and gore may give them nightmares.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished this anime, I had a dream where my school was taken over by zombies and a few of my friends survived. I loved the dream, but it was well gory and violent.\\n\\n\r\nSo beware of dreams based on HOTD\\n\\n\r\nI gave the characters a 6, because the characters were pretty much used up. From others animes or movie. The originality didn't show very well.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should wrap this up. So bottomline; it's a great anime despite it's many flaws, and I recommend it to teens and older.  This anime was given an overall 7 by me. Enjoy this anime/manga!",

            "content": "Highschool of the dead.. This revolves on the group of individuals who are trying to survive the Hell out of the undead zombies.. Just like Resident Evil.. This anime adaptation is surely not completed as the things in the manga are still on a roll. (Thought for some unknown reasons, there are still no updates for the latest chapter.)\r\nGoing back in the series. This a harem type of anime.. Not only that, it has a lot of fan service because the girls have a huge breasts.. If you are the main character Takashi, you will feel that you are in heaven even though the realitystates that you are  in hell. Every straight guy will definitely enjoy this series..\\n\\n\r\nOk.. Here are my thoughts..\\n\\n\r\nStory (8)\\n\r\nBelieve me but I watched this series primarily because of the story.. The story is great.. zombie apocalypse. The story also shows how morals decay especially when you are in chaos.. You can say that the one thing that is interesting in the series, aside form the fan service, is the problems on public morals, panic and of course the zombies.. One example of the decaying morals shows a character named Koichi (the teacher) that built a somewhat cult that behaves abnormally.. I can say that it sparked my interest..\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nNo doubt about it.. The animation is so good that I can say that I 'm gonna fall in love with the girls.. The sex appeal can be seen in each artwork.. Also, the animation is great.. It has a cinematic feel for me.. Also, it has good graphics..\\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nI'm referring to the opening theme.. I'm addicted to it.. It gets you in the mood.. especially the guitar riff at the beginning of the OST.. Also, try listening to the full version and you can hear the awesomeness of that riff..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10)\\n\r\nEach character is good.. They have their own back stories.. They have different personalities.. But my most favorite character is Saeko Busujima.. Why? She is beautiful, brave, charming but deep inside there is a Sadist side within her which makes her very deadly.. I honestly felt that she is very hot... (Excuse for me that..) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nThis is FAN SERVICE!! The breast is in the air.. The fan service was so great that my relatives thought that I'm watching H anime.. I told them of course that this series is clean.. I really enjoyed this series.. This fan service is definitely an attracting factor to other Real Guys to watch this.. Aside from that, this is a Harem.. lots of girls..\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nI think that this series marked to others as a Fan Service anime.. But, looking in the story of it, it's good and interesting.. One more thing, I hate zombies..\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading..\\n\\n\r\nLightningSnow :)",

            "content": "Boobies... Yes... O:\r\nHighschool of the Dead is set in the present day 2010 Japan, beginning as the world is struck by a deadly pandemic that turns humans into zombies, euphemistically referred to by the main characters as \"Them\" \r\nThe story follows a group of high school students, the high school's nurse, and a young girl as they fight their way to safety through the deadly streets of Japan during a worldwide catastrophic event known as the \"Outbreak\". As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse, they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors, and thepossible decay of their own moral codes.\\n\\n\r\nMix all that together and you get an overly-sexualised and wonderfully violent production -- beautifully presented and horrific, even if it doesn\u2019t, in its component parts, contain a single original element. And far be it from me to wonder if the ratio of zombie decapitations to shots of the lead girl\u2019s underwear is a solid 1:1. (I've always believed movies should contain at least two decapitations for every shot of naked under-lady.)\\n\\n\r\nBetter to start off with the \\n\r\nOver all which I'd give 10/10\\n\r\nWe've got an assembly of people who rely on each other for survival, in a world crawling with danger. And overall, it's a pretty good show.\\n\r\nAmidst the incredibly overwhelming fan service, there's a lot of great stuff going on in HOTD. There's good action, there's some small romance, there's comedy, there's suspense and there's the reality of the situation in that the characters portrayed aren't really all that special outside their role in the group. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 O:\\n\r\nThat's not to say you can't enjoy anyone else, Kouta just elevates it to be really enjoyable.There is enough action to make it enjoyable on that aspect alone, but I really feel like Kouta saves the show from being a big flop. He's not the main character, nor is he the most important, but he's there as some comic relief, as well as an integral part of the main cast. You'll find yourself enjoying this show overall, and when you look back, you'll find most of the best parts involved Kouta getting a nosebleed, getting all excited over a weapon, or shooting zombies in the head with a nail gun.Some how dislike fan service anime. You have to give me more than some panties and bras to make me want to watch a show. Thankfully, HOTD realized this.\\n\\n\r\nSounds is 9/10\\n\r\nSome really didn't fit the scene or some episodes.But what I can tell you is that what they're doing sound-wise in the show works. Where they choose to put music blends so well you won't be able to distinguish it from the animation. Where there is no music, it adds a suspenseful effect to help bring you the realization that we're in a zombie-infested wasteland of a city. So the sound department is definitely solid. HOTD has no characters whose voices don't suit them, and the voice acting is well performed. The drone of zombies does it's job. To be honest, I haven't really noticed background music in the episodes during action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt  10/10\\n\r\nthey made sure that boobs would jiggle at every opportunity. So there's a good framerate going, and crisp clean artwork.Just putting that out there. The animation is clear, it's well done, and it's eye-catching. The way they animate action scenes is high quality stuff.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters would be 10/10\\n\r\nHOTD revolves around only 3 of the 6 main characters, and the only thing bringing it up from mediocre to fair (5 to 6) is our Macgyver. Kouta is not only epic and awesome in his practical knowledge, he's wonderfully written, funny, and someone our inner otaku can relate to.\\n\r\nWe've got a clumsy nurse, an egotistical girl, a somewhat selfish and reliant girl, a strong girl displaying leadership qualities, and the male leader. But most of that can be summed up as such. \" We have 4 pairs of breasts, one is useful, a typical male lead. I don't mean to demean it or anything, but the other characters get so bogged down in fan service that you could seriously give them any archetype and the show wouldn't be much different.\\n\r\nHere are some boobs, sometimes they show butts too. Honestly, character is underdeveloped in HOTD. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, High School of the Dead has actually been very enjoyable overall.  \\n\\n\r\nReally though. Its an equal disturbution of ecchi and zombies.\\n\r\nSome boobies and some zombie won't be that bad will it? :O :P\\n",

            "content": "HOTD had the potential to make my top ten of anime with plot alone, but several characteristics of this particular anime caused it to fall down on the ratings for me.\r\nStory: (10)\r\nA zombie apocalypse occurs and several high school students and their school nurse are doing their best to survive the global pandemic. THIS IS AN AWESOME PLOT! My goodness I've been waiting for them to do a zombie apocalypse anime forever! On the other hand, this is a harem anime so there are of course multiple girls fighting over the same heroic guy who is just trying to keep everyone alive. I'm not muchfor harems myself, but you know what? There are freaking zombies so I watched it all the way through!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: (8)\\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs were catchy and addicting, so I didn't feel the need to fast forward through the opening.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (6.5)\\n\r\nGranted some of you who have watched this may be going \"WHAT! The art was amazing!\" Yes, I do not doubt this for a second. The zombies were kick-ass! As were the guns, scenery, blood, guts, character expressions, etc. Only one thing got me off of the fan bus for the art and that was: the ever present, impossibly huge, exaggerated movements of the breasts! My goodness people I mean these things were... I rest my case. If you've seen HOTD you know what I'm talking about. Then again, maybe it's because I'm a girl and actually have a pair that I can be irritated by them. At ease men! Enjoy the exaggerations as I continue my review.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9) \\n\r\nThe individual character development was decent. The connection between the main character and his complicated relationship with one of the females is explained, and they continue on blah blah blah. What I really liked was that each character really was different in personality. Sure it's a harem so the girls all like the same guy, but what's great is that: that is the only thing they have in common! One of the best characters is a total nerd that turns bad ass once the apocalypse starts and isn't the least bit hesitant on doing what needs to be done. Some might say that makes him kind of psycho, but he still gets along well with others and the group and is out for the protection of the people he is with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ Overall: (7)\\n\r\nSeriously if it weren't for the constant need for nudity and giant breasts then this would've made my top then. Other than that, this anime was pretty good and i do suggest it to my guy friends.\\n\r\nHope you found my review helpful!",

My only real criticism is that I'm not sure that the screenwriter knew why you want to watch it, resulting in some legitimately grim moments which are a bit discordant with the overarching theme of \"boobs are fun!\"\r\nI think it's worth noting that overall HotD does a pretty good job of recognizing the difference between objectification and titillation, treating most female characters as humans with breasts as opposed to breasts with attached humans.  It does spendan awful lot of time focussing on the breast end of the equation, but I hope I might be forgiven for being at peace with that.",

The first thing I will tell you all is to watch it.  I don't care how you do it, burn it, borrow it, steal it, and when you do you will be hooked.\r\nStory 8: Only one episode into this series but it seems like a basic zombie survivor show but with what seems like underlying subplot for the other characters involved.  As the series go on the story could become much more intriguing dependingon where the story goes from its original generic zombie plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10:  To my eyes I enjoy the way it looks.  There is a good amount of detail involved, and the colors are bright and vibrant.  This series is very pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9:  Nothing like the sound of a baseball bat whizzing through the air just before it crashes on the skull of some zombie student.  It is japanese audio which I love to hear and the voice acting is spot on.  I can really hear the fear and the pain in these characters voices.  In all I love the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:  Haven't been introduce to all the characters yet but they seem like what you get in most high school anime the leader, his love interest, the nerd, the samurai girl, the noisy girl, etc.  I like these characters but they are nothing new and so far they aren't that special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:  The fights are awesome, the panty shots are nice, the emotions are real.  I have to say to sit down and watch this I was just blown away with how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:  Now if you were to add up my scores and average them out this series would be a 9 but in the end it all comes down to the enjoyment of the show.  If you really enjoy something regardless of the other factors you will continue you like it.  If you like the way a girl looks but you don't enjoy being around her then she isn't all that great.  If she is okay looking but is funning with a great personalty then she is way better to be with.  Anyway that just my opinion, and I hope it helps,",

(though I welcomed the echhi,lol)  I truely believe that the writers of Highschool of the Dead do an excelent job of presenting the mental & moral challenges that one would face surviving in a Zombie Apocalipse.  Yes, they pervert it up a lot, but that's there very-unique style and I absolutley love it!  The characters are the only real weak element to me(6/10), because the character development isn't as deep or involved as it could be.  I think those who dont like itwere expecting a action anime first , and a comedy/echhi/ect. anime second. But, Highschool of the Dead was always, from the begining, an Echhi anime first, and all the action/comedy/ect. stuff next; and as far as I know, no one else make an echhi anime with this level of action & gore without it being some weird hentai.  They find a nice ballance between the echhi/action/comedy elements of the show. That's what makes this show a rare gem, and I really hope they make more shows like this one.",

What surprised me was the great quality of the animation and soundtrack, and the action scenes. This anime featured a lot of gory, over-the-top action scenes, even for a zombie flick. Coupled with the soundtrack, it made it a pretty thrilling and enjoyable experience. \r\nRegardless of the fact that it has a lot of aesthetic appeal, Highschool of the Dead is lacking, due to it's cliched plot and it's unrealistic characters, who I didn'treally care about. Frankly, after watching many films/series from the same genre, it felt expected and predictable. Additionally, the over-sexualisation of just about all the female characters and the sexual nature of many scenes just felt out of place; wrong even.\\n\\n\r\nHighschool of the Dead is what it is: your usual zombie flick, nothing more, nothing less. Still, it was a pretty good watch.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7/10",

            "content": "*This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account, and this was posted on Christmas Eve, so this is outdated as of now*\r\nWARNING: The following review contains Strong Language, if that is not your cup of tea, I suggest you do not continue. Thought I'd warn you.\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: December 24, 2012. Review #27: Highschool of the Dead\r\nOn November 30, 2012. I went and saw the new James Bond movie Skyfall with a friend, and after the movie was over, we went to the library and I checked out some anime because my friend usually suggests animes that I haven't watched yet that were availableat this library. She had me check out Gun x Sword (which I previously reviewed) and another anime called \"Highschool Of The Dead\". I remember my brother telling me that the show is full of \"tits and ass\" and I told my friend that and I asked her if she'd seen it and she told me that she hasn't seen it yet but she insisted that I watch it. Well, I've held back quite a while and since Christmas is tomorrow, I'm in a holly jolly mood and I can't wait to BITCHSLAP this anime for this review! This anime is obviously going on the naughty list. So... Let's shoot the fuck out of Highschool Of The Dead!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTakashi Komuro is just an average high school boy, that is until an infection breaks that turns people into zombie-like creatures. Alongside his friends and a school nurse, they fight their way out and continue their journey to find out what exactly is going on with the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere! That is the basic gist of the plot of this bloody mess.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Madhouse production and to my surprise. The animation actually looks really good in this show. In fact, it's probably the only good feature in Highschool Of The Dead (or H.O.T.D. for short) Madhouse is known for their really good production quality from back then as well as today and the animation is mostly good while having a few problems. One is that the zombies could've looked a little better but they still look alright to a degree. The big problem I have with the animation department is them throwing in fanservice in the middle of a damn action scene. Not only that but there are many scenes with lots and boobies and plenty of panty shots. Expect to see a few scenes of nudity too. I wouldn't mind the fanservice if it wasn't thrown in from scene to scene from time to time. That's my major bone to pick with H.O.T.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Takafumi Wada is not that memorable to me, but there are some worthy mentions in the music department for Highschool Of The Dead. The closing credits feature 12 songs with one song for each episode. It's kind of nice, but there are some songs that really feel a little out of place. When it comes to the opening, I just have a few things to say about it. The opening theme kicks ass, the visuals are pretty cool for the most part, and it's a song that is stuck in my head for a while. The highlight on the music is definitely the opening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Voice Acting, The Japanese Cast is decent but it's not really an all-star cast. Junichi Suwabe plays Komuro just fine for the most part. Marina Inoue (the seiyu of Yoko from Gurren Lagann) is fine as Rei Miyamoto, Eri Kitamura is okay as Saya. Junko Takeuchi (The seiyu of Naruto from...Naruto) sounds nothing like Naruto and yet plays her role just fine. Miyuki Sawashiro plays Saeko pretty well for the most part. Nobuyuki Hiyama is pretty good as Kota Hirano *Record Scratch* Kota...Hirano...? You mean that this character was named after Kouta Hirano, the manga artist and creator of Hellsing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, there's no coincidence. The Kota Hirano you see in H.O.T.D. was modeled after the real-life Kouta Hirano. You know what? I liked Hirano throughout the series, he was alright.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've brought up the subbed version of Highschool Of The Dead, it's time that I mention the dub. OH...FUCK! Before I mention the vocal talent, there's something I must mention. Steven Foster is responsible for writing the Adaptive script as well as being the ADR director for the dub of this show. If you know what I'm talking about. It's THAT Steven... Motherfucking...Foster. He's a ADR director that I assume proudly shows that he doesn't give two fucks about the original material regardless of what it really is or how people would react to the dubs he produces. The only dub I think was a good one he did was Cromartie High School. However since he produced this dub, expect a few things.\\n\\n\r\n1. Characters swearing up a fucking storm. I don't know how many times the F-Bomb has been dropped.\\n\\n\r\n2. He has a tendency to portray the characters as mean-spirited while the original Japanese intent of the characters tends to differ.\\n\\n\r\n3. Some rare adaptive script writing that has some awkwardness.\\n\\n\r\n4. Pop culture references that don't make sense in the context of the story.\\n\\n\r\n5. A mixture of over-acting and wooden acting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Steven Foster should do is try to re-create the intent of the original material and maintaining the spirit of the original Japanese intent instead of making a bastardized juvenile adaptive script that mocks the material instead of being faithful to it. If other dubs produced by Steven Foster have the same problem, then this dub has the same old Foster bullshit from before. When I mentioned the juvenile feel of the adaptive script, it's a little surprising to admit that it actually fits the show to some degree. Now that I'm done mentioning about Steven Foster, I'll actually get right down to the dub. It's not good at all, it's pretty bad. Leraldo Anzaldua is okay as Komuro but sounds off at times. Jessica Boone is alright I guess. Maggie Flecknoe is way off as Saya. Mark X. Laskowski is not all that great as Hirano. Monica Rial sounds way off as Shizuka (the Nurse). Taylor Hannah is a bit decent as Saeko, nothing more. Brittney Karbowski (Black*Star from Soul Eater, Pride from FMA: Brotherhood) plays a little girl and it's nothing to write home about. Hey! the English voice of Krad (Illich Guardiola) voices Shido in the dub and he's alright for the most part. Still, the dub is pretty bad and it is much easier to watch this one subbed. Thank God that's over and done.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, they are poorly written. Especially the female cast. Komuro is a little uninteresting to me and comes off as a bit one-dimensional at times. Rei is alright, Saya is a rich bitch (really, she is), Shizuka is...uh... well... she doesn't really do a whole damn lot. Saeko is a little interesting. Hirano is fun to watch at times and a character that I liked for the most part. The characters are still not written that well and that's another big flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw I see is the story. It's sort of a average story about high school except that there's an outbreak of zombies swarming around mixed in with some gun action and bouncing boobies as well as some panty shots. It's a real fucking mess and I feel as if the show is confused itself because the school plays little to no part later on unless you count the students as part of the school setting I guess. I will say that the weirdest thing is when Arisu is thrown in the mix of characters. She's just a 7-year old and having the majority of female characters being labeled as \"sexy characters\" seems to not mix in too well, at least there's not any innuendos thrown in during her moments. As much as I am trying to hate this show. I can't fully hate it for some reason. The fanservice is a bit fucking annoying, but the action scenes were sure cool. The animation was a solid effort by Madhouse and I do label this anime as \"brainless entertainment\" because this show doesn't hide from what it really is. This anime doesn't feel rushed or slowed down either, so that's also a good plus. Wanna know an extreme mindfuck? Tetsuro Araki is the director of this show and he was very well known for his direction on Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nHNNNNGGG!!!\\n\\n\r\nThis really is a mixed bag kind of anime, but this will be memorable for a while. The ending isn't all that great but what do you expect after sitting through 11 episodes of brainless entertainment. If you have extra time to spare and want to see Zombies getting shot to hell as well as seeing some nice animation, give this anime a try. Just get ready to be bombarded with big bouncing boobies as well as panty shots, Cleavage, and some nudity. In other words, expect a whole lot of fanservice before you sit down and watch it. It is quite entertaining either way.\\n\\n\r\nHighschool Of The Dead is available from Sentai Filmworks. The manga written by Daisuke Sato and illustrated by Shoji Sato is available from Yen Plus. An OVA called \"Drifters of The Dead\" has not been released stateside for some odd reason, which is kind of a shame to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Highschool Of The Dead is a mixed bag with a mess of a plot, a unmemorable soundtrack, poorly written characters, and a pretty bad dub. It's action scenes and animation is what saved the show from being absolutely awful. The fanservice should be viewed as \"Take it or Leave it\". It's surprisingly an entertaining show for what it is. This is an anime that may be hard to hate, but it is hard to like if you are trying to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nI give Highschool Of The Dead a 5.7 out of 10, it is SO-SO!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and Merry Christmas.",

            "content": "Why do people take this show so seriously?\r\nA lot of the reviews I have read have been taking this show way too seriously. Its zombies and ecchi. I don't really think it was supposed to be serious. This show is just supposed to be really enjoyable, its extremely thoughtless. All it really is, is guns, girls and zombies. What more could you want?\r\nThe story is pretty simple, a zombie apocalypse starts and all hell breaks loose afterwards. So, an average bum, a ginger, a fat guy, a bitch who's a bitch, the badass chick who's only purpose is to be badass, the doctor thats practicallyfanservice as her tits jiggle up and down every damn second, a loli and a dog have to run run till they're save from the zambies.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty generic and the characters are all stereotypes. Takashi, the main character of main characters is really just an average dude, all the chicks in the group want to get banged by him, I've never seen that before! *cough* harems in a nutshell *cough* Rei is your basic dumb bitch who's purpose is to be that dumb bitch in zombie movies that is well, dumb. And as we go on, all the characters are a stereotype.  So to finish off the characters quickly:\\n\\n\r\nSaeko: Basic badass woman that knows kindo and can use katanas and stuff and has some bad past. Never heard this before.\\n\\n\r\nSaya- Your basic rich girl that brags over how smart she is. I really don't have to say anything else...\\n\\n\r\nAlice- Why is this character even here? She's just a plot device and literally has no purpose to be here.\\n\\n\r\nZero- It's a dog, you always need a dog!\\n\\n\r\nKouta- You wonder what, I have made fun of every character, but this guy, holy shit I love him. Its an otaku that knows how to use fucking guns! The explanation is stupid but I don't care, he has some genuinely funny dialogue and how can you not love him?\\n\\n\r\nYou wonder what I see through all of this? A tribute to all those zombie movies that started zombie movies. I love it man. This is really what this reminds me of. And I appreciate the writers and directors for doing this cause as much as I really don't like some of these characters (other than Kouta), I do enjoy seeing them kill zambies and getting into shitty situations.\\n\\n\r\nAnd besides all that, this show is a lot of fun. There's action left and right and genuinely some funny dialogue. Like I said before this show isn't supposed to be taken seriosuly, it's just a lot of fun as we see a bunch of big tittied woman and 2 guys try to survive a zombie apocolypse. Overall, I had fun with this show.\\n\\n\r\nTo get it out of the way. The animation is pretty good. I liked some of the art, the zombies looked menacing, the animation is smooth and decent. At times CGI is used and it may be a little wonky looking and kind of didn't fit in the show. The music is so fitting to the show. Many uses of hard rock and pop music just fits into the show. Also, I fucking love the OP, gets me pumped up every time as the first couple of seconds open up with a guitar solo getting my anus prepared for tits and gore!\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show actually, if you want a simple and brainless anime to just entertain, I easily would recommend this. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub? Dub. It's really good and flashy and there's a lot of pop culture references. The sub is extremely taken seriously as everyone's voices dosen't really fit their characters.\\n",

            "content": "\"It'd be Perfect if it Weren't for all the Risqu\u00e9 Scenes\"\r\nI'm currently watching the HOTD series which has truly grabbed hold of my attention this season. The artistry's great. The characters are developing nicely.\r\nAfter ten episodes, I've stopped worrying about how a series will continue on people surviving a zombie influx; I'm rather impressed how the producers have kept the whole thing entertaining. But they don't need to keep injecting cleavage (or, bouncing breasts), and the roll-in-the-hay (or bathtub) scenes they seem to relish pushing. Just when I'mgetting into a twist in the plot, here comes some up-skirt shot. I've been training myself to ignore those shots - but perhaps many people like that kind of thing. I, at 47, don't need to see it constantly. But the plots and artistry keep me wanting to see what happens. If you're easily offended or put off by the PG-13 (and really pushing R-rated) snippets, please try to watch a few episodes from the beginning. For those who don't care, watch the series from episode one! Great entertainment!",

            "content": "So this is my first review, and I am by no means a great reviewer or can go in depth as to what really makes me enjoy something (really the most important part of a reviewer of all things), but I will try and briefly (oops) explain why I really enjoyed Highschool of the Dead contrary to popular opinion. I must say now that I might be a bit biased, as I have been a huge fan of zombies practically my whole life, although I do think I bring up some valid points.\r\nHighschool of the Dead is by no means a fantastic story or onethat has great character development (largely the most important factor in an anime for me), although this anime fulfilled its true purpose, making it fun to watch the characters kill zombies. When I walk away from finishing this anime, I wont remember the heart throbbing characters like that of Clannad or the Monogatari Series, I will remember how much fun it was watching zombies get sliced and diced, and killed by other means. Since I feel like I am getting kind of lost here, I'm just going to switch over to bullet points now;\\n\\n\r\n1: It has a good dub. I myself normally watch subs, but HotD actually had a great dub with some hilarious voice lines. A good dub or a dub in general only increases the quality of life for the non-Japanese speakers, and I am thankful for that. I must admit, I did not hear how the original sub sounded, so I cannot draw comparison between the two.\\n\\n\r\n2: The genre is not often explored. Now I am sure there are other animes out there that might feature themes similar to HotD (most notably Gakkougarashi!), although it's pretty rare to stumble upon an anime that features the modern (George A. Romero) zombie and has a pretty high production value. If you are a fan of zombies, I think you'd really enjoy this anime, also I don't think you are left with many other choices.\\n\\n\r\n3: The lewd aspect. If that is even the right word for it, basically the fan service and nudity present throughout the show. This is one of the main bases for criticism and I can agree, it's just holding the story and the characters back. Most of the female characters have huge goddamned breasts, and have \"those\" scenes to show them off. It only takes away potential time from the rest of the episode to further develop the story among other things. \\n\\n\r\n4: All the other stuff. The story) was OK, I could keep up with it and enjoy it for the most part, although among some scenes like a certain bathroom scene... (see the previous point) I did not enjoy. Art) was good, everything looked pretty good and the theme of a zombie apocalypse really gave the artists a lot to play with when it came to killing zombies among other things. Sound) The sound was good. As said about the story, there was a lot of opportunity for some cool sounds being the zombie apocalypse. The voice acting, the action sequences both sounded great.  I don't know much else to say about that in particular. Character) The characters are pretty hit and miss. I will let you discover for yourself what you might think, but some I've really come to admire, and others, are just really pathetic, *cough* big boobed teacher *cough*. Enjoyment) This is the best part of the anime really, I touched up on it somewhere in the mess above. But it was really fun to watch, minus the \"lewd\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, 8/10, and an end to my actually not-brief review of HotD, and first MAL review ever. Sorry I could not elaborate more deeply as to what really drove me to enjoy it, I tried my best. I do not think this anime is as bad as people say it is. Don't watch this anime thinking you are in for a serious story with great characters, you are here for some great zombie killing and action sequences, and some story and character development as a side to complete the dish.",

These 12 episodes are packed with lots of ecchi scenes which make it even better, not to mention the beautiful art work. \r\nThe story is very interesting and suspenseful without a doubt, each episode is filled with mad hype and lots of fan service. Defiantly would recommend this anime if you love high school anime, a little romance, and fan service! The ending and beginning are mad and wish it got a second season, but even so it takes you on quite the journey.\r\nMy only \"con\"with this anime is that the fan service can be a bit much at some points. The dialogue at many points also could have been written a bit better. It also would have been a lot better if they gave us more character development with some characters, but overall it was a great anime.",

The characters are diverse and all that i didnt like was there was not a true tsundere character which is my favorite character type. It is a japanese Walking Dead but only for a male audience.

The animation is clear, eye-catching and entertaining.  There are some boob-jiggling-physics that I will never forget and I very gay male and still impressed.  The music fits with the action.

            "content": "All these children trying to write reviews are embarrassed because there's boobs in their anime. \r\nThe top review is pretty fair, recognising the good point of the show despite the fact that they \"really, really dislike fan service anime.\" But then looking further down, people are giving 2s and 3s just because the anime had lots of boobs, saying hyperbolic things like \"this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen.\" \r\nI disagree with all these opinions. Let's look at some more quantitative elements of the show before we dive into it's ethos. First, the artwork is great. The zombies are scary, the girlsare sexy, and the fight scenes are exciting (this is to be expected, since it's directed by the same man who made AOT). Also, there's genuinely great character developement. You can really see the characters changing and acting realistically as they struggle through their various challenges. Just this fact alone puts this show above 90% of modern anime. Another way this show stands out is its great pacing. At no point in the show did I feel like the storyline was making unnecessary turns, nor that it was going too quickly.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core, Highschool of the Dead is about instincts. It's not an intellectual show promoting some grand philosophy or showcasing complex psychological battles. I think this is part of where the show gets misunderstood; some people only acknowledge these aspects of a show. Highschool of the Dead is meant to make you feel rather than think. It focuses on two primal thoughts: fear and sexuality. These two complement each other, and if you take either one out of the show, it would probably only be an 8. It's this magic mixture that leads me to rate this show a 10, despite it's complete lack of an intellectual agenda.",

If the answer is negative, then believe me you haven't missed anything from another world. It can be compared with a low budget +b zombie movie, with more fan service that action. Seriously if it didn't have that crazy amount of fancervice it would be a passable series.  I say passable because the argument is horrendous, in the first episode we see how the world falls to a zombie infection, the rest is a group of subnormals with a ton of luck running form onepint to another one. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do you expect when the characters are ammm... I mean it's ok they wanted to put a character with super human boobs, but really why the hell every time she tacked a step theres is \"booing\" sound!\\n\\n\r\nThe only passable part in this anime is the sound and maybe the animation.

            "content": "I might be a little biased when writing this being the anime that got me into the whole otaku business. To start off though, this was the first fully fledged anime I watched when it was first released in 2010 around September. I was 10 years old. You might think that it\u2019s messed up to watch an anime like this at the age of then but I think otherwise. This was one the best experiences of my life watching this show.\r\nBeing regarded as one of the most perverted shows of all time is an understatement. This went above and beyond. The amount of fan-service inthis show is overly done which I don't like. It did make the show majorly popular which was the whole point of it being there in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10: Despite being one of the most perverted anime if not THE most perverted, the amount of detail is astonishing. The animation and art style is amazing. it`s just plain beautiful. The two guys who made this anime and manga might be huge pervs but they are geniuses to art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7: Besides and whole zombie apocalypse concept and great art style, Maon Kurosaki became famous for her album made for all the ending songs of the show. Her voice is just amazing. It\u2019s very unique and beautiful and all the songs in the end are different which gives much to enjoy. If I have to say, this anime has to have one of the best soundtracks of all time. Not only that but all the lyrics actually correspond to each episode it was part of and they actually have good meaning to them. But there is one problem; the English dubbed version was horrible. The voice overs were really annoying and didn't fit. Even if they did fit they pissed me off with their high pitched voices. For one, in the Japanese version, Takashi says the F-bomb one in the beginning, correct? Maybe some minor language throughout that right? In the English dub he says the F-bomb at-least 20 times throughout the series which I didn't see was necessary Some might like it but in my opinion it was unnecessary and the Japanese voices were far better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6: After years of watching the show over and over again, I now notice that the only good character was Hirano, Alice and Shizuka. Takashi has literally no good traits about him. I hate Tsunderes like Takagi but she`s slightly better than the rest. I guess it\u2019s her character design and her family. Saeko is one of those female characters that are all powerful. She is a bit overpowered than the rest. Alice and Zeke go along with Hirano; they are the only ones that are good. She\u2019s cute and helpful. Rei is that annoying clingy female character and Shizuka is a dumb blonde which actually gives personality to the group surprisingly. Hirano finally comes in, the otaku, geek, nerd who actually has a good personality and shows character development throughout the story. He`s the only character that most of us actually love. i wouldnt care if the others died just keep Hirano, Alice, Shizuka and Zeke.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10: I\u2019ve been doing research for 4 years and this is still the only anime in existence that involves the zombie apocalypse concept. Maybe because the concept is so farfetched that it isn\u2019t attempted by any except the Sato brothers who as we\u2019ve seen, are either crazy or geniuses or both. This being the first anime I actually watched (besides Bakugan, Yu-Gi-Oh and the other crap that used to show) I took major enjoyment in it. But now as I watched it today I still get that geeky feeling every time Hirano comes up or when the Humvee pops out. Being the only Zombie anime, it\u2019s a must see if you done mind watching some really perverted scenes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7: It\u2019s very realistic in terms of what is going to happen in the apocalypse. The government falling and how humans are the problem and not the walkers, and the whole society falling apart thing. My problem with it was that the creators focused more on fan-service instead of the story. It should\u2019ve been more like The Walking Dead depicting how the humans are scarier than the walkers themselves. If the creators had put more of that, and maybe still have the excessive fan-service, it would\u2019ve been near perfect.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: The anime was great if you\u2019ve seen it and as you\u2019ve seen I`m still a little biased towards it. It\u2019s a much watch if you don\u2019t mind excessive fan-service and nudity. With the supposed season two coming in Fall of 2014, after 4 goddamn years, it will make even more money and become even more popular than it is now. Those who have been waiting as much as me cross your fingers and wait to go full nerd as the next 12 episode come soon.\\n",

            "content": "Now, before writing this review I wondered what would I get by analyzing a show like this piece by piece. It\u2019s no mystery that this show is bad and it would be pointless to even write a review. But, then I realized that maybe  High School of the Dead has more issues other than  just its fanservice.\r\nCurious what I mean by that?\r\nWell, we will find out in today\u2019s review\r\nAn unknown virus spreads in the world causing people to turn into you guessed it zombies. The story starts off at your average Japanese high school- where you see teenagers dealing with your average adolescentbullshit. However, things take quite the turn when bam the entire place is invested with brain hungry zombies. Now, our journey a group of students as they fight to survive this zombie apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nNow, a zombie anime sounds like some entertaining shit. Sure, nothing that might be considered anything close to a masterpiece but entertaining nonetheless. However, then the creators had this other idea which was to input all the annoying anime clich\u00e9s into it to make it as popular as possible , hence to generate a shit tonne of money. It\u2019s like they tried mixing everything that makes a show sell and so that's how this show came into fruition. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, what does High School of the Tits, not have that any popular anime doesn\u2019t? Well let\u2019s see it has a harem, a forced romance, blood and gore, bitchy tsunderes, bath house scenes, a clich\u00e9 shonen protagonist and of course let\u2019s not forget the oh so glorious fanservice. However, it\u2019s like when creating the show they made sure to really turn up the fanservice cause sex sells baby, reason why the porn industry is booming so much!\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t ask me why I know that though!\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing worth mentioning about the story as I feel its non-existent. Nothing about the virus or the zombies is given much importance- and like I mentioned earlier becomes your typical fanservy harem with the added bonus of boobs. I mean, it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even try to have a decent story which is the real problem I have. \\n\\n\r\nAs a heterosexual female, boob physics and panty shots were just not enough to keep me interested. Hence, at times I got really bored watching High School of the Sluts. If a show should be made, then I believe it should have something for everyone. But, this show is obviously targeted towards horny fifteen year old boys- so in a sense I feel like this show hates me more than I hate it!\\n\\n\r\nNow, RosarioVampire is another supernatural ecchi series that I enjoyed despite how bad it was. And that was mainly due to the characters. However, it pains me to say that this show doesn\u2019t even have that. The characters range from being bland to downright annoying and despicable. The main lead Takashi like I mentioned earlier is your stereotypical protagonist and heck even looks like it. He is the most tolerable out of all these characters which is the biggest compliment I can give him. The romance between him and Rei was cheesy as hell- and he even delivered some of the dumbest lines when trying to act cool as he protected Rei.\\n\\n\r\nOne character that truly disappointed me was Saeko. She started out to be this badass chick but ended up being another girl in the main lead\u2019s harem which brought her character down by several notches. \\n\\n\r\nThe character that I hated the most other than that crazy pedophilic teacher was Saya- a pink haired bitchy tsundere. Throughout this series I wanted her dead so badly, because all she does is act like a know it all and doesn\u2019t know when to shut up. They portray her as somewhat of a tragic heroine but at the end she is nothing but a whiny bitch who I would never associate myself with in real life. Oh and Shizuka is hands down the most useless character I have ever come across in any show and her uselessness is such a major factor that I had to mention. The only redeeming quality I would say that the characters have is that surprisingly they were given character development and we got to know about most of them. Like that impressed me but it wasn\u2019t enough for me to care about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was I can\u2019t believe I am saying this was done by Madhouse, whom I freaking adore to death. Yeah, it amazes me that the same studio who made One Punch Man and Death Note also made High School of the Never-ending Panty Shots. The colours were kind of muted- which was suited for this show\u2019s atmosphere. The character designs were nothing outstanding and I feel like the animation truly shines during yes the fanservy bits. Which I leave up to you to decide is whether a bad or good thing. Yes, not one of Madhouse\u2019s best works but for what they had they did a solid job.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is what I consider the best part of this anime and I honest to God never skipped it. I still listen to it now and then- and it was probably the main reason I even bothered watching the entire show. Yes, the fanservy bits in that are also cringy but it is easy to ignore when you have got such a good song.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the reason why I disliked this show so much is mainly due to the lack of any actual story and its lame ass characters \u2013 which are like the main pillars in making any show stand out. It is honestly nothing but softcore porn and I was bored a lot by this show. But, it wasn\u2019t downright terrible that I wanted to gouge out my eyes. I know many mercilessly bash on the show for its fanservice- but I feel like that if you should hate this show then hate it should because of how much wasted potential it has. Well, that and the fanservice because that too is unbelievably unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind I am going to give this show a 4 out of 10 and that you should trash it. It wasn\u2019t the worst thing I ever watched but it didn\u2019t pass by any means either. However, if you need something to fap to then look no further as I present to you High School of the Dead! \\n",

            "content": "This review was originally posted in June 2011, during a month long special called Zombie Month.\r\nWell, it\u2019s June! And you know what that means! It\u2019s ZOMBIE MONTH!!! And what better way to start this two review fun with one of the most current popular anime out there. The one that has more fanservice and zombies then you can shake a stick at! HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD!!!\r\nHigh School of the Dead is a Horror/Drama anime based on the anime by Daisuke Sato and published by Kadokawa Shoten, and is available in America by Yen Press. Studio Madhouse picked up the anime version, and made it\u2019srun in the summer of 2010 with 12 episodes. Anime Network currently holds licensing for the series.\\n\\n\r\nTakashi Komuro is a normal high school boy, until an infection breaks out that turns people into zombie-like creatures. Along with his friends & the school nurse, they fight their way out and continue their journey to find out what exactly has happened to the world. (Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nThe look and the animation in this show is amazing! There was really nothing lazy, or bad about the animation quality. Color and style are used well for this anime, and the animation doesn\u2019t seem to have any problems. The one thing I have to be nit-picky about, is the zombies sometimes looking like clay animation rather than drawn. Does it look cool? Sure. Does it work for the series? Not really.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty basic: Survive. And it does tell us how our characters attempt survive the hoard of zombies that are around every corner. The one major thing that is never explained, but does leave the viewer to wonder, how did the infection start? Was is a virus, supernatural curse, or the careless actions of a corporation trying to cure cancer? We don\u2019t know that, but we don\u2019t need to. The story about surviving the slavering monsters around us, and that\u2019s it. Even with all the fan service in the series you would think be a distraction, the story is immensely involving and actually keeps you on the edge of your seat. With all the chaos and death happening around them, and the realistic way the characters react, in highly traumatic ways, the story manages to pull almost every heart string you possess. You can relate to these characters in their struggle, even the most annoying ones manage to be sympathetic, and keep us involved with the story, right up to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters have little bits of development here and there throughout the story. More development comes from Kohta Hirano, Saeko Busujima, and, maybe, Takashi Komuro. Everyone else doesn\u2019t seem to have a whole lot to go through in the series. As for the characters in general, they aren\u2019t bad. Some are more annoying then others, but for the most part it shows what individuals go through in a crisis like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the Japanese is good, with the characters sounding like how you would expect them to. The english dub, however, is a bit of a different story. I gave Jessica Boone props for her role in Canaan in a previous review, but as Rei Miyamoto it seems like she dropped the ball a little. Some of the lines spoken by her character seem a little too forced to be believable. Maggie Flecknoe (Red Garden) as Saya Takagi is rather annoying, but, then again, she\u2019s the know it all genius, so it kinda fits. Mark Laskowski (Super Dimension Fortress Macross) as Kohta was certainly a bad choice to make. The only time the voice fits is when he goes all military on the group. Leraldo Anzaldua (Canaan) picks up the main male lead in Takashi, and doesn\u2019t do too bad with it. But the two people from the group for favorites voice acting would be Taylor Hannah (Le Chevalier D\u2019Eon, Red Garden) as Saeko and Monica Rial (Soul Eater, Baccano!, Tsubasa)as Nurse Shizuka Marikawa. They are certainly the better fits for their characters. Oh! And here\u2019s a surprise for you. Remember Brittney Karbowski? The woman who voice Black Star in the Soul Eater dub? Well, she\u2019s back..... as a little girl. Little Alice Maresato.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this can\u2019t be a review about High School of the Dead without talking about the thing that people remember this show the most for: the fanservice. So how does it really stand up to the series? Well, I can say it is a pain watching the show with it occurring every minute (I would say five seconds but I feel generous right now). As the first anime I have ever seen with this much boobs and pantie shots, I have the feeling this anime was solely created for (Lonely)men. I guess when the original creator discovered he had no clue how to make it seem less like a porno, he threw in a zombie apocalypse just to make it more badass. If you didn\u2019t have the distracting fan service, this would certainly be an awesome series. However, since we do, it kind of takes away the show\u2019s quality. I will say, if you\u2019re a guy who loves boobs and zombies, and girls with huge boobs killing zombies(seriously, every female lead in the group has tits that should be impossible Especially the nurse, that poor, broke backed impossible creature) then here\u2019s an anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, High School of the Dead is an exciting story with amazing animation and imaging, but way to much boobs and panties. If you took out the fan service, the story would probably be more effective rather then the way it is now. A few of the characters are likable, but not all are. If you must see this series, since EVERYONE always talks about this, watch the Japanese version; it has better voice acting. All I have to say now is, viewer discretion advised....... BOOBIES!!",

Takashi is the lead character, who decides to team up with his classmates to live through the zombie apocalypse. There are many clich\u00e9s in the story, but as I mentioned before, you don't get bored watching it. It's ecchi, so there is lot of fanservice. But if you manage to overlook the fanservice (also if you're a girl, like me) then it's pretty good. Even the plot is so typical, the anime is enjoyable overall. The dub is also very good, I'ddefinitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Ahh, the anime that pulled me back into it all! I first started watching Highschool of the Dead the year of 2011 and I will tell you that this show is crazy addicting! I have re-watched this show at least ten times (if that doesn't tell you something about the quality of this show then I don't know what will!)\r\nAnyway's let's get this review going!\r\nPros: The storyline for this series is absolutely thrilling, and I hated zombie shows before this because they all seemed to just try to get as much gore as possible on the screen for the viewers. Highschool of the Dead (orHOTD) however delves not only into intense action scenes, but goes into the character interactions of how the react to the zombie apocalypse and how they learn to deal with each other. Almost every episode has some sort of new and exciting twist that pushes the character's to their limits. Despite the slight harem style developments, I have found many of the character's reactions to their predicament as well as the situations they wind up in to be quiet plausible. Also the artwork in this show is stellar! Sure, since it wasn't released this year, there certainly are many other shows that would pass it up in the graphics department like Psycho Pass and Muv luv Alternative: Total Eclipse, but they are still fantastic in my opinion!\\n\\n\r\nCons: Yeah, this is the part we all dreaded. Now don't get me wrong, girls with large bust sizes are just as appealing to me as any other heterosexual male... But this show kind of took the fan service to extreme. From the bath scene to the constant breast jiggling that defies the laws of physics, theres just no need for so much in any show (especially one that is so epic anyways!) Also, there were a number of times that some of the guns were misnamed, but that's not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the best anime series that I have ever seen and I would suggest it to anyone who is down for some epic storyline and zombie killing action!",

The plot is interesting, there's drama but ya know, its gonna happen.  The characters are \"common\" but they are \"unique\" in their own way.\r\nBut on to the important stuff, the zombie apocalypse setting is an awesome idea.  Plus, the highschoolers face a struggle with adults still bossing them around yet they are mowing down zombies while them adults aren't doing jack-squat.  \r\nBottom-line:HOTD is pretty awesome and I hope season 2 comes out soon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I can't really see how anyone with a dick can actually NOT enjoy this show. The action is top-notch, the breasts are wonderful and constant, and the atmosphere is so playfully tense that you can't help but get caught up in it all. Whether it's your shitty, uninteresting chosen genre or not, it's pretty undeniable that Highschool of the Dead is one of the best things to happen to ecchi in a long time. \r\nStory: 10/10. The zombies attack, and a formerly normal, boring teenager does the logical thing and surrounds himself with guns and underage females. Expected shenanigans ensue, riding in on a tidalwave of tense, sinfully enjoyable fanservice. Bottom line, only fags don't like this story; But even they can't help but be so fully aroused by ultimate bro Takashi. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Gore, boobs, gore, delicious thighs, more gore, masochistic girlfriend, blood+guts, titties. IT ALL LOOKS SO GOOD OH GOD NEW UNDERWEAR EVERY FIVE MINUTES. CUM NO MAN-MADE BUCKET CAN EVER HOPE TO CONTAIN. No seriously guys it's fucking legit, props to Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. This was like a slightly altered 28 days later, which I was much more than a little okay with. No better way to watch this, except with the entire series endlessly looped to \"Hot in Here\" by Nelly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Takashi is a pussy commander, as well as the resident superhero and zombie anal demolisher. The girls are all hot, with varying accurate and unbelievably annoying female personalities I chose to ignore in light of their succulent jail bait loins. Well except for Saeko, she can my with her WHIPS CHAINS WHIPS CHAINS all night, if you know what I mean. Oh there was some fat fucker too, he was pretty bro for an annoying nerdy piece of shit. He had cool guns too, or something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. It's been a while since I was able to fully enjoy my anime viewing experience with my dick in my left hand the entire time. That really means a lot coming (haha come) from me, for I am a man of few words and many thoughts (mostly about sex and CTR) who only speaks his mind in times of great necessity. And this, my friends, is one such time. Go now, go forth and EXPERIENCE THE MASTURBATORY RIDE OF YOUR SAD, PATHETIC LIFE. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. Highschool of the Dead was a manga I never, ever had any hopes of seeing animated because it was just so god damn GOOD. The anime was pretty damn faithful to the manga artistically and structurally, and I'd totally recommend it to anyone who likes zombies and boobies (even gays, contrary to my earlier statement).",

            "content": "Highschool of the dead - \r\nFirst off let me just say that the sweetest things are always the most short lived.\r\nHighschool of the dead is just that it's epic, and fantastic  but just to short.\r\nSynopsis: a group of high school students and their school nurse escape from their school in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, they make the long journey through the hellish streets of the city on the way to safety and their loved ones.  \r\nStory: the story was very engrossing, and realistic, full of minor plot twist and at times gut wrenching fear, or romantic tension. It did all ofthis so well for the 12 short episodes they had to work with. the logic they implore is top notch and could have come straight out of the zombie survival guide. pop culture references from America are abundant almost as if it was written for a u.s. viewer. Despite the gory and horrific atmosphere there is always a chuckle to be had although the real fun doesn't start until halfway through. It is also filled with nudity and not soft nudity i mean nipples and bare butts flying everywhere, if ecchi or raunchy  is not for you avoid this show at all cost, it really grew on me however. the romance took a sideline but was not what i was expecting, and through me off. \\n\r\nsome of the only things i found wrong with the story was unrealistic fighting, and scenes where physics just don't seem to apply, but hey its an anime right?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: this is a newer anime and it shows. Beautiful characters and backdrops, although a bit over the top on the detailed panty shots and huge bouncing breast.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting: pretty good English dubbing with a great cast of voice actors many of which havent been scene in every anime under the sun.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: this show covers all the bases, heavy metal, german techno, soft piano, and of course a fantastic intro covered by Japanese punk/pop\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: the characters seem shallow at first but even in this limited time frame all seem to grow and develop by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Point: survive the zombie apocalypse... that about covers it and they did cover everything that entails, from the darker side of humanity to triumph over all and everything in-between. It was a wild ride that had me watching every episode back to back until it was over, and i WANT A SECOND SEASON. :)\\n\\n\r\noh and don't watch the OVA it was nothing like the show(more like an echhi pokemon episode) and it was just unwatchable.",

No matter how much the studio tries to unknowingly sabotage this series by filling it with overly abundant fan service you can't help but get drawn in (especially if your a zombie fan like myself). \r\nMost of the main cast grow out of their stereotypes towards the middle of the series and for a show thats main selling point is sex, guns, and tits, the characters are surprisingly multidimensional. The dialogue exchanged between the main cast is for the most part very well written and the topics they discuss go deeper than your typical zombiefare and yet, the show is still able to deliver it's jokes with perfect execution.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the somewhat unoriginal looking female characters, the visuals in this series pass with flying colors. The action looks spectacular and the gun play in particular is reminiscent of Angel Beats! which is a good thing. The show does a magnificent job of depicting this lifeless japan that these kids are traveling through; the scenes with Komuro riding on his motorcycle with abandoned towns and cities in the background are masterfully done and really draw you deeper into the world the characters are in.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, probably the best feature of this series, Komuro Takashi. Harem's for the most part have male leads that have the sexual libido of a wet carrot but every once in a while you get one that's a bad ass and damn it that's something to cherish! Komuro is one of the best harem leads in a while because he is the exact opposite of the cliche males we've seen in the moe drenched harems of the past few years.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can look past the gimmicks that the producers used to try to make this show sell, you find something much more special. when i first started watching i was expecting explosions, boobs, and weapons, but what i got (along with boobs and explosions) was a story about change, humanity, and acceptance.",
