            "content": "For over a decade now, the anime industry has been producing one series a season that deserves the highly appreciated title of ironic masterpiece. This time around it's a show about suicidal loli and a massmurderer who refuses to kill her. And it has everything. When I say everything, what I really mean is e v e r y t h i n g, and I have been laughing my butt sore since episode 1. \r\nOur story starts off in a spooky hospital where security cameras garnish the walls every 3 inches, doors close behind people's back like it is Ghost Hunt, and possessed typewritersare the ones asking all the questions that matter since our characters don't even bother trying as they are too busy planning to kill themselves. It's bad? No, it's the peak of self-awareness. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual events focus around some floor master shit fights because the entire series is based on a video game that was created with goddamn RPG Maker's free trial edition. Need a better prove of quality? That's what I thought. The entire story is real mysterious and apparently everything in it symbolizes some religious nonsense hence why all the 3 different English titles of the show have the word \"Angel\" in them. Essentially this is lot like Evangelion except fun to watch because the mc only has one mental illness and one of the characters has a pumpkin as a head. \\n\\n\r\nOur cast is beyond incredible. Rachel is surprisingly non-annoying for a 13 yo child who is in angst (even if her every 3rd line consist of the word \"kill\" and \"me\"). Isaac Foster is the perfect representation of a generic horror psychopath from any horror game you play on easy and the murderer is an NPC. He also owns a cool scythe and I laugh similarly as he whenever he does anything. His laugh is real sick, reminds me of Orihara Izaya from Durararararara. +1 for seiyuu work. Daniel Dickens is the best character. I have had a blast using the phrase \"the plot Dickens\" when ever he does anything. MVP material right there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also beyond incredible. Especially the tight and dark spaces really do add to the overall atmosphere. I mentioned Ghost Hunt earlier and that was favorite horror comedy before this one became a thing. The best arc from that anime takes place in a building highly similar to the architecture in which the entire story of Satsuriku no Tenshi takes part in except more floors this time around. Some of the floors really do offer that video game feeling where the series is its own thing and that manages to serve the immersion the work has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this Satsuriku no Tenshi offered genuine entertainment. Some of it can be seen to be silly, but I found all of that just add to the overall experience. For example, the dialogue and angst that is best shown in the repetition of the two lines \"kill me\" and \"no\" is nothing less than comedic gold, and such lousy cliches as memoryloss were taken exactly as seriouly with this series as they always should be dealt it. Meaning not seriously at all. \\n\\n\r\nJ.C.Staff has been fixing their reputation their best since the Rie Kugumiya's loli tsundere era, and thus far, Satsuriku no Tenshi is yet another show from them that looks mediocre, but is everything but. Don't let the criticism ruin the fun as this is what entertainment truly means.",

            "content": "*I have only watched the anime, not the manga or game. Thus, this review will be based on the anime alone*\r\nAfter having completely finished the anime, I can safely say that Satsuriku no Tenshi is one of the most frustrating horror animes I\u2019ve ever watched. From the very start of the show, there have been a myriad of flaws involving plot, dialogue, and character development, all resulting in a trainwreck of a show, which is really a shame because it had such an interesting premise.\r\nPlot (1/10): The plot to this anime is one of the worst I have ever seen and most of its issuesbegin with it\u2019s progression, or rather, the utter lack of it. Right from the beginning and up to halfway through the story, we can see this show following a typical formula: villian shows up -> zack does something stupid -> Rachel finds a solution -> more talking about killing and then not killing. The \u2018mystery\u2019 in the show is awfully boring, with the clues being vague and pretentious, constantly talking again and again about \u2018sins\u2019 and \u2018god\u2019 but adding nothing to the story. Actually that\u2019s the perfect word to describe this shitty show. It\u2019s vague. Really vague. It always felt like it wanted to impress the audience by being \u2018intelligent\u2019 so instead of slowly revealing things to the audience (like a good thriller should), it keeps on sprouting ambiguous and often nonsensical details. In my opinion, this show would do better if it was more straightforward so the viewer would get engrossed in the mystery and its progression.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem I had with Angels of Death (and probably the most noticeable one) is its repetitive, boring, and edgy dialogue. Basically, it goes something like this:\\n\\n\r\nRachel: I want to die. Can you kill me?\\n\r\nZack: Your expression is boring. I\u2019ll kill you when we get outside.\\n\r\nRachel: Can you kill me?\\n\r\nZack: What the hell are you talking about? I said I don\u2019t want to kill you.\\n\\n\r\nOMG. JUST KILL HER ALREADY!!\\n\\n\r\n(sorry that was me ranting) All of the dialogue in the story is basically 1) stuff that is really vague 2) stuff we already knew. It\u2019s like it can\u2019t even tell the intelligence of the audience. The whole thing feels like it's constantly going around in circles, with no meaning or wittiness. We KNOW Rachel wants to die. We KNOW the doc has a crazy eye fetish. Just tell us something important already!!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10): For a J.C Staff show, the art is surprisingly pretty. It uses a nice color palette and Rachel\u2019s character design was very attractive. Although Zack and the other villains character design do look somewhat generic, I\u2019m willing to give this section a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10): This department is pretty subjective, but I felt the music in this show to be rather average. It\u2019s not bad, but not very good either. I liked the voice actor for Rachel, but Zack\u2019s voice was straight-up annoying and honestly, I felt like punching his stupid face everytime I hear that voice of his. The villains\u2019 voices also felt extremely annoying, with their over-the-top laughter and eccentric attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10): Our female protagonist, Rachel, is the only one in the entire cast who didn\u2019t manage to annoy me. That\u2019s not to say she\u2019s a good character though. In the entire anime she was bland and emotionless and lacked any type of character development. Overall, she\u2019s the classic kuudere archetype but nothing to make her interesting. We learn nothing about her throughout the entire story, only that she wants to die. We don\u2019t know why she wants to die, what was accountable for her 180 in the story, or even her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist Zack isn\u2019t any better, if not worse. Loud, impulsive, and often temperamental, he\u2019s basically your \u2018all brawn no brain\u2019 male archetype. He adds nothing to the story, is often very stupid, and is definitely one of the most annoying characters I\u2019ve seen. Not to mention, his \u2018tragic backstory\u2019 is one I found to be very generic and a cheap way for viewers to pity him. Overall, it\u2019s not enough to develop his character or make him into a more complex person. Nobody\u2019s expecting an amazing and deep backstory like Kiritsugu\u2019s or even Akashi\u2019s but it\u2019s like this show doesn\u2019t even try. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains were all badly made and were all \u2018psychos\u2019 with crazy laughs and no personality. They all want to kill the 2 mc\u2019s but for no reason. They were also involved in some stupid plot twist which brought them back to life even though it was stated that they died.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10): I actually enjoyed some parts of the show but most of the time it just felt tedious and uninteresting. Unlike other bad thrillers like mirai nikki or kakegurui, this isn\u2019t very entertaining and is not worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "I've watched a whole let's play of the original Indie game. I already know the whole story and what to expect. To those who say the characters are two-dimensional... I can see why you'd think that. I disagree because there is a degree of character development that will become apparent if you stick around long enough. Know too that the story IS that predictable. However you think the story is going to turn out, you're probably going to be correct in at least one regarded aspect. Despite that, it's still fun. There's a certain level of early 2000's edginess in here. It's dark, bloody, gritty,and full of psychotic laughter.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: A young girl named Rachel Gardner wakes up without any memories and finds herself trapped in a building with several floors. She meets the serial killer Isaac Foster who tries to kill her but fails. Later on Rachel no longer wishes to live and asks Isaac if he could kill her. He agrees to kill her as long as she helps him escape the building. So Isaac and Rachel has to try to \u201cbeat\u201d all the different floors and find a way to escape.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just simply love horror, this first episode was probably very entertaining and gave you hope for the series.\\n\r\nBut if you want dramatic horror with a good story and characters, this episode might have given you some doubts.\\n\\n\r\nFor me it seemed very confusing at first, I had so many questions and it felt like the story wasn\u2019t very well planned and was just supposed to be random and scary. However I was very wrong and I ended up liking the plot and the characters a lot more than I expected. \\n\r\nBut as I said, I was very confused in the beginning and had no hope for the story.\\n\r\nWhy are they trapped in a building? Who trapped them? Why does the girl want to die all of a sudden? Why do they have to beat these floors?\\n\r\nEverything that seems confusing in the beginning is explained later and the plot is actually very interesting. It is not just a scary horror story. It is progressive and with time it gets more dramatic. \\n\r\nPlus there\u2019s a LOT of character development so I hope they keep it that way in the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nZack (Isaac Foster) the serial killer is not the average crazy aggressive killer who doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything. Well he is aggressive, crazy and very short tempered but he also becomes a very fun and interesting character which you\u2019ll learn a lot about throughout the story. (He is my favourite character because of his character development)\\n\\n\r\nRay (Rachel Gardner) was for me, a very confusing character since I didn\u2019t know why she wanted to end her life so badly. But with time, she shows more of her personality and in the end you find out her story and why she desires death.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters has very unique personalities and what made me happy was that none of them felt unnecessary. It felt like each and every one of them were needed in some way for the story to be as good as it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was not disappointing and was actually one of my favourite endings of all the rpg maker horror games I\u2019ve played. It left you satisfied and gave a lot of room for your own imagination as to what happens after the ending. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion: If you\u2019re into dramatic psychological horror themes and want a good plot with interesting characters and a lot of character development, this should fit you very well.\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful for anyone having doubts about watching this anime. I hope it turns out well!",

            "content": "Watching Satsuriku no Tensei (Angels of Death) gave me perhaps one of the strangest impressions of this year. Set in a mysterious building, we immediately meet main female protagonist Rachel Gardner as she is confused about her whereabouts. It doesn\u2019t help that she has no memories except for her name. The show immediately drops viewers into this sort of storytelling out of nowhere and it\u2019s hard to take everything in from the start. Make no mistake. Satsuriku no Tensei is one of those shows where I lost count how many times I rolled my eyes and asked myself just exactly what the hell is goingon.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime is based on a video game, it also does really feel much like playing one. Rachel meets a serial killer named Zack who nearly kills her in the beginning. The show begins to build on its suspenseful plot here onwards as we learn about both characters. An important element of the series is the psychological thriller style of storytelling. The plot can be rather confusing as it sells its ideas through the psychology of the show. With Rachel being in a confused state, she begins to wonder her purpose in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus is Rachel and throughout the series, she wonders around the floors of this mysterious place with no memories. However, she isn\u2019t too desperate to escape and seemingly has a death wish. She mentions many times throughout the show of her desire to be killed by Zack. In order to accomplish that, she hopes to survive long enough and not get killed by anyone else. The anime presents her personality as being a calm girl with a lack of understanding about morality. She finds it difficult to express human emotions and often says what\u2019s on her mind. It\u2019s also noticeable that Rachel believes in the existence of God. In one particular episode, she declared Zack as her \u201cGod\u201d. A behavior like this is far from normal but the show emphasizes on her inhuman-like personality at every chance it gets. However, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Her partner in crime Zack tunes abnormality up to the 11. Known by his full name as Issac \u201cZack\u201d Foster, the series pushes the envelope to make him a serial killer. He has actually been involved in previous murder cases before and the show explores some of his past through flashbacks. If you\u2019ve seen his personality, then Zack would definitely be someone you hope to never run into in some dark alleyway. For his personality, Zack is bluntly rude and often uses foul language. He isn\u2019t very intelligent either and between the two, he is more of the muscle while Rachel has the brains. However, there\u2019s no doubt that Zack is mentally unstable and has survivalist instincts. The cause of his mentality is not exactly known and this feels more like a flaw of the show. The creators wants the audience to basically accept Zack for who he is without really getting us to understand him. In essence, I see Zack as a monster despite his alliance with Rachel. He\u2019s the type of guy that gets the thrill of killing without any true reason. However, Rachel does bring out some human-like emotions out of him when the duo are together. As odd as it seems, they are like two peas in a pod that are inseparable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show features a variety of characters with Zack and Rachel finding that out the hard way as they navigate through various floors. It really does feel like a role playing RPG and the more I watched this series, the more I felt compelled to see what events await them. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really express satisfaction at the characters they encounter on their dark adventure. It seems the show tries to make its entire character as inhuman as possible. First, we got Daniel Dickens, an insane doctor who has an unhealthy obsession for Rachel\u2019s eyes. Then, there\u2019s Eddie, a boy who wears a mask and is in love with making graves. Cathy is introduced as a floor master and someone I\u2019d describe as sadistic. She enjoys toying with others and inflict punishment for her own pleasure. Finally, there\u2019s Gray, a religious priest who loves to pass judgement on others. His actions in the show should be condemned as sinful as he attempts to burn Rachel alive at a stake. It feels like the creator wanted the viewers to hate these characters as much as possible. And if that was the intention, it succeeded. These supporting characters also feel like video game bosses as they are the main obstacle for Rachel and Zack to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nSo what now? Does Satsuriki no Tensei really work as an anime? Or does it fail like a half-polished video game filled with bugs that needs fixing? Honestly, I think it\u2019s a bit of both for the main TV series. I mention this because there are still 4 episodes left to debut in home release format. With 12 episodes, the show is incomplete without a proper conclusion. I have not played the game before but there have been some games I\u2019ve played that resembles this show. Games like The Evil Within reminds me of this series as it adheres to psychological horror and thriller. The downside is that I never did once get scared in this show because it\u2019s hardly any scary. Instead, the more accurate representation is more of a psychological thriller. The anime explores the human psyche as we see how these characters behave in unusual circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by J.C. Staff, you can easily tell that they were aiming for a dark and grimy setting. The uneasy feeling of the abandoned building and atmospheric feeling never leaves the show throughout the duration of its run. It paints the feeling of being trapped like a rat. Character designs in the series represent a creative style with our two main characters. First, there\u2019s Rachel with her petite stature and blonde hair. She wears a stripped shirt with a white sweater complete with black boots. In many ways, she actually looks rather normal although her character expressions are often devoid of feelings. On the other hand, Zack has the look of a homicidal maniac. Compared to Rachel, he is much taller and wears a hoodie. His signature weapon is a scythe that almost represents him as a living reaper. His character expressions throughout the series is malicious and he is known to break out of insane laughter from time to time. The other characters in this series are decorated with abnormal traits such as Daniel\u2019s freakish eyes, Eddie\u2019s burlap mask, or Gray\u2019s religious attire. The fact is, the creators definitely put their thought into making these characters distinctive as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs a psychological thriller, expect an eerie OST that\u2019s often quiet to bring an unsettling mood. Indeed, the mood of the show is often eerie even during some of the action segments. There are many moments when the music really amps up to make viewers feel like as if they are with them. Similarly, the theme songs contain cryptic lyrics that ceases every moment to make the show as uncomfortable as possible. Finally, I have to give praise to the voice talent in this series. Characters like Rachel and Zack are able to bring their characters fully to life despite their complex personalities. It\u2019s not easy to step into the shoes of an emotionless character like Rachel but I fully embraced her role if judging by her voice. Zack is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto who is well known for his role as Accelerator from the Index franchise. From this series, he displays his full talent to bring out Zack\u2019s personality to a menacing degree.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot more to be said about Satsuriku no Tensei but for its TV airing, the show is more of a base game. I\u2019d treat the reminding episode as DLC content to fully explore the story and give this anime a proper ending. Regardless, this show is not easily recommendable to anyone as the unusual style of storytelling will be difficult to get used to. It\u2019s sometimes not faint for the heart either if you\u2019re not comfortable with watching murder scenes. It almost feels like the creators are trying to get in our heads to see what we're thinking. I would say that giving this show is more suited for thrill seekers or those who watch this like playing a video game.",

            "content": "\"Don't take story ideas from 12 yr olds, or at least those who have the mental capacity of a 12 yr old.\"\r\nThe synopsis itself is promising, and in the hand of another writer there could've been a great story. But sadly, it just wasn't to be. Unlikable characters, predictable plot, lack of gore for something that's supposed to be scary, horrible dialogue and the worst jokes I've ever seen in an anime all contribute towards making this piece of shit the piece of shit it is.\r\nThese reasons all contribute towards my hate for this anime, but for me the most infuriating part about thisanime is how it treats it's viewers like retarded pieces of shit. WE DON'T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT RACHEL WANTS TO DIE! we knew that from the first episode, stop reminding us every 5 seconds. This is probably also the reason some people like it, since their brains can't really keep up with something more complicated than whatever a monkey with a typewriter can make. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, we get a little more in depth with the anime (some spoilers i guess):\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPure shit. nothing more. \\n\r\nThe story itself is really simple, Rachel wakes up suffering from amnesia, she doesn't remember how she got there, and then suddenly encounters our great villain/secondary protagonist Zack. He chases her around for a bit, but once she regains her soulless eyes he suddenly doesn't want to kill her. Then our lovely characters go through an adventure through each floor, encountering other stereotypical villains on their way to escape. The dialogue during the 2nd episode was really bad, there was also a scene where Zack asks her why she doesn't kill herself and her reply is \"because god says it's bad\"(god or religion will probably become really important later on, what a surprise). Then on the 3rd episode the murderous child offers to kill Rachel the soulless husk, but she denies because Zack swore to god that he'll kill her I guess?? Which makes me wonder, if she wants to die so much that she has withdrawal symptoms if she doesn't mention it every minute (during the 3rd episode she mentions or implies that she wants to die 8 fucking times), why didn't she take his offer?\\n\\n\r\nI basically skimmed through the 4th episode, so I can't really criticize anything. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGood. The best part about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOK. \\n\r\nI know some people find Zack's laugh annoying, but it doesn't really bother me and the voice acting is alright. If had any criticisms it would be the lack of atmospheric music. you sometimes need it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAbsolute dog shit, we never have any reason behind any of the villains actions other than \"hurr durr I'm evil\", Rachel is an unlikable soulless piece of shit and Zack is sorta alright I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI only sorta enjoyed the first episode, the rest made my blood boil.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's shit, don't watch it.",

            "content": "Satsuriku no Tenshi, or Angels of Death, was one of my most hyped and anticipated shows of the Summer season, because I have heard good things about the game that it originates from and its manga adaptation which replicates the game quite nicely. And now, the arrival of the anime adaptation of both the game and the manga...and its overall quality couldn't be more justified than just following the narratives of the game, so much so that I went to play the game and it certainly holds that into regard.\r\nThe story may just be your standard horror-adventure genre narration, but it has more substance thanthat. We follow 13-year-old Rachel \"Ray\" Gardner in her quest as she was taken into a basement for a counselling from witnessing murder in the face, that she wasn't meant to be there in the first place, and now is looking for means to escape and find her parents. It is there that she meets Isaac \"Zack\" Foster, a grim-reaper-looking bandaged man who is as mad as a serialist mass-murderer with a scythe, and in the process, tries to escape Zack by escaping to Basement 5, but gets messed up with her counsellor Daniel \"Danny\" Dickens for trying to encapsulate her colourful eyes, before being slain by Zack, and now both labelled as violators of the \"escape game\" and together they make their way up, working their own solutions and helping one another to stay out of harm's way.\\n\\n\r\nSo from the get-go, for people whom have either played the game or read the manga equivalent of the adaptation, I can say with certainty that you are definitely not disappointed with the exposition from the writing and pacing of the show. For anime-onlys however, this might be way too confusing to deal with at first, but the pacing progressively helps bring the core of the show along with it. It's tough but it's doable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Rachel and Isaac both are like horrors within themselves, with Rachel's constant wish for someone to kill her because of the nightmare that she went through, and now with the juxtaposition that her life has been one of dread and emotionless feels, so much so that she is displayed by her emotionless self, and Isaac being the M equivalent of a grim reaper feeling, that he cares for nothing but people's deaths upon his hands. And speaking of the VAs for both MCs, Rachel's VA might be a bit of an unknown (Haruga Chisuka, Akatsuki no Yona's Ki-ja, Owari no Seraph's Mikaela) but you sure as hell will know Isaac's VA (it's VERY obvious who he is but if you don't, it's HeroAca's Deku's buddy rival Bakugo), greatly love the emotions that both VAs bring towards their characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt-and-animation wise, of the J.C.Staff shows airing this season, this show has the best-looking and animation views of the surroundings, from the various floors of different expositions of the basement floor bosses personalities to the adventure-thriller-driven emotions of the characters. With that said, the quality unfortunately had to be cut out in certain spots (because it's public TV), but for the most part it holds and retains its source well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one area where to me it is very divisive. For the most part, Massaki Endou's OP was somewhat strange because of the mostly-shounen feels (he has done YuGiOh and Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar), but I I don't see that being justifiable for me yet. On the other hand, I absolutely love and adore the ED by Rachel's VA, that it got me hooked and dropping tears with the game in mind, it evoked the right sense of foreboding and emotions that toy the feels, So overall, ED > OP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the good shows of the Summer season, and I know some people just couldn't be afforded with the copious amounts of horror-adventure that just feels laid down and such. But if this is your thing, go ahead and watch this show, it's not a masterpiece but it's certainly a good watch.",

            "content": "So Angels of death used to say it had 16 episodes but they changed it to 12 and the rest are being released as videos. (is what I heard)\r\nAnyways beside that Angels of Death was really just okay. Doesn't really do anything special so it's just kinda average. Although I have my score as an 8 because really I did enjoy it. \r\nThe show has revolves around Rachel and Zack trying to get out of this building they're in and leave. They start at the bottom floor and just work their way up battling floor masters along the way. Each floor master having their ownweird interest in Rachel which gets weird and annoying fast. Not the battle themselves I think the floor master battles are interesting for the most part but it's the over excessive importance and obsession with Rachel which just gets annoying but again another one of my personal problems with the show. \\n\\n\r\nI think if you're just looking for a fun, fighting, edgy, and crazy show to watch then this show may not be the best choice as they're way more better ones out their but this one is also good if you already seen the other type of shows like this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall honestly was fun I really only liked Zack and that dude with the peanut like mask but that's not to say the other characters were bad though. Had a good time watching this and I think you will too.\\n",

            "content": "I gotta say, four episodes in and I am enthralled by the story... Heck, it's pilot even created a compelling storyline that I'd hate to miss.\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nIt sets the scene whereby the MC (I guess she's the MC) follows a progressive plot through, what I'd refer to as levels -I say levels since her \"spawn point\" is a basement from which she must navigate to go up a floor.\r\n-\r\nThis is affirmed by it's most recent episode.\r\n-\r\nFurthermore, it is a level because she has to escape what could potentially be her cause of death...\r\nBut that's not what got me into it, rather -straight off the bar-it had incorporated psychological elements that can only be further elaborated with each episode; this created the foundation for mental growth of the characters. But that's not all of what it would seem to be; whilst maintaining the theme of \"levels,\" it was quick to throw a wrench into the works and the dynamics of the anime had become growingly distorted -much of that distortion contributed to the already ambiguous storyline given... However this gave a sense of closure to the MCs story which made me think, \"seriously, you're gonna end it here!\"\\n\r\nI mean, it obviously didn't, but if they had allowed the protagonist to continue this devilish game allow for at least one and a half episodes would have more benefits to it than consequences; anyway, since it's only been three episode it's not done much harm either so... Meh.\\n\r\nSo, the reason why I rated the characters rather lowly in comparison to the other aspects of the anime is because they felt a bit lacklustre and fell flat in terms of depth... Due to its game-like progression, each character is given a specific role and does not display behaviour out of it's role; whilst I say this, there have been implications of dark secrets that each character carries -in my opinion, this is extremely suggestive of a more rounded character which we may learn of in future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nSo, for the story, it's built up quite nicely I would say; It gave us a good understanding of the story mechanics -or the mechanics that they want us to know (plot twists are fully welcome).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nArt, I gotta hand it to JC, they know how to make it work and with this anime, no less. I've not seen the source material so I've nothing to compare it to, but considering other anime e.g. Shokugeki no souma etc. it seems to be fairly consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKeeping true to the psychological/thriller genre, the suspense music doesn't fail to deliver... It was captivating and had sucked me in; I had become wary of what was to come, and that had inevitably heightened my reactions, making me vulnerable to being startled.\\n\r\nMoreover, we have bakugou's (Boku no hero academia) VA (okamoto nobuhiko) filling one of the characters positions, which to me, is a massive bonus as his voice has a tendency to act as a form of comic relief -and when considering the darker tropes this series seems to be adhering to, I feel that having such a voice actor will strike a balance to an anime akin to a seinen. But time will tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime had created an awesome opening guaranteed to pique the interest of further viewing for anyone that sits down to watch the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEdit*\\n\r\nI just found out that the source material is a game haha\ud83d\ude02. An' here I was goin' on about levels... I guess Ima go play this game now (if possible\ud83d\ude05).\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nThis review had been written during the pilot episode but is still relevant to all the aired episodes thus far.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who'd played the game and read the manga version of this series, I only have one advice for you: treat this anime like a love story. And also, it will get a lot better and those of you who're complaining about the lack of characterization... well, the amount of character development later on will overwhelm you to the point of suffocation.\r\nStory 8: The only reason I gave it a 8 is that the production team didn't include Eddie and Danny's backstory. If they did, I don't think so many people would be shitting on this anime at the moment. Also I feel thatthe anime changed this part too much. Zack was supposed to be gritting his teeth refusing to scream out in the beginning but slowly losing his control the more electricity he went through. The way the anime made him scream the entire part starts to irritate me after a while. And certain parts are dragged out too much. Other than that, the anime's following the game/manga plotline perfectly. I'm truly excited to see certain scenes animated. This story is THE best love story I'd ever read. The character interaction later on in the plot actually brought a tear to my eyes. And if you think it's predictable now? Well, try and predict the later plot then. Pff.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Making a crappy RPG game character design into something this magnificent. How can you give it any less? Those who thinks Zack's design is stereotypical? He has his reasons. The only reason I didn't give it a ten was that I like the way Zack's face was drawn in the manga more than in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: Love the voice actors. Zack, Ray, Eddie, Cathy... suits them perfectly. Spot on. No complaints. BGM can't be more fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: It's a nine cuz some character backstories are cut out, making them kind of bland (when theybreally aren't). Those who complains about shitty writing and lack of characterization for Ray? Keep watching. It'll prove you wrong. Ray is one of the deepest main character I've seen (partially because most of her characterization is related to religion and I'm an atheist so all those religion stuff she's saying is pretty confusing to me). And you'll understand later on why she wants to kill herself. Zack too isn't a one-dimensional psychopath wanting to kill. His story goes deeper than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: the fact that I anticipate this anime more than my current number 1 fav My Hero Academia's update shows just how much I'm enjoying this series. Would enjoy it a lot more if it followed the manga down to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 Cannot wait for the bang scene. And the bang bang bang in the end ;-) gamer you know what I'm talking about.\\n",

            "content": "* An analysis of the plot and characters until the first five episodes. *\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi is one of the animes managed to have more relevance this season for two reasons: for its duo of protagonists and because the season is loose, a season that only offers two sequels and more reasons to reaffirm how bad the modern anime is, for less innovative than to say it. \r\nAlthough the synopsis is already screaming at my ear that it is not going to be something specifically innovative to be of the genre and that starts strong using mediocre resources like misfortunes that happen because if orsituations with ridiculous backgrounds like the tests to which they are subjected, resources with Equally mediocre justifications, I have not seen works of this kind for a long time, so I can have sensations of amazement or who knows. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is easy to follow because it shows what is just and necessary, and implies that there are things to explain at another time better known as narrative shortcuts, not because it is the beginning but much of what can be said about the story is in the premise, is based on a problem and knowing how to conclude this, by the characteristics the strong point should be in\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nWhether or not interesting, they are 100% junk, it starts with a girl, Rachel Gardner who is supposed to be a normal person in an abnormal situation and is confused, well, it seems logical, there is a pseudo-killer who \"tries\" kill her but it has a strange fetish with facial expressions or something I managed to understand and the disinterest in living that arises in Rachel makes them end up forming a duo with the plan to escape, well. Other characters appear who are crazy or do not act at all normal with the aim of killing, or a peculiar definition of killing since everything revolves around death, these only serve as an obstacle, another reason to pay attention to those of the promise, that's their way of being within the psychological genre, with crazy people, good. \\n\r\nNobody can deny that \"promise\" of Rachel and Isaac is totally absurd, it makes sense until the part in which the two get what they want, but going back to the drastic change that arose in the protagonist, I thought that she was going to be the only thing that could be rescued from this anime, an exceptional principal but no, the best reaction he had was to become the lowest example of the Kuudere stereotype, only to be able to fit the context, perfect. So, up to this point the only moderately interesting thing to see is how the relationship between these two develops, I only want to know what excuse they are going to put so that in some way they empathize and end up all happy after so many misfits and whatever wait, although another less positive conclusion is equally possible but I always follow the basic prediction, I know it as the last resort; put romance because it always works to get attention. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that he tries with a doubtful effort to be what he is, an Anime of Horror, psychological, thriller, but I do not think he achieves it at all, it seems only an excuse to show blood and problems. The environment, the situation or the places are well worked although sometimes it has too much resemblance to the world of a videogame, with the armed scenarios and other things that can make it meaningless to be brought from the mechanics of a videogame. \\n\\n\r\nI never liked RPGs, most of those who have tried their game I guess they like this adaptation, but I think the correct thing is to see it as two different things and that none influence the other. \\n\\n\r\nI thought I would have more things to say about this, but the few things that this anime offered so far, added the disinterest and the little attention with which I saw the first five episodes left me saying obvious things and repeating ideas, I hope to see how continues this work, very unattractive, many stupid things that degrade the little that has quality, and a perfect opportunity to create fanarts of the alleged relationship and nothing, I just wanted to write about anime and just this had the wrapping.\\n\\n\r\nIf you noticed a misspelling, a badly constructed sentence, or if the review seemed like trash, keep in mind that it was translated from Spanish to English with little grace, thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Jesus Christ, how do these guys make money? \r\nI, much like you read the bio, and expected a GENIUS plotline. \r\nOnce again, Japanese films fail at what American filmworks and animation studios NAIL everytime. Character development and pacing. I....I watched three episodes of a none mystery anime and have ZERO idea of what it's even about. \r\nPro tip? Don't just SCREAM OUT A CHARACTERS ENTIRE ARC, BACKSTORY, AND PERSONALITY IN ONE EPISODE; IN ONE SCENE. Film is nothing more than an interesting way to convey information. Thats IT!!!! The rest is just extra stuff on the salad. If you need fried chicken strips to enjoyyour salad...well then eat a fricken chicken sandwich. Thats all this anime IS!!!! Bacon, and chicken strips sprinkled on it. Why is the character whose roll is to be interesting having his entire backstory presented in front of us.\\n\\n\r\nFight Scenes: Guns are so modernized and advanced vs. melee that you usually need a GINORMOUS reason not to include them in ANY mostly combat anime. They said \"Nah, scythes are cool!\"\\n\\n\r\nGood ideas? Don't ruin the entirety of your work by contradicting the main plot and character. Not really a SPOILER, but really the entire premise of the anime which is introduced from the beginning. Calm down. She wants to die? Fine, for whatever reason she isn't willing to do it herself they're MULTIPLE occasions where she has a chance.\\n\\n\r\nWhat killed it for me? The pacing and character development. The plot made no sense. Why is the character threatening the other character with death? She can die anytime she likes. \\n\\n\r\nSCREEN PLAY 101: Introduce EVERYTHING so you dont have any ass pulls. Ever since the genius that is ready player one? They find an interesting way to INTRODUCE EVERYTHING so you don't have any ass pulls. I.E. foreshadowing. Its awesome. It also pro typically builds the intensity tards.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, what really killed this anime was itself. I think it had MAJOR potential but the characters there just seem unnecessary. When you write a screenplay you want as much lettuce as possible. Then, the obvious salad dressing. Bacon, tomatoes, chicken and the other things aren't necessary. They're tools to drive the FLAVOR home.\\n\\n\r\nSpicy salad? Chicken would do well.\\n\\n\r\nRegular salad? No need for extras, fresh lettuce, a good dressing and maybe a vegetable like an onion to spice it up will do fine.",

            "content": "The premise of this anime is dreadful so far. The protagonist goes from being a regular person to a 2006 emo kid requesting to \"be killed because I want to die\" very quickly. This is incompatible with the telling of the story, given that every other character so far would jump at the opportunity to kill her and she really doesn't need the help of her buddy Zack just to die. I have little faith that at some point the story will justify this paradoxical behaviour later and will probably shoehorn something that will be lapped up regardless.\r\nCharacters are very flat without much development, theinteractions between Zack and Rachel don't make sense for what the audience probably assumes it will become. Any curveballs thrown will probably be poorly executed. On another note Zack's laughter sounds like he's a 14 y/o smoker of 50 years, absolutely grating on the ears and far too frequent such that it kills whatever mood is trying to be created.",

            "content": "My mother always said if you don't anything nice to say about someone, don't say anything at all. Thankfully, this nightmare (and not the scarey kind, ironically) isn't a person.\r\nThe summary is a cookie cutout of a typical mystery archetype / story setting. The amnesiac in a strange place. Then there's the weird anime twists with a murder with a scythe who laughs like a popcorn machine with a fork in it. Anyways, nothing overtly special or any red flags in the summary. Except for maybe that stupid little bit about fate. Doubt fate locked you in a building. Moving on. Why it's bad.\r\nThe mysteryas shown in the summary / template isn't anything inherently special. The story writer, the original author or whoever had most input in the anime clearly didn't do anything to improve on that lack of specialty. Nothing interesting or unpredictable happened. In fact it's was the exact opposite. Entirely predictable and boring. Something that kinda shouldn't happen in a mystery horror. The dialogue, events and motivations of characters are tragic. And not in the Romeo and Juliet sense. Mystery isn't an excuse for poor character building, and lack of background knowledge. The procedural, unchanging a repetitive events that last 2 - 4 episodes which only difference from the last arc is a new murderer on a new floor. The shoe horned, poorly thought out religious malformed mutations that embodies every stereotypical and unconvincing religious standpoint or assertion didn't help improve the series either. Lastly, the unsurprising, unoriginal and boring ending didn't improve upon any of the incredibly low bows this series set.\\n\\n\r\nEach floor's murder was uninteresting to say the least. Not ideal for a psychopathic killer in a building of psychopathic murderers. The only difference in their quality or interest to the main characters is due to their lack of presence in the overall story. Which ironically is a good thing. They were already glaringly hypocritical, illogical and or inconsistent. The lack of empathy, fear or genuine interest they inspired would only be compounded by a continued presence. If you switched the names, orders, faces, stories or anything you really want about them, it'd have essentially zero significant impact on the story. The only truly impactful side character is the priest, and his impact is just as rooted in illogical fallacy as are the actions and beliefs of Rachel, the moving doll who's only redeeming feature is she doesn't talk or make as much noise as Zack. The more I see of the dynamic duo of dipshits known as our main characters the more problems I have. Completely uninteresting, unoriginal, unchanging cookie cutter archetype side characters are better than completely uninteresting, unchanging, illogical and irritating main characters. Zack is irritating to say the least. He's exactly what'd you expect a teenager would imagine a teenage murderer to be. He, like all of the characters, is uninteresting and has little originality. Aside from his backstory, which is neither good nor exceptionally bad, he lacks depth and personality or change. It's like someone took Jason and animified him. Rachel on the other hand has literally had no personality. There was nothing interesting about her, her backstory or her actions. She's inconsistent and illogical. Wants to die, but suicide is wrong. Killing people? Eh whatever. Oh this psychopathic murderer will kill me if I help him? Perfect. No problems. This other psychopathic murderer will kill me? Nope. No good, the first one already promised god. Her fundamental perception and practice of religion is insulting even to me as a non believer, I can only imagine how irritating it'd be an actual respectable theologian, not that bad stereotype of a Messiah complex evil priest.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even need to say anything about the voice acting. Zack's voice and laughing makes me want to gouge out my ears with a pair of chopsticks. It's not intimidating or scary. If I heard that in the dark I wouldn't run for the hills. I'd tell the fucker to shut up and cut out his vocal cords if he tried to kill me with his gardening tools. Not exactly what a murderer's 'evil laugh' should inspire. Rachel's entire personality was nothing. Flat, emotionless and unchanging. Guess having no standards is one way to avoid criticism. \\n\r\nI've seriously seen characters who don't talk AT ALL that have better voice acting than Rachel. High Score Girl's Oono is a perfect example. More emotion is conveyed in essentially coughs, grunts and literally no words than any and every word Rachel uttered. As for music. Everyone knows music is a key part of horror and suspense. Doesn't hurt mystery either. This anime lacked any suspense and the lack of good music certainly contributed to that lack of suspense. A pathetic and easy to avoid failure on this anime's part that would have greatly contributed to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nIt was entirely too hard for me to find any enjoyment in a story devoid of consistency or logic but with plenty of plot armor. Blood loss apparently doesn't exist in this world.\\n\r\nThe repetitive story, background and general events, lack of atmosphere and good music, and pathetic characters and character past & building. Then religion, an incredibly difficult topic to discuss seriously, being portrayed in such a laughable and contemptible manner compounded the irritating nature of the series and just stacked up on top of the other glaring issues of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a fools idea of good mystery and a child's idea of a good horror anime. It's basically what you'd get if you asked for a fanfiction of Beauty and the Beast from a weaboo. There's not much to say. It's bad. I could go on and on, put in more effort, but this show is just so comically and unapologetically bad, I don't feel it deserves anymore effort. Unless you like everything from ebola to retardation in physical form, such as the Paul brothers, don't watch this. It's not worth the time, energy or brain cells. It's the worst show to air this season. Maybe even this year. The only happiness I got from this series is when I found out it was 12 episodes instead of 16.\\n",

            "content": "What should you be expecting from Satsuriku no Tenshi? A promise between a pure murderer and a mysterious girl and their journey together, mixed with some self-discovery. \r\nI first took notice of this series in the Summer 2018 lineup. The synopsis intrigued me so much, I read the manga and watched a complete playthrough of the game. The anime adaption, so far, is faithful to the source. It draws primarily from the manga but the released episodes have taught me they\u2019re ready to adapt little things to fit a big screen. \r\nEpisode 1 was fast-paced and edgy while later episodes settle into a more relaxedatmosphere. Our main characters reveal their true colours-- Zack is a goofy madman, while Rachel does a 180 and becomes a monotonous doll. The reason for her mood change was confusing (basically Rachel remembered something) so I felt the anime should have made it clearer. To be fair, it was never fully explained in the game nor in the manga, and it is difficult to explain without spoiling. One thing I noticed is that they skipped backstories for some characters (shame) but if it was a necessary sacrifice to adapt everything.\\n\\n\r\nI love the light sprinkling of humour. Some may find it off putting but it adds to the interesting relationship between Rachel and Zack. Some also find the constant repeating of \u2018kill me\u2019 and \u2018swear to god\u2019 annoying but trust me, it eases off over time and the characters (namely Zack) does comment on it. \\n\\n\r\nJC Staff did a good job on the anime because I really dig the aesthetics of the show. I also like the use of effects; it gives a polished, modern look. (wish they toned down the yellow filter/glow thing\u2026) Character designs stay consistent and faithful to the original ones and did I mention how much I love their eyes? Eyes (\u2018peepers\u2019 lol) were prominent in the original game: the heterochromia of both Zack and Danny, the light in Rachel\u2019s eyes and the piercing blue of her eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the OP and ED. Opening \u2018Vital\u2019 is sung by Endoh Masaaki and written by Jin. Ending \u2018Pray\u2019 is sung by Chisuga Haruka (VA of Rachel) and written by DECO*27. Both are sung by accomplished singers and written by popular vocaloid producers (HYPE). I don\u2019t know how to judge music but to my ears, both themes fit the anime well! The visuals are also impressive. I love the nod to the original chara designs at the beginning and the signboard holding at the end of the OP; whereas in the ED I love the footprints and the English words that correspond to the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I did not find the game particularly gripping or life-changing. It\u2019s really not as amazing as people make it out to be >< Nonetheless, it is a breath of fresh air from recent anime. If the anime keeps the original spirit of the source, adapts parts of the game to better suit a anime and makes full use of its medium, it could well be considered anime of the season(barring certain popular sequels\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that horror and puzzle-solving will not play a big part! I\u2019ve seen many people classify it as a horror anime but the horror in here is tame. Be prepared to be disappointed if you were expecting a groundbreaking psychological thriller. To me, the main selling point of this series was that it was short and satisfying, with the right amount of edginess and completeness. There are way too many light novel/manga adaptations nowadays that adapt one tiny bit source leaving many loose ends but Angels of Death is sourced from a game, which means you can experience the whole story in one perfect 16-ep package. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Satsuriku no Tenshi? Yes, but I recommend playing the game/watching a walkthrough of the game first. (If you want to experience both game and manga, do game first. The quality of art between the two is astounding. Not that game art is bad. It's endearing. But I digress.) Satsuriku no Tenshi is a series that benefits from rewatching as it creates a better experience and clears up many confusions. So give Satsuriku no Tenshi a chance because ultimately it is worth watching\u2661\\n",

I expected so much more but it ended up being an edgy \"humorous\" mess I can only imagine 13 year olds can enjoy. \r\nSo lets start of with our main character rachel gardner who just loves to remind the audience that she really wants to die BUT it can only be done by isaac becouse \"he swore it to god\" or some crap like that. This gets annoying very fast and I just couldnt help but think \"yeahI get it now, you want to die\" every time she said how much she wanted to die, also the reason why it must be done by isaac is complete bull crap and is only there for convenience so the anime can exist for more than 3 episodes. Maybe there is a deeper reason for all this but I just cant bring my self to watch any more of this disaster of an anime. Also, what is up with the tone of this anime. It tries to be a horror anime but at the same time it tries to throw in \"funny\" jokes in moments that would other wise be quite intense. The animation is decent I guess it doesnt really have anything special or note worthy, except for the thousands of cgi doors that look really out of place and weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe good things I can say about this anime is that its op and ending are pretty nice and the first episode also was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nI know I probably should finish the anime and see if it gets better but I just cant bring my self to watch this mess of an anime any longer, and trust me I wanted to love this anime, I mean just look at isaacs design and the premise looked pretty neat. But it just fails so hard and I just cant help but feel disappointed about this anime. I qould give this anime an 4/10 becouse it does have some nice things in it but the bad just really outshines the good in this anime",

            "content": "Watching \"Angels of Death\" was quite a tumultuous journey, and I don't mean emotionally. Now, I won't go into massive detail about the plot, since the synopsis is right on the page; it would be redundant of me to make you read it twice. However, I will discuss the things I liked and the things I disliked about this anime. \r\nFirst, the things I disliked. For starters, the animation in the opening wasn't as fluid as I'm used to. It was kind of snappy and abrupt, rather than flowy and smooth. However, I did get used to this rather quickly. Another thing that I didn'tlike too much was the constant talk about God. Now, I am a Christian, so I do believe in God; however, I don't get offended when people don't believe. For me, the constant talk about \"be my God\" and \"there is no God\" and \"you swore to God\" just seemed...unnecessary to the story. Like, I realize why it was there, but it just came off as pseudo-deep. I rolled my eyes quite a few times, especially when it was talked about continuously throughout an episode. I also didn't like Rachel's character too much at first. I found her annoying. It got better, though. Finally, I won't give spoilers since it's a relatively new show, but the ending left me pretty disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the things I liked. For one thing, I really enjoyed the mystery surrounding Rachel's past. I was pretty satisfied with it when it was revealed. This goes for Zack's past, too, though his backstory was more emotional for me. This leads to my next point: the characters. Though not all of them were my favorite, there were two shining stars for me: Zack and Eddie. Zack was easily my favorite part of the anime. He was funny, cool, brash, and protective. He had a tough exterior, but like Rachel said near the end, \"He's not a monster. He's a human.\" A human with a heart of gold, if you ask me. He was also pretty sexy, so that helped out a lot. Eddie, despite being a psychopath, was just really adorable and likable. I actually felt bad for him, despite how murderous he was. I also grew to like Rachel near the end, which is a good thing. Another thing I liked was the relationship between Rachel and Zack. Though initially involved in a Predator-Prey dynamic, their relationship evolved into something morbidly sweeter than that. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried during their exchange in Episode 15. The OP and the ED were both excellent, though the ED takes the cake for me. It was beautifully sung by the woman who voiced Rachel in the Sub. Rachel's theme was also very beautiful. The artwork was really nice, and the animation was actually pretty fluid in the show, unlike in the OP. Finally, I really enjoyed the character development that took place in Rachel and Zack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a rather frustrating watch for me. Though it was good, it waited until Zack's backstory episode and the second-to-last episode to really show some emotion. When it did, I loved it; other than that, it was just pretty good. The pretentious talk about God really brought the show down for me until Zack and Rachel had a heart-to-heart about it. Rachel was so annoying sometimes that I nearly quit watching. However, despite all of this, the good outweighs the bad. The mystery was fun, some of the characters were great, the character development was refreshing, the music was beautiful, and the relationship between the two main characters was great to witness. So, with all of this in mind, I had fun with this one, and I do recommend it if you can be patient with it. I'm sure you'll find some enjoyment in it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10",

            "content": "For over a decade now, the anime industry has been producing one series a season that deserves the highly appreciated title of ironic masterpiece. This time around it's a show about suicidal loli and a massmurderer who refuses to kill her. And it has everything. When I say everything, what I really mean is e v e r y t h i n g, and I have been laughing my butt sore since episode 1. \r\nOur story starts off in a spooky hospital where security cameras garnish the walls every 3 inches, doors close behind people's back like it is Ghost Hunt, and possessed typewritersare the ones asking all the questions that matter since our characters don't even bother trying as they are too busy planning to kill themselves. It's bad? No, it's the peak of self-awareness. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual events focus around some floor master shit fights because the entire series is based on a video game that was created with goddamn RPG Maker's free trial edition. Need a better prove of quality? That's what I thought. The entire story is real mysterious and apparently everything in it symbolizes some religious nonsense hence why all the 3 different English titles of the show have the word \"Angel\" in them. Essentially this is lot like Evangelion except fun to watch because the mc only has one mental illness and one of the characters has a pumpkin as a head. \\n\\n\r\nOur cast is beyond incredible. Rachel is surprisingly non-annoying for a 13 yo child who is in angst (even if her every 3rd line consist of the word \"kill\" and \"me\"). Isaac Foster is the perfect representation of a generic horror psychopath from any horror game you play on easy and the murderer is an NPC. He also owns a cool scythe and I laugh similarly as he whenever he does anything. His laugh is real sick, reminds me of Orihara Izaya from Durararararara. +1 for seiyuu work. Daniel Dickens is the best character. I have had a blast using the phrase \"the plot Dickens\" when ever he does anything. MVP material right there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also beyond incredible. Especially the tight and dark spaces really do add to the overall atmosphere. I mentioned Ghost Hunt earlier and that was favorite horror comedy before this one became a thing. The best arc from that anime takes place in a building highly similar to the architecture in which the entire story of Satsuriku no Tenshi takes part in except more floors this time around. Some of the floors really do offer that video game feeling where the series is its own thing and that manages to serve the immersion the work has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this Satsuriku no Tenshi offered genuine entertainment. Some of it can be seen to be silly, but I found all of that just add to the overall experience. For example, the dialogue and angst that is best shown in the repetition of the two lines \"kill me\" and \"no\" is nothing less than comedic gold, and such lousy cliches as memoryloss were taken exactly as seriouly with this series as they always should be dealt it. Meaning not seriously at all. \\n\\n\r\nJ.C.Staff has been fixing their reputation their best since the Rie Kugumiya's loli tsundere era, and thus far, Satsuriku no Tenshi is yet another show from them that looks mediocre, but is everything but. Don't let the criticism ruin the fun as this is what entertainment truly means.",

            "content": "*I have only watched the anime, not the manga or game. Thus, this review will be based on the anime alone*\r\nAfter having completely finished the anime, I can safely say that Satsuriku no Tenshi is one of the most frustrating horror animes I\u2019ve ever watched. From the very start of the show, there have been a myriad of flaws involving plot, dialogue, and character development, all resulting in a trainwreck of a show, which is really a shame because it had such an interesting premise.\r\nPlot (1/10): The plot to this anime is one of the worst I have ever seen and most of its issuesbegin with it\u2019s progression, or rather, the utter lack of it. Right from the beginning and up to halfway through the story, we can see this show following a typical formula: villian shows up -> zack does something stupid -> Rachel finds a solution -> more talking about killing and then not killing. The \u2018mystery\u2019 in the show is awfully boring, with the clues being vague and pretentious, constantly talking again and again about \u2018sins\u2019 and \u2018god\u2019 but adding nothing to the story. Actually that\u2019s the perfect word to describe this shitty show. It\u2019s vague. Really vague. It always felt like it wanted to impress the audience by being \u2018intelligent\u2019 so instead of slowly revealing things to the audience (like a good thriller should), it keeps on sprouting ambiguous and often nonsensical details. In my opinion, this show would do better if it was more straightforward so the viewer would get engrossed in the mystery and its progression.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem I had with Angels of Death (and probably the most noticeable one) is its repetitive, boring, and edgy dialogue. Basically, it goes something like this:\\n\\n\r\nRachel: I want to die. Can you kill me?\\n\r\nZack: Your expression is boring. I\u2019ll kill you when we get outside.\\n\r\nRachel: Can you kill me?\\n\r\nZack: What the hell are you talking about? I said I don\u2019t want to kill you.\\n\\n\r\nOMG. JUST KILL HER ALREADY!!\\n\\n\r\n(sorry that was me ranting) All of the dialogue in the story is basically 1) stuff that is really vague 2) stuff we already knew. It\u2019s like it can\u2019t even tell the intelligence of the audience. The whole thing feels like it's constantly going around in circles, with no meaning or wittiness. We KNOW Rachel wants to die. We KNOW the doc has a crazy eye fetish. Just tell us something important already!!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10): For a J.C Staff show, the art is surprisingly pretty. It uses a nice color palette and Rachel\u2019s character design was very attractive. Although Zack and the other villains character design do look somewhat generic, I\u2019m willing to give this section a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10): This department is pretty subjective, but I felt the music in this show to be rather average. It\u2019s not bad, but not very good either. I liked the voice actor for Rachel, but Zack\u2019s voice was straight-up annoying and honestly, I felt like punching his stupid face everytime I hear that voice of his. The villains\u2019 voices also felt extremely annoying, with their over-the-top laughter and eccentric attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10): Our female protagonist, Rachel, is the only one in the entire cast who didn\u2019t manage to annoy me. That\u2019s not to say she\u2019s a good character though. In the entire anime she was bland and emotionless and lacked any type of character development. Overall, she\u2019s the classic kuudere archetype but nothing to make her interesting. We learn nothing about her throughout the entire story, only that she wants to die. We don\u2019t know why she wants to die, what was accountable for her 180 in the story, or even her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist Zack isn\u2019t any better, if not worse. Loud, impulsive, and often temperamental, he\u2019s basically your \u2018all brawn no brain\u2019 male archetype. He adds nothing to the story, is often very stupid, and is definitely one of the most annoying characters I\u2019ve seen. Not to mention, his \u2018tragic backstory\u2019 is one I found to be very generic and a cheap way for viewers to pity him. Overall, it\u2019s not enough to develop his character or make him into a more complex person. Nobody\u2019s expecting an amazing and deep backstory like Kiritsugu\u2019s or even Akashi\u2019s but it\u2019s like this show doesn\u2019t even try. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains were all badly made and were all \u2018psychos\u2019 with crazy laughs and no personality. They all want to kill the 2 mc\u2019s but for no reason. They were also involved in some stupid plot twist which brought them back to life even though it was stated that they died.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10): I actually enjoyed some parts of the show but most of the time it just felt tedious and uninteresting. Unlike other bad thrillers like mirai nikki or kakegurui, this isn\u2019t very entertaining and is not worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "I've watched a whole let's play of the original Indie game. I already know the whole story and what to expect. To those who say the characters are two-dimensional... I can see why you'd think that. I disagree because there is a degree of character development that will become apparent if you stick around long enough. Know too that the story IS that predictable. However you think the story is going to turn out, you're probably going to be correct in at least one regarded aspect. Despite that, it's still fun. There's a certain level of early 2000's edginess in here. It's dark, bloody, gritty,and full of psychotic laughter.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: A young girl named Rachel Gardner wakes up without any memories and finds herself trapped in a building with several floors. She meets the serial killer Isaac Foster who tries to kill her but fails. Later on Rachel no longer wishes to live and asks Isaac if he could kill her. He agrees to kill her as long as she helps him escape the building. So Isaac and Rachel has to try to \u201cbeat\u201d all the different floors and find a way to escape.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just simply love horror, this first episode was probably very entertaining and gave you hope for the series.\\n\r\nBut if you want dramatic horror with a good story and characters, this episode might have given you some doubts.\\n\\n\r\nFor me it seemed very confusing at first, I had so many questions and it felt like the story wasn\u2019t very well planned and was just supposed to be random and scary. However I was very wrong and I ended up liking the plot and the characters a lot more than I expected. \\n\r\nBut as I said, I was very confused in the beginning and had no hope for the story.\\n\r\nWhy are they trapped in a building? Who trapped them? Why does the girl want to die all of a sudden? Why do they have to beat these floors?\\n\r\nEverything that seems confusing in the beginning is explained later and the plot is actually very interesting. It is not just a scary horror story. It is progressive and with time it gets more dramatic. \\n\r\nPlus there\u2019s a LOT of character development so I hope they keep it that way in the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nZack (Isaac Foster) the serial killer is not the average crazy aggressive killer who doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything. Well he is aggressive, crazy and very short tempered but he also becomes a very fun and interesting character which you\u2019ll learn a lot about throughout the story. (He is my favourite character because of his character development)\\n\\n\r\nRay (Rachel Gardner) was for me, a very confusing character since I didn\u2019t know why she wanted to end her life so badly. But with time, she shows more of her personality and in the end you find out her story and why she desires death.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters has very unique personalities and what made me happy was that none of them felt unnecessary. It felt like each and every one of them were needed in some way for the story to be as good as it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was not disappointing and was actually one of my favourite endings of all the rpg maker horror games I\u2019ve played. It left you satisfied and gave a lot of room for your own imagination as to what happens after the ending. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion: If you\u2019re into dramatic psychological horror themes and want a good plot with interesting characters and a lot of character development, this should fit you very well.\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful for anyone having doubts about watching this anime. I hope it turns out well!",

            "content": "Watching Satsuriku no Tensei (Angels of Death) gave me perhaps one of the strangest impressions of this year. Set in a mysterious building, we immediately meet main female protagonist Rachel Gardner as she is confused about her whereabouts. It doesn\u2019t help that she has no memories except for her name. The show immediately drops viewers into this sort of storytelling out of nowhere and it\u2019s hard to take everything in from the start. Make no mistake. Satsuriku no Tensei is one of those shows where I lost count how many times I rolled my eyes and asked myself just exactly what the hell is goingon.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime is based on a video game, it also does really feel much like playing one. Rachel meets a serial killer named Zack who nearly kills her in the beginning. The show begins to build on its suspenseful plot here onwards as we learn about both characters. An important element of the series is the psychological thriller style of storytelling. The plot can be rather confusing as it sells its ideas through the psychology of the show. With Rachel being in a confused state, she begins to wonder her purpose in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus is Rachel and throughout the series, she wonders around the floors of this mysterious place with no memories. However, she isn\u2019t too desperate to escape and seemingly has a death wish. She mentions many times throughout the show of her desire to be killed by Zack. In order to accomplish that, she hopes to survive long enough and not get killed by anyone else. The anime presents her personality as being a calm girl with a lack of understanding about morality. She finds it difficult to express human emotions and often says what\u2019s on her mind. It\u2019s also noticeable that Rachel believes in the existence of God. In one particular episode, she declared Zack as her \u201cGod\u201d. A behavior like this is far from normal but the show emphasizes on her inhuman-like personality at every chance it gets. However, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Her partner in crime Zack tunes abnormality up to the 11. Known by his full name as Issac \u201cZack\u201d Foster, the series pushes the envelope to make him a serial killer. He has actually been involved in previous murder cases before and the show explores some of his past through flashbacks. If you\u2019ve seen his personality, then Zack would definitely be someone you hope to never run into in some dark alleyway. For his personality, Zack is bluntly rude and often uses foul language. He isn\u2019t very intelligent either and between the two, he is more of the muscle while Rachel has the brains. However, there\u2019s no doubt that Zack is mentally unstable and has survivalist instincts. The cause of his mentality is not exactly known and this feels more like a flaw of the show. The creators wants the audience to basically accept Zack for who he is without really getting us to understand him. In essence, I see Zack as a monster despite his alliance with Rachel. He\u2019s the type of guy that gets the thrill of killing without any true reason. However, Rachel does bring out some human-like emotions out of him when the duo are together. As odd as it seems, they are like two peas in a pod that are inseparable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show features a variety of characters with Zack and Rachel finding that out the hard way as they navigate through various floors. It really does feel like a role playing RPG and the more I watched this series, the more I felt compelled to see what events await them. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really express satisfaction at the characters they encounter on their dark adventure. It seems the show tries to make its entire character as inhuman as possible. First, we got Daniel Dickens, an insane doctor who has an unhealthy obsession for Rachel\u2019s eyes. Then, there\u2019s Eddie, a boy who wears a mask and is in love with making graves. Cathy is introduced as a floor master and someone I\u2019d describe as sadistic. She enjoys toying with others and inflict punishment for her own pleasure. Finally, there\u2019s Gray, a religious priest who loves to pass judgement on others. His actions in the show should be condemned as sinful as he attempts to burn Rachel alive at a stake. It feels like the creator wanted the viewers to hate these characters as much as possible. And if that was the intention, it succeeded. These supporting characters also feel like video game bosses as they are the main obstacle for Rachel and Zack to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nSo what now? Does Satsuriki no Tensei really work as an anime? Or does it fail like a half-polished video game filled with bugs that needs fixing? Honestly, I think it\u2019s a bit of both for the main TV series. I mention this because there are still 4 episodes left to debut in home release format. With 12 episodes, the show is incomplete without a proper conclusion. I have not played the game before but there have been some games I\u2019ve played that resembles this show. Games like The Evil Within reminds me of this series as it adheres to psychological horror and thriller. The downside is that I never did once get scared in this show because it\u2019s hardly any scary. Instead, the more accurate representation is more of a psychological thriller. The anime explores the human psyche as we see how these characters behave in unusual circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by J.C. Staff, you can easily tell that they were aiming for a dark and grimy setting. The uneasy feeling of the abandoned building and atmospheric feeling never leaves the show throughout the duration of its run. It paints the feeling of being trapped like a rat. Character designs in the series represent a creative style with our two main characters. First, there\u2019s Rachel with her petite stature and blonde hair. She wears a stripped shirt with a white sweater complete with black boots. In many ways, she actually looks rather normal although her character expressions are often devoid of feelings. On the other hand, Zack has the look of a homicidal maniac. Compared to Rachel, he is much taller and wears a hoodie. His signature weapon is a scythe that almost represents him as a living reaper. His character expressions throughout the series is malicious and he is known to break out of insane laughter from time to time. The other characters in this series are decorated with abnormal traits such as Daniel\u2019s freakish eyes, Eddie\u2019s burlap mask, or Gray\u2019s religious attire. The fact is, the creators definitely put their thought into making these characters distinctive as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs a psychological thriller, expect an eerie OST that\u2019s often quiet to bring an unsettling mood. Indeed, the mood of the show is often eerie even during some of the action segments. There are many moments when the music really amps up to make viewers feel like as if they are with them. Similarly, the theme songs contain cryptic lyrics that ceases every moment to make the show as uncomfortable as possible. Finally, I have to give praise to the voice talent in this series. Characters like Rachel and Zack are able to bring their characters fully to life despite their complex personalities. It\u2019s not easy to step into the shoes of an emotionless character like Rachel but I fully embraced her role if judging by her voice. Zack is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto who is well known for his role as Accelerator from the Index franchise. From this series, he displays his full talent to bring out Zack\u2019s personality to a menacing degree.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot more to be said about Satsuriku no Tensei but for its TV airing, the show is more of a base game. I\u2019d treat the reminding episode as DLC content to fully explore the story and give this anime a proper ending. Regardless, this show is not easily recommendable to anyone as the unusual style of storytelling will be difficult to get used to. It\u2019s sometimes not faint for the heart either if you\u2019re not comfortable with watching murder scenes. It almost feels like the creators are trying to get in our heads to see what we're thinking. I would say that giving this show is more suited for thrill seekers or those who watch this like playing a video game.",

            "content": "\"Don't take story ideas from 12 yr olds, or at least those who have the mental capacity of a 12 yr old.\"\r\nThe synopsis itself is promising, and in the hand of another writer there could've been a great story. But sadly, it just wasn't to be. Unlikable characters, predictable plot, lack of gore for something that's supposed to be scary, horrible dialogue and the worst jokes I've ever seen in an anime all contribute towards making this piece of shit the piece of shit it is.\r\nThese reasons all contribute towards my hate for this anime, but for me the most infuriating part about thisanime is how it treats it's viewers like retarded pieces of shit. WE DON'T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT RACHEL WANTS TO DIE! we knew that from the first episode, stop reminding us every 5 seconds. This is probably also the reason some people like it, since their brains can't really keep up with something more complicated than whatever a monkey with a typewriter can make. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, we get a little more in depth with the anime (some spoilers i guess):\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPure shit. nothing more. \\n\r\nThe story itself is really simple, Rachel wakes up suffering from amnesia, she doesn't remember how she got there, and then suddenly encounters our great villain/secondary protagonist Zack. He chases her around for a bit, but once she regains her soulless eyes he suddenly doesn't want to kill her. Then our lovely characters go through an adventure through each floor, encountering other stereotypical villains on their way to escape. The dialogue during the 2nd episode was really bad, there was also a scene where Zack asks her why she doesn't kill herself and her reply is \"because god says it's bad\"(god or religion will probably become really important later on, what a surprise). Then on the 3rd episode the murderous child offers to kill Rachel the soulless husk, but she denies because Zack swore to god that he'll kill her I guess?? Which makes me wonder, if she wants to die so much that she has withdrawal symptoms if she doesn't mention it every minute (during the 3rd episode she mentions or implies that she wants to die 8 fucking times), why didn't she take his offer?\\n\\n\r\nI basically skimmed through the 4th episode, so I can't really criticize anything. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGood. The best part about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOK. \\n\r\nI know some people find Zack's laugh annoying, but it doesn't really bother me and the voice acting is alright. If had any criticisms it would be the lack of atmospheric music. you sometimes need it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAbsolute dog shit, we never have any reason behind any of the villains actions other than \"hurr durr I'm evil\", Rachel is an unlikable soulless piece of shit and Zack is sorta alright I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI only sorta enjoyed the first episode, the rest made my blood boil.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's shit, don't watch it.",

            "content": "Satsuriku no Tenshi, or Angels of Death, was one of my most hyped and anticipated shows of the Summer season, because I have heard good things about the game that it originates from and its manga adaptation which replicates the game quite nicely. And now, the arrival of the anime adaptation of both the game and the manga...and its overall quality couldn't be more justified than just following the narratives of the game, so much so that I went to play the game and it certainly holds that into regard.\r\nThe story may just be your standard horror-adventure genre narration, but it has more substance thanthat. We follow 13-year-old Rachel \"Ray\" Gardner in her quest as she was taken into a basement for a counselling from witnessing murder in the face, that she wasn't meant to be there in the first place, and now is looking for means to escape and find her parents. It is there that she meets Isaac \"Zack\" Foster, a grim-reaper-looking bandaged man who is as mad as a serialist mass-murderer with a scythe, and in the process, tries to escape Zack by escaping to Basement 5, but gets messed up with her counsellor Daniel \"Danny\" Dickens for trying to encapsulate her colourful eyes, before being slain by Zack, and now both labelled as violators of the \"escape game\" and together they make their way up, working their own solutions and helping one another to stay out of harm's way.\\n\\n\r\nSo from the get-go, for people whom have either played the game or read the manga equivalent of the adaptation, I can say with certainty that you are definitely not disappointed with the exposition from the writing and pacing of the show. For anime-onlys however, this might be way too confusing to deal with at first, but the pacing progressively helps bring the core of the show along with it. It's tough but it's doable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Rachel and Isaac both are like horrors within themselves, with Rachel's constant wish for someone to kill her because of the nightmare that she went through, and now with the juxtaposition that her life has been one of dread and emotionless feels, so much so that she is displayed by her emotionless self, and Isaac being the M equivalent of a grim reaper feeling, that he cares for nothing but people's deaths upon his hands. And speaking of the VAs for both MCs, Rachel's VA might be a bit of an unknown (Haruga Chisuka, Akatsuki no Yona's Ki-ja, Owari no Seraph's Mikaela) but you sure as hell will know Isaac's VA (it's VERY obvious who he is but if you don't, it's HeroAca's Deku's buddy rival Bakugo), greatly love the emotions that both VAs bring towards their characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt-and-animation wise, of the J.C.Staff shows airing this season, this show has the best-looking and animation views of the surroundings, from the various floors of different expositions of the basement floor bosses personalities to the adventure-thriller-driven emotions of the characters. With that said, the quality unfortunately had to be cut out in certain spots (because it's public TV), but for the most part it holds and retains its source well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one area where to me it is very divisive. For the most part, Massaki Endou's OP was somewhat strange because of the mostly-shounen feels (he has done YuGiOh and Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar), but I I don't see that being justifiable for me yet. On the other hand, I absolutely love and adore the ED by Rachel's VA, that it got me hooked and dropping tears with the game in mind, it evoked the right sense of foreboding and emotions that toy the feels, So overall, ED > OP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the good shows of the Summer season, and I know some people just couldn't be afforded with the copious amounts of horror-adventure that just feels laid down and such. But if this is your thing, go ahead and watch this show, it's not a masterpiece but it's certainly a good watch.",

            "content": "So Angels of death used to say it had 16 episodes but they changed it to 12 and the rest are being released as videos. (is what I heard)\r\nAnyways beside that Angels of Death was really just okay. Doesn't really do anything special so it's just kinda average. Although I have my score as an 8 because really I did enjoy it. \r\nThe show has revolves around Rachel and Zack trying to get out of this building they're in and leave. They start at the bottom floor and just work their way up battling floor masters along the way. Each floor master having their ownweird interest in Rachel which gets weird and annoying fast. Not the battle themselves I think the floor master battles are interesting for the most part but it's the over excessive importance and obsession with Rachel which just gets annoying but again another one of my personal problems with the show. \\n\\n\r\nI think if you're just looking for a fun, fighting, edgy, and crazy show to watch then this show may not be the best choice as they're way more better ones out their but this one is also good if you already seen the other type of shows like this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall honestly was fun I really only liked Zack and that dude with the peanut like mask but that's not to say the other characters were bad though. Had a good time watching this and I think you will too.\\n",

            "content": "I gotta say, four episodes in and I am enthralled by the story... Heck, it's pilot even created a compelling storyline that I'd hate to miss.\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nIt sets the scene whereby the MC (I guess she's the MC) follows a progressive plot through, what I'd refer to as levels -I say levels since her \"spawn point\" is a basement from which she must navigate to go up a floor.\r\n-\r\nThis is affirmed by it's most recent episode.\r\n-\r\nFurthermore, it is a level because she has to escape what could potentially be her cause of death...\r\nBut that's not what got me into it, rather -straight off the bar-it had incorporated psychological elements that can only be further elaborated with each episode; this created the foundation for mental growth of the characters. But that's not all of what it would seem to be; whilst maintaining the theme of \"levels,\" it was quick to throw a wrench into the works and the dynamics of the anime had become growingly distorted -much of that distortion contributed to the already ambiguous storyline given... However this gave a sense of closure to the MCs story which made me think, \"seriously, you're gonna end it here!\"\\n\r\nI mean, it obviously didn't, but if they had allowed the protagonist to continue this devilish game allow for at least one and a half episodes would have more benefits to it than consequences; anyway, since it's only been three episode it's not done much harm either so... Meh.\\n\r\nSo, the reason why I rated the characters rather lowly in comparison to the other aspects of the anime is because they felt a bit lacklustre and fell flat in terms of depth... Due to its game-like progression, each character is given a specific role and does not display behaviour out of it's role; whilst I say this, there have been implications of dark secrets that each character carries -in my opinion, this is extremely suggestive of a more rounded character which we may learn of in future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nSo, for the story, it's built up quite nicely I would say; It gave us a good understanding of the story mechanics -or the mechanics that they want us to know (plot twists are fully welcome).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nArt, I gotta hand it to JC, they know how to make it work and with this anime, no less. I've not seen the source material so I've nothing to compare it to, but considering other anime e.g. Shokugeki no souma etc. it seems to be fairly consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKeeping true to the psychological/thriller genre, the suspense music doesn't fail to deliver... It was captivating and had sucked me in; I had become wary of what was to come, and that had inevitably heightened my reactions, making me vulnerable to being startled.\\n\r\nMoreover, we have bakugou's (Boku no hero academia) VA (okamoto nobuhiko) filling one of the characters positions, which to me, is a massive bonus as his voice has a tendency to act as a form of comic relief -and when considering the darker tropes this series seems to be adhering to, I feel that having such a voice actor will strike a balance to an anime akin to a seinen. But time will tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime had created an awesome opening guaranteed to pique the interest of further viewing for anyone that sits down to watch the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEdit*\\n\r\nI just found out that the source material is a game haha\ud83d\ude02. An' here I was goin' on about levels... I guess Ima go play this game now (if possible\ud83d\ude05).\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nThis review had been written during the pilot episode but is still relevant to all the aired episodes thus far.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who'd played the game and read the manga version of this series, I only have one advice for you: treat this anime like a love story. And also, it will get a lot better and those of you who're complaining about the lack of characterization... well, the amount of character development later on will overwhelm you to the point of suffocation.\r\nStory 8: The only reason I gave it a 8 is that the production team didn't include Eddie and Danny's backstory. If they did, I don't think so many people would be shitting on this anime at the moment. Also I feel thatthe anime changed this part too much. Zack was supposed to be gritting his teeth refusing to scream out in the beginning but slowly losing his control the more electricity he went through. The way the anime made him scream the entire part starts to irritate me after a while. And certain parts are dragged out too much. Other than that, the anime's following the game/manga plotline perfectly. I'm truly excited to see certain scenes animated. This story is THE best love story I'd ever read. The character interaction later on in the plot actually brought a tear to my eyes. And if you think it's predictable now? Well, try and predict the later plot then. Pff.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Making a crappy RPG game character design into something this magnificent. How can you give it any less? Those who thinks Zack's design is stereotypical? He has his reasons. The only reason I didn't give it a ten was that I like the way Zack's face was drawn in the manga more than in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: Love the voice actors. Zack, Ray, Eddie, Cathy... suits them perfectly. Spot on. No complaints. BGM can't be more fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: It's a nine cuz some character backstories are cut out, making them kind of bland (when theybreally aren't). Those who complains about shitty writing and lack of characterization for Ray? Keep watching. It'll prove you wrong. Ray is one of the deepest main character I've seen (partially because most of her characterization is related to religion and I'm an atheist so all those religion stuff she's saying is pretty confusing to me). And you'll understand later on why she wants to kill herself. Zack too isn't a one-dimensional psychopath wanting to kill. His story goes deeper than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: the fact that I anticipate this anime more than my current number 1 fav My Hero Academia's update shows just how much I'm enjoying this series. Would enjoy it a lot more if it followed the manga down to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 Cannot wait for the bang scene. And the bang bang bang in the end ;-) gamer you know what I'm talking about.\\n",

            "content": "* An analysis of the plot and characters until the first five episodes. *\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi is one of the animes managed to have more relevance this season for two reasons: for its duo of protagonists and because the season is loose, a season that only offers two sequels and more reasons to reaffirm how bad the modern anime is, for less innovative than to say it. \r\nAlthough the synopsis is already screaming at my ear that it is not going to be something specifically innovative to be of the genre and that starts strong using mediocre resources like misfortunes that happen because if orsituations with ridiculous backgrounds like the tests to which they are subjected, resources with Equally mediocre justifications, I have not seen works of this kind for a long time, so I can have sensations of amazement or who knows. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is easy to follow because it shows what is just and necessary, and implies that there are things to explain at another time better known as narrative shortcuts, not because it is the beginning but much of what can be said about the story is in the premise, is based on a problem and knowing how to conclude this, by the characteristics the strong point should be in\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nWhether or not interesting, they are 100% junk, it starts with a girl, Rachel Gardner who is supposed to be a normal person in an abnormal situation and is confused, well, it seems logical, there is a pseudo-killer who \"tries\" kill her but it has a strange fetish with facial expressions or something I managed to understand and the disinterest in living that arises in Rachel makes them end up forming a duo with the plan to escape, well. Other characters appear who are crazy or do not act at all normal with the aim of killing, or a peculiar definition of killing since everything revolves around death, these only serve as an obstacle, another reason to pay attention to those of the promise, that's their way of being within the psychological genre, with crazy people, good. \\n\r\nNobody can deny that \"promise\" of Rachel and Isaac is totally absurd, it makes sense until the part in which the two get what they want, but going back to the drastic change that arose in the protagonist, I thought that she was going to be the only thing that could be rescued from this anime, an exceptional principal but no, the best reaction he had was to become the lowest example of the Kuudere stereotype, only to be able to fit the context, perfect. So, up to this point the only moderately interesting thing to see is how the relationship between these two develops, I only want to know what excuse they are going to put so that in some way they empathize and end up all happy after so many misfits and whatever wait, although another less positive conclusion is equally possible but I always follow the basic prediction, I know it as the last resort; put romance because it always works to get attention. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that he tries with a doubtful effort to be what he is, an Anime of Horror, psychological, thriller, but I do not think he achieves it at all, it seems only an excuse to show blood and problems. The environment, the situation or the places are well worked although sometimes it has too much resemblance to the world of a videogame, with the armed scenarios and other things that can make it meaningless to be brought from the mechanics of a videogame. \\n\\n\r\nI never liked RPGs, most of those who have tried their game I guess they like this adaptation, but I think the correct thing is to see it as two different things and that none influence the other. \\n\\n\r\nI thought I would have more things to say about this, but the few things that this anime offered so far, added the disinterest and the little attention with which I saw the first five episodes left me saying obvious things and repeating ideas, I hope to see how continues this work, very unattractive, many stupid things that degrade the little that has quality, and a perfect opportunity to create fanarts of the alleged relationship and nothing, I just wanted to write about anime and just this had the wrapping.\\n\\n\r\nIf you noticed a misspelling, a badly constructed sentence, or if the review seemed like trash, keep in mind that it was translated from Spanish to English with little grace, thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Jesus Christ, how do these guys make money? \r\nI, much like you read the bio, and expected a GENIUS plotline. \r\nOnce again, Japanese films fail at what American filmworks and animation studios NAIL everytime. Character development and pacing. I....I watched three episodes of a none mystery anime and have ZERO idea of what it's even about. \r\nPro tip? Don't just SCREAM OUT A CHARACTERS ENTIRE ARC, BACKSTORY, AND PERSONALITY IN ONE EPISODE; IN ONE SCENE. Film is nothing more than an interesting way to convey information. Thats IT!!!! The rest is just extra stuff on the salad. If you need fried chicken strips to enjoyyour salad...well then eat a fricken chicken sandwich. Thats all this anime IS!!!! Bacon, and chicken strips sprinkled on it. Why is the character whose roll is to be interesting having his entire backstory presented in front of us.\\n\\n\r\nFight Scenes: Guns are so modernized and advanced vs. melee that you usually need a GINORMOUS reason not to include them in ANY mostly combat anime. They said \"Nah, scythes are cool!\"\\n\\n\r\nGood ideas? Don't ruin the entirety of your work by contradicting the main plot and character. Not really a SPOILER, but really the entire premise of the anime which is introduced from the beginning. Calm down. She wants to die? Fine, for whatever reason she isn't willing to do it herself they're MULTIPLE occasions where she has a chance.\\n\\n\r\nWhat killed it for me? The pacing and character development. The plot made no sense. Why is the character threatening the other character with death? She can die anytime she likes. \\n\\n\r\nSCREEN PLAY 101: Introduce EVERYTHING so you dont have any ass pulls. Ever since the genius that is ready player one? They find an interesting way to INTRODUCE EVERYTHING so you don't have any ass pulls. I.E. foreshadowing. Its awesome. It also pro typically builds the intensity tards.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, what really killed this anime was itself. I think it had MAJOR potential but the characters there just seem unnecessary. When you write a screenplay you want as much lettuce as possible. Then, the obvious salad dressing. Bacon, tomatoes, chicken and the other things aren't necessary. They're tools to drive the FLAVOR home.\\n\\n\r\nSpicy salad? Chicken would do well.\\n\\n\r\nRegular salad? No need for extras, fresh lettuce, a good dressing and maybe a vegetable like an onion to spice it up will do fine.",

            "content": "The premise of this anime is dreadful so far. The protagonist goes from being a regular person to a 2006 emo kid requesting to \"be killed because I want to die\" very quickly. This is incompatible with the telling of the story, given that every other character so far would jump at the opportunity to kill her and she really doesn't need the help of her buddy Zack just to die. I have little faith that at some point the story will justify this paradoxical behaviour later and will probably shoehorn something that will be lapped up regardless.\r\nCharacters are very flat without much development, theinteractions between Zack and Rachel don't make sense for what the audience probably assumes it will become. Any curveballs thrown will probably be poorly executed. On another note Zack's laughter sounds like he's a 14 y/o smoker of 50 years, absolutely grating on the ears and far too frequent such that it kills whatever mood is trying to be created.",

            "content": "My mother always said if you don't anything nice to say about someone, don't say anything at all. Thankfully, this nightmare (and not the scarey kind, ironically) isn't a person.\r\nThe summary is a cookie cutout of a typical mystery archetype / story setting. The amnesiac in a strange place. Then there's the weird anime twists with a murder with a scythe who laughs like a popcorn machine with a fork in it. Anyways, nothing overtly special or any red flags in the summary. Except for maybe that stupid little bit about fate. Doubt fate locked you in a building. Moving on. Why it's bad.\r\nThe mysteryas shown in the summary / template isn't anything inherently special. The story writer, the original author or whoever had most input in the anime clearly didn't do anything to improve on that lack of specialty. Nothing interesting or unpredictable happened. In fact it's was the exact opposite. Entirely predictable and boring. Something that kinda shouldn't happen in a mystery horror. The dialogue, events and motivations of characters are tragic. And not in the Romeo and Juliet sense. Mystery isn't an excuse for poor character building, and lack of background knowledge. The procedural, unchanging a repetitive events that last 2 - 4 episodes which only difference from the last arc is a new murderer on a new floor. The shoe horned, poorly thought out religious malformed mutations that embodies every stereotypical and unconvincing religious standpoint or assertion didn't help improve the series either. Lastly, the unsurprising, unoriginal and boring ending didn't improve upon any of the incredibly low bows this series set.\\n\\n\r\nEach floor's murder was uninteresting to say the least. Not ideal for a psychopathic killer in a building of psychopathic murderers. The only difference in their quality or interest to the main characters is due to their lack of presence in the overall story. Which ironically is a good thing. They were already glaringly hypocritical, illogical and or inconsistent. The lack of empathy, fear or genuine interest they inspired would only be compounded by a continued presence. If you switched the names, orders, faces, stories or anything you really want about them, it'd have essentially zero significant impact on the story. The only truly impactful side character is the priest, and his impact is just as rooted in illogical fallacy as are the actions and beliefs of Rachel, the moving doll who's only redeeming feature is she doesn't talk or make as much noise as Zack. The more I see of the dynamic duo of dipshits known as our main characters the more problems I have. Completely uninteresting, unoriginal, unchanging cookie cutter archetype side characters are better than completely uninteresting, unchanging, illogical and irritating main characters. Zack is irritating to say the least. He's exactly what'd you expect a teenager would imagine a teenage murderer to be. He, like all of the characters, is uninteresting and has little originality. Aside from his backstory, which is neither good nor exceptionally bad, he lacks depth and personality or change. It's like someone took Jason and animified him. Rachel on the other hand has literally had no personality. There was nothing interesting about her, her backstory or her actions. She's inconsistent and illogical. Wants to die, but suicide is wrong. Killing people? Eh whatever. Oh this psychopathic murderer will kill me if I help him? Perfect. No problems. This other psychopathic murderer will kill me? Nope. No good, the first one already promised god. Her fundamental perception and practice of religion is insulting even to me as a non believer, I can only imagine how irritating it'd be an actual respectable theologian, not that bad stereotype of a Messiah complex evil priest.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even need to say anything about the voice acting. Zack's voice and laughing makes me want to gouge out my ears with a pair of chopsticks. It's not intimidating or scary. If I heard that in the dark I wouldn't run for the hills. I'd tell the fucker to shut up and cut out his vocal cords if he tried to kill me with his gardening tools. Not exactly what a murderer's 'evil laugh' should inspire. Rachel's entire personality was nothing. Flat, emotionless and unchanging. Guess having no standards is one way to avoid criticism. \\n\r\nI've seriously seen characters who don't talk AT ALL that have better voice acting than Rachel. High Score Girl's Oono is a perfect example. More emotion is conveyed in essentially coughs, grunts and literally no words than any and every word Rachel uttered. As for music. Everyone knows music is a key part of horror and suspense. Doesn't hurt mystery either. This anime lacked any suspense and the lack of good music certainly contributed to that lack of suspense. A pathetic and easy to avoid failure on this anime's part that would have greatly contributed to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nIt was entirely too hard for me to find any enjoyment in a story devoid of consistency or logic but with plenty of plot armor. Blood loss apparently doesn't exist in this world.\\n\r\nThe repetitive story, background and general events, lack of atmosphere and good music, and pathetic characters and character past & building. Then religion, an incredibly difficult topic to discuss seriously, being portrayed in such a laughable and contemptible manner compounded the irritating nature of the series and just stacked up on top of the other glaring issues of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a fools idea of good mystery and a child's idea of a good horror anime. It's basically what you'd get if you asked for a fanfiction of Beauty and the Beast from a weaboo. There's not much to say. It's bad. I could go on and on, put in more effort, but this show is just so comically and unapologetically bad, I don't feel it deserves anymore effort. Unless you like everything from ebola to retardation in physical form, such as the Paul brothers, don't watch this. It's not worth the time, energy or brain cells. It's the worst show to air this season. Maybe even this year. The only happiness I got from this series is when I found out it was 12 episodes instead of 16.\\n",

The show attempts to create a compelling mystery, but fails miserably and ends up giving birth to a bloody mess.

            "content": "What should you be expecting from Satsuriku no Tenshi? A promise between a pure murderer and a mysterious girl and their journey together, mixed with some self-discovery. \r\nI first took notice of this series in the Summer 2018 lineup. The synopsis intrigued me so much, I read the manga and watched a complete playthrough of the game. The anime adaption, so far, is faithful to the source. It draws primarily from the manga but the released episodes have taught me they\u2019re ready to adapt little things to fit a big screen. \r\nEpisode 1 was fast-paced and edgy while later episodes settle into a more relaxedatmosphere. Our main characters reveal their true colours-- Zack is a goofy madman, while Rachel does a 180 and becomes a monotonous doll. The reason for her mood change was confusing (basically Rachel remembered something) so I felt the anime should have made it clearer. To be fair, it was never fully explained in the game nor in the manga, and it is difficult to explain without spoiling. One thing I noticed is that they skipped backstories for some characters (shame) but if it was a necessary sacrifice to adapt everything.\\n\\n\r\nI love the light sprinkling of humour. Some may find it off putting but it adds to the interesting relationship between Rachel and Zack. Some also find the constant repeating of \u2018kill me\u2019 and \u2018swear to god\u2019 annoying but trust me, it eases off over time and the characters (namely Zack) does comment on it. \\n\\n\r\nJC Staff did a good job on the anime because I really dig the aesthetics of the show. I also like the use of effects; it gives a polished, modern look. (wish they toned down the yellow filter/glow thing\u2026) Character designs stay consistent and faithful to the original ones and did I mention how much I love their eyes? Eyes (\u2018peepers\u2019 lol) were prominent in the original game: the heterochromia of both Zack and Danny, the light in Rachel\u2019s eyes and the piercing blue of her eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the OP and ED. Opening \u2018Vital\u2019 is sung by Endoh Masaaki and written by Jin. Ending \u2018Pray\u2019 is sung by Chisuga Haruka (VA of Rachel) and written by DECO*27. Both are sung by accomplished singers and written by popular vocaloid producers (HYPE). I don\u2019t know how to judge music but to my ears, both themes fit the anime well! The visuals are also impressive. I love the nod to the original chara designs at the beginning and the signboard holding at the end of the OP; whereas in the ED I love the footprints and the English words that correspond to the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I did not find the game particularly gripping or life-changing. It\u2019s really not as amazing as people make it out to be >< Nonetheless, it is a breath of fresh air from recent anime. If the anime keeps the original spirit of the source, adapts parts of the game to better suit a anime and makes full use of its medium, it could well be considered anime of the season(barring certain popular sequels\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that horror and puzzle-solving will not play a big part! I\u2019ve seen many people classify it as a horror anime but the horror in here is tame. Be prepared to be disappointed if you were expecting a groundbreaking psychological thriller. To me, the main selling point of this series was that it was short and satisfying, with the right amount of edginess and completeness. There are way too many light novel/manga adaptations nowadays that adapt one tiny bit source leaving many loose ends but Angels of Death is sourced from a game, which means you can experience the whole story in one perfect 16-ep package. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Satsuriku no Tenshi? Yes, but I recommend playing the game/watching a walkthrough of the game first. (If you want to experience both game and manga, do game first. The quality of art between the two is astounding. Not that game art is bad. It's endearing. But I digress.) Satsuriku no Tenshi is a series that benefits from rewatching as it creates a better experience and clears up many confusions. So give Satsuriku no Tenshi a chance because ultimately it is worth watching\u2661\\n",

Voice acting was pretty poor too, often not syncronised with the characters.\r\nThe characters were downright boring. Emotionless mc and an obnoxious sidekick. Very original. The creators of the original indie game obviously were into creepypasta. Nice\"original character\". None of the villains stood out either, painfully generic to the T (mad scientist, sadistic pretty lady... really?). Maybe they were supposed to be generic on purpose, but I can't make myself watch more of this without heavy drinking.\\n\r\nOverall, just don't bother.

            "content": "So this is my first review so sorry if its kinda bad. Also sorry for my crappy english\r\nBut this anime was a very big disappointment for me. I expected so much more but it ended up being an edgy \"humorous\" mess I can only imagine 13 year olds can enjoy. \r\nSo lets start of with our main character rachel gardner who just loves to remind the audience that she really wants to die BUT it can only be done by isaac becouse \"he swore it to god\" or some crap like that. This gets annoying very fast and I just couldnt help but think \"yeahI get it now, you want to die\" every time she said how much she wanted to die, also the reason why it must be done by isaac is complete bull crap and is only there for convenience so the anime can exist for more than 3 episodes. Maybe there is a deeper reason for all this but I just cant bring my self to watch any more of this disaster of an anime. Also, what is up with the tone of this anime. It tries to be a horror anime but at the same time it tries to throw in \"funny\" jokes in moments that would other wise be quite intense. The animation is decent I guess it doesnt really have anything special or note worthy, except for the thousands of cgi doors that look really out of place and weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe good things I can say about this anime is that its op and ending are pretty nice and the first episode also was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nI know I probably should finish the anime and see if it gets better but I just cant bring my self to watch this mess of an anime any longer, and trust me I wanted to love this anime, I mean just look at isaacs design and the premise looked pretty neat. But it just fails so hard and I just cant help but feel disappointed about this anime. I qould give this anime an 4/10 becouse it does have some nice things in it but the bad just really outshines the good in this anime",

            "content": "Watching \"Angels of Death\" was quite a tumultuous journey, and I don't mean emotionally. Now, I won't go into massive detail about the plot, since the synopsis is right on the page; it would be redundant of me to make you read it twice. However, I will discuss the things I liked and the things I disliked about this anime. \r\nFirst, the things I disliked. For starters, the animation in the opening wasn't as fluid as I'm used to. It was kind of snappy and abrupt, rather than flowy and smooth. However, I did get used to this rather quickly. Another thing that I didn'tlike too much was the constant talk about God. Now, I am a Christian, so I do believe in God; however, I don't get offended when people don't believe. For me, the constant talk about \"be my God\" and \"there is no God\" and \"you swore to God\" just seemed...unnecessary to the story. Like, I realize why it was there, but it just came off as pseudo-deep. I rolled my eyes quite a few times, especially when it was talked about continuously throughout an episode. I also didn't like Rachel's character too much at first. I found her annoying. It got better, though. Finally, I won't give spoilers since it's a relatively new show, but the ending left me pretty disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the things I liked. For one thing, I really enjoyed the mystery surrounding Rachel's past. I was pretty satisfied with it when it was revealed. This goes for Zack's past, too, though his backstory was more emotional for me. This leads to my next point: the characters. Though not all of them were my favorite, there were two shining stars for me: Zack and Eddie. Zack was easily my favorite part of the anime. He was funny, cool, brash, and protective. He had a tough exterior, but like Rachel said near the end, \"He's not a monster. He's a human.\" A human with a heart of gold, if you ask me. He was also pretty sexy, so that helped out a lot. Eddie, despite being a psychopath, was just really adorable and likable. I actually felt bad for him, despite how murderous he was. I also grew to like Rachel near the end, which is a good thing. Another thing I liked was the relationship between Rachel and Zack. Though initially involved in a Predator-Prey dynamic, their relationship evolved into something morbidly sweeter than that. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried during their exchange in Episode 15. The OP and the ED were both excellent, though the ED takes the cake for me. It was beautifully sung by the woman who voiced Rachel in the Sub. Rachel's theme was also very beautiful. The artwork was really nice, and the animation was actually pretty fluid in the show, unlike in the OP. Finally, I really enjoyed the character development that took place in Rachel and Zack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a rather frustrating watch for me. Though it was good, it waited until Zack's backstory episode and the second-to-last episode to really show some emotion. When it did, I loved it; other than that, it was just pretty good. The pretentious talk about God really brought the show down for me until Zack and Rachel had a heart-to-heart about it. Rachel was so annoying sometimes that I nearly quit watching. However, despite all of this, the good outweighs the bad. The mystery was fun, some of the characters were great, the character development was refreshing, the music was beautiful, and the relationship between the two main characters was great to witness. So, with all of this in mind, I had fun with this one, and I do recommend it if you can be patient with it. I'm sure you'll find some enjoyment in it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10",

To be killed, because you have no purpose to live. You hate yourself. That's what Rachel wishing for. But the end of it, it shows the synonym of her request was actually \"please love her\". This anime has so many confusing things up but all I can say is it'sa melancholy. I'm not a psychopath because enjoying this but these 2 people shared the same pain. It has a nice plot. You can relate this if you're into psychology thriller anime. Don't relate this with anything other than that because you'll be complaining a lot. Hey this is the type of psychological thriller, of course, it'll make you feel weird. what so good about psychological thriller is you need to think wide and wise so you won't get boring or lost in the middle.",

However, after realizing how unbelievably edgy this anime is, I regret every minute I spent watching this show. Take a shot every time you read the word \u201csins\u201d and you\u2019ll pass out within the first few minutes.\r\nWhile the plot of the anime doesn\u2019t make much sense, most of the issues of this show lies with its characters. While Rachel isn\u2019t a great character by any stretch, Zack is unbearably annoying. At first I thought he was satire of every edgy creepypasta character ever written, but I obviously gavethis show far too much credit. His voice is awful as well, and it isn\u2019t his VA\u2019s fault. The only sounds Zack makes are piercing screeches and the occasional melodramatic grumble. Aside from his voice, his character as a whole can be represented by one word: edgy. I have no issue with a bit of edginess, but there is nothing redeeming in this edginess. None of the supporting characters are much better.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish on a good note, the animation is rather nice and I thought the colour choice suited the show. The OP was lackluster at best, although I genuinely enjoyed the ED.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren\u2019t head-over-heels in love with this show after the first episode, you won\u2019t like this show whatsoever.

The build-up is okay, but slow. I would have put a 6 if I hadn't play the game. I know that it becomes interesting after a while.\r\nArt: 9\r\nI REALLY lovethe art and animation. They did a really good job. Nothing more to say. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall music is nice. Voice acting is fine. But the laugh of one particular character creeps me out a bit... But it's fine. He's a psychopath. It's just the creepy laugh of a psychopath, we're not suppose to like it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I watched the dub recently and it's pretty good in my opinion! So consider watching the dubbed version if you don't like the japanese voice acting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime adapts well the game and the manga, I will definitly change my rating later. But for now... I'll leave it at 7. The characters are interesting so far but not really developped yet. I really hope there will a bit of information on backstories like in the manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm just happy to watch good art, animation and voice acting over a good game. I'm in heaven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say for now is that it's a good adaptation to the game. The game wasn't that great in the beginning, but it became much more interesting later. The anime will probably follow the same path.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, the three episodes rule will maybe not work for you. This is an anime that is meant to be watched completly. Don't give up on it.",

            "content": "\u201cI want to die\u201d, a statement that is presented a lot but never seems to amount to much. It\u2019s a harrowing remark that tries to show the disdain for Racheal's own existence, one that ends up being a plight on the shows incoherent mess of a plot. \r\nThe narrative starts out rather mysterious, with our two main characters being tied together in circumstances rather than by purpose. The theme of Racheal wanting to die starts here with a promise between the two. If they both get out then Zack promises to kill Racheal in return, plain and simple. There is some good initial exposition ofthe start of the story and I was originally hopeful with what the premise could offer but soon after my excitement was dashed as every episode turned into a reiteration of the last as Racheal keeps repeating her request of dying to each villain only to have Zack recommit with killing her later. This level of repetition is increasing suffocating as nothing is added or changed for the characters to grow. To explain this discrepancy several philosophical purposes are purposed to why Racheal thinks this way. The first is initially that she wants to die for the sake of dying but is then reconciled with the belief that Zack was her god, and that somehow gives him reason to kill her. By having Zack be her god she believes that it will erase all her sins when she is killed and therefore grants her relief. The problem with the ideology is that it completely fails to bring reason to her constant complaint that she wants to die. If anything, this just makes her character even worse as she now has layers of ineffective characterization, bogging down and dialogue that comes up for the rest of the series. Zack is only slightly better than Racheal with is character is extremely simple and easy to understand. Not much in terms of depth but at least he is not held back by the many contradictions that the other characters in the show present. These two make up the bulk of the show's development and as you can see not much to go off of through the entire story. The other characters tend to have the same level of weird shallow contradictions with themselves. The ending was actually satisfying for me but that\u2019s only with my personal preference in sentimental things and not that the ending was anything of quality.  \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the narrative, the animation was also really on the lower side of quality. For a show in 2018, I expect a certain level in key animation, movement, and background. JC staff did a great job in providing a standard quality for the show and there are hardly any flaws, but in return, the show doesn\u2019t match the level of quality that I would expect from a show in 2018. Mediocre is best to describe the standard it has put out.   \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was straight was bad and this comes from the complete ineptitude of the composer. There is even a track where the entire piece is him going up at one semitone at a time for no particular reason. Not to mention that even though the show is supposed to be horror, the soundtrack does nothing to create that atmosphere. It\u2019s a rather kind of annoying ambiance that detracts from what is actually happening on screen. In the end, the soundtrack has nothing even remotely good about it and unfortunately ends up hurting the show in so many ways. I would like to add my thoughts on the voice acting as well and how terrible it can sound at times. Zack in the sub was particularly bad to the point where I couldn\u2019t stand his screaming anymore and decided on the dub instead which had a much lower and raspy voice for Zack. Racheal's voice was decently done as her voice was already melancholy, to begin with, and the English version of it was more or less the same.  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I was really holding on at the end with my sense of disbelief. The show was wrapping its self-inside out with so many inconsistency's that I lost complete focus of it by the end of it. I haven't played the game but from what I can see the length of the game was not long enough to accommodate the length of the show. Which made the writers and director trying to stretch the show as long as possible to last for the entire season and in the end backfiring heavily against their own favor. Angels of death is available on Crunchyroll for the sub. For the home release and dub, it's currently available through FUNimation.",

            "content": "Angels of Death is a weak, poor and unnecessary adaptation of its video game counterpart. I didn\u2019t actually play the game. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know there was a game in the first place until I watched the first episode. So even if you\u2019re diving into this show without any prior knowledge about it other than the actual synopsis, I feel almost obligated to warn you that it\u2019s in fact terrible. Any game adaptation for that matter has been terrible, minus some extremely rare exceptions. Take a look at Corpse Party, The KanColle Collection, Silent Hill and even the Resident Evil franchise. \r\nThis animeis not inherently bad, in a sense that the original game is bad. This anime is bad because it lacks any form of development, is full of inconsistencies and unlikable characters in a story that could have ended in 1 second but didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSo Rachel, our main protagonist wakes up in an eerie abandoned hospital. Having no recollection of her past and how she got here, she begins exploring the building before getting chased by Zack, a murderous psychopath who wants to kill her for no reason whatsoever. After miraculously escaping, something snaps in her head and she decides to die, still HAVING ZERO recollection of her memories. But hold on to your seat, because its gets even more absurd. She asks the very same psychopath to kill her, but to her surprise he doesn\u2019t accept, simply because she\u2019s \u201cnot making a good face\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so the duo go on a suicidal adventure, casually defeating enemies on every floor, because how else are we supposed to move the story forward? Throughout the series, they continuously engage in a repetitive, flat and awkward dialogue that is repeated 20 times or even more. I don\u2019t know at this point, I\u2019ve lost count. Here\u2019s a typical conversation between the two that you can almost certainly find every 5 minutes in a single episode:\\n\\n\r\n- \u201cI want to die\u201d\\n\r\n- \u201cI will kill you when we get out. Just make sure you make a good face and smile a bit\u201d\\n\r\n- \u201cBut you will kill me right? Because you promised God\u201d\\n\r\n- \u201cDon\u2019t get so serious you brat. You look too boring I don\u2019t want to kill you\u201d\\n\r\n- \u201cI want to be useful to you\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but every single villain in the story paraphrases the same thing over and over again, because how else are we supposed to fill 20 minutes of screen time? The villains are stereotypical, bland and forgettable since they are one-dimensionally evil and constantly remind everyone about their goal.\\n\r\nThe doctor reminds everyone about his eye fetish, and how he will literally pop Rachel\u2019s eyes out because they\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m not even joking about this. The kid reiterates about his obsession with graveyards and also Rachel. He loves her so much that he decides to kill her just to bury her in a nice looking grave. The sadomasochistic girl wants to torture the main characters just for the fun of it, as this wasn\u2019t clear enough from her high-pitched crazy voice. And finally, the priest who complains about how bad religion is, by acting like any teenager in his rebellious phase. *hurr durr* God doesn\u2019t exist, religion is bad, people are hypocrites.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rachel herself, she is an irritating, ambivalent and indecisive girl who wants to die at the hands of her psychopathic friend but at the same time doesn\u2019t want to be killed by the villains. Because how else are we supposed to give her a clear and convincing motivation? If she\u2019s that determined to die she can simply kill herself for crying out loud. But for some bullshit philosophical debate, she doesn\u2019t feel like it because God will get mad. I mean, isn\u2019t the act of asking someone else to finish you off the same as your decision of committing suicide in the first place? God will get mad in both cases anyway. The writer pretty much plot armors the very thing the protagonist can achieve in an instance by having said protagonist NOT WANTING to achieve it  in an instance, but rather waste her entire time fooling around a hospital with her friend, aimlessly defeating enemies every floor, before finally accepting to be killed after escaping the building. Then why exactly didn\u2019t she kill herself in the first place and be done with it? Why waste your time that you clearly disregards for such absurd means? Because how else are we going to write a meaningless story with a crystal clear objective that could have been achieved in an instance?\\n\\n\r\nBut the inconsistency doesn\u2019t stop there. Her companion, Zack, genuinely wants to kill her. But doesn\u2019t because he wants her help to escape, even though he can clearly do it by himself since the puzzles in the show are basically made for kindergartens, by kindergartens. Plus, she doesn\u2019t really hold a unique ability, weapon, or a skillset that he can use to his advantage. Having an IQ greater than 0 for solving such puzzles doesn\u2019t count. Halfway through the show, Zack slices his belly wide open with his scythe, loses 10 times the blood capacity of a normal human body but somehow survives after 2 whole episodes. And get this, Rachel spends her remaining time finding a medicine for a guy she doesn\u2019t need nor care about since she can JUST kill herself or hell, ask another villain to do it in her place. Plus, why the hell should we care about Zack? He\u2019s still a serial killer who brutally murdered countless innocent people because his parents treated him like a tool. You can show us flashbacks about his tragic past but this won\u2019t magically make him a better person. He has to earn it. And so far, all he\u2019s trying to do is resist the urge to kill Rachel. So I don\u2019t see any progress. \\n\\n\r\nGiving each main character a tragic backstory is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. It\u2019s not going to help redeem the characters because all they do is act irrationally, contradict themselves all the time, and have barely any resemblance to an actual human personality. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other scenes, they are indecipherable and a complete waste of time. Rachel basically gets teleported in and out of different scenes for no other reason than to fill screen time. And she finally gets back to where she was at the beginning of the episode, so there is absolutely no continuity. The story is basically a snake eating its own tail: it keeps running in circles until it finally breaks out from its loop by revealing a \u201cplot twist\u201d at the end. A plot twist that makes zero sense because it turns the two characters against each other by having them fight to death. Wait a second, wasn\u2019t this the premise of the show?\\n\\n\r\nThe art is clearly a step forward from the actual game and even the manga itself. The animation is most of the time captivating, but other times makes your head spin when special effects such as smokes, blood, weird writings and such are all applied at the same time. The music on the other hand is average and repetitive, especially the piano music which was spammed in almost every episode. The OP fits more a Slice of Life setting, seriously. The ED was a bit better though.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Angels of Death is a badly written horror story of two sad protagonists who are thrown in an excuse of a plot that looks and plays exactly like in a RPG. You\u2019ve got characters defeating a villain every level and finding a clue or a trigger before passing to the next stage. The only catch is the awkward and almost laughable relationship between the duo, where Rachel refuses to commit suicide since she prefers getting brutally killed by some serial killer she just met, and Zack who refuses to kill her because she\u2019s not \u201cmaking a good face\u201d. This back and forth ultimately led the show to its demise due to its own inconsistency. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay.... where to begin with a series like Angels of Death. \r\nTo give a vague synopsis, it follows Rachel Gardner with little memory of what happened or brought her to the bottom floor of a 6 story building, who meets fellow building dweller Isaac, and together, with a very strange request, are both motivated to escape the building. \r\nOverall, if I'm being blunt and honest, there isn't anything overly offensive about this series, for the most part it was fine and I found myself enjoying it... again, for the most part. \r\nArt wise, the series looks good, character wise they're very individual, if not somewhatrushed, and plot/motivation is very unique, or at the very least not one that I've seen before. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part were the characters. Especially the way Rachel and Isaac play off each other, Isaac's outbursts, their contrasting personalities offered me a few chuckles here and there, and the majority of their interactions with other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I can't say this was brilliant or masterful, is because, at it's core, I personally found it confusing. The concepts and messages they were bringing up and having characters worry/motivate them were fascinating, but incredibly confusing the first time around and very quick to change from one episode to the next. \\n\r\nThis is another reason I enjoyed Isaac's character so much, because every now and then he would just blurt out exactly what I was thinking regarding these situations; \"What the hell are you talking about?\", \"What the hell does that mean?\", \"What are you getting at?\" and at times just straight up demanding someone explain wtf is going on. This shows me that the writers/creators are at least aware of the deep thinking bits in this story. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure if I watched this a few more times, with the knowledge I now have having finished it, some concepts could make more sense to me and I perhaps would be able to understand what characters are saying to each other. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I found the series incredibly tense, and from the aspects I definitely 100% understood it gave me satisfaction to arcs, answers to mysteries and questions they put forward and offered me an interesting perspective of relationship types that I thought worked remarkably well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, what I can definitely praise are the lead characters, (for the cliches they portray very well), and honestly the ending is something I haven't seen or expected for a while.  \\n\r\nWould recommend, but warning, it can be a thinker!",

Now, if you don't want to read too much just skip to the last paragraph that sums this all up quite well.\r\nIn all honesty the story only had me interested around episode 4, though even after that it seemed rather plain buti felt this strange, calm and absorbed feeling and it just kept me going. As i progressed i felt it is was definitely a one-of-a-kind story line that i don't think i will ever encounter again, not sure if thats a good or a bad thing. I will say that it had a nice beginning and a beautiful ending that is basically based upon how you wish to see it, by that i mean that you can interpret it by many different ways until you are left with the one you are most satisfied with. However, in my opinion, there is only one true ending that can be seen if looked into deeper but i cant quite accept it as it simply makes me sad just thinking about it...\\n\\n\r\nI have in fact got very much to say about the characters but once i get started i might as well of started off by saying \" I will now just basically re-tell the whole anime in words so don't get too bored\" So all i will say about them is that they are very unique, but a feeling kept bothering me that they have something in common about them all that i have missed or yet to discover while i occasionally think about this anime in my day to day life.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, i don't really have anything to say about the sound because i didn't pay much attention to it, or was there even any sound except from their voices and the opening? Well, what i can say is that the story did a good job then because i was so memorized my it and what was happening my attention was drawn exceptionally to it.\\n\\n\r\nWell if you reached this far in my review you probably already realized that i very much enjoyed this anime so theres not much to say to end this off with except from saying one thing; I was definitely not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did (yup, that is exactly how i started this review)",

            "content": "This anime. Wow, WOW, WOW. This is not your average dark show. I think I need a soul cleanse after this one. This show went all in with the dark, gritty and gore. I won't tell you about it because the write up is already there. So let's dive in with my review......\r\nStory 10/10: This story and plot twists were out of this world. It kept flowing and kept you intrigued with what's going on. It didn't stall where most shows do ,where it would hit that middle episode slump. There were just \"wtf after wtf\" moments with this anime. It delved deep into thedark corners of religion and mental illnesses and challenging you to find out who your really are. Lots of psychological mind games this story was. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10: The animations were great. I loved how they drew Rachel's eyes. And throughout the anime, you can see her eyes going a shade darker or lighter. The church scenes were beautifully designed. Lots of beautiful shots. Especially when Rachel was in the purple smoke.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10: Opening and closing theme songs were great. The piano rift with the ending theme reminded me a lot of Angel Beats. Both songs were catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: You immediately love Zack and Eddie, even though you know they are the bad guys. Zack was the foul mouthed, comedic relief to break some of the dark and horror aspects of the show. Rachel was a little getting use to, mainly because of her deadpan, monotone expressions. But she get's better as the show came to its final episodes, where she starts to show emotions and you begin to feel sorry for her. I love that there was a lot of character background information on everyone, development, somewhat, with Zack. The priest still gives me the creeps too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: How can you not? \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I loved it. It took me down a dark path for 16 episodes and I felt like I was drowning in dread and despair and should be doing 12 hail marys afterwards. It was bone chilling, some weepy moments, a bunch of laughs and some moments where you just want to question your humanity. It ended with an opening, where you can come to your own conclusion on what happened to them both in the end. You can either wish for a happy ending or a dark sad one.",

            "content": "This anime is the best example I've seen of the 'so bad it's good' concept in anime. Nearly everything about the show is a total trainwreck from the writing to the art to the sound (except the voice acting) to the animation is godawful and feels like it was made by a group of people who have exactly zero idea what they're doing. (Except for the first episode. The first episode is definitely the most solid episode of the whole show.) But, despite this, the show just somehow manages to click and be a fun thrill ride of a dumb edgy action show with oneor two really memorable characters and one hell of a ridiculous plot. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThe story makes like literally zero sense when you think about it. Like within the narrative it makes sense but it's also just like really really dumb. It's a cool concept and an interesting idea to get two characters with such ridiculously contrasting personalities into a situation like this, but in the end it ends up raising a lot of questions. Like how has no one ever found this building? How did the police get there? How did Gray know this would happen? How did they know about Ray? How do they pick sacrifices? It's really never clarified. It's enough to keep the show running, but certainly not what makes it so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nAfter some pretty impressive animation cuts (mostly Zack being Zack) in the first episode, I was shocked to find that almost the entire rest of the show flows like a cheaply produced A-1 Pictures show. The CG effects are atrocious and the shot composition verges on painful. This certainly provided a lot of laughs as I was watching the show, but this, again, is not what makes the show fun. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe voice actors are (for the most part) clearly having an absolute blast as they scream and spout absolutely ridiculous edgy dialogue. I'd say Gray has the weakest performance, but Danny, Zack, and Cathy more than make up for any weaknesses in the other performances with their bombastic over-acting and hilarious dialogue. \\n\r\nThe actual sound design of the show is, like the animation, utterly atrocious and the music choices can often feel entirely mishandled. But this is more a source of unintentional hilarity than anything else. And the OP is freaking amazing. JIN FTW!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis is basically all because of Zack. Zack is the emotional center of the entire show. When he takes a few episodes off to spend dying in a hallway, the show isn't fun to watch anymore. His easy-going banter and fun chemistry with Ray is like half the reason any of the show works at all. The other half is Zack just being a bouncy, fun, lovable character to spend time with. And honestly, he provides any depth or heart the show has at all. I could probably write a full analysis about how Zack's characterization contrasts with that of Ray and how he's portrayed as a more genuine and kind person than her despite him being a serial killer and her just being a little girl. And how much they grow to care about each other over the course of the show is the real emotional core of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nFrom an objective standpoint, Angels of Death is pretty terrible. But, from a purely subjective standpoint it's an absolutely hilarious romp full of heart and a really entertaining bandaged psycho that you should definetly watch with friends if you plan to watch it.",

I'll be doing my best to take into account that there are differences, but will be talking about the game too, albeit briefly. So, THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS. Read at your own risk.\r\nWhile it has been beaten to death that Angels of Death is slow, I couldn't disagree more. At least, until I got to the later episodes that is. But more on that later. The story of a mentally ill girl and a crazed murderous forming a bond shouldn't be appealing, in fact it sounds more like a comedythan a psychological horror, but that is indeed the relationship that we spend the most time with. \\n\\n\r\nRachel and Zack are two very different people, brought together in a game of religion and horror. Playing the game first, I was unsure how the anime would be able to structure their relationship - the jarred first meeting, the unsure but curious fledgling of a friendship and then, unwavering loyalty. But the anime has done that and more, delving deeper into what makes Zack and Rachel special to one another. We spend more time in their past in the anime than in the game, and how their past interlinks them. Both have been pushed aside by people who were supposed to protect and love them, twisting them into the people they are. Zack reacts violently, lashing out to destroy. Rachel, on the other hand, acts only to preserve an image of purity and innocence. The difference between them is intoxicating. \\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated looking more into the other judges, like Cathy, Eddie, and Gray. Danny is just plain annoying, so kudo's to the anime for making him like that still, I guess. In the game I felt that the rest of the judges barely got any screen time, so it was nice for that to be included. I find them all rather interesting, but I wish that we'd have got to know more about their backstory. Still, it was nice to see more of 'the angels' of death.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I can't deny it's that Angels of Death looks damn good. I enjoyed the visuals of the pixel game on Switch, but I'd be lying if I said that the anime was, by any means, bad. Great stuff. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto it dragging. At first, nope. I felt that they handled the episodes rather nicely, up until it got to episode 12 which is where I started to zone out. There's nothing wrong with adding more stuff like backstory and whatnot, but holy crap, two whole episodes dedicated to Zack and Rachel doing ONE specific thing? Nuh uh, that was just plain terrible and it made me feel as though I was just watching the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though? Angels of Death is a great anime and I think if you were a fan of this, you should go play the game. It's bloody brilliant.\\n",

A lot of them were not good in the aspect of personality, but they were more of a plot device than anything, so it doesn't bother me too much. The anime gets preachy at times and usually just sounds like mad ramblings, but it is to be expected since nearly all the characters are just criminals or psychopaths. The story was pretty good and thought out to an extent, but the delivery in which they did so,wasn't exactly ideal. There were several moments where I thought they could have done better, but I think their problem was being a little too stuck on the two main characters, not allowing them to grow properly as the story line progressed.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT PLAYED THE GAME. I KNOW THAT THE SHOW IS NOT OVER, AS THE SPECIALS ARE RELEASING SOON. THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE SHOW UP TO EPISODE 12, SO SOME SPOILERS ARE PRESENT.*\r\nAngels of Deaths is...strange. Not in a bad way, but this is one of those shows that truly is the definition of a mixed bag. It's not terrible, but at the same time, the series is just something I wouldn't go out of my way to watch a second time. And yet, it's a series I'll probably remember because of how bizarre it was.\r\nStory:6/10\\n\r\nThe story of Angels of Death is fairly simple. Rachel Gardner find herself trapped inside of an abandoned building without any of her memories intact. Wandering around, she meets Zack, a man who's a bit off his rocker, who wields a sickle in hand. Together, they form a bond and try to find a way out of the building itself. Right off the bat, the concept alone is interesting. There are different floors that offer different, deadly challenges.\\n\r\nAnd also, did I mention that they aren't the only ones in the building?\\n\\n\r\nThe challenges themselves are conducted by murderers, one in charge of each floor. Rachel and Zack are put up to dangerous tasks, whether it's from a doctor who has an abnormal obsession with the human eye, or a woman who's sadistic mature makes killing seem like a game of punishment for people she deems 'sinners', the entire building is full of downright dangerous people.\\n\r\nBut despite all these interesting concepts and ideas, the execution comes off as just incredibly slow. The pacing can be fast at times, but it's most just dragging on as they try to find how to get out of each floor. If there were a set of episodes that I find reasonably paced, check out episodes 4-6. I'm not saying the entire show is slow though, it does pick up around episode 10. And while the end of the 'final' episode is pretty easy to latch onto, it's a good stopping point  to where the specials will pick up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt may not look like it at first glance, but the animation and art in Angels of Death is pretty impressive. The art is simple, yet the color palette to me is dark, adding to the mysterious vibe the show is trying to give. The designs of each character are also pretty unique, a standout for me being Zack's design altogether. Each character stands out and looks different from one another, which is a huge positive. There are also many scenes where JC Staff clearly went all out, with scenes that absolutely stand out and look gorgeous as hell. In this aspect, Angels of Death clearly hits the mark.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Angels of Death can vary from being quite forgettable, to absolutely amazing. The opening song is nothing special, and in my personal opinion doesn't really fit the tone of the show at all. But, the ending song 'Pray' is one of the best I've heard in a long time. It's something very memorable, and Haruka Chisuga's (Who is actually the VA for Rachel) change from soft to powerful vocals are something to be admired. The OST for the show is is pretty great too, which I believe is from the game itself? \\n\r\nI almost forgot to mention the voice acting here, which is great! Rachel's VA does a great job at capturing her character well, along with the VA's for each murderer. Similar to the character designs, the voice for each character is undeniably unique, even more so than the art itself. You can tell the VA's are having an absolute blast with their roles. But, the standout for me is Zack. \\n\r\nSeriously, what is up with Zack being the total standout of this show? Nobuhiko Okamoto gives Zack the perfect amount of charm and crazy to just  make every man and woman nut to the far ends of the galaxy.\\n\r\nMaybe it's because this man voiced Bakugo from MHA (which from listening closely, you can hear a tint of it in there.), but he really is a talented guy.\\n\\n\r\n(Imagine Bakugou having an eternal hissy fit over Izuku and then stabbed him twenty times, was put in a mental institution, and escaped. That's how I can summarize Zack.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nNow here's where things get rocky. The characters on their own have quirks that make them stand out, which is a good thing. But the big problem with the characters lies in development. Some characters, like Zack, get tons of characterization. But others don't really get that kind of treatment, like some of the murderers or a certain girl, but we'll get back to her. We got so much information on Zack, hell, I think there was an episode where most of it was just Zack backstory. Listen up JC Staff and Angels of Death staff, we all love Zack. But, he's taken up a bit TOO much of the development that others should've gotten. When it comes to the murderers, it varies. Some get lot of screentime, and don't get jack shit of development. Meanwhile, some are only there for not even one and a half episodes, and get so much more development than either of them. Y'all writers just can't figure out what to do, huh?\\n\r\nBut the one thing that really made em disappointed the most, was how they handled Rachel.\\n\r\nHere's the thing. They didn't do Rachel a dirty, they gave her a fair share of development. But the problem is, there are so many things that are mentioned about Rachel and important plot points that are just....never brought up again.\\n\r\nIt's just sad to see it all be thrown away, but hey, the series ain't over yet. Gotta wait and see.\\n\r\nOverall, the staff goofed the eff up. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite some of it's lingering issues, Angels of Death is fairly enjoyable, and I hope that it starts to pick up.",

But the story is a no for me. The earlier episodes is really interesting where they solved the puzzle for each levels before moving on. \r\nWhen it reaches to the end, the priest guy level, I don't understand what is happening there. Having a trial all of a sudden and I'm like blank. When reaches the last level, itgoes back to being interesting because its a plot twist. But, the cliffhanger I'm blank again and that's it. These last few episodes is abit rushing to me because I got lost there.\\n\\n\r\nThey shouldn't set the leftover episodes as \"specials\" because to me specials are like episodes you dont' really need to watch.

We follow them on their quest to escape from a certain hospital which also doubles as a hunting ground for sociopaths who kill the unfortunate souls that enter the damned building. Each floor of the building is occupied by one of these psychopaths who will kill anyone who enters their \u201clevel\u201d.\r\nOne of our maincharacters, Isaac is in charge of the bottom-most level where he tries to kill Rachael but fails to do so. Rachael, then remembers some stuff that happened to her in her past and comes to the very obvious conclusion - that she needs to die; but she doesn\u2019t want to commit suicide because \u201cGod will not forgive her, for suicide is a sin\u201d.  So, she does what any sane person would do, she asks for Isaac to kill her to which he gives her the stupendous reply that he won\u2019t kill her because her face doesn\u2019t look good. So they decide to team up and escape the building together and thus starts the abomination that is Angels of Death. \\n\\n\r\nYou might think that a premise like this must provide some sort of entertainment to the viewer, and it does, which is immediately ruined by the introduction of some cardboard cutout character who wants to kill Zack and Rachael. The characters that occupy the floors of the building try to kill them because how else will we progress our non-existent and a sorry excuse for a plot?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about Rachael. She wants to die but won\u2019t let anyone kill her and neither will she kill herself. This state of ambivalence is never clearly explained. You could argue that she promised Isaac that she would help emancipate him, but why the hell does she care when she just wants to go to the afterlife? Also she doesn\u2019t speak much and is brooding all the time for some equivocal reason. That\u2019s all there is to her character.\\n\r\nIsaac on the other hand is a very irksome character who does absolutely nothing but shouts and swings his scythe around to decapitate someone or to spill someone\u2019s guts out. Apparently, he was abused as a child and became a killer because he saw someone in a movie killing a girl. And that\u2019s all there is to his character. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is utterly balderdash and it\u2019s filled with banal, edgy clich\u00e9s. There is copious amount of blood for some reason. Zack gets his stomach cut and keeps bleeding out for 4 episodes straight without inching any closer to death. A person gets shot, he/she goes flying backwards 2 meters because there is no such thing as Physics. Prisoners in this anime can apparently survive for months without food or water. There are four lines of dialogue in this series which are delivered in subtly different ways. It\u2019s like the writers put their brains in abeyance when making this atrocity. All that the characters do is kill, and when they\u2019re not doing so, try to kill.  \\n\\n\r\nTl;Dr\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime filled with interesting characters and a grand story then is not the anime you\u2019re looking for. But, if you want an anime that you can enjoy with your brain turned off, then this is definitely not the way to go. Don\u2019t watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "The term \"God\" can mean multiple things these days. Whether \"God\" is a deity that watches over everyone, someone or something that acts as judge, jury and executioner upon the wicked or a specific individual who looks down on people and believes they can change everything around them for the better. My point is that people have different interpretations of what they believe to be God. This is something that this anime tackles and tries to give us ways God is interpreted. With a mysterious shadow looming over our main characters as they hold each other to a promise that they both hope they canfulfil. \\n\\n\r\nSit back , relax and remember to be polite when someone answers your door and says \"Hello, would you like to talk about our Lord and Saviour Haruhi Suzumyia.\" As I present to you the anime review of Satsuriku no Tenshi or by its English translation, Angels of Death. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a 13 year old girl by the name of Rachel Gardener who wakes up in a seamlessly abandoned building with no idea of how she got there. She then starts exploring the various basement floors until she runs into a scythe wielding serial killer by the name of Zack. Zack tries to kill Rachel at first but then certain circumstances causes to them to make a deal. If Rachel helps Zack get out of where they are, Zack promises to kill Rachel since Rachel has heard the news of her parent's fate, she wishes for death. From there they explore the different floors and slowly start to learn about where they are and about each other. \\n\\n\r\nFirst impressions were good for this series as it had a sense of isolation and fear of the unknown in its first couple of episodes that kept your attention and in suspense. But then the show started to trip up and the quality of the story was slipping and I can attribute this to the show's immediate change in tone after the first couple of episodes. It goes from slasher horror to mystery thriller without trying to balance the two together. When the show tires to continues to keep you in suspense and shock you, it fails. This is because there isn't an good emotional reaction or response. When Rachel discovers something disturbing or shocking, she keeps a blank face that shows that she does not care and shows no emotion. Or when Zack gets told something, he just shouts as he can't be arsed to think about it. And when these two are the main characters, there is no emotional investment in the story. \\n\\n\r\nReally, what kept me going was the overall mystery of the show. I wanted to keep watching to find out where the hell they were and why they are there in the first place. The show does give hints and clues through the environment and in the character's dialogue as to why they are here. It kept me thinking of what is this place that they are stuck in. Is it merely a building to f**k with people, or are they actually in hell and are going through the different circles of hell. It made me think and good on the show to get me interested on that aspect of the story. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also kind of funny how literal the translation from the game to the anime was. Each floor acts like a level with an entrance and an exit with many obstacles in the way. There are multiple puzzles in each level and Rachel and Zack have to figure them out in order to advance while the caretaker of each level watches over them. But is this poor adaptation from adapting the game into an anime? Yes and no. In some aspects, yes because it does sometime fell very \"video gamey\" with some of the situations that our protagonist finds themselves in. But the anime enhances the drama of these aspects with close ups and different camera angles to give it a more cinematic feel to rack up the tension of that moment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nSo Rachel is one half of the main characters but is the character that the show like to focus on. She acts as a lost soul of sorts. Someone who is hoping that someone can put her to rest. So since she has little reason to go on, she wishes for death and wants Zack to do it because Zack promised to God. Good thing they added that there because it would have been off that she didn't ask anyone else to kill her. And trust me, she will keep reminding Zack and you, the viewer, that she wishes for death and Zack has promised, over and over again. It is kind of like the scene from Evabridged where Gendo keeps asking Ritsuko to have sex with him, except there is no end to it. It is unbearable at times to keep hearing her saying that she wants to die every 5 minutes and really brings down her character. Granted, it is nice to see she doesn't suffer from amnesia because in a situation like this, it would be easy to do so. It gives the impression that she is hiding some secrets that could explain why she is in this mysterious place to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Zack, he is more defined than Rachel is. It is easy to see that he is serial killer with a traumatic past to explain why he became a serial killer in order to gain sympathy points. Through is brash attitude and impatience lies a man who actually has morals. He won't kill just anyone (hence why he never killed Rachel when they made their promises together) as he actually has some morals. Not a lot, but some. As time went on, we see a man that actually does somewhat care for Rachel when she it not terrified of him anymore and he is not someone who is just using her to get out of wherever the hell they are. I actually was invested more into Zack than Rachel because his character was more interesting than Rachel despite Rachel having the some mystery behind her. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is small but distinct. They each have their own personality and morality to explain why there here along with Rachel and Zack and act as floor guardians. Each floor reflecting their personality. Danny being a doctor has his floor be a hospital as well as a lab for his more deranged experiments as he is fascinated with human eyes. Eddie's floor focuses on a graveyard as he loves to bury the souls of the deceased and wants to help people guide them to their graves. With Catherine's floor being a prison as she has a dominatrix personality and likes to punish people. Then you have Abraham's floor be a church to reflect his personality of being righteous and him being the voice of god. It does help make each character more defined by their own environment as well as their own personality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe shows animation isn't really remarkable and is not something to write home about as it lacks detail and finesse. Rachel especially looks like her character has been just sketched onto the drawing board and they haven't worked on the details yet they needed to start animating immediately. I believe they could have been a bit more visceral with the violence to hammer in the psychotic tendencies of our characters, especially Zack. But outside one glorious scene from episode 1, it dissapoints. But the animation is not bad. It actually is good is small areas and the character designs are distinct from one another, but unremarkable everywhere else. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this show is varied. From single use instruments like pianos to the use of strings to using organs to enhance the religious factor of this show. It's varied and enjoyable to listen to. Each piece of music matches to the environment well and is appropriately used in that aspect. This is especially true with the organs as whenever I hear those, I know something bad is going to go down. In fact, I got more engaged with the OST than with the characters to enhance the scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is very skippable for me. Outside of some clever use of imagery, it doesn't grab my attention as it just prepares me for what's to come, once i've seen it a couple of times, i've seen enough. Rather I enjoyed the ending sequence more than I enjoyed the opening. \"Pray\" by Haruka Chisuga has some very eerie instrumentals that conflicts with the light hearted vocals to make the song as a whole a haunting experience. While the visuals aren't anything to write home about outside of a few spots, I still enjoyed listening and watching the ending sequence. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nWhile writing this review, I realised that I enjoyed Angels of Death more than I thought. Sure I have huge gripes with this series that brought my experience down while watching it, but I do have positives for this show. It's characters besides Rachel are good and its overall mystery kept me watching. But it was that lack of emotional investment into this series and how much I dislike Rachel that brought this show down for me. It had a good start and I was getting invested in the final two to three episodes but it was that middle stretch of boredom and tedium that brought the quality of this show down for me. Now the show ain't finished as it ended on a cliffhanger. But it is the good kind of cliffhanger that makes you want to see what happens next. I did also get some answers to the mystery to make me satisfied but not too much to check out the 4 other episodes that for some reason are being streamed at another time\\n\\n\r\nI am not entirely disappointing with this show, just some aspects. It has enough intrigue to get me engaged for more but not enough to leave a side of caution with this show. For now, I will say this. Angels of death is a show that has a good mystery and intrigue that is hampered down by a tedious middle section and a weak female lead. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6.5/10   Recommendation: Consider it\\n",

            "content": "\"Kill me now\", \"Not until you show a good expression\"...your gonna hear these ALOT in Satsuriku no Tenshi.\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi is the anime adaptation of a Japanese horror adventure game using RPG Maker, so by extension this is Satsuriku no Tenshi's attempt branching out into it's multi-media franchise and this venture....is mixed for LA's judgment.\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi follows Rachel Gardner voiced by Haruka Chgusa waking up in a decrepit building and strikes a strange friendship with Zack Foster voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto, Rachel wants to die, but Zack now marked for death and the buildings \"angels\" now after Zack strikes up a deal, Zack willonly kill Rachel once Zack is out of the building.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi on the outset looks like most horror animes, but Satsuriku no Tenshi by in large is more on the lines of psychological thriller than horror, yes gore and blood appear but not to the point of visceral intent that most horror goes through. The psychological aspects comes into play when it involves the main cast of Satsuriku no Tenshi, especially towards Zack and Rachel.\\n\\n\r\nRachel and Zack as character do develop as outside their archetypes however they slow drip to you their backstories with Rachel's backstory being the most mysterious throughout the anime. Zack gets some backstory to how he became how he is but not much other than that as he doesn't exactly change from his hair triggered personality but at least he loosens up....a little, key word being \"little\". Rachel is pretty much the same, she's the typical stoic, silent type but has a deadpan voice to go along with it, yes we get glimpses of her backstory and how this affects the plot and the such but her backstory and revelation isn't brought up until the final episode. Nonetheless Rachel is also afflicted with having a backstory that doesn't change their personality in a ways but in comes the problem.....LA felt that both Zack and especially Rachel our MAIN NARRATIVE FOCUSED characters...were bland yeah who would had thought it?\\n\\n\r\nLA was more interested in the \"Angels of Death\" and how they factor into it, from the mad eye obsessed doctor, Daniel Dickens voiced by Takahiro Sakurai who \"knows\" Rachel, Edward Mason voiced by Natsumi Fujiwara, a little kid who specializes in making graves and tombstones who's in love with Rachel, Catherine Ward voiced by Mariya Ise, a sadomasochist warden that specializes in traps and was LA's favourite  Angel of Death by sheer merit of her insanely haughty personality and with Mariysa Ise backing this character up. Finally we have the blind priest Abraham Gray voiced by Houchuu Ootsuka who is more than you think. Really the Angels of Death made the anime a bit more interesting than our bland duo of Rachel and Zack even though they were intrinsically linked to both main characters but nonetheless, the Angels of Death and especially Catherine were a thrill to get to know even if they were ALSO stereotypical but the fact of them being villains and barring the main characters way and made the anime interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi falls under the the chess-piece storytelling and for a video game to anime adaptation right down to every conversation, every action the characters do, well you CAN TELL from the dialogue alone this felt like a straight up retelling, though this isn't a bad thing, for newcomers and whatnot but some of the flaws LA had for Satsuriku no Tenshi is of the repetitive dialogue and conversations between Rachel and Zack, hammering it into you of \"this is important\"...most times not but point being. Again with the aforementioned characters being stereotypically bland is a huge detriment to the anime and though we do learn at least Rachel and Zack's backstories, they just don't back enough enough for LA to be entirely invested (maybe Rachel near the end because of the focus is on her). Because this is an anime to video game adaptation and characters get into traps or a forced to do something for development or because of the game and everything it goes two ways, one it goes in line with the game and the fact the characters are in danger causes the events to happen, on the other hand it leads to chess piece story telling for this character do know what the audience now knew in advance, LA gets it it's a video game adaptation, but it doesn't have much freedom due it all...this IS a detriment but not to sole reasoning as to Satsuriku no Tenshi's downfall. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by JC Staff was admirable to say the least, they kept with it's aesthetics as a psychological thriller and with how they portrayed the mental state of it's characters through the use of stylized coloring of it's flashbacks, state of being and mental states, the more horror aspects though it is bloody and gory it kept in a respectable amount which is odd considering how many character die in this anime but nonetheless. Character designs were vibrant and grungy at the same time, fitting considering what kind of setting Satsuriku no Tenshi is placed in and the backgrounding also applies to this as well. If there was anything LA would properly praise JC Staff would be it's psychological aesthetics and how they portrayed it.\\n\\n\r\nMVP for the voice cast just HAS to go to Mariya Ise, she just hammed it up and LA just loved every moment of her in screen to the point of her OUT HAMMING NOBUHIKO OKAMOTO...like seriously. Haruka Chigusa was decent but like Rachel herself, bland, though LA won't blame her considering it was her role as Rachel  and as for Nobuhiko Okamoto as Zack...well we have Accelerator accenting here...another words, psycho crazy but he loosens up after his introduction as Zack and instead goes Bakugo arrogant cadence through out the anime afterwards. Overall, voice cast was decent enough with Mariya Ise just easily taking LA's favourite seiyuu in this anime, at least she brought life to this deathly anime...\\n\\n\r\nSatsuriku no Tenshi as a whole falls under it's bland characters, the anime tries to give us backstories to our main characters but for the most part becoming almost worthless, especially when it pertains Zack's backstory, Rachel as a character is bland and both drives the plot forward but has an interesting backstory but is barred by her personality and though we as the audience found out why Rachel wants to die by the end of the anime...LA just felt...nothing, another words, LA wasn't invested in Rachel as a character as much they develop Rachel as a character and gave her vague glimpses into her backstory. Again, LA was more interested in the Angels of Death than Rachel, the main protagonist. Production wise, it was great, from the good aesthetics of the animation down to it's character designs, psychological aspect and backgrounding as well as it's decent voice cast, but Satsuriku no Tenshi's slow drip plot and uninteresting main characters was the last stake in the coffin. \\n\\n\r\nOh, Satsuriku no Tenshi still under all this criticism is still \"fine\", but not great by any means if your interested in the game, it's still an ok but \"by the books\" video game to anime adaptation that buckles in making the anime interested in or care for it's characters that also leaves us off with a \"to be continued\" when the anime was only getting to it's climax (from what LA has gotten, the last 4 episodes will be released through online broadcast, still leaving the anime like that was such a tease to say the least).\\n\\n\r\n\"Kill me please\"...\\n\\n\r\nNo, but LA is disappointed to the point of death...",

And the design for the anime was really amazing, I loved the design for the inside of the building and all the narrow paths and bloodstained walls. The relationships` arequite complex but that`s just what makes it so interesting and enjoyable. And also I the funny moments` are really cute and great and it just adds` so much enjoyment to the whole episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first time writing a review so sorry if it`s not the best. But if you don`t like horror animes`I`d personally recommend this but if you like or love horror animes` I think this is just for you.\\n",

If I know there will not be any more episodes, I would RAGE QUIT! Update from me, a gamer of the game.\r\nSadly, the adaption was quite alright. This is coming from someone who actually REALLY enjoyed the game. Personally, everything after episode 12 is the greatest highlight of the game, so this leave everything that build up until episode 12 wouldn't be entertaining to watch. It is just the introduction.\r\nIf we follow the story graph from introduction, to rising action, toclimax, to falling action, to resolution, then the story is somewhere on the rising action as I speak here from episode 12. Ever heard of the Melancholy of Suzumiya? Yeah, these 12 episodes are kinda like that. Just a jumble mess that builds up the story for the movie, which was a masterpiece. I believe in the last 4 episodes would be amazing, and it will reach its climatic heights as all tension is only rising up to these last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI am very sadden and disappointed at the repetition of that music playing every single episode. I just wish they start using more varieties of music use, instead of that constant piano piece. Though they did some really emotion music on some scene, I can only say that the music was the worst use in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it a lot mainly because I played the game, and knew what will happened. I am sadden to see many people disliking the anime for its pace, but you know what they say, patience sometimes lead to entertainment that you've never experience before. Be patient and watch ALL of the story to finally judge.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, these last 4 episodes is the only greatest thing in the game. It carries the entire story to the end, and if you don't believe me, wait and witness for yourself the reward you will receive by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my long review! Have a great day!",

            "content": "Tl:dr - Pretty good, slow, and haven't seen enough to know.\r\nSLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nWriting a proper review this early into the series is rough, so I'll leave this as an interim due to my mixed feelings that may lead to me dropping it early. I also won't be engaging in detailed feelings for character and story since much hasn't been revealed yet.\r\nI am aware of the game this anime originated from, however I have not watched nor played the original.\r\nBRIEF SYNOPSIS:  4~6\r\nYoung woman (Rachel) wakes up in an unknown building and meets insane serial killer (Zack) and asks him to murder her. Zack refuses tokill her unless she assists him in escaping the building they're both in. Each floor they move to is controlled by other mentally disturbed characters that they must fight/outwit in order to survive and escape.\\n\\n\r\nAfter two episodes and considering this came from a freeware game it's obvious that this is a deliberate combination of mystery/psychological horror. Even Rachel, who is by all means the most sane character in the anime, has her own specific issues. Neither her nor Zack's backgrounds are explained early, rather being hinted at/explicitly shown throughout the course of the story. Each antagonist's demented quirks vary from obsessive insanity, sadistic torture, and possessive delusion.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I can say one thing: edgy. That's probably the one thing you'll hear everywhere about this anime, and it's true. Considering the story and setting \"explanations\", adding an absurd amount of edge to make this anime work in-genre is practically a necessity. I can also say that whatever mystery they have in store for Rachel isn't explicitly obvious, which is a nice touch to keep people watching. \\n\\n\r\nA problem I can see for others is that this anime can be considered fairly slow, which is my original reasons for wanting to drop it. This anime doesn't center itself around fast-paced action that betrays the gore and craze of its trailer. Rather it focuses on detailed visuals, sound cues, character design, and atmosphere which I have to give it credit for. \\n\\n\r\nART and SOUND: 7/6\\n\r\nAs said before I have my own share of praises for this anime. It presents both the background and characters spectacularly well, giving me high hopes for J.C. Staff's future works. Everything is detailed from the shine in Rachel's sweat to the rust on various tools. The added lighting in various scenes and shadows are spread perfectly to present each scene. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, there isn't too much in terms of \"epic\" such as Sawano Hiroyuki's works, but Noisycroak certainly knows what is necessary for such an anime. A mix of various scare chord-inspired works, eerie ambient sounds, and string-based discordant tracks works well in-universe. Nothing spectacular, just exactly what is needed. Opening theme is alright, but the Ending theme shines well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6 (Above Average)\\n\r\nI'm pleasantly surprised by this anime. I came in with low expectations and have been given much higher expectations as I go through. So far the characters haven't been fleshed out enough for me to say any of them excel, and the story is fairly unique so far. This anime can improve as log as it continuously expands on the main characters and maybe even the villains while hopefully increasing its own pace towards the end.\\n\\n",

Its a cool, and edgy story with a pair of main characters with really good chemistry.",

Was okay...? The idea itself was amazing, but the way that it was portrayed was, well, not good. It is true that everything that happened helped with character development, but the way it was written made the anime boring. I felt as though the entire thing was dragged out. I'm trying not to get into spoilers here, so I'll leave it at that.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art was the common \"anime\" artstyle. The graphics were good, and everything was fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice actors and actresses were amazing. The soundtracks suited the scene being portrayed, too. The ending song was suiting what I'm sure the feel the anime was going for, (and, in my opinion, failed to) but the opening song, compared to the ending song, wasn't that good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAll the characters obviously had a ton of research put into them. Rachel, Zack, and Danny had a fleshed out past, and it made sense why they act the way they did in the anime. The development was perfect. I'm sort of sad that the other characters' pasts couldn't be portrayed too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI'll try not to be harsh here, but I'm sitting here, staring at my screen, wondering what the heck I just watched. As I said before, it felt dragged out. I felt as if I lost so much of my time. This anime would've been better suited to lesser episodes. In the end, I was confused because of all the unnecessary details added. However, I loved the ending scene in the final episode. I loved the character development. Everything was perfect, but again, the biggest flaw was that the story stretched on for 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime was like any other show. It has no aspect to make it stand out in my mind, except for the ending song. It's just an anime I'll stack under my \"Hey, I watched that too\" list and carry on. I'm not saying that I regret watching it. It's just that if I could tell my future self about it, I'd advise them to watch it when I have nothing else to watch.",

It was very enjoyable, and the characters were each unique in their own way, I mostly enjoyed all the death, but the story that came behind all the death & chaos was even more amazing.",

After watching all of the episodes however, I change my mind. \r\nPlot: 2/10\r\nThere's so many plot holes. Who create such game? Who is the mastermind behind all these chaos? What exactly makes Rachel Gardner so special? None of my many questions were answered even after I have watched the entire episodes. The plot is ridiculously unrealistic in terms on how the characters react to different situations. What is the goal of this anime? I can't see it.\r\nGore elements? None. Sure there's bloodhere and there but it's nothing gory, nothing worth gasping or chilling over. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly, I hate Rachel's character the most. Her character is boring, typically cold, mysterious main character who has no goal in life and is so overly obsessed with the concept of dying in the name of God. Which is ridiculous considering she is one of the sinners.\\n\\n\r\nIsaac's character is shallow though kind of interesting. With the amount of blood he loses between episode 8 to 11, I think he probably should've died. \\n\\n\r\nThe priest's character is not explained well it got me confused. All in all, I couldn't love even one single character in this anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI felt like I wasted so many times watching all episodes of this anime. I keep on waiting and waiting for it to surprise me, to entertain me, even just a little, I keep on giving this anime a chance. But it's... just so disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nNot recommended at all.",

I don't feel that way ever while I was watching, ok I admit, I was confused at the character'sbehavior once. I also wasn't confused at all the religious stuff.\r\nI only watched the anime not the game or manga. (I watched all of the 16 eps)\r\nStory - the only thing that bothers me is that not all the character's backstories is revealed in the anime. It doesn't bother me that much though. \r\nI like the originality. Almost every other anime I watched, the mcwants to live. But in this anime, the mc seriously wants to die. Like she isn't being delusional and acting like a tragic hero. She's serious about it.\\n\r\nThere's some comedy once in a while. I find it heartwarming\\n\\n\r\nArt - I have nooooo problems with it. Its super pretty and nice. The characters are super cute personality and appearance wise. So bonus points (even though I can't give a higher score than 10). I love the eyes and creativity. \\n\\n\r\nSound. Amazing. The songs are good. Voice actors fit perfectly with the characters. The sound effects are amazing. Good at making atmospheres.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -  the characters aren't really annoying, do you know what I mean? Like there's characters who is super emotional, so emotional, it's annoying. I don't find any problem with their personalities and appearance. I actually love their personalities and appearances. They are super cute and nice. also it's not annoying when the character is delusional. Probably because they are not spewing nonsense about themselves. They are pretty convincing too even though they are delusional sometimes.\\n\r\nAlso the mc aren't like people who have never sinned and strive to be a hero to purify all evil. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime alot. So much it's my favorite anime. It's heartwarming, funny, there's a bit of laid-back personality, the characters are cute, they aren't annoying, good plot, a bit of psychopathic personality it's just, some fine gold anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's cool. Also the \"romance\" in it doesn't make me cringe so that's amazing.",

This one is really great, with all it's great aspects and flaws. Zack's voice actor actually did a splendid job for voicing him! Loved every bit of it. Keep in mind I only watched the anime.\r\nTo begin with, the story is rather complex since we have a psychological genre. The two main characters are Ray and Zack. I must admit I loved watching their relationship throughout the whole story. At times Iwould think the guy would do something incredibly cringe, opposite of what I wish he did at the time (in my mind), yet he does what I imagined in the first place and with a unique twist on it. I just couldn't believe how I loved being deceived and fulfilled all at a time. This isn't your typical 6+ score anime - it actually will move you, make you laugh, make you sad, make you desperate for certain things to happen. You will witness good character development and weird interactions, but you will (maybe) get it because it is a rather odd and deep show. The art is actually stunning! I couldn't find a single flaw in it which means it is actually very polished. There were literally only small little details that nobody would notice such as some birds being animated averagely.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, it is great, but taste played the major role here. If you got a different taste, you will most likely will not like it. I myself believe this to be what captures a good show from the rest - I would definitely place this among the better ones in my list, however, it is only my own opinion, so I hope it helps if you decide to watch it! It is a good watch, a good experience, and a good lesson altogether. Have fun!",

After certain events, they agree to absurd terms where he promises tokill her once they escape.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS HERE*\\n\\n\\n\r\nit turns out she killed her parents, the main antagonist is some dude that tries to figure out how religion works and is on the second to last floor.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt style is ok, it isnt amazing, but it isnt bad or eye hurting generic. It has it's specific traits (jaw line is drawn in a very appealing and specific manner)\\n\\n\r\nI liked it. the colour scheme is quite ok, though I'd prefer it to be either all toned or all colorful (or atleast change the whole scheme accordingly and dont leave characters colorful with bland backgrounds)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRegarding sound it was ok, voices were ok though Zacks voice was dreadful to hear because of his absurd laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (I will decribe my opinion in the enjoyment part, I will include more details regarding all of the above topics since I like to distinguish more of an objective and descriptory part first and my subjective thoughts second)\\n\\n\r\nThey seemed bland and illogical, so were their abillities. Sometimes they acted in a realistic manner and sometimes they were refusing to accept such thing as physics and logic.\\n\r\nBoth main characters were edgy \"traumatic background\" sad cliche personas.\\n\r\nDidnt enjoy them, their enemies lacked proper background and motivations (they had some but they were bland and didnt really protrude).\\n\r\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\r\nEnjoyment my overall opinion:\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the core, my main issue and the thing I find interesting to talk about is the fact that the whole anime seems so ironic and self aware.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that some illogical facts during the anime are pointed outs by characters, making it either very clever or an accident because of the fact that rest of the show seems very serious. \\n\\n\r\nSo thats the main thing that struck me positively.\\n\\n\r\nBut I do consider this anime to be a serious show and not some kind of deliberate caricature of cliched series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd thats the problem, it's trying to be edgy, but ends up being cringy with vague nonsensical and cliched characters (loli blue eyed blond quiet yet caring character with emotional problems, a middeschooler edgelord dream girl, a tall bandaged guy being all about killing and trauma, in a hoodie with a giant scythe, grotesque \"psycho\" yet \"loveable\" (cough cough) characters)\\n\r\nthey all seem like the target are introvertic edgy kids, making it quite a cringy experience. \\n\r\nThe show doesn't really explain motivations, Our character Rachel on one hand is emotionless, on the other she's cliched triggered by certain words or actions, which makes her \"unique\" for everyone in the building for some reason different for everyone (the eye motive is bad and lets all admit it), she contradicts herself by shooting the judge, yet refuses to commit suicide. \\n\r\nThere are many more problems with her character and the story but lets move on to the next \\n\\n\r\nZack kills because of some trauma (doesn't really explain this kind of urge and sympathy towards main protagonist, its either vague or doesnt have sense, as if writers thought that we would take it for granted and move on... also the blind nice old guy cliche was such a bloody cheap move), Eddie who's main trait is that he likes graves, we don't know how come he's inhumanly agile and supposedly can become invisible (ye ye, he's great at hidding, but the anime straight up shows that he dissapears and his agility doesnt make it easier to explain. \\n\\n\r\nAn obsessive doctor who is very very fond of eyes (I never really heard why exactly apart from the fact that he has a bad eyesight)\\n\\n\r\nA Sadistic judge (cant remember her name), she enjoys giving \"justice\" in her own twisted sense of justice (looks like a character from Danganronpa and is just as irritating as Zack with her laugh)\\n\\n\r\nA priest that tries to create his own religion (which is literally like catholism, so much it makes our protagonist think that way till the very end, just until he doesnt explain it; also witch and inquisition cliche)\\n\r\nHe's similar to other villains who's causes are \"motiveted\" by something bigger. He isn't really all bad but the way he executes his plan is ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't really compelling either, neither the narrative portion of it, it's predictable, boring and repetetive, I don't mind shallow series, I enjoy them, but when an anime tries to act like some sort of philosophical and psychological series when in the end it's just an edgy backstory trauma weep train, it's just plain dissappointing, if the characters had more depth less edge and wouldn't act so ridiculous, it could have been a decent show.\\n\\n",

Also if you interested in abnormal relationships between fictional characters, you can like it. \r\n* Zack is totally a bae for me. He is just a non-complex killer but I don't think he's \"dumb\". Yes, he doesn't have a deep philosophy about life but he has sharp, clear thoughts. \r\n* Ray's catatonic personality made me sick. Afterwards, we saw the reason of her behaviors. Ray has a deep story and many right reasons to act like that. But still; that unemotional, unreactiveloli was very boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\n* Ray has good synergy with Zack. You can define the relationship between them as \"Stockholm Syndrome\". I don't understand that kind of relations but I think they are cute as a couple, in a weird way.\\n\\n\r\n* All antagonists are okay but completely my personal opinion: That doctor is very annoying. My favorite antagonist is the Priest. \\n\\n\r\n* All episodes have little details about Ray's past. In my opinion, the best episodes are the last three ones because Ray starts to react more humanly in these episodes. And Ray-Zack relationship becomes apparent.\\n\\n\r\n* The opening is good, the ending is perfect. Every episode has a motto.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nThe story was interesting enough to follow it in spite of its flaws--there were some very specific plot points that were alluded to from the very first episode... And while I love a nice, good dose of foreshadowing, in this case, it just felt... forced. They were constantly throwing back in our face that we do not understand the characters we are seeing before us, to the point where when it came time for the plot twists at the end... (this applies to the end of the 12th episode, mind)... there was no element of surprise left to be had. You were approaching theepisode from a standpoint of \"Okay, so we know there's something fishy here, but what is it?\" From a viewer perspective, that sort of anticipation only propels an audience to continue watching if it's done subtly. The sort of exasperated anticipation just leaves a feeling of \"Okay, this better be good, or else I just wasted a few hours of my life I ain't ever getting back.\" And frankly, the plot twist was not good enough for that to be an effective mechanism. Most of the \"twist\" was just stuff we either knew or easily could have guessed from early on. \\n\r\nThere's also an overwhelming sense with the pacing that... you can just tell it was based off of a video game, even if you've never heard of the aforementioned game. Certain scenes make sense when you consider how they would be used in your standard indie horror game, but when you apply them to real life, or even to an anime... It just doesn't seem like it should work quite like that. I have had zero exposure to the game, so I cannot comment any further on that, but I do believe that when making a series about a video game, a viewer should not watch it and within the first episode think \"...am I watching an anime or a video game?\"\\n\r\nI will say, however, that I did appreciate how even though the beginning of each episode started with the last few seconds to a minute of the prior episode, there was usually something new added before the opening sequence, so it didn't feel overly repetitive. It was more like \"We showed you this already, but here's more details.\" I liked that because I don't want to waste my time on something I've already seen. This sort of gentle reminder as to where the last episode left off plus fleshing it out more to lead into the current episode? Good storytelling. Works for both people who had to step away from the series for a period of time and for people watching everything close to the same time. \\n\r\nMost of my other qualms with the plot revolve more extensively around the characters than the plot itself, but I will reiterate: The show's foreshadowing was not exactly the most agreeable and the plot twists were far too obvious to have any element of surprise. The show was too predictable, but the story somehow managed to keep me hooked in spite of that, so I'll give it a solid 6. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nOkay, the visuals for this anime? Better than most I've seen. You can see not just the expressions of the eyes but also the highlights in the eyes reflecting characters' emotions, when a character is injured it doesn't just magically fade away in the next episode, you can tell on the characters' clothes which stains are older and which are newer (a lot of shows forget about holes and stains from one episode to the next), and camera positioning as well as choreography are both used very nicely to convey characters' emotions. \\n\r\nI cannot say enough: I love the choreography for this show. From episode 1 to episode 12 (or episode 16 if you stuck with it until the \"real\" ending), you can clearly see body language of the characters being used very expressively, to the point where you can clearly connect it to how a real actor would portray that scene. There aren't a lot of static frames/segments, and where they do exist, they're used to create tension. \\n\r\nThe designs of the characters were very simple (which I assume is due to faithfulness to the original game?), but the art style for the anime allows enough detail for them to feel lifelike in spite of their simplicity, and the art and visual cues are used to reflect each character's personality, and I repeat, the choreography also helps this. \\n\r\nThe backgrounds are well-done and set the scene for each location, and visual symbolism is used throughout the series to reflect each character and each plot point's implications. \\n\r\nI would rate the visuals at a solid 10. The visuals played a significant role in my continuing to watch this series through to the end. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nDue to the nature of this anime as a horror-based show, music and sound effects can make or break any scene... and I would say that in terms of music and sound effects, this show nailed it. You can tell the weight of objects and the materials of things based on the sound effects, and music is used to create tension--and most importantly, it succeeds in doing so. The music is just subtle enough to not tell you anything the anime isn't already throwing in your face. \\n\r\nThe voice actors also definitely fit the characters. They were all skilled in such a way that they managed to portray their characters and convey the personalities of their characters very well. With the exception of some of the laughing sounding off to me, I can't say the VAs were bad--at least, not the Japanese ones. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending were also both very nice and pleasing to the ear, even though I personally skipped the ending sequence a lot because I don't listen to slower songs particularly often. The opening, however, was a good song that I didn't skip a single time because I liked it that much. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, while I do remember that the music was used well to strengthen the pacing and the emotions evoked by a scene... all I can remember of the music from episode-to-episode is that it wasn't bad. I know it did well at what it did, but... Ultimately, everything besides the opening was... pretty forgettable. For that reason, I'll give it a 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOnto the biggest complaints I have about the series as a whole is the characters. They were all enjoyable to watch. Unique enough to be memorable in spite of their flaws. \\n\r\nBut. \\n\r\nThroughout the plot, most all of the characters were portrayed in a light that highlighted one specific trait they were \"known\" for, and while those traits were usually explained, there wasn't... depth to the characters beyond that. You don't see multi-faceted characters with intricate personalities... You see single- or maybe double-sided characters (though that's... debatable), but you don't really see complex emotions and while it's highly implied, if not directly stated, that some of the characters have some form of psychosis, the story does nothing to understand the actual effects and treatment of psychosis (or any potential mental illnesses, for that matter). They're just given a side of crazy to make the plot more creepy. \\n\r\nThat said, the characters were interesting enough to keep me watching in spite of this... The characters were likable enough for me to sit through 12 episodes with them and there was character development, however minuscule, to make me want to see how they would continue to grow as the plot continued. For portraying these sorts of one-track characters in an interesting enough fashion for me to see it through to the end, I'll give it a 6. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nFor all its faults, I will say that I personally found this show greatly entertaining for what it was, and I have a lingering attachment to some of the characters, even if I think they could have been written better. The ending (note: referring to the ending of episode 16) fit the characters perfectly and was a perfect resolution to the storyline. Everything we needed to know for that story was revealed and none of the plot points were left as holes. \\n\r\nIt's one of those shows that mostly appeals to people who like horror themes with an emphasis on psychosis, but as someone who eats that stuff up, I found myself going back and rewatching it. I highly enjoyed this... but I have to doc points off for it being annoyingly transparent and some of the character arcs just... not being interesting to me from a personal standpoint. I'd recommend this anime to people who enjoy horror, suspense, and a focus on psychological themes in horror and suspense and who don't mind religious undertones, but ultimately, it's not something I would recommend to just anyone. I would rate it as a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nOverall, it has an intriguing story and an interesting enough plot to sit through 16 full episodes. As an experience, there were plot twists that caught me off guard, and the first episode was compelling and confusing enough to pique my curiosity. While the pacing of the story is a bit awkward and the story is very transparent, the visuals and music help to make up for where it is lacking, and the choreography is very expressive and well-thought out. The suspense elements were just strong enough to make up for the predictability of the plot and the simplicity of the characters. For what it is, I'll give it a 7, but if it had been a little less obvious as an anime based off of a game, I might have given it an 8 or even a 9.",

I enjoyed the mystery in that and anticipating what her background was. That did not disappoint, but I did get my hopes up too high on the relationship between Rachel and Zack. I was kind of hoping for a deeper sort of relationship between them. \r\nSpoiler:\r\nI was kind of hoping they were going to end up together as in become killers together or at least have seen what she wanted him to do to her, especially sinceit's all she talked about throughout the entire show. But neither happened. So I was fairly disappointed and it kind of ruined the entire experience because I was not able to get full satisfaction so if you are like me then you won't really like the show unless you prepare yourself and just enjoy the show for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was fine but I can't say I recommend it.",

            "content": "So, this was a chore to watch. I'll start out being saying the sound and art are alright, but that should be a given for all anime. Pretty much everything else is an absolute drag. It is easy to imagine the type of audience for this kind of anime/manga/game because it hits perfectly on all the sappy love story notes. The thing with this anime is that all the \"romance\" aspects were spun into a really contrived psycho-horror semantic word game. Like everyone is talking about \"being together forever\" and \"not wanting to be alone\" and all that stuff but under the pretense of murder.It just has me sitting here thinking, \"ya know, what's the point in any of this?\" In any other context, it's a generic adventure-romance story with two protagonists who are so very obviously going to get together in the end, but because Rachel says it like, \"I only want Zack to kill me. He promised.\" and Zack being like, \"I never lie\" then the crowd goes wild? And speaking of the dialogue, the verbal tap dancing in Satsuriku no Tenshi is just dreadful. I was so tired of hearing Rachel repeat herself over and over that even Zack had enough after the first few times. I understand that Rachel is cute (and boy, is she cute), but that's no excuse for this writing that sounds like it came from a middle schooler who just started writing romance novels. So many ideas could've been conveyed in a fashion that wasn't so hamfisted; it felt like this anime was force feeding me the whole time. Something that would've improved this anime was more humor, because it doesn't really take itself that seriously either. I was expecting there to be humor similar to that of Gugure! Kokkuri-san where there is some seriousness there, but it's deflated using well-timed jokes and slapstick comedy. Instead, the forced dread piles up like a stock market bubble and the few quirky moments sprinkled in between don't really add depth to any of the characters. They're all crazy, loud, mysterious, or drab or a random combination of these qualities. Satsuriku no Tenshi is a circular, verbose, tedious, and just straight-up boring anime, but if you're a damaged person or a hopeless romantic, and are slightly demented, you might find this pulling on your heartstrings.",

            "content": "Angels of death is an anime adaptation of a video game, a horror game. Now i have not played the game, this is solely my review on the anime. \r\nStory: The story, without any spoilers, but enough to give you a sense of what angel of death is about is basically, there's a girl named Rachel gardner. She suddenly wakes up in this room where she has no memlry of how she got there. The whole \"plot\" is for her to escape this place. She must overcome other people in this building, that \"surprisingly\" enough are trying to kill her.\r\nArt: Nothing special here, but nothingawful. Was a pretty mediocre art style. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I fell in love with the ending soundtrack, it's honestly beautiful, but a shame that it's in this anime. But a good thing at the same time because if it weren't, j wouldn't have found the END soundtrack. Would suggest giving it a listen. Opening is just fine imo.\\n\r\nSound in the actual anime is okay, not bad neither outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nRachel gardner: oh boy, the dread awful characters. Rachel is a quite, and quite BORING character that you don't even want to root for. And you're supposed to since she's trying to escape. I understand that they were trying to make her a emotionless character, but viewing 6 episodes, and not until ep 7 does she show little growth is plain awful.\\n\r\nZack: it is later revealed why he acts the way he does, but it's done so poorly. To sum him up short he's a serial killer, who has an obnoxious laugh throughout the anime.\\n\r\nOther supporting characters: They just want to kill them causs they want to... weak characters for sure\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Do you love a whole episode being a cliffhanger? Well that's what you're in for with Angels of death. Each episode gives you the illusion that the story is progressing, but i watched 7 episodes, and man where they literally painful to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you enjoyed this, cool. I didn't and i gave some points as to why. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not only are each episodes progressively boring to sit through but they get you nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also my first review so if it's not the best or well constructed that's because I'm new to this\\n",

You can see from how the scenes are made and some interactions that it was made for and RPG Maker creation, I think that knowing that it was made from a game helps to watchit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art 10/10 :\\n\r\n\tAstounding, that season there was a good of show with good art but this one definitely caught my attention more than the others by it\u2019s beauty and care for details as little as they could be. There were some nice shots such as the one in the end or the judgment scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound 9/10 :\\n\r\n\tThe piano was one of the main reasons this had a high score, the OST was at the top of it\u2019s game.

Like, heck, why did they change one of Catherine's obstacles into a fricking dollhouse... it wasoriginally an abyss with several narrow columns spaced far away from one another as their only support to cross to the other side... that or a rope so thin it could break... not to mention that at random moments guns would shoot them and potentially lose their balance and fall into their deaths. That, and they went on their separate ways because Zack can't cross using the rope and Rachel can't jump too far between the columns...\\n\\n\r\n...I'm getting off-track, back to the anime itself\\n\\n\\n\r\nYes, I can understand why people could hate the anime without knowing the original source first... because it was originally a game, hence the puzzle-solving aspects and the each-floor-is-a-new-challenger-kinda thing. And that I felt that each of the \"villains\" was not given enough \"tension\" and their resolve and character was not properly adapted (in my humble opinion), that's why anime-watchers only didn't connect enough with them and didn't feel their presence enough to be intimidating (like, if they made this with two seasons with 24 episodes total, they could have expanded and put up each of the villain's back story, which was available in the manga adaptation... *shrugs*)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut then, sure it was quite disappointing but like I said at the beginning, I loved the game because of Zack and Ray, and that really, it was said at the summary of the anime that this is about the two of them and their strange promise at one another and their obstacles that they face in each floor. And the floor bosses actually served each of their purpose... to put up a psychological damper in both Zack and Ray.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdward Mason, his resolve in putting Rachel in eternal rest due to him knowing Ray's past was because his past (I won't spoil them here, read the manga instead) shaped him into a character that turns those that he kills and buries into his treasures and that became his form of love... thus his desire to end Ray's misery.\\n\\n\r\nCatherine Ward, with her strong belief and prejudice that knows no bounds (her backstory in the manga just emphasized that), and that she truly believes in her own power of condemning those she hails as criminals... no exceptions. But it was her observing nature and beforehand knowledge that makes her a threat to Zack and Rachel's relationship. I like to think of her as a prosecutor that explains her reasons and views... before mercilessly killing those she found guilty.\\n\\n\r\nDanny Dickens... as his name implies, he's a d***\\n\r\n...lol sorry got carried away there, He deserves to be the main antagonist of this series due to his connections with Rachel and his past. I absolutely loved his character development the most and I thank the anime for actually fleshing out his resolve and desires... (ep. 16... \"...mother!\"... seriously, I don't remember him saying that in the game but it made his character closure so much better!).\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, Gray (lol I just searched the character list and apparently, his last name is Abraham haha good to know). He is the most mysterious character out of all of them since we don't know much about him. All we know is that he's the \"god\" of the building that our protagonists are trapped in and that he's the one leaving those cryptic messages that Rachel sometimes find in some of the floors. Yes, he does attempts to kill Rachel at one point but that is after evaluating her and giving her trials and tests that would let him assess her morals. I would spoil if I keep on talking about him so watch the anime instead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think the reason why people didn't like the anime because they thought since this has a boss-per-floor thing, the action scenes will be the focus. This ain't shounen guys, this is horror... specifically, psychological horror.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, don't expect jumpscares and gross things. Find them someplace else. Not here.\\n\\n\r\nThe main obstacles are not the ones that are physically present (strength of the enemy), but rather, it was the situations that is presented by each of the villains that is the real threat to our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a battle... a clash of ideals.\\n\r\nWith our two protagonists right at the center, their decisions and inner workings of their minds shaping the series. They adapted Zack's and Ray's relationship with each other so well that I actually teared up in one of the later episodes due to how good it was.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I talked enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the original source, I'm happy with how they adapted this anime.\\n\r\n(*whispers* EPISODE 16 IS EVERY GAME/MANGA/LN 'S DREAM COME TRUE)\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the game, I watched it for Zack and Rachel. I am more than satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\r\n9/10 (-1 because despite it being a great adaptation of the game, It lacked some charm that the game had. But then, they overwhelmed me with the anime ending so all is good <3)",

            "content": "The anime has now 15 episodes , the last one should be published soon . What can I say? watch it. It 's not bad , the thing that really annoyed me was that Rachel reminded us like 5-8 time per episode that she wants to die but that s all. I really loved the characters after all , you found out why she wants to die when they got to her ...you'll find out , I m not giving any spoilers. \r\nRachel will seem to be the typical  kuudere but as the episodes go by you will start to notice some emotions ,in the end you will see an explosion of feelings.\\n\r\nStory : 8 \\n\r\nWhy? they could add more details , everything was so cryptic that sometimes left me a little confuse ( lucky , everything stars to have sens in the last 4 episodes  ) oh and the fact that we see the same conversations sometimes .The God thing? I still don't get some things about her obsession, some things  are clarified some not.\\n\r\nArt 10:\\n\r\nI LOVED IT . I really enjoyed it. Rachel was stunning and I loved how they added to her eyes the most details to make them as unique as possible .The floors arrangements represented the characters personality , it helps a lot in finding out more about who they are if you pay more attention on it. \\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nThey could do better , but it was ok.\\n\r\nCharacters 8:\\n\r\n8 because they really did a nice job with Rachel for me , from a sweet , scared girl with amnesia to a criminal it s a long way. Her looks as I said at art , it was stunning.\\n\r\nAbout the other protagonist ,I loved  Zack from the beginning actually . Yes , he's not something special , the typical villain , the bad boy with a f***d up past but he was ok for me , the one thing that makes him more...unique it s the story about the  bandages that he s cover up with. What really I liked about him is not his appearance , his way of showing that he cares about her , a prove that in every evil is something good. At the beginning he can be annoying for some but you will like him , trust me , give the guy a chance , he s more than he shows in the first episodes. \\n\r\nThe other ones?\\n\r\nI hate Daniel , we got that he has some ugly eyes , his obsession for pretty eyes and the mother thing. \\n\r\nEddie was a sweetheart , I liked him . His home really represented him and his actions that we found about shows his true self.\\n\r\nThe pink hair lady?\\n\r\nDidn't like her , neither her laugh. \\n\r\nThe priest it s nice actually ', he s not a crazy psiho like the other characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: not 10 because of some things that will annoy every human that will watch the anime .I don t have much to say about it , just give the anime a chance , you will  not regret it.\\n\r\nOverall:8:\\n\r\nThey could do  better ,they could work more on this but it s alright like this too. is not for everyone this anime but give it a try and if you like something about it finish watching all the episodes. \\n\r\nHave a nice day(night for some ) <3\\n\r\nUPDATE: I just finished the anime. Watch it . The end is not how most people think .",

            "content": "A IMP Review of: Angels of Death (season 1) (Dubbed edition)\r\n(IMP stands for \u201cIn My Prospective\u201d, meaning if someone attempts to correct the way I see the show I have no intention of reading any \u201ccorrections\u201d)\r\nI have to admit this story is quite an interesting experience, i don't see often in anime and the fact it's based off a game help revive my opinion of anime to game adaptations (i'm looking at you Danganronpa...) But without further adieu let's head to the story floor (you'll get it if you watch the show).\r\nStory: We start of with young Rachel Gardner who wakes up in a roomwith no memories of her recent events believing she is in the hospital after a gruesome accident involving her parents. When she finds out she's not in a hospital she gets on the elevator which takes her one floor up where she runs into a scythe wielding maniac who's determined to kill her. She manages to avoid capture and reach floor 3 where she meets a familiar face, Doctor Nutjob (not really his name), or Eddie who seems to have a huge fascination with blue eyes and wants to extract Rachels, but Scythey McSythey wants to contiue the chase and heads to floor 3, after spoiler type things happen Rachel finally remembers that tragic memory about her parents and asks Scythey Mcscythe to kill her, he loses interest and offers to do the deed if she helps him get out of the crazy floor maze because he's dumb as a brick  and she wholeheartedly agrees and while they ascend they learn more about each other, for better or for worse. To mean thats a solid 9/10 story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Let's start with Rachel Gardner (sense you'll hear this name CONSTANTLY throughout the show), She's not your typical little girl, after she remembers somethings important, her eyes are cold and lifeless and she becomes the extremely dependent on Zach and his Scythe attack (brain and braun type thing) and has a strange fascination with god. Throughout the show you'll she her making decisions that ultimately are to her own personal benefit and that will be confronted later on. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to Zach attack who absolutely hates Rachel's new face and wants her to smile throughout the show so he head actually get up the nerve to kill her when hes finally out. Zach is abrasive, loud and can't read (which is somewhat important), he's always covered in bandages and is practically invincible when hit with normal attacks. He becomes less chaotic as they continue but still is a murderer at heart. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters i don't want to spoil everything about them so lets just give them nicknames, First Doctor Eyelove, Second Happy Happy Grave Boy, Third Ms. Drunk on Punishment, and Forth Mr. Narcissist (who overall had the most corny-stupid and best lines of all the side characters IMO).\\n\\n\r\nWith our interdasting cast of freaky friends i'd give them a all a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style wasn't bad but wasn't like timeless either, I really enjoyed the faces in this show and the grim atmospheric colors but besides that it was standard so 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Most of the time i rate this based off the opening or songs in the show, but the background music helped set the tone of the show so i can't complain about that, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I waited to binge watch out to episode 10 or 9 and it really got me in the psychological mode, i'd say its weakest point was i believe episode 11 but overall i can overlook it and with its (to be continued) message at the end perhaps they got approval for a sequel, of which if its true i would enjoy to see how things go in the next season so i'd say it was a solid 8/10 in terms of my enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: i give this show the overall rating of 8/10, it would have been 9/10 if not for the 11th episode, a cop out situation (i won't say for spoilers), and the to extreme attitude adjustment of Zach. (which is also why it's not a 10/10) I recommend that people go watch this cause its worth your time if you like Psychological type stuff. \\n\\n\r\nLet me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I\u2019m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own \u201canime records\u201d so to speak, so if you see this and don\u2019t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for my record than anything in the long run.",

            "content": "Satsuriku no Tenshi was a very hyped show, one fans were excited and waiting for. And for the first episodes, it did help satisfy the audience, but overtime, the story decayed to a rather mediocre story led by weak characters, barely keeping the anime from collapsing into chaos.\r\nJ.C. Staff did a great job with introducing Satsuriku no Tenshi, cleverly setting up the protagonists Zack and Rachel as well as a horror/mystery atmosphere. Many questions such as who Rachel and Zack were, where they were trapped in, and why they were trapped in the strange building were all well introduced in the first episode. If J.C.Staff had continued this quality of production, this show would have been amazing.\\n\\n\r\nExcept they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nJust from the 2nd episode much of the atmosphere that J.C. Staff so nicely set up was almost nonexistent, as if it was completely ignored or wasn't even there in the first place. The horror feeling is gone, and the mystery just felt so lackluster. But it was only the second episode, and there was still a lot of hope remaining. Sadly, the story never picked up from this devastating injury; overtime almost everyone that was set up from the first episode is gone, no horror or mystery, as if it was entirely a new anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow Satsuriku no Tenshi tried to compensate for its poor plot with good characters which can work, but in order for this to work there needs to be great character development, background or backstory, and depth. \\n\\n\r\nExcept there really wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff tried very hard to create 2 great characters, Zack and Rachel, as they worked together to defeat the floor \"bosses\" and reach the top. And they both developed overtime, but the reasons why were very confusing. There was not really much to explain about the reasons behind their developments, their absolute loyalty to each other(other than their oath), and who they truly were as characters. It was very confusing, being thrown Rachel's ideals of God and Zack's backstory of why he became such a murderous man. J.C. Staff introduced these factors thinking we'd understand or relate to the characters, but it only made things worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the only redeeming factors of the show, it nicely fits the \"supposed\" atmosphere of the anime and can be considered pretty high quality. The soundtrack is also pretty good, especially the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stress enough how important characters or plot or both are to the overall story. Art and soundtrack are nice, they enhance the experience but they alone are barely enough to keep a show together. Art and sound are rather benefits, and to fully enjoy a series, there needs to be either good characters or good plot, or if possible, both. Satsuriku no Tenshi could not continue with their great set up in the first episode, and when they tried to compensate with better characters but failing to do so too, it ultimately just fell and became one of the season's greatest letdowns.\\n",

            "content": "Edit: Satsuriku no Tenshi will apparently get some ONA to finish up the whole story since the show should end at episode 16. Therefore, I will leave my final review on the ONA section of the show.\r\nRealize that some of the reviews have been given based on the first 4 episodes which i can firmly say was a totally different situation compared to where the show has taken us so far.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAs for someone that have already done a total of 2 whole gameplay of the rpg, it might have heavily impacted on my overall judgement of the anime it is based off of. However,what i can say about the pace of the story is that it is fairly steady and well in sync with the actual game. they don't seem to hastily breezes through the story and manages to hit almost if not all the key points on the game as well. I do look forward to whether they will continue with the game's story line all the way to the end or if they will implement an anime alternative ending for this game.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there are a lot of shows out there right now with miraculous and amazing animations and unique art styles. However, the art style I would say make a huge improvement to the original game while being able to hold similarities with the art style and textures present in the game. As for character design, I found the characters to be drawn accurately based on each character's personality without losing reference to the game.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that the ed fits this type of anime well better than the op but both have been executed well to the point that I feel satisfied. I would've given sound a 9 if they were to use some of the original ost from the rpg but the background music used delivers the same effect as the original ost so no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\ni think we can agree that compared to episode 1, the characters begin to show development in characterization especially for rachel and zack. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI tend to enjoy shows especially those that are based off of video games. Most of my enjoyment can be coming from nostalgia from my first play through of the game. However, I can firmly say as this point of the anime that even without the experience from the rpg, I would still enjoy this show as much as anyone else would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to have the anime spoiled then I'd say hold off the game that does exist for this anime for now. Other than that, I would say the show is a watch for those into horror or psychological shows.",

            "content": "Oh lookie here another edgy seasonal show. Angels of death! *Menacing* Angels of Death is about a 13 year old quiet blond girl named Rachel, who wakes up without any memories in some basement of an abandoned building. She wakes up and walks around for a bit and runs into this one interesting character. Some guy wrapped in bandages wielding a scythe named Zack. He tries to kill her, but after a series of spoilerly events they reconcile and decide to work together to escape the building they are trapped in. They are held together by 2 promises. The promise that Zack will do everythinghe can to help get them out of there, and that when they finally get out, Zach will kill Rachel.\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is sort of confusing, because this is Rachel\u2019s wish. Yes, she wants to die. We can check that motive off the list of edgy anime. But no, wait a minute, she only wants to die by Zack\u2019s hands though. This is because Zack made a mindless comment on how he \u201cswears to god\u201d that he\u2019ll kill her, and due to her devout belief, she takes that as a promise that she must help him keep. She's the smart one. The brains.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs most of these pairs go, Zack is the muscle of the duo. But not so much muscle as a violent, unstoppable, borderline supernatural force. He\u2019s pretty stupid and relies on Rachel to give him orders a lot of the time. Well, it's not as much as relies on her, its just that he takes what she tells him to do, and takes it as a suggestion instead of something that will get them out of there faster, easier, and without harm. From what I can see, his only motivation is killing. He\u2019s only helping Rachel because 1. He wants to kill her, and 2. He wants to get out to kill some more. All of this is in a character design which looks like a 12 year old child of divorce would create. Bandages covering his body entire, black hoodie, bloodstains all over his body, and one of his most prominent features, his huge fucking scythe he just carries around with him for the entire show. I called him a supernatural force earlier because this fucker just won't die. Over the course of the show, he\u2019s been stabbed, blogdended, ripped open, poisoned, fucking took the electric chair multiple times, and walked away with minimal injuries. To end it off, Zack\u2019s voice is awful and makes ME want to take the electric chair when he laughs.\\n\\n\r\n\tEnough about him, let\u2019s get into the wondrous story they give us in Angels of Death. As stated earlier, they\u2019re trapped in a mysterious building, and they\u2019re working to get out of there. They work together to solve puzzles, defeat villains, and get to higher and higher floors. On every floor there\u2019s a villain trying to kill them and who they have to defeat to get to the next floor. These are the characters you\u2019ll see in the poster art. These characters aren\u2019t really notable and are just as edgy as the main characters. Mainly in the sense where they just want to kill without little motivation to do so except they like to. The protagonist also find clues to learn more about themselves and their pasts in the process.\\n\\n\r\n\tYou may have read back in the previous paragraph and squinted your eyes just a little bit when I said that they solve puzzles to get out. Maybe you thought it was just some bad wording on my part, but, in fact, they are puzzles. Now you see, Angels of Death was originally a game. Not only a game, an rpg maker game. You can find and play it on steam right now. I don\u2019t know how accurately the anime follows the game, but the fact that there are scenes in the anime that directly reference to what I assume were real puzzles in the game. At one point, with no sense or irony at all, they find a switch to open a door hidden underneath a pot. If that doesn\u2019t scream game adaptation, I don\u2019t know what is. The anime also has a fuck ton of these long corridors for these characters slowly walk down, which is very game like. With these unnecessarily perfect adaptations of the game, you gotta wonder what creative liberties they took with the anime in the first place. If I would\u2019ve watched a lets play on the game, would I have the same experience as I had while watching the anime? I mean, as a game, it has a pretty interesting concept. The protagonist teams up with the first floor boss and goes through the game and watches the 2 bosses duke it out. But it just doesn\u2019t transfer to anime I feel.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe thing about the animation, is that it sucks most of the time. But, for some reason, I don\u2019t know what, the blood splatters that come out of the body looks really good. I the art makes an impression I guess. I mean, its not pretty at all. But it mainly having to do with lots of fun and unique character designs, despite everything being edgy, they look good I must admit. They really represent their character.\\n\\n\r\n\tOne more thing about this show which, in my eyes, is despicable. At the end of the anime, it's a cliffhanger, you know? Pretty shitty, but the thing is that all the rest will be revealed in the specials revealed in the blu ray release. This is incredibly scummy to me. Having the rest of the story in the specials, means that nobody will be able to finish the story without buying the actual blu ray disk. Legally at least. I guess you could buy the game, but anime onlies are going to be very angry.\\n\\n\r\n\tI give Angels of Death, a 2 out of 10. I recommend to whoever just wants to watch an terrible edgy show for the lolz. Or just likes edgy stuff.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, to be true:\r\n1. My English is horrible, but I'm trying. ;-;\r\n2. It's my first review, but because all those reviews with low raiting with only 4 of 16 episode, and I can't just sit and nothing do about it! I just can't look at this.\r\n3. I know how this is gonna end, because I played in game. Yes. Game is a source anime.\r\n4. I give this anime in my personal raiting 10, because I just can't look at this all bad raitings... 6.99 is just too low for this anime.\r\nAnd now a review:\r\nStory:\r\nMany people hate the story, but you know why? Because you haveto wait! 4 episodes is not much to know the story... 10 also. If you really wanna enjoy the show then you have to wait for all discovers secrets about a story, and a Rachel. Because yes, she have her own secret, and belive me, you won't be disappointed ^.^\\n\\n\r\nBut, the specificts. The story is about Rachel - 13 years old girl. She woke up in strange place, and doesn't remember anything. Or maybe..? She meet a serial killer - Zack. To be true. He is a stupid 20 years old guy... But we all love him. In first, she ran away. But when they meet again... Something is diffrent. Why Rachel is not runing? And why she ask Zack to kill her? Only one is sure: She recalled something, that she shouldn't.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end: 8/10 <3\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple, but I love how it looks in the end. Just perfect for this anime. And it's really nice to watching ^.^\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe... 9/10?\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOk. I love music from game, and I'm really sad that in anime they change music ;-; But still: Opening and ending... I JUST LOVE THEM. This is the opening and ending that you don't skip ;3\\n\\n\r\nSo... 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOk, this will be fun, because:\\n\r\nAnyone: Rachel suck!\\n\r\nMe: Love Rachel. Danny suck.\\n\\n\r\nBut why all those people hate Rachel? Because she doesn't have any emotions. But why? Because she have a reason! So this is sad, that so many people can't wait for all answers ;-;\\n\r\nOk, but I'm not here for crying\\n\\n\r\nI really love characters (Still Danny suck. Cathy too). They have their own story. And I love that in anime Zack have his backstory! Yes, in game he hasn't... But still love him.\\n\r\nAnd Rachel... She is little cinamon roll. Must protect! ;A;\\n\r\nOk, ok. I know.\\n\\n\r\nZack: Really funny guy. Ok. He is a serial killer, but... He has really sad backstory (like Rachel). And to be true: He is like Deadpool. He never die, even if he lose 2 liters of blood xD\\n\r\nRachel: She have her backstory. And to be true it's really sad. But no spoilers. Maybe she hasn't any emotions, but still it's inteligent girl. It's just slowly developing character ^.^\\n\\n\r\nSo I gave them 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoument:\\n\\n\r\nI just have fun in this anime, and also I \"crying\" a lot (ok, I don't, but I'm really, really sad), because of the story. And it's good, because it's not only the comedy. It's a serious anime with serious problems in it (if you know the ending, or Rachel backstory then you know what I'm talking about)\\n\\n\r\nSo I give it... 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPersonal I give it 10. But to be more true... I give 8/10. And it's really good rating ^.^\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's my personal opinion (but I'm trying to do a good review ;-; ), but I'm hope that I help someone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again. I'm really, really sorry for my English, but it's just not my language, haha.",

So far, it has taken some unexpected but not totally amazing twists and turns. Rachel is a bit confusing of a character, and the male MC seems a bit out of touch with his own feelings., While we get a glimpse into who he is, Rachel still remains a bit of a mystery. I will add, andthis isn't a spoiler, that the first episode seems to be crucial to the plot. So far this anime seems to be the kind that ends up all falling together in the end so I believe (and am hoping for) a conclusion that will unveil a deeper meaning. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, that being said. If you are intersted in a show that has a bit of a danganropa (spelled it wrong and I know it, sorry) feel, a bit of some gore (but not anything too crazy), and a dash of puzzle and mystery this will prove to be an interesting watch!",

The Protagonist and her companion move through each floor with several complications that are solved in a far too mundane manner. \r\nAnd as a horror... this is very lacking. I should feel the thrill or fear (especially as someone who doesn't like to watch scary stuff #scaredycat) but build up and execution is a continual failure. \r\nArt - 7\r\nI do quite enjoy the character designs and the dark aesthetics meshed into this anime. \r\nSound - 5\r\nTo me, thereseems to be something lacking with the soundtrack and some of the voice actors execution of their creepy characters. As mentioned, the horror and thriller portion of this anime are lacking and part of this are the lack of fitting sounds. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nWe don't get much background on focus duo but I actually think that's just fine. It's obvious that little details will be revealed as the story progresses. This is a horror mystery and it makes sense that the characters remain a mystery. The unlikely duo is actually fun to watch despite the dark setting. They each need each other in order to get what they desire and that keeps them together. The characters stick tightly to their character which is perfect! I almost thought they were going to push for unneeded romance between the duo but it seems they've stuck with they've presented. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nI continue watching mainly because I've played games like the one this is based off before and that keeps me on the edge of my seat to see the hidden outcome by the end. \\n",

We\u2019re not shown who or why, so her emotional connect to us is gone, not like it was ever there in the first place.\r\nShe figures out shes not in the hospital and proceeds to look around finding writing on the wall and a paper to which she signs with no issues, let aloneconcern.
