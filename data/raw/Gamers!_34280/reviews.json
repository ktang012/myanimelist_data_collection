            "content": "Yeah ! Another adaptation of light novel about a rom-com focused on otaku high school students who like to play video games. It is true that we didn't have enough similar animes and studio Pine Jam was kind enough to realize it. A big thank-you.\r\nGamers! is your seasonal generic anime and my expectations weren't high but it is not even satisfying because it tries to be funny by repeating gags based on misunderstandings all along the anime till this concept is exhausted. \r\nWe have a series with a lambda protagonist named Keita Amano who loves to play video games. He will meet progressively people whoshare his passion (or not): the popular Karen Tendo (who is beautiful and likes to play video games), the ikemen Uehara (big lol) with his girlfriend Aguri (aka \"gal\") and Chiaki Hoshinomori, a secluded and shy girl who plays video games and who will often quarrel with Keita Amano because they will have slightly different tastes.\\n\\n\r\n (Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)\\n\\n\r\nAll that Keita Amano says and does makes me cringe. He does not agree with Karen Tendo because he thinks he must play by having fun and not being competitive. The idea does not even come to mind that he could do both as well. Have fun and be competitive and I'm sure a lot of people prefer to play in this way. If you play without interest to win or play correctly, then this means more a lack of self-confidence that you will voluntarily ignore. Gradually, talking with Tendo Karen (who mainly plays by being competitive), Keita Amano will review her judgment and incidentally fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Amano doesn't understand love relationships. He thinks that life happens as in visual novels and as a result he will train to understand girls through visual novels. But what an absurd idea! life and games have nothing to do (what Uehara will point out to him). I complain when I see this type of behavior because the anime portrays a negative image of the otaku gamer, assuming that he only lives in 2D and is unable to understand anything to real life. I understand that it is a comedy but surprisingly the anime tries to give a more serious tone in these moments.\\n\\n\r\n(By the way, let's also point out that Keita Amano buys at cost price his video games in shops and never on the Internet.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other male protagonist is Uehara. A high school student who has a lot of friends and a girlfriend called Aguri. He doesn't care so much about his girlfriend and often forgets her. He is more interested in Keita Amano (Is he gay?) because he saw that this unpopular guy was discussing with Karen Tendo and that the latter had a fit when Keita refused to register for the club. He tries to become a friend with Keita and helps him find a girlfriend who also plays video games. So he suggests that Keita talk to Chiaki. The latter proves to be (surprise ! surprise !) Keita's only friend because they have already met on a mobile game. But the two concerned don't know. Obviously Uehara, satisfied to hear this news (without the other two being aware) would like them to go out together.\\n\\n\r\nHe thinks that Keita and Chiaki can live as a couple because they both love video games. Sorry? It's completely stupid. Such a couple is completely improbable. It is not because you have a common passion that everything will go well for the rest of your life as a couple. This type of relationship is completely fragile and has no future.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the female characters, I appreciate them although they are not coherent. Aguri is a girl who goes out with Uehara but becomes jealous because she sees Uehara with Chiaki and suspects him of going out with Tendo as well. Karen Tendo is a very popular girl who wants Keita to join her video games club. Surprisingly, the anime seems to assume from the first episodes that gamers do not have many friends and often feel isolated as we can see with Keita and Chiaki but not with Tendo. I don't know if the passion of Tendo is secret but if it is the case, it is improbable since the club of video games seems quite visible and that some people are already in this club. Following Keita's refusal, Tendo gradually falls in love with Keita and follows him like a stalker. She will try to get closer and they will go out together. Why is she interested in Keita while receiving daily declarations of love from other boys? Do not ask me, it's a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's hard for me to describe the characters more, because their personality is inconsistent. It evolves according to the needs of the scenario. If Karen Tendo is to react as a tsundere at a specific time, she will. If Uehara is to behave like a fool by gesticulating stupidly, he will. If Aguri must be angry with her boyfriend (Uehara) because she has seen him with another girl, she will either do it or not. Only the scenario decides. The characters do not behave logically. The characters are deliberately stupid and this facilitates all the more the setting up of the misunderstandings in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus all misunderstandings are based on random reactions of the characters. They don't try to think much longer about their situation, their real relationship with their boyfriend or girlfriend. They only believe what they see and it's insane. If tomorrow I see my girlfriend walking with another man, I won't directly assume she's unfaithful, right? But it's different for Gamers' characters. Two or three coincidences are enough so that the character feels betrayed. At no time do the characters really decide to reason and go quietly to discuss with their partner to understand what is really going on. They try to get together to play a ridiculous board game that plays even more with their relationships but do nothing concrete to correct misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nThe relations between the characters aren't interesting and illogical too. For example, Aguri and Amano will initially ally to know if Uehara actually goes out with Chiaki because they accidentally saw them together once. And to complete the misunderstanding, Chiaki and Uehara think that Aguri and Amano love each other because they happened to see them together in the restaurant. Meanwhile, Amano and Uehara continue to see each other at school without asking a single question, while if at least one of them tries to approach the subject, misunderstandings could have been solved more quickly. So everything is good to continue the same insipid and repetitive comedy. Like manzai gags we can see in the shounen mangas.\\n\\n\r\n*Big spoiler*\\n\r\nLater, these misunderstandings will create a love triangle. Chiaki aka Mono (her username in the mobile game) hears that Keita is her best friend who has supported her creations from the beginning. Keita doesn't know the true identity of Mono. And because plot-convenience, Chiaki says that her little sister is Mono. (I wonder how she could convince her sister) But Keita doesn't notice the lie. Even if he is a little suspicious, he doesn't try to make the connection between Mono and Chiaki, not once. And so begins our dramatic romance with Chiaki who begins to regret seeing Keita go out with Tendo while she did everything to stop Keita from knowing her identity. She is shy but at one point I wonder why she decides not to reveal anything to Keita. Why suffer so much?\\n\r\nAs for the Aguri-Uehara couple, it is present only to increase the number of misunderstandings. There is no development in their unstable relationship but obviously no one wants to break despite the lack of trust between the two characters. I pity this poor Aguri frankly because her boyfriend seems to be totally disinterested in her. Actually I almost never saw this couple act like a couple.\\n\r\n*End big spoiler\\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems cheap. Anyway, I had low expectations of the studio Pine Jam, known for two other lamentable works: one with a magical girl for lolicons and the other with a high school girl who seduces a salaryman because boobs. Overall the faces are drawn roughly and the colors are close to what you can see using paint. The opening sounds like a disgusting mixture of generic J-pop with noisy seiyuu. Where are the great performances of excellent seiyuu like Nao Touyama or Rie Takahashi? I thought the Japanese were taking this profession more seriously than in the West but apparently the level is falling in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Gamers! didn't try to build romances, trying to give a more interesting place for video games. You can find some references on popular games, whether it is the games that the characters play or the comic scenes where the characters run or make choices such as a visual novel. It was entertaining, nothing exceptional either. Gamers! doesn't really deal with interesting themes such as the place of video games in society or the impact of video games on the characters' daily lives. A series like New Game! is more interesting at this level. I expected at least a series like Genshiken who shows us (comically, I admit) the routine of the otakus. Don't waste your time on this series and watch something that can actually satisfy you, for example Made in Abyss if you choose a seasonal show.",

            "content": "First review, but I felt like some of this needed to be said and I felt I've seen enough.\r\nThis does contain some spoilers, I suppose. \r\nGamers has a cool premise: modern gaming, where there's a school club for it and the leader is a popular and pretty blonde girl who tries to find other gamers and recruit them - but the main lead says no to joining!\r\nThe first few episodes seemed pretty decent and I was enjoying the show. After a few episodes, things got really frustrating. The show steered away from video games and gaming culture for the most part and turned into anextremely petty and frustrating love drama between the characters. They are all suspicious of each other liking someone else and instead of, y'know, just talking to each other and actually communicating, they have obscured POVs and do petty things to find out if their hunch is right, and, without actual proof, they draw conclusions over the dumbest and simplest things. I thought it would all stick to one, maybe two episodes, but it went on longer than it should have and is still going.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to give it a chance after a couple of bad episodes. I was really excited to watch it and thought it was really cute and enjoyable at first, but the plot just went completely downhill the last few episodes that it became unwatchable. I am only being this hard on it since it's a 12 episode anime. That's short, and if you have several bad episodes within that.. that really takes the quality down several notches. \\n\r\nInstead of the characters developing, it's as if it's the characters just became worse - and not in an interesting way either. They went from pretty cool, smart characters to all of them just making piss poor decisions and failing so hard at communicating that it was cringe-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that every plot has at least one conflict, but the kind of conflict they went with is very poor, annoying, and unfitting for what the show could/should have been about. There's so much they could have done with this show but instead of sticking to the show's actual theme, they chose to plop in a bunch of negative, unnecessary love drama.. with the odd video game reference here and there to remind you of the title, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be nice if the plot picked up again and became more about gaming again, but I couldn't stand to stick around. I understand one of the themes of this anime is romance as well, which is fine, but the fact that they made all the characters so painfully stupid and oblivious is extremely unrealistic - even for naive highschoolers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther than my disappointment for the plot (so far) and character development (or lack there-of/character decline), the music is decent. The opening is adorable, and the animation itself is decent.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the show does improve, I'll be happy, but its annoying fall-off in the middle (so far, anyway) is too frustrating to endure for me and seems to steer away from the original premise of what was making the show so charming.",

            "content": "Gamers. An anime that perfectly showed us how teens behave in real life. Games, the concept of love and the like are all things we go through in real life and Gamers excels in it's faithful representation of that. Simply put, it's *damn* relatable.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is less about Gamers and more about how teens live their daily life along with the everyday shenanigans involved. It as mentioned before was very relatable and was fun to watch. The plot moved on slowly and smoothly and I enjoyed the pace it went at as it didn't feel rushed at all. It didn't have any particular 'arcs'as most anime do as it felt kinda like a Slice of Life, which also added to the fun as the fun was standardised everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKadokawa. How much I love you and your brilliant assistance in helping studios with art. This  was headed by Pine Jam and I loved it. The characters were amazingly done and they looked beautiful. The emotions on the face when something was happy or shocked accentuated the humor and made it better. The backgrounds (something Pine Jam worked on before) were the best thing in the anime. Period. Sometimes I felt Pine Jam put more effort on the background than the main characters, and I don't mind, it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average. The characters were really believable but unfortunately Amano wasn't great... He wasn't too believable but the rest of the cast was excellent. Tendou, Chiaki, Aguri, Tasuku all were excellent. The OP wasn't that much at first but later on surprisingly it grew on me and I started loving it. Meanwhile the first ED was really forgettable but the second ED made up for it. The second ED was really good and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. Enough said. The characters were amazing. Each and every character had something great in them and I was happy-surprised that 5 main characters each got equal attention, a feat which very very few anime with multiple MCs accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nAmano: Though his voice was not what you call the best, his character was great. The way he was confused in simple moments was appealing to most introverts. And it was really hilarious to watch him and everyone for that matter how they dealt with situations without directly sorting it out. \\n\\n\r\nTendou: Our Resident Tsundere, She was literally the best girl. The way she behaved throughout the anime was cute and fun to watch at the same time. Though her reason for falling in love with Amano wasn't the best reason out there (if there was any) but it was washed out with her other acts in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki: A character I disliked at first, Chiaki is the 100% introvert which puts her at the top of the relatable chart for Gamers. She was shy and awkward to deal with her problems and once again she was fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAguri: Best girl? Well, she is best girl material. She was jumpy, hyperactive and plain stupid at times and it was hilarious to see her reactions. I loved the time she was with Amano but obviously she was Tasuku's girlfriend so I didn't whine about so much. Her personality was well thought out and was also one of the best in anime, not fanboying.\\n\\n\r\nTasuku: A very thoughtful and generous person at heart, Tasuku is your dream husbando. He wanted everyone to get along together happy and though his methods like every other characters' wasn't the best, it was still nice to see him try to make everyone good friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching Gamers. And it was really fun to see how everything turned out to be with every episode. It was lovely seeing the flustered, hilarious, shocked and all other reactions of the characters. The fun, plain stupid acts of all the characters were something I really enjoyed. I enjoyed the Romance and the Comedy in Gamers (which was the reason I wanted to see the anime, and was fulfilled 100%). This was literally one of my favorite animes of this year in terms of Comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6\\n\\n\r\nOverall Games is the prefect blend of Comedy, Romance and relatability. It has some of the best characters in 2017 and is absolutely fun to watch. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to see a fun RomCom, or just wants to enjoy watching an anime where the characters resonate with you. Simply put, one of the best RomComs out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Tendou is best girl <3 although Aguri is at a close second <3",

            "content": "Gamers is honestly a show that made me scratch my head more than I realized. As a gamer myself, this anime really feels relatable at heart on occasions because of its concepts. However, what really follows is a rough adaptation that translated into a questionable story. It ended up being an anime that I can\u2019t fully say it\u2019s appreciable for what it had to offer. And that\u2019s too bad really.\r\nBased on the light novel of the same name, Gamers stood out as an anime at first for me just by its title and it seemed like a show that I felt comfortable with. However, whatthis series actually presents is far more just about gamers gathering together to play games. It became a show with romance themes, misunderstandings, and drama shenanigans that really took relationships to a strange level. On paper, the show\u2019s premise sounds pretty simple as main male protagonist Keita Amano is invited by the prettiest girl of the school Karen, to join her video game club. What follows is a string of misunderstandings that ended up being messy.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the obvious elephant in the room out of the way. Gamers is not recommendable if you have an obvious dislike for rom-com. From the very start, it\u2019s pretty straightforward as the anime jumps right into the main picture with the characters and their roles. Karen is a character that I found to be easy to accept as she is friendly and simple to get along with. What might rub people in the wrong way is her obsession with video games and more so, her obsession with Amano. The anime makes it clear that she likes Amano and extends beyond just the idea of video games. For Amano himself, it seems he has a mutual attraction towards Karen although has a hard time to confess the truth. Unlike Karen, he\u2019s also more timid and unpopular at school. Drama follows the both of them as ship teases begins to develop between various characters. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond Amano and Karen, we also got Aguri and Tasuku, a couple with very sociable personalities. They bring in the comedic drama as misunderstandings are often created by plot circumstances and their own personal delusions. Individually, Aguri is also quite an energetic character with a friendly personality. Similarly, Tasuku finds himself easy to make friends with others and very outgoing. Both of their live are intersected with Karen and Amano as the story picks up and they get involved in drama and the misunderstandings. For me, this shows draws and sells its humor through the misunderstandings. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say the anime\u2019s plot work overall from this formula. It\u2019s very formulaic and predictable as almost every episode feels the same. You may think there are developments between the main characters but in reality, the anime doesn\u2019t do a clever job at progressing the plot. While I appreciate how the anime tries to sell its comedy with character pairings, it\u2019s really no different in the end with plot resolutions. Beyond the humor, there is some actual drama if you count Chiaki\u2019s role in the show. The character chemistry between her and Amano occasionally has more emotions although is still often downplayed quickly because of how lighthearted this anime is. Surprisingly, I found her sister to be more likable as she seems like a fun person to hang out with and talk to. The sibling relationship Hoshinomori is surprisingly realistic as the two can be easily relatable by their roles in this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of video games, you\u2019ll notice a lot of references. These range from console games, PC gaming, dating sims, and even arcade games. Thanks to these ideas, I think some people may find this anime likable even with the lackluster plot. The idea of gaming is explored with social norms and relatable with the main characters. However, do realize that the anime is very lighthearted and doesn\u2019t really take a serious approach at exploring the cultural ideas of gaming. It\u2019s more of an anime that deals with comedic relationship pairings in order to draw out a casual audience. The lack of background storytelling (with exception of Tasuku and Aguri) also holds this anime back at times. To me, Gamers is an anime that\u2019s easy to accept but hard to embrace.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Pine Jam, this anime originally had my worries due to its lack of promotions. More importantly, their previous project was pretty unnoticeable for its technical quality. However, my worries quickly died down after seeing the first few episodes. It\u2019s not at a level that will make your jaws drop but definitely consistent for a light novel adaptation. What really draws the audience into the technical quality is perhaps the character expressions. The biggest sell of this show is the humor so it\u2019s important to capture those expressions. Thankfully, I found myself laughing on occasions when characters react as result of misunderstandings, drama, and other shenanigans. The character designs themselves are also appealing enough to make them stand out; except with the case of Amano as he looks like a generic Average Joe. Unfortunately, this anime doesn\u2019t escape the fan service pit so expect some episodes to have it with suggestive camera angles and swimsuits.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lighthearted anime like Gamers, the theme songs aren\u2019t particular noticeable until you realize their style. While it\u2019s not truly avant-garde, it does take an approach that will make the audience talk about especially with its catchy OP song. The gaming references extends to its soundtrack elements as it sometimes uses a similar style for its OST. Still, character voice mannerism is rather moderate as none of them really stand out. Aguri\u2019s accent also took me some time to get used to as she sounds like a kid at times. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Gamers? Honestly, it really depends but the anime felt more like a big ship tease rather than an appealing show of sharp writing. The comedy is the main selling factor so if humor is your cup of tea, then this anime will be one that you\u2019ll remember that by. As for the storytelling? It really doesn\u2019t do any favors when the show is like a loop that doesn\u2019t progress the main plot altogether. The anime itself is also an incomplete adaptation as the novels are ongoing. So in essence, it\u2019s rather open ended. For gamers and anime fans, this show is fun to watch when you\u2019re bored and need time to pass by. But for what it really delivered, it\u2019s an anime that I found face palming myself more than laughing.\\n",

            "content": "What is the meaning of gamer? If we go to our favorite culture dictionary, we will consider a gamer someone that plays video-games. Is it the main topic of this anime? Sadly, it isn't. The video-game idea is irrelevant here unless that we associate the game concept with a relationship. In that case, we can say that the plot of this anime is a relationship game and a \"gamer\" interprets, acts, and plays on that relationship game. The goal of the game could be ending with someone, maybe love, etc. \r\nI can give several convenient titles for this anime, \"Misunderstandings,\" \"The mess,\" \"Mistakes,\" \"Misconceptions.\" Allthese titles point to the same problems in a relationship and how messy a relationship can be. It would be wrong waiting to see a full-time anime about \"video-games,\" tournaments, and more video-games. If you just watch this anime for that reason, you will receive a big blow on your face, you will lose all your health points, and you will end very disappointed with a big question \u00bfAnd the games?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nRelationships are complicated and love ones are even worse. How many times have we seen an anime about them? If you answer just this one, I will call you Pinocchio. This anime created some relationships from a simple topic the \"video-games.\" The characters have something in common, video-games or persons that played them. These characters will try harder to find more about other players because they have THAT something in common (games). That's the main story of this anime. Keita the typical gaming freak meets another gaming freak called Karen. Call it destiny, clich\u00e9, lack of argument she felt something for Keita. For me, both them are the first gamers. The goal is that they end together. During this adventure, other \"gamers\" joined this messy match and added chaos with some alternative endings. For example, Keita should end with Chiaki, etc. All this mess is titled \"Gamers!\" an amusing comedy with funny moments and some frustrating events but enjoyable at the end. \\n\\n\r\nI know, Gamers' story isn't that amazing. After the half of the series, we can consider it average and repetitive. Also, several persons expressed unsatisfaction of the same misunderstanding recycling and how it only gets worse. From my perspective, that is the main argument of the series if you remove this \"mess\" we will end with an empty casket that would talk about video-games, a gaming club but won't be an enjoyable comedy. Besides, no matter if the argument is repetitive we can associate it to the insecurity found in every relationship.  They are average students without any relationship experience, they will make several mistakes and will tend to overthink everything. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nWe have five main characters. They share the ability to mistake relationships from bad judgment. They don't have any love experience. They will overlook every decision for that reason all ends in chaos. \\n\\n\r\nKeita Amano, the conventional freak. We can see him as a zero at the left. None notice about him and he lives in a gaming world. Insecure, shy, but cares for his new friends. \\n\\n\r\nTendou Karen, the freakish idol. She is a beautiful face, desired student, popular, and with a hidden gaming addiction. From a relationship perspective, she is very insecure and timid.  \\n\\n\r\nChiaki Hoshinomori, the last freak. We can consider her a secondary freak. She is similar to Keita, they like the same and do the same, but they have several differences when they talk about games. She also is the last acting.\\n\\n\r\nTasuku Uehara, the ex-freak. A reformed \"Keita.\" He was like Keita but changed and became popular. He wants to help Keita, but he overthinks everything and ends creating a bigger mess. \\n\\n\r\nAguri, the insecure lover or better the ex-freak lover. She has a particular personality, but she is very uncertain of her relationship and sees a cheating ghost every time. Even if she doesn't like games, she enjoys being around gamers.  \\n\\n\r\nAll these characters have a twisted insecurity that keeps adding gasoline to the fire but thanks to that we can see some hilarious moments. Sometimes we want to hit the screen with our head but overall the moments are good. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't that amazing, and there are some angles where we can see some ugly spots or weird faces. In general, the art is acceptable. They focus on the characters, their faces, and details to create an impact on the expressions depending on the situation. The palette is the same most of the time as the lighting model, so they used a bright light with a pastel combined palette. In general, the art is acceptable for a comedy.     \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 \\n\r\nThe sound mix helps on the situations and adds tension when needed but also focus on the awkward moments, so it helps with the plot and levels the climax. The OP and ED are good, I loved more the ED, but both are very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nNo matter if the problems are repetitive the show offers several hilarious scenes. The insecurity of this group is presented to the audience with a combination between mess and comedy. This concept works well with the storytelling, a good pacing, and produces a twisted love comedy that we will enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nFinally, I want to apologize. I overused the word \"GAME\" maybe you are exhausted from it, but I am sure this simple messy story will bring a smile on your face. It isn't the best comedy out there, but it is acceptable. The characters have their moments, and their insecurity is used to create some epic events. I am sure that you will enjoy some of them. Give it a try.  \\n",

They're both basically about the same thing (slice of life in a video game club) but their execution is way different.\r\nThis anime basically completes netoge in some areas and it seems to explore the social aspect of video game geeks. At the same time, it seems to be a manifesto forplaying games the fun way. Nowadays, with the popularization of eSports a lot of people have started to play games in a competitive manner that, in my and apparently this anime's opinion, spoils the fun.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for good romcoms that don't have a linear, boring  boy-meets-girl-they-fall-in-love-funny-stuff-happens, and this seems to hit the right spot. It's kinda underrated in my opinion, but it can be argued that this anime formula is already overused. Still, I believe it's worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nDEFINITELY give this a try.",

If you answered yes, then there is no need for you to watch this show. It's your generic story of a loser, socially awkward MC that gets attention from the hottest girls in his school for no apparent reason. The relationship webs between characters are poorly done and only arise because the characters are too stupid to make logical decisions when it comes to their relationships. Ultimately, it failsin making the connection between these realistic, therefore defeating one of the main purposes of a rom-com.... the romance. \\n\\n\r\nOh and about the comedy, it's awful. The only time I laughed while watching this show was at myself after a joke I made about one of the characters playing a what was essentially CS:GO. The comedic timing is way off and characters have no gimmicks to play off of one another.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nThink anime. Think anime protagonist. Now you know what our main character looks like. Character designs are bland, boring and just plain bad. However the animation itself is good and the intro has great animation featuring the main characters as if they were inside various types of games.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nNothing special, background music fits the tone of situations well and the intro and ending are decent. Nothing much more to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nThis is where the show is most insulting. Not only are the characters generic, underdeveloped, having no rhyme or reason as to why they like the other characters, but the misrepresentation of gamers is what really ruins the charters. You will not find a single gamer in this world that is anything like most of the main cast. They are gamers for the sake of the plot and are given no reason as to why they started playing video games in the first place, which could have given a nice conflict in ideologies which the show tried to do... yet failed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere's not much to like at all about this show, if you have seen one rom-com anime, you've seen Gamers!. Do not bother watching, I've done the dirty work for you in order to write this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\n---DO NOT WATCH---\\n\r\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\\n",

            "content": "The center of videogame stories are almost often gaming prowess of some schmuck who can go hayaku. But there is another important aspect that is not usually touched on: how videogames affects our day to day interactions and how it opens up a whole new way of forming bonds. There's a reason why MMO players say \"Came for the game, stayed for the community.\" It's a beautiful sentiment that captures the often unheralded but nonetheless important aspect of gaming in today's society.\r\nI'm happy to say that Gamers understands that aspect and struggles to make it the core of the series. While the characters right nowmay feel like it'll just fill the check-boxes of typical high school stock models, this series can get by with simplistic characterizations because its potential lies in the character interactions more than anything. This is a celebration of gaming as a community after all.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, however, Gamers is an anime you wouldn't feel bad missing out on. It has shown lopsided execution with a penchant for slapstick humor that can grow old easily, especially if its not your type of humor. The artstyle is less-detailed which enables more fluid animation but it's largely centered around the aforementioned slapstick comedy and the OST is nothing standout.\\n\\n\r\nBut the anime is not without potential, despite its abysmal first episode which I feel I must warn you about. How it goes about fulfilling that makes or breaks the series.\\n\\n\r\nHappy TI7 everyone.\\n\\n\r\nTNC! Tangerine Chicken for the win!",

            "content": "\"Missunderstandings\" everywhere. You could basically sum up the whole show with these two words. To cut to the chase, the characters are really bad and 1-dimensional. This was one of many griping issues that was bugging me while watching this show; the characters are all dumb/intentionally idiotic (and I don\u2019t mean this lightly), and the cast consists of your run-of-the-mill cliche character tropes you\u2019ll find in any romcom anime. You\u2019ll have your \"wimpy loser MC\u201d who is voiced by your average female shounen VA, the \"prettiest girl in class that has a crush on the wimpy MC\u201d cause for SOME REASON wimps are chick magnets,the \"annoying girl with the annoying voice\" (you\u2019ll know which one), the \"dude that is really popular but likes to hangout with loser MC\", and the list goes on. \\n\\n\r\nTo add on top of the lame cast, the show never seems to go anywhere. The only thing that seems to be driving the plot forward would be the \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d that would occur between two of the characters. This misunderstand could be anything: Character A was caught being close to Character B, Character B shares a drink with Character C and Character A sees this and is surprised that B and C are close (even though in reality it was mutual and not in a way of showing lovely emotions towards each other), Character C thinks Character A hate them thus undergoes depression, THE LOST GOES ON AND IT\u2019S ANNOYING! The whole foundation of the plot in Gamers are the misunderstandings that happen in the show, it\u2019s the only thing moving the plot. Forget good writing, forget good drama, forget good comedy, they were basically grabbing shit outta there asses and hoping anything could help move the plot forward. What a joke. \\n\\n\r\nRant out of the way, I'd like to say a few things: I don't have a clue as to why I stuck with this show for 5 tremendously bad episodes and I guess I was really hoping I'd actually get something good outta this show. Instead of romance and comedy, I got stale jokes and bad writing. Basically unoriginal cliche romcom horse arse. To be honest, the thing that drove me to stop watching this show the most was the characters. The characters were so bad it got unbearable; I was at a point in the show that I didn\u2019t care about the plot anymore and was just focusing on how utterly terrible the characters were. It was just so...BAD! Words can\u2019t describe how miserable each episode was, watching as the characters go on their daily lives of looping through the same problems over and over again and never learning. The characters have peas for brains! As for the art, it was mediocre AT BEST but wasn't too bad. I\u2019d expect better quality though, the colors and designs of the setting and characters were bland and boring to look at. The Sound wasn't too bad either but not noticably great, though I did kinda enjoy the OP. The OP was catchy and I enjoyed the references to other games (such as PUBG, Super Smash Bros, and Undertale). Besides all of that though, this show could be summed up as a terrible mess or the crap I take after eating the local Chipotle burrito. I don't recommend this show to anyone who wants REAL romance with an ACTUAL plot, but if you like romcom cliches then go ahead and watch.",

But dont insult his friends or else he will bite at you.\\n\r\nSadly his low self esteem makes see himself unworthy makes him always jump to conclusions and exagerates the pesimistic view in his mind.\\n\\n\r\nSecond we have Tendou Karen:\\n\r\nA princess type girl who is the madonna of school. She is into competition gaming to gain prestige and fame. She rebuilt the gaming club for such actions as the previous club members won many trophies so she dont want to ket them down. Also the principal let her have the club with the condition to gain prestige. She also dislike casual games and sees them as trash since you cannot win competitions with them. (Reason why i began to dislike her, i took offense to that). Fell in love with Amano after she hears him defend her and her club in a valiant way. Since then she sees amano as a prince and tries to recruit him for her club to be with him but ended as his girlfriend by a misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThird is Uehara Tasuku:\\n\r\nAn ex game otaku now turn into ikemen. Became friends with Amano by a misunderstanding as he saw the kid had gust in the end when provoked. He has the chuuni habit of talking to himself in a superior sense as if all of them would be lost without him. He also decided to be Amano's wingman for the girls that were interested in Amano making himself wall in a riot of misunderstandings because of it, but he is not far into jumping to conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nFourth is Aguri:\\n\r\nA nerdy girl turned-bubbly-bishoujo who had a crush on Uehara since middle school. After she saw him change she changed herself to fit his liking and ended dating. But also fell into a riot of misunderstandings as she also jumped to conclusions after she saw Tasuku interact with other girls (when he was working as Amano's wingman). She ended up becoming good friends with Amano because of, as Amano tries to help her save her relationship.\\n\\n\r\nFifth comes Chiaki:\\n\r\nAnother gamer girl who is the female synonim of Amano Keita. Chiaki met Amano when he came to her class after Uehara tried to hook them up. Everything started well, both of them likes same things, same games and get along... Until they discovered they have different opinions about certain games then the bickering began. Since then Chiaki and Amano act like a bickering married couple which made Uehara wonder why dont they just hook up. In the end it turns out that Chiaki is in fact Amano's admired doujin game maker and his best game partner Nobe and Mono.\\n\\n\r\nSixth is Konoha:\\n\r\nChiaki's little sister who was dragged into the mess thanks to Chiaki herself. She and Amano hits it off and become good friends since they both love visual novels, but deep inside Konoha is a pervert who wants to bang bishoujo (cute girls) making her a bit of a lesbian or at least bisexual. Her preference is erogaming which she tries to keep it a secret to hide her lewd persona. She also becomes Chiaki's wingman (or wingwoman) as she tries to hook both Chiaki and Amano up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the whole deal.\\n\r\n\"Gamers!\" Is about teenagers getting involved in misunderstandings to add drama to their youth. Which makes the beauty of the series.",

            "content": "misunderstandings and really awkward, awfully written characters! nice bait and switch with the gaming theme btw. i really appreciate how this turned into yet another terrible, cliche-ridden, flavorless romcom after like 3 episodes and completely threw away the idea of actually being about games at all. it's so ridiculously convoluted and over the top with the constant misunderstandings (that would instantly be solved by any single character actually acting like a human being) that it's actually somewhat memorable/noteworthy. noteworthy for being shitty, but still.\r\nbut seriously, why is this show called \"Gamers!\"? the show has almost nothing to do with games at this point, and asa \"\"\"\"gamer\"\"\"\", i can't say that any of the characters are particularly relatable. probably because they all have a deadly combination of fetal alcohol syndrome + terminal aspergers and i don't. that and i also didn't have 3 obvious girlfriend candidates and a wide social circle in high school. i also actually played videogames, rather than spending every day poorly handling relationship issues, huffing paint, and making unfunny, forced game references. wow, a character got upset and randomly blurted out the konami code! hilarious! this is the pinnacle of comedy! what's next, a character becoming so happy that they can't help but shout \"THE CAKE IS A LIE!\"?\\n\\n\r\nany time they do actually talk about games, it makes me cringe so hard i feel like i'm going to implode. they're playing the mario kart arcade game and MC gets an item that apparently has a 50% chance of blowing up everyone around him and a 50% chance of blowing himself up. after this is explained to him, the blonde girl says \"it's really hard to use on this map!\" .....what? why would the map have even the tiniest bearing on how difficult it is to use? ?????????????????? nice show. totally wasn't written by a 40 year old that only plays a mobage once a week.\\n\\n\r\ni feel like people get so caught up in praising this show for the MC not immediately accepting the club invite (so unique!!!!) that they're able pretend like the show didn't immediately turn into a cliche factory afterward. i turned my brain off as soon as i saw bridge scene in episode 2 or 3 where MC is vehemently defending a girl he has talked to for all of 5 minutes with a \"YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT DON'T TALK BAD ABOUT HER!\" and nearly kills the guy with his retard strength. of course, the girl is secretly watching this exchange and falls madly in love with MC as a result. really breaking new ground here.\\n\\n\r\nin conclusion, this show is basically just Netoge no Yome season 2 but with less games and more glue consumption. only watch it if you love misunderstandings and hate anything resembling actual human interaction.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nI'll admit I was hooked in for the first few episodes of the series, they were very appealing and interesting for me as an avid gaming fan. But it all fell apart midway.\r\nI went into the show completely blind not knowing what to expect, and the first episode was great. It had very nice gaming culture references from CSGO and even Guilty Gear! It made the MC, Keita, a very relatable character that just wants to plays game for fun instead of playing it competitively like the gaming club does.\r\nThe second episode was wonderful as well, especially with its wonderfully animated introductionsequence and the nest full of gaming culture references in it. This episode focused more on Uehara's character and his transition from being a loner gamer nerd to a typical cool and handsome stud. There is one part where Uehara and Keita are in the arcade and playing Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game, where Uehara basically is able to read Keita's movements and basically body him due to his 'noob' tells/tendencies in the game. That part was the hook, line and sinker for me in this anime and I was even more excited in watching the third episode for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I had thought that the plot would be focusing on Uehara and Keita's journey in the gaming club, but this was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 3 and 4 rolled along, and now I had this bad premonition that this anime was actually not what I thought it was.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 5 and 6 came out and I just felt crushed. It was at this point where I realised that they would be focusing on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters and that just completely turned off this anime for me. The selling point of the anime for me, about how it was gaming, was now almost completely gone and I had just lost interest in continuing to watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been such an interesting concept for an anime, focusing on the inner workings of competitive gaming and gamers. It had untapped potential and they just threw it all away in favour of an overly clich\u00e9d misunderstanding-riddled romcom.\\n\\n\r\nAnd god, the characters. The character development between the main characters was just completely thrown into the garbage, it felt like the characters' personalities from the first few episode had completely flipped and they were now all completely naive and oblivious.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who would like this type of anime, but this just isn't my cup of tea, I just didn't like how they just suddenly steered away from gaming almost completely and instead focused solely on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, the artstyle of the anime is decent, nothing flashy but still okay, and I do love the music as well as the wonderful opening of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very disappointing to see how this anime turned out, it could have been one of my favourite animes of this year. It feels that the title of the series 'Gamers!' was just stuck there just to draw in gamers into watching this anime, and it definitely did, I just wished they at least would have tried to made the focal point of the series to be gaming instead.",

The show is more a Slice of life Romcom about teenagers where the story just focuses on their lives at High school and their interactions with one other which may disappoint some viewers due to its Soap Opera-ish vibe. (If you are looking for something similar but with more gaming involved, check out \u2018Netoge No Yome Wa Onnanoko Ja Nai To Omotta?\u2019) I too was upset upon learning this, but the anime brilliantly defends itself by delivering spontaneously strong, albeitsometimes cliched Comedy! By not resorting to a Harem anime like everybody else, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have 2 main guys rather than 1 and all girls. The 1st episode itself foreshadows uniqueness as the show deliberately sets up a Generic Romcom setting where the MC is invited to a Gaming club by a beautiful girl and the other characters presented clearly looked like the shows main cast. Only to swerve all of us towards the end by having the MC be like \u2018Nah, this isn\u2019t for me\u2019! Realizing the show had the balls to create a \u2018fake cast\u2019 of characters just for 1 Joke meant I was in store for something Awesome! And I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Another thing I liked was the shows effort of making fun of the Harem genre itself. We actually have a character who calls upon this in one episode! The same character even plots to force a Harem on one of the MC\u2019s which ended up rebounding horribly! \u2018Gamers\u2019 uses an old exaggeration of an over the top love triangles which gets everyone confused and misinformed, thus resulting into utter chaos! (The show bravely points it out to us from time to time) You have things like characters hearing only the worst parts of a conversations to someone suppressing important info just to protect another character\u2019s public image which may look frustrating, but it was fantastically executed!\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are genuinely interesting by managing to stand out via their personalities. We have our simple looking Amano, who\u2019s very bad when it comes to judgements due to his uncertainties. Nevertheless, he\u2019s a good MC since he\u2019s peculiarly zealous about certain type of games and will fight \u2018\u2019verbally\u2019\u2019 tooth and nails to defend his point despite sucking at playing games! He manages to come across very kind to others and it\u2019s his infectious passion for games that resulted into Tendou falling head over heels for him! Tendou herself is a big gaming fan (in secret) so others simply can\u2019t understand her infatuation for Amano which results into Tendou losing her \u2018Highschool Dream Girl\u2019 image. (Being REJECTED by a Nobody really hurt her image at school!) Even though she doesn\u2019t do much later, her depiction of a major crush was humourlessly presented to us which never got tiring. After all this is how a person with a real crush acts! The person goes through unstable amount of emotions without ever expressing it out loud. Uehara is another character who comes off looking cool but isn\u2019t as smart as he thinks! Often a prey to his own schemes due to bad decisions, results in being the root for the whole group problems! Aguri bonds nicely with Amano and she\u2019s all cute and innocent while Chiaki turns out to be even a bigger Gaming nerd than the MC himself! I liked how her story went along with the main arc and whenever she said \u2018Desu Desu\u2019. These 5 characters provide us with the bulk of relatable Comedy in a hilarious and ridiculous manner that will have you LOLing pretty hard! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty basic, though colourful and the character designs are by the numbers. Both the OP and ED were a stand out with very catchy music and bright visuals which is appreciated with great Voice Acting from the cast for both Subs and Dubs. The opening video boasts wonderful ingenuity by showcasing countless parodies of video games like Mario and Street Fighter and the work done on facial expressions were superb!  \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I found the anime funny and entertaining. Episode 5, now remembered as \u2018The Mother of All Misunderstandings!\u2019 was hands down the best episode the anime has to offer as it managed to deliver a perfect storm of emotions ranging from Jealousy, Love, Envy, Confusion, Shock, etc in a Comedic fashion! (I loved how the MC was totally oblivious to all it!) This reminds me of a movie called \u2018Crazy, Stupid, Love\u2019 which pulled of a similar scene of misinterpretations by Comedic means. But exactly like the movie, this brilliant plot unravelled too quickly as the anime failed to entertain us on this level again! The anime tries to repeat itself with the follow up of a Board game, but it just didn\u2019t have the same kick to it! And add in the pretty Meh ending, hurts your final thoughts about the show. Still the characters had their own side plots which were nicely demonstrated though the interactions between them remained the highlight of this anime. Certainly, recommend it to everyone as it\u2019s one of the good anime of this year!",

            "content": "Gamers! is one of the few anime I've watched where I gradually kept disliking it as it kept on progressing. I try to keep all airing anime up to date so that I can give reviews on them, and this is an anime I kept thinking \"great, its Thursday and another episode of this is out\".\r\nHonestly, the first few episodes of Gamers! were halfway decent, with many new characters being shown and a story line progressing all along with many people having personalities that were somewhat memorable.\r\nIt's animation is quite good and with the exception of the annoying cliche apologies the dialogue is good. Whattruly made me love the opening was of the many games that a large population of the world can recognize, for me it was the reference of Smash Bros and Player-Unknown's Battlegrounds.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after the first few episodes the show really starts to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, what really dropped my approval rating was what the show ended up being. This isn't about people and their different views on video games, which is by episode 2 what I was expecting. This is a shitty romance anime of people that enjoy video games.\\n\\n\r\nA whole lot of the episodes are spent attempting to have the main character join the game-club, which not only never happens, but seems to be fully forgotten. It's almost as if the episode shouldn't be there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent, however cliche each of them are. None of them are memorable whatsoever but Aguri is slightly distinct. The anime's main love interest is the typical \"good at everything but somehow secretly a part of an unpopular group\" and the main character is generic and boring, with nothing special except for his laid back gaming personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws of this anime are how unenjoyable and boring the anime becomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime turns into dialogue heavy excerpts of more than likely two people having a conversation about one of the five main characters and how they seem to be cheating on each other, with another one of the main characters.\\n\r\nI don't understand why this topic was prolonged so heavily, I've watched 9 episodes and in every single episode an issue occurs from a misunderstanding that one of the five people obviously know but are reluctant to tell each other. It's not the fact of what's going on being the problem, but how goddamn oblivious each and every one of them are about what their actions are.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes aren't memorable whatsoever and neither is the anime, many other animes have done a much better job of assumptions causing issues. The romance is not good at all, and so is its presentation of the romance.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was forced to describe the anime in a few words it would be: Bland, Boring, and Disappointing.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I almost dropped this anime from episode 1 because I got influenced by some reviews saying its 'clich\u00e9'. Note to self: Never read mal reviews before judging a show by myself ever again.\r\nJust know that clich\u00e9s do not automatically make a show bad. A very great example of a clich\u00e9s done right is Konosuba, which utilises the isekai trope to create a wonderful and humorous parody of the actual genre, and in my opinion, another great example is Gamers!. This turned out to be one of the most impressionable romcoms for me.\r\nThe reason I almost dropped this show was because I was overly judgementalon its first episode. Admittedly, the following  clich\u00e9s were a bit of a turn off at the beginning: \"high school game club\" and  \"otaku-pandering main protaganist\". Basically the premise of episode 1 at first felt kind of uninteresting and even unrealistic. \\n\r\nI decided to give this anime another chance after months because I saw that it had potential. After re-evaluating the character motives and  making the effort to actually think deeper into the actions of the characters, it made so much more sense. It's evident from episode 1 that the character motives in the entirety of the show can be sometimes hard to grasp and character's actions can often feel unreasonable or confusing (as expected of every drama show tho).  However they really are quite meaningful when given a second thought. The premise starts getting way more entertaining after episode 2 with the slight twist. What\u2019s hilarious is that the much hated \u2018game club\u2019 clich\u00e9 was actually almost never mentioned again in the show, despite spending 1 episode introducing it. It just shows how self-aware the humour is, by first baiting the audience into thinking \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those shows\u2026 .-.\u201d then surprising them and making fun of it. (tl;dr: so if you're planning to get into this show, be prepared for a little bit of confusion. if u want to understand every character fully, give everything some thought and it's actually quite meaningful)\\n\\n\r\nThe main appeal of this show is that it handles the relationship drama part of it really well. Its humour stems from how self-aware the show is to the many supposed clich\u00e9s, making fun of it and deriving humour from that. (I kind of see elements of Konosuba\u2019s humour in this show.) It also does the whole \u2018misunderstandings\u2019 thing better than most other shows by making light-hearted fun of it. I find it so funny because it makes fun of exactly what I LOATHE about many drama shows and actually making it work well.\\n\r\nSee, misunderstandings in anime, especially in romance dramas, were something that I always hated to the core. It always annoyed me to no end when shows used 'misunderstandings' as a main driving point of its plot as an excuses to either lengthen itself or to drive its melodrama. Shows like the second season of Kimi ni Todoke has fueled my hate for this because it JUST isn't realistic, the character's constant beating around the bush and not noticing the most obvious things just annoys me at how un-humanlike the characters become because of it. The problem is that most of the time, their misunderstandings can all be fixed if the characters just calm the fuck down, sit down and talk it out... Shows like that just feel very unnecessarily dragged out, insincere and boring. Drilling the frankly petty misunderstandings into our heads and making it the main point of the show be the drama that comes from them honestly makes it emotionally exhausting to watch.\\n\r\nOf course, I have seen a small few anime that actually effectively used misunderstandings, but that\u2019s hard to pull off, because you have to make the effort to make the misunderstandings feel genuinely realistic or relatable for the show to be actually be likable. (One example is Tsuki ga Kirei, I could get into why in another review)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when misunderstandings are used as a meta plot device to not only get great humour out of it, but also as a way to bond and develop characters, that\u2019s good shit. Gamers! does it so well. Notice how really it doesn\u2019t get sad and edgy all because of some stupid misunderstanding but it not only gets funnier, characters also know each other better and develop through those experiences.\\n\\n\r\nHere are some other small examples of self-aware humour that I laughed way too hard at, which made fun of things other anime did badly:\\n\r\n1. Having Uehara as the intelligent, NOT dense character that actually knows what\u2019s going on. The fact that he judges situations and can read people\u2019s expressions (like a normal person would) is just hilarious. Viewers can really relate to him as he actually reads into things instead of being any other dense character that does not give anything a second thought.\\n\r\n2. The fact that Uehara and Keita consciously calls everyone into meetups to clear misunderstandings LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN WOULD DO. It\u2019s so rewarding to see anime characters use common sense instead of beating around the bush.\\n\r\n3. Small things like the clich\u00e9-looking student council members of the other school or other blatant references to different clich\u00e9s like Misumi Eiichi's little section on the last episode. XD\\n\r\n4.  How the game club which was 'supposed' to be the main focus of the show completely became irrelevant later in the show.\\n\r\n5. The extremely amusing and exaggerated misunderstandings that thankfully were not unnecessarily over-complicated and edgy.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give this show a strong 8.5/10\\n\r\nThis show is great and it has some silly and lovable characters that unexpectedly develops through light-hearted drama and misunderstandings. The ending was an emotional pay-off and was greatly satisfying. Instead of being sad and edgy and unrealistic, it resolves all the romance and drama like a man, and in heartwarming and gratifying ways! You know a show is great when you actually like and care about every one of its characters. I have not even mentioned the \"Gamer\" part of this show, which I absolutely loved and related to. References everywhere, and it even teaches some really meaningful values for gamers at episode 4. Gaming is a huge theme (no shit) in Gamers! and fits into the contexts of the plot and characters so well: characters are bonded by and understands each other through the common interest of games. Maaaybe a little otaku-pandering but still relatable to most people. Yes there are some flaws that I won't mention here, but overall it's an extremely sweet and enjoyable show that can NEVER DESERVE THE \u201c4\u201d RATING. HMPH >.<\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll edit in more to this review when I can remember more necessary things to add. Right now I\u2019m too tired to remember everything I wanted to say. This was basically a drunken rant at 3 am after getting slightly triggered by the bad ratings in mal and wanting to do this anime some good. Knowing the fact that I almost dropped this show and that more people like me will because of mal reviews, I wanted to do this anime some justice. This definitely deserves more praise imo!",

If you checked off more than one of the options I listed, I got the show just for you! It's \"Gamers!\" The show where all of your characters are nothing more than a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to connect with each other.\r\nYou can't help but cover your eyes hoping it doesn't get any cringier. Seeing this makes me want to bawl my eyes out as the characters fail to interact with each other like regular human beings. It's a mixtureof cringe, frustration, and stupid fun rolled into one. First and foremost, I'd like to say, the show is a comedy. Personally, if a show has made me laugh countless times, I'd say it did its job correctly. I'm sure it is also safe to say that the show is one giant ball of confusion. At a certain point, you would hope that the confusions would be solved A.S.A.P. right and everything would be fine and dandy? WRONG! The confusion just keeps going on and on and quite frankly, it feels mundane. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to mention the casual and competitive gaming portion of the anime. Personally, I was hoping there would be more emphasis on the difference between those two as the anime is titled \"Gamers!\" but it seems to be more focused on the relationships between the confusion of the character's romances.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime opening and ending theme songs aren't special in any type of way either except that it sounds video game-y and the art is art.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this whole show up, there's a love/hate feeling with this anime. I had a good time laughing but also a good considerable amount of time cringing at everything that happened out of pure stupidity from the characters. To a certain extent, what they do is reasonable like being jealous and worrying about their partner cheating but the misunderstandings are just irritating. I had expectations that it was going to be a typical, otaku, video game club anime where the main character is a wuss which is kind of true but there were times when the characters stood up for themselves and I, personally, found that admirable in its own way. There could've been multiple ways where \"Gamers!\" could've been better but what I got were headaches and laughable cringe. Keep your dreams to yourself. The show is a slap to your face for having expectations.",

            "content": "I don't quite understand the people reviewing this. Are you seriously telling me this is relatable to how \"gamers\" behave?\r\nThat must be a joke, because in the first place, The \"Gamers!\" in the title is only to lure for viewers, nothing more. The plot itself has nothing relatable to video games, this series is all about misunderstandings and a boring/generic romcom plot.\r\nLet's start with the basics, the story is pretty bland, first 3 episodes do have a bit of game references and how the protagonists game and stuff. That's about it, after episode 4 the misunderstandings and the romcom start, but horribly. I understand themisunderstandings are the plot itself, but they are making it so they are slow paced and rather boring, at times it feels like filler when it obviously shouldn't be. It just feels like they are dragging it to at least make it up to 12 episodes because we haven't gotten any progress in the story so far, always at the same point, but it is a \"slice of life\". Althought, i wouldn't consider a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nMy general problem with these misunderstandings is that they are all the same, i expected them to improvise a bit and make them different than each other, but they only spoil on how a one cheats on another when it doesn't really happen, blah, blah... Tell me, where's the creativity in that? In the end, the plot doesn't move on because of this.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, the animation is nothing special, but i don't really mind it. The designs are really good for the most part. Environments are quite good looking and scenarios are fitting. The colour palette is quite nice and vibrant too.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music is top notch if you ask me, but i feel like the BGM does not fit with the scenes at times. VA are quite enjoyable, and really nice choice. The Op might be the only thing from this anime that includes Game references, the ED is enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the other problem i have with most reviews and the series itself. There's nothing from the character development and behaviour that make me think \"oh i act like that\" \"that has happened to me\" \"oh i hate that feeling\", literally nothing. Well, i didn't think anything of that because, the character development is horse poop, like the only character we know a bit is Tendou, no one else had a \"let me get to know thing\" thingy were we see their daily lives and stuff. We are already at episode 10, and i would've loved to see a bit of storyline for the game club Tendou has, i would've loved to see more from the protagonists as child' and how they got into games (But, obviously that won't be possible, this isn't a series about gamers)\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise was good, but not with an almost clickbait title \"Gamers!\", the series is just a generic romcom we see all seasons. Nothing new, nothing creative and nothing funny about it. I did wait quite some time to see if things would've gotten to the start point again, but nope, it's just the same over and over again. Edit: I'm dropping it, i'm just tired of this whole plot, it makes no sense. Lowered from 3 to 2 on overall.\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAs i'm quite repetitive, i'm sorry for any spelling or any grammar error i may have.",

            "content": "\"Extreme Misunderstandings \u2013 the animation\", for better or worse.\r\nGamers is a bit of a misleading anime. The synopsis primarily gives off the vibe of being a slice of life club anime where the club in question would be focused on gaming. But that is not really what Gamers is about. Yes, there technically is such a club in this anime but it's a very minor part of it, and in reality Gamers is more of a stereotypical love polygon romcom. However, although it is certainly somewhat generic, the show has some decent merit to it all things considered, but ultimately ends up biting off morethan it could chew.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Gamers is an anime about romance-related misunderstandings. Multi-layered misunderstandings. You may think that this does not sound like anything out of the ordinary for a romcom at all, and for first couple episodes of the anime you'd be right, and they are quite average at best. However, past a certain point the anime starts going to such an extreme extent in order to complicate matters as much as possible that it starts bordering on sheer absurdity. It makes the types of misunderstandings you'd normally see in romcoms looks like peanuts in comparison, and it almost starts to feel more like a parody of the genre. Once this happens (around episode 6), the enjoyment value of the show suddenly climbs rapidly. Every character is quite clearly described and their somewhat na\u00efve personalities are easy to understand, so their respective misconceptions are quite logical from their own perspectives. Truthfully they are all pretty stupid in their own way, but as a whole it all makes sense and it is quite funny to watch. It becomes a sort of Fawlty Towers plot, where an initial misunderstanding is first conceived and then additional misunderstandings are added on top in order to sustain the logic of the previous one, setting off a chain reaction of exponentially increasing levels of ridiculousness until eventually everything comes crashing down in the most spectacular and hilarious way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Gamers though is that ultimately it turns out to be somewhat of a one-trick pony. The peak which the show reaches around the halfway mark is quite good, but after that it starts to deteriorate again. Because once pretty much all the misunderstandings have finally been resolved and the plot looks like it's about to take a new, quite interesting direction... it's like the story suddenly has a relapse where it decides that instead of trying something new, let's just bring all the misunderstandings back and do the whole thing all over again. The difference is that the second time around it's just not as funny anymore. The joke has already been demonstrated; you don't need to do the exact same thing again. Not only that, but I also felt that some of the plot developments which led to this relapse were rather unnatural to say the least; Chiaki in particular suddenly started doing some inexplicably stupid things that barely even made sense from her own perspective. It started giving me the feeling that the author was running out of ideas, but unfortunately this kind of plot doesn't have the sustainability to warrant going in circles like this.\\n\\n\r\nGamers does have some pretty amusing characters (albeit pretty dumb ones) and momentarily has some moments of brilliance. However, despite only being 12 episodes, this anime is honestly still too long. If Gamers had ended after episode 6 or 7 it would actually have been a lot better, because everything beyond that just feels like padding. It's an inconsistent show, but on average still a decent one I think. It has almost nothing to do with games though.",

            "content": "Yeah ! Another adaptation of light novel about a rom-com focused on otaku high school students who like to play video games. It is true that we didn't have enough similar animes and studio Pine Jam was kind enough to realize it. A big thank-you.\r\nGamers! is your seasonal generic anime and my expectations weren't high but it is not even satisfying because it tries to be funny by repeating gags based on misunderstandings all along the anime till this concept is exhausted. \r\nWe have a series with a lambda protagonist named Keita Amano who loves to play video games. He will meet progressively people whoshare his passion (or not): the popular Karen Tendo (who is beautiful and likes to play video games), the ikemen Uehara (big lol) with his girlfriend Aguri (aka \"gal\") and Chiaki Hoshinomori, a secluded and shy girl who plays video games and who will often quarrel with Keita Amano because they will have slightly different tastes.\\n\\n\r\n (Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)\\n\\n\r\nAll that Keita Amano says and does makes me cringe. He does not agree with Karen Tendo because he thinks he must play by having fun and not being competitive. The idea does not even come to mind that he could do both as well. Have fun and be competitive and I'm sure a lot of people prefer to play in this way. If you play without interest to win or play correctly, then this means more a lack of self-confidence that you will voluntarily ignore. Gradually, talking with Tendo Karen (who mainly plays by being competitive), Keita Amano will review her judgment and incidentally fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Amano doesn't understand love relationships. He thinks that life happens as in visual novels and as a result he will train to understand girls through visual novels. But what an absurd idea! life and games have nothing to do (what Uehara will point out to him). I complain when I see this type of behavior because the anime portrays a negative image of the otaku gamer, assuming that he only lives in 2D and is unable to understand anything to real life. I understand that it is a comedy but surprisingly the anime tries to give a more serious tone in these moments.\\n\\n\r\n(By the way, let's also point out that Keita Amano buys at cost price his video games in shops and never on the Internet.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other male protagonist is Uehara. A high school student who has a lot of friends and a girlfriend called Aguri. He doesn't care so much about his girlfriend and often forgets her. He is more interested in Keita Amano (Is he gay?) because he saw that this unpopular guy was discussing with Karen Tendo and that the latter had a fit when Keita refused to register for the club. He tries to become a friend with Keita and helps him find a girlfriend who also plays video games. So he suggests that Keita talk to Chiaki. The latter proves to be (surprise ! surprise !) Keita's only friend because they have already met on a mobile game. But the two concerned don't know. Obviously Uehara, satisfied to hear this news (without the other two being aware) would like them to go out together.\\n\\n\r\nHe thinks that Keita and Chiaki can live as a couple because they both love video games. Sorry? It's completely stupid. Such a couple is completely improbable. It is not because you have a common passion that everything will go well for the rest of your life as a couple. This type of relationship is completely fragile and has no future.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the female characters, I appreciate them although they are not coherent. Aguri is a girl who goes out with Uehara but becomes jealous because she sees Uehara with Chiaki and suspects him of going out with Tendo as well. Karen Tendo is a very popular girl who wants Keita to join her video games club. Surprisingly, the anime seems to assume from the first episodes that gamers do not have many friends and often feel isolated as we can see with Keita and Chiaki but not with Tendo. I don't know if the passion of Tendo is secret but if it is the case, it is improbable since the club of video games seems quite visible and that some people are already in this club. Following Keita's refusal, Tendo gradually falls in love with Keita and follows him like a stalker. She will try to get closer and they will go out together. Why is she interested in Keita while receiving daily declarations of love from other boys? Do not ask me, it's a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's hard for me to describe the characters more, because their personality is inconsistent. It evolves according to the needs of the scenario. If Karen Tendo is to react as a tsundere at a specific time, she will. If Uehara is to behave like a fool by gesticulating stupidly, he will. If Aguri must be angry with her boyfriend (Uehara) because she has seen him with another girl, she will either do it or not. Only the scenario decides. The characters do not behave logically. The characters are deliberately stupid and this facilitates all the more the setting up of the misunderstandings in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus all misunderstandings are based on random reactions of the characters. They don't try to think much longer about their situation, their real relationship with their boyfriend or girlfriend. They only believe what they see and it's insane. If tomorrow I see my girlfriend walking with another man, I won't directly assume she's unfaithful, right? But it's different for Gamers' characters. Two or three coincidences are enough so that the character feels betrayed. At no time do the characters really decide to reason and go quietly to discuss with their partner to understand what is really going on. They try to get together to play a ridiculous board game that plays even more with their relationships but do nothing concrete to correct misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nThe relations between the characters aren't interesting and illogical too. For example, Aguri and Amano will initially ally to know if Uehara actually goes out with Chiaki because they accidentally saw them together once. And to complete the misunderstanding, Chiaki and Uehara think that Aguri and Amano love each other because they happened to see them together in the restaurant. Meanwhile, Amano and Uehara continue to see each other at school without asking a single question, while if at least one of them tries to approach the subject, misunderstandings could have been solved more quickly. So everything is good to continue the same insipid and repetitive comedy. Like manzai gags we can see in the shounen mangas.\\n\\n\r\n*Big spoiler*\\n\r\nLater, these misunderstandings will create a love triangle. Chiaki aka Mono (her username in the mobile game) hears that Keita is her best friend who has supported her creations from the beginning. Keita doesn't know the true identity of Mono. And because plot-convenience, Chiaki says that her little sister is Mono. (I wonder how she could convince her sister) But Keita doesn't notice the lie. Even if he is a little suspicious, he doesn't try to make the connection between Mono and Chiaki, not once. And so begins our dramatic romance with Chiaki who begins to regret seeing Keita go out with Tendo while she did everything to stop Keita from knowing her identity. She is shy but at one point I wonder why she decides not to reveal anything to Keita. Why suffer so much?\\n\r\nAs for the Aguri-Uehara couple, it is present only to increase the number of misunderstandings. There is no development in their unstable relationship but obviously no one wants to break despite the lack of trust between the two characters. I pity this poor Aguri frankly because her boyfriend seems to be totally disinterested in her. Actually I almost never saw this couple act like a couple.\\n\r\n*End big spoiler\\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems cheap. Anyway, I had low expectations of the studio Pine Jam, known for two other lamentable works: one with a magical girl for lolicons and the other with a high school girl who seduces a salaryman because boobs. Overall the faces are drawn roughly and the colors are close to what you can see using paint. The opening sounds like a disgusting mixture of generic J-pop with noisy seiyuu. Where are the great performances of excellent seiyuu like Nao Touyama or Rie Takahashi? I thought the Japanese were taking this profession more seriously than in the West but apparently the level is falling in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Gamers! didn't try to build romances, trying to give a more interesting place for video games. You can find some references on popular games, whether it is the games that the characters play or the comic scenes where the characters run or make choices such as a visual novel. It was entertaining, nothing exceptional either. Gamers! doesn't really deal with interesting themes such as the place of video games in society or the impact of video games on the characters' daily lives. A series like New Game! is more interesting at this level. I expected at least a series like Genshiken who shows us (comically, I admit) the routine of the otakus. Don't waste your time on this series and watch something that can actually satisfy you, for example Made in Abyss if you choose a seasonal show.",

            "content": "First review, but I felt like some of this needed to be said and I felt I've seen enough.\r\nThis does contain some spoilers, I suppose. \r\nGamers has a cool premise: modern gaming, where there's a school club for it and the leader is a popular and pretty blonde girl who tries to find other gamers and recruit them - but the main lead says no to joining!\r\nThe first few episodes seemed pretty decent and I was enjoying the show. After a few episodes, things got really frustrating. The show steered away from video games and gaming culture for the most part and turned into anextremely petty and frustrating love drama between the characters. They are all suspicious of each other liking someone else and instead of, y'know, just talking to each other and actually communicating, they have obscured POVs and do petty things to find out if their hunch is right, and, without actual proof, they draw conclusions over the dumbest and simplest things. I thought it would all stick to one, maybe two episodes, but it went on longer than it should have and is still going.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to give it a chance after a couple of bad episodes. I was really excited to watch it and thought it was really cute and enjoyable at first, but the plot just went completely downhill the last few episodes that it became unwatchable. I am only being this hard on it since it's a 12 episode anime. That's short, and if you have several bad episodes within that.. that really takes the quality down several notches. \\n\r\nInstead of the characters developing, it's as if it's the characters just became worse - and not in an interesting way either. They went from pretty cool, smart characters to all of them just making piss poor decisions and failing so hard at communicating that it was cringe-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that every plot has at least one conflict, but the kind of conflict they went with is very poor, annoying, and unfitting for what the show could/should have been about. There's so much they could have done with this show but instead of sticking to the show's actual theme, they chose to plop in a bunch of negative, unnecessary love drama.. with the odd video game reference here and there to remind you of the title, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be nice if the plot picked up again and became more about gaming again, but I couldn't stand to stick around. I understand one of the themes of this anime is romance as well, which is fine, but the fact that they made all the characters so painfully stupid and oblivious is extremely unrealistic - even for naive highschoolers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther than my disappointment for the plot (so far) and character development (or lack there-of/character decline), the music is decent. The opening is adorable, and the animation itself is decent.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the show does improve, I'll be happy, but its annoying fall-off in the middle (so far, anyway) is too frustrating to endure for me and seems to steer away from the original premise of what was making the show so charming.",

            "content": "Gamers. An anime that perfectly showed us how teens behave in real life. Games, the concept of love and the like are all things we go through in real life and Gamers excels in it's faithful representation of that. Simply put, it's *damn* relatable.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is less about Gamers and more about how teens live their daily life along with the everyday shenanigans involved. It as mentioned before was very relatable and was fun to watch. The plot moved on slowly and smoothly and I enjoyed the pace it went at as it didn't feel rushed at all. It didn't have any particular 'arcs'as most anime do as it felt kinda like a Slice of Life, which also added to the fun as the fun was standardised everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKadokawa. How much I love you and your brilliant assistance in helping studios with art. This  was headed by Pine Jam and I loved it. The characters were amazingly done and they looked beautiful. The emotions on the face when something was happy or shocked accentuated the humor and made it better. The backgrounds (something Pine Jam worked on before) were the best thing in the anime. Period. Sometimes I felt Pine Jam put more effort on the background than the main characters, and I don't mind, it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average. The characters were really believable but unfortunately Amano wasn't great... He wasn't too believable but the rest of the cast was excellent. Tendou, Chiaki, Aguri, Tasuku all were excellent. The OP wasn't that much at first but later on surprisingly it grew on me and I started loving it. Meanwhile the first ED was really forgettable but the second ED made up for it. The second ED was really good and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. Enough said. The characters were amazing. Each and every character had something great in them and I was happy-surprised that 5 main characters each got equal attention, a feat which very very few anime with multiple MCs accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nAmano: Though his voice was not what you call the best, his character was great. The way he was confused in simple moments was appealing to most introverts. And it was really hilarious to watch him and everyone for that matter how they dealt with situations without directly sorting it out. \\n\\n\r\nTendou: Our Resident Tsundere, She was literally the best girl. The way she behaved throughout the anime was cute and fun to watch at the same time. Though her reason for falling in love with Amano wasn't the best reason out there (if there was any) but it was washed out with her other acts in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki: A character I disliked at first, Chiaki is the 100% introvert which puts her at the top of the relatable chart for Gamers. She was shy and awkward to deal with her problems and once again she was fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAguri: Best girl? Well, she is best girl material. She was jumpy, hyperactive and plain stupid at times and it was hilarious to see her reactions. I loved the time she was with Amano but obviously she was Tasuku's girlfriend so I didn't whine about so much. Her personality was well thought out and was also one of the best in anime, not fanboying.\\n\\n\r\nTasuku: A very thoughtful and generous person at heart, Tasuku is your dream husbando. He wanted everyone to get along together happy and though his methods like every other characters' wasn't the best, it was still nice to see him try to make everyone good friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching Gamers. And it was really fun to see how everything turned out to be with every episode. It was lovely seeing the flustered, hilarious, shocked and all other reactions of the characters. The fun, plain stupid acts of all the characters were something I really enjoyed. I enjoyed the Romance and the Comedy in Gamers (which was the reason I wanted to see the anime, and was fulfilled 100%). This was literally one of my favorite animes of this year in terms of Comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6\\n\\n\r\nOverall Games is the prefect blend of Comedy, Romance and relatability. It has some of the best characters in 2017 and is absolutely fun to watch. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to see a fun RomCom, or just wants to enjoy watching an anime where the characters resonate with you. Simply put, one of the best RomComs out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Tendou is best girl <3 although Aguri is at a close second <3",

            "content": "Gamers is honestly a show that made me scratch my head more than I realized. As a gamer myself, this anime really feels relatable at heart on occasions because of its concepts. However, what really follows is a rough adaptation that translated into a questionable story. It ended up being an anime that I can\u2019t fully say it\u2019s appreciable for what it had to offer. And that\u2019s too bad really.\r\nBased on the light novel of the same name, Gamers stood out as an anime at first for me just by its title and it seemed like a show that I felt comfortable with. However, whatthis series actually presents is far more just about gamers gathering together to play games. It became a show with romance themes, misunderstandings, and drama shenanigans that really took relationships to a strange level. On paper, the show\u2019s premise sounds pretty simple as main male protagonist Keita Amano is invited by the prettiest girl of the school Karen, to join her video game club. What follows is a string of misunderstandings that ended up being messy.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the obvious elephant in the room out of the way. Gamers is not recommendable if you have an obvious dislike for rom-com. From the very start, it\u2019s pretty straightforward as the anime jumps right into the main picture with the characters and their roles. Karen is a character that I found to be easy to accept as she is friendly and simple to get along with. What might rub people in the wrong way is her obsession with video games and more so, her obsession with Amano. The anime makes it clear that she likes Amano and extends beyond just the idea of video games. For Amano himself, it seems he has a mutual attraction towards Karen although has a hard time to confess the truth. Unlike Karen, he\u2019s also more timid and unpopular at school. Drama follows the both of them as ship teases begins to develop between various characters. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond Amano and Karen, we also got Aguri and Tasuku, a couple with very sociable personalities. They bring in the comedic drama as misunderstandings are often created by plot circumstances and their own personal delusions. Individually, Aguri is also quite an energetic character with a friendly personality. Similarly, Tasuku finds himself easy to make friends with others and very outgoing. Both of their live are intersected with Karen and Amano as the story picks up and they get involved in drama and the misunderstandings. For me, this shows draws and sells its humor through the misunderstandings. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say the anime\u2019s plot work overall from this formula. It\u2019s very formulaic and predictable as almost every episode feels the same. You may think there are developments between the main characters but in reality, the anime doesn\u2019t do a clever job at progressing the plot. While I appreciate how the anime tries to sell its comedy with character pairings, it\u2019s really no different in the end with plot resolutions. Beyond the humor, there is some actual drama if you count Chiaki\u2019s role in the show. The character chemistry between her and Amano occasionally has more emotions although is still often downplayed quickly because of how lighthearted this anime is. Surprisingly, I found her sister to be more likable as she seems like a fun person to hang out with and talk to. The sibling relationship Hoshinomori is surprisingly realistic as the two can be easily relatable by their roles in this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of video games, you\u2019ll notice a lot of references. These range from console games, PC gaming, dating sims, and even arcade games. Thanks to these ideas, I think some people may find this anime likable even with the lackluster plot. The idea of gaming is explored with social norms and relatable with the main characters. However, do realize that the anime is very lighthearted and doesn\u2019t really take a serious approach at exploring the cultural ideas of gaming. It\u2019s more of an anime that deals with comedic relationship pairings in order to draw out a casual audience. The lack of background storytelling (with exception of Tasuku and Aguri) also holds this anime back at times. To me, Gamers is an anime that\u2019s easy to accept but hard to embrace.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Pine Jam, this anime originally had my worries due to its lack of promotions. More importantly, their previous project was pretty unnoticeable for its technical quality. However, my worries quickly died down after seeing the first few episodes. It\u2019s not at a level that will make your jaws drop but definitely consistent for a light novel adaptation. What really draws the audience into the technical quality is perhaps the character expressions. The biggest sell of this show is the humor so it\u2019s important to capture those expressions. Thankfully, I found myself laughing on occasions when characters react as result of misunderstandings, drama, and other shenanigans. The character designs themselves are also appealing enough to make them stand out; except with the case of Amano as he looks like a generic Average Joe. Unfortunately, this anime doesn\u2019t escape the fan service pit so expect some episodes to have it with suggestive camera angles and swimsuits.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lighthearted anime like Gamers, the theme songs aren\u2019t particular noticeable until you realize their style. While it\u2019s not truly avant-garde, it does take an approach that will make the audience talk about especially with its catchy OP song. The gaming references extends to its soundtrack elements as it sometimes uses a similar style for its OST. Still, character voice mannerism is rather moderate as none of them really stand out. Aguri\u2019s accent also took me some time to get used to as she sounds like a kid at times. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Gamers? Honestly, it really depends but the anime felt more like a big ship tease rather than an appealing show of sharp writing. The comedy is the main selling factor so if humor is your cup of tea, then this anime will be one that you\u2019ll remember that by. As for the storytelling? It really doesn\u2019t do any favors when the show is like a loop that doesn\u2019t progress the main plot altogether. The anime itself is also an incomplete adaptation as the novels are ongoing. So in essence, it\u2019s rather open ended. For gamers and anime fans, this show is fun to watch when you\u2019re bored and need time to pass by. But for what it really delivered, it\u2019s an anime that I found face palming myself more than laughing.\\n",

            "content": "What is the meaning of gamer? If we go to our favorite culture dictionary, we will consider a gamer someone that plays video-games. Is it the main topic of this anime? Sadly, it isn't. The video-game idea is irrelevant here unless that we associate the game concept with a relationship. In that case, we can say that the plot of this anime is a relationship game and a \"gamer\" interprets, acts, and plays on that relationship game. The goal of the game could be ending with someone, maybe love, etc. \r\nI can give several convenient titles for this anime, \"Misunderstandings,\" \"The mess,\" \"Mistakes,\" \"Misconceptions.\" Allthese titles point to the same problems in a relationship and how messy a relationship can be. It would be wrong waiting to see a full-time anime about \"video-games,\" tournaments, and more video-games. If you just watch this anime for that reason, you will receive a big blow on your face, you will lose all your health points, and you will end very disappointed with a big question \u00bfAnd the games?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nRelationships are complicated and love ones are even worse. How many times have we seen an anime about them? If you answer just this one, I will call you Pinocchio. This anime created some relationships from a simple topic the \"video-games.\" The characters have something in common, video-games or persons that played them. These characters will try harder to find more about other players because they have THAT something in common (games). That's the main story of this anime. Keita the typical gaming freak meets another gaming freak called Karen. Call it destiny, clich\u00e9, lack of argument she felt something for Keita. For me, both them are the first gamers. The goal is that they end together. During this adventure, other \"gamers\" joined this messy match and added chaos with some alternative endings. For example, Keita should end with Chiaki, etc. All this mess is titled \"Gamers!\" an amusing comedy with funny moments and some frustrating events but enjoyable at the end. \\n\\n\r\nI know, Gamers' story isn't that amazing. After the half of the series, we can consider it average and repetitive. Also, several persons expressed unsatisfaction of the same misunderstanding recycling and how it only gets worse. From my perspective, that is the main argument of the series if you remove this \"mess\" we will end with an empty casket that would talk about video-games, a gaming club but won't be an enjoyable comedy. Besides, no matter if the argument is repetitive we can associate it to the insecurity found in every relationship.  They are average students without any relationship experience, they will make several mistakes and will tend to overthink everything. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nWe have five main characters. They share the ability to mistake relationships from bad judgment. They don't have any love experience. They will overlook every decision for that reason all ends in chaos. \\n\\n\r\nKeita Amano, the conventional freak. We can see him as a zero at the left. None notice about him and he lives in a gaming world. Insecure, shy, but cares for his new friends. \\n\\n\r\nTendou Karen, the freakish idol. She is a beautiful face, desired student, popular, and with a hidden gaming addiction. From a relationship perspective, she is very insecure and timid.  \\n\\n\r\nChiaki Hoshinomori, the last freak. We can consider her a secondary freak. She is similar to Keita, they like the same and do the same, but they have several differences when they talk about games. She also is the last acting.\\n\\n\r\nTasuku Uehara, the ex-freak. A reformed \"Keita.\" He was like Keita but changed and became popular. He wants to help Keita, but he overthinks everything and ends creating a bigger mess. \\n\\n\r\nAguri, the insecure lover or better the ex-freak lover. She has a particular personality, but she is very uncertain of her relationship and sees a cheating ghost every time. Even if she doesn't like games, she enjoys being around gamers.  \\n\\n\r\nAll these characters have a twisted insecurity that keeps adding gasoline to the fire but thanks to that we can see some hilarious moments. Sometimes we want to hit the screen with our head but overall the moments are good. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't that amazing, and there are some angles where we can see some ugly spots or weird faces. In general, the art is acceptable. They focus on the characters, their faces, and details to create an impact on the expressions depending on the situation. The palette is the same most of the time as the lighting model, so they used a bright light with a pastel combined palette. In general, the art is acceptable for a comedy.     \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 \\n\r\nThe sound mix helps on the situations and adds tension when needed but also focus on the awkward moments, so it helps with the plot and levels the climax. The OP and ED are good, I loved more the ED, but both are very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nNo matter if the problems are repetitive the show offers several hilarious scenes. The insecurity of this group is presented to the audience with a combination between mess and comedy. This concept works well with the storytelling, a good pacing, and produces a twisted love comedy that we will enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nFinally, I want to apologize. I overused the word \"GAME\" maybe you are exhausted from it, but I am sure this simple messy story will bring a smile on your face. It isn't the best comedy out there, but it is acceptable. The characters have their moments, and their insecurity is used to create some epic events. I am sure that you will enjoy some of them. Give it a try.  \\n",

They're both basically about the same thing (slice of life in a video game club) but their execution is way different.\r\nThis anime basically completes netoge in some areas and it seems to explore the social aspect of video game geeks. At the same time, it seems to be a manifesto forplaying games the fun way. Nowadays, with the popularization of eSports a lot of people have started to play games in a competitive manner that, in my and apparently this anime's opinion, spoils the fun.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for good romcoms that don't have a linear, boring  boy-meets-girl-they-fall-in-love-funny-stuff-happens, and this seems to hit the right spot.

If you answered yes, then there is no need for you to watch this show. It's your generic story of a loser, socially awkward MC that gets attention from the hottest girls in his school for no apparent reason. The relationship webs between characters are poorly done and only arise because the characters are too stupid to make logical decisions when it comes to their relationships. Ultimately, it failsin making the connection between these realistic, therefore defeating one of the main purposes of a rom-com.... the romance. \\n\\n\r\nOh and about the comedy, it's awful. The only time I laughed while watching this show was at myself after a joke I made about one of the characters playing a what was essentially CS:GO. The comedic timing is way off and characters have no gimmicks to play off of one another.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nThink anime. Think anime protagonist. Now you know what our main character looks like. Character designs are bland, boring and just plain bad. However the animation itself is good and the intro has great animation featuring the main characters as if they were inside various types of games.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nNothing special, background music fits the tone of situations well and the intro and ending are decent.

Not only are the characters generic, underdeveloped, having no rhyme or reason as to why they like the other characters, but the misrepresentation of gamers is what really ruins the charters. You will not find a single gamer in this world that is anything like most of the main cast. They are gamers for the sake of the plot and are given no reason as to why they started playing video games in the first place, which could have given a nice conflict in ideologies which the show tried to do... yet failed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere's not much to like at all about this show, if you have seen one rom-com anime, you've seen Gamers!.

            "content": "The center of videogame stories are almost often gaming prowess of some schmuck who can go hayaku. But there is another important aspect that is not usually touched on: how videogames affects our day to day interactions and how it opens up a whole new way of forming bonds. There's a reason why MMO players say \"Came for the game, stayed for the community.\" It's a beautiful sentiment that captures the often unheralded but nonetheless important aspect of gaming in today's society.\r\nI'm happy to say that Gamers understands that aspect and struggles to make it the core of the series. While the characters right nowmay feel like it'll just fill the check-boxes of typical high school stock models, this series can get by with simplistic characterizations because its potential lies in the character interactions more than anything. This is a celebration of gaming as a community after all.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, however, Gamers is an anime you wouldn't feel bad missing out on. It has shown lopsided execution with a penchant for slapstick humor that can grow old easily, especially if its not your type of humor. The artstyle is less-detailed which enables more fluid animation but it's largely centered around the aforementioned slapstick comedy and the OST is nothing standout.\\n\\n\r\nBut the anime is not without potential, despite its abysmal first episode which I feel I must warn you about. How it goes about fulfilling that makes or breaks the series.\\n\\n\r\nHappy TI7 everyone.\\n\\n\r\nTNC! Tangerine Chicken for the win!",

            "content": "\"Missunderstandings\" everywhere. You could basically sum up the whole show with these two words. To cut to the chase, the characters are really bad and 1-dimensional. This was one of many griping issues that was bugging me while watching this show; the characters are all dumb/intentionally idiotic (and I don\u2019t mean this lightly), and the cast consists of your run-of-the-mill cliche character tropes you\u2019ll find in any romcom anime. You\u2019ll have your \"wimpy loser MC\u201d who is voiced by your average female shounen VA, the \"prettiest girl in class that has a crush on the wimpy MC\u201d cause for SOME REASON wimps are chick magnets,the \"annoying girl with the annoying voice\" (you\u2019ll know which one), the \"dude that is really popular but likes to hangout with loser MC\", and the list goes on. \\n\\n\r\nTo add on top of the lame cast, the show never seems to go anywhere. The only thing that seems to be driving the plot forward would be the \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d that would occur between two of the characters. This misunderstand could be anything: Character A was caught being close to Character B, Character B shares a drink with Character C and Character A sees this and is surprised that B and C are close (even though in reality it was mutual and not in a way of showing lovely emotions towards each other), Character C thinks Character A hate them thus undergoes depression, THE LOST GOES ON AND IT\u2019S ANNOYING! The whole foundation of the plot in Gamers are the misunderstandings that happen in the show, it\u2019s the only thing moving the plot. Forget good writing, forget good drama, forget good comedy, they were basically grabbing shit outta there asses and hoping anything could help move the plot forward. What a joke. \\n\\n\r\nRant out of the way, I'd like to say a few things: I don't have a clue as to why I stuck with this show for 5 tremendously bad episodes and I guess I was really hoping I'd actually get something good outta this show. Instead of romance and comedy, I got stale jokes and bad writing. Basically unoriginal cliche romcom horse arse. To be honest, the thing that drove me to stop watching this show the most was the characters. The characters were so bad it got unbearable; I was at a point in the show that I didn\u2019t care about the plot anymore and was just focusing on how utterly terrible the characters were. It was just so...BAD! Words can\u2019t describe how miserable each episode was, watching as the characters go on their daily lives of looping through the same problems over and over again and never learning. The characters have peas for brains! As for the art, it was mediocre AT BEST but wasn't too bad. I\u2019d expect better quality though, the colors and designs of the setting and characters were bland and boring to look at. The Sound wasn't too bad either but not noticably great, though I did kinda enjoy the OP. The OP was catchy and I enjoyed the references to other games (such as PUBG, Super Smash Bros, and Undertale). Besides all of that though, this show could be summed up as a terrible mess or the crap I take after eating the local Chipotle burrito. I don't recommend this show to anyone who wants REAL romance with an ACTUAL plot, but if you like romcom cliches then go ahead and watch.",

But come on. This is going way too far. \r\nOther than the inept communication ability of all the main characters, the anime is alright. Art is good, music is fine, the plot isfine too.

But dont insult his friends or else he will bite at you.\\n\r\nSadly his low self esteem makes see himself unworthy makes him always jump to conclusions and exagerates the pesimistic view in his mind.\\n\\n\r\nSecond we have Tendou Karen:\\n\r\nA princess type girl who is the madonna of school. She is into competition gaming to gain prestige and fame. She rebuilt the gaming club for such actions as the previous club members won many trophies so she dont want to ket them down. Also the principal let her have the club with the condition to gain prestige. She also dislike casual games and sees them as trash since you cannot win competitions with them. (Reason why i began to dislike her, i took offense to that). Fell in love with Amano after she hears him defend her and her club in a valiant way. Since then she sees amano as a prince and tries to recruit him for her club to be with him but ended as his girlfriend by a misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThird is Uehara Tasuku:\\n\r\nAn ex game otaku now turn into ikemen. Became friends with Amano by a misunderstanding as he saw the kid had gust in the end when provoked. He has the chuuni habit of talking to himself in a superior sense as if all of them would be lost without him. He also decided to be Amano's wingman for the girls that were interested in Amano making himself wall in a riot of misunderstandings because of it, but he is not far into jumping to conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nFourth is Aguri:\\n\r\nA nerdy girl turned-bubbly-bishoujo who had a crush on Uehara since middle school. After she saw him change she changed herself to fit his liking and ended dating. But also fell into a riot of misunderstandings as she also jumped to conclusions after she saw Tasuku interact with other girls (when he was working as Amano's wingman). She ended up becoming good friends with Amano because of, as Amano tries to help her save her relationship.\\n\\n\r\nFifth comes Chiaki:\\n\r\nAnother gamer girl who is the female synonim of Amano Keita. Chiaki met Amano when he came to her class after Uehara tried to hook them up. Everything started well, both of them likes same things, same games and get along... Until they discovered they have different opinions about certain games then the bickering began. Since then Chiaki and Amano act like a bickering married couple which made Uehara wonder why dont they just hook up. In the end it turns out that Chiaki is in fact Amano's admired doujin game maker and his best game partner Nobe and Mono.\\n\\n\r\nSixth is Konoha:\\n\r\nChiaki's little sister who was dragged into the mess thanks to Chiaki herself. She and Amano hits it off and become good friends since they both love visual novels, but deep inside Konoha is a pervert who wants to bang bishoujo (cute girls) making her a bit of a lesbian or at least bisexual. Her preference is erogaming which she tries to keep it a secret to hide her lewd persona. She also becomes Chiaki's wingman (or wingwoman) as she tries to hook both Chiaki and Amano up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the whole deal.\\n\r\n\"Gamers!\" Is about teenagers getting involved in misunderstandings to add drama to their youth. Which makes the beauty of the series.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nI'll admit I was hooked in for the first few episodes of the series, they were very appealing and interesting for me as an avid gaming fan. But it all fell apart midway.\r\nI went into the show completely blind not knowing what to expect, and the first episode was great. It had very nice gaming culture references from CSGO and even Guilty Gear! It made the MC, Keita, a very relatable character that just wants to plays game for fun instead of playing it competitively like the gaming club does.\r\nThe second episode was wonderful as well, especially with its wonderfully animated introductionsequence and the nest full of gaming culture references in it. This episode focused more on Uehara's character and his transition from being a loner gamer nerd to a typical cool and handsome stud. There is one part where Uehara and Keita are in the arcade and playing Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game, where Uehara basically is able to read Keita's movements and basically body him due to his 'noob' tells/tendencies in the game. That part was the hook, line and sinker for me in this anime and I was even more excited in watching the third episode for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I had thought that the plot would be focusing on Uehara and Keita's journey in the gaming club, but this was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 3 and 4 rolled along, and now I had this bad premonition that this anime was actually not what I thought it was.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 5 and 6 came out and I just felt crushed. It was at this point where I realised that they would be focusing on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters and that just completely turned off this anime for me. The selling point of the anime for me, about how it was gaming, was now almost completely gone and I had just lost interest in continuing to watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been such an interesting concept for an anime, focusing on the inner workings of competitive gaming and gamers. It had untapped potential and they just threw it all away in favour of an overly clich\u00e9d misunderstanding-riddled romcom.\\n\\n\r\nAnd god, the characters. The character development between the main characters was just completely thrown into the garbage, it felt like the characters' personalities from the first few episode had completely flipped and they were now all completely naive and oblivious.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who would like this type of anime, but this just isn't my cup of tea, I just didn't like how they just suddenly steered away from gaming almost completely and instead focused solely on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, the artstyle of the anime is decent, nothing flashy but still okay, and I do love the music as well as the wonderful opening of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very disappointing to see how this anime turned out, it could have been one of my favourite animes of this year. It feels that the title of the series 'Gamers!' was just stuck there just to draw in gamers into watching this anime, and it definitely did, I just wished they at least would have tried to made the focal point of the series to be gaming instead.",

The show is more a Slice of life Romcom about teenagers where the story just focuses on their lives at High school and their interactions with one other which may disappoint some viewers due to its Soap Opera-ish vibe. (If you are looking for something similar but with more gaming involved, check out \u2018Netoge No Yome Wa Onnanoko Ja Nai To Omotta?\u2019) I too was upset upon learning this, but the anime brilliantly defends itself by delivering spontaneously strong, albeitsometimes cliched Comedy! By not resorting to a Harem anime like everybody else, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have 2 main guys rather than 1 and all girls. The 1st episode itself foreshadows uniqueness as the show deliberately sets up a Generic Romcom setting where the MC is invited to a Gaming club by a beautiful girl and the other characters presented clearly looked like the shows main cast. Only to swerve all of us towards the end by having the MC be like \u2018Nah, this isn\u2019t for me\u2019! Realizing the show had the balls to create a \u2018fake cast\u2019 of characters just for 1 Joke meant I was in store for something Awesome! And I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Another thing I liked was the shows effort of making fun of the Harem genre itself. We actually have a character who calls upon this in one episode! The same character even plots to force a Harem on one of the MC\u2019s which ended up rebounding horribly! \u2018Gamers\u2019 uses an old exaggeration of an over the top love triangles which gets everyone confused and misinformed, thus resulting into utter chaos! (The show bravely points it out to us from time to time) You have things like characters hearing only the worst parts of a conversations to someone suppressing important info just to protect another character\u2019s public image which may look frustrating, but it was fantastically executed!\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are genuinely interesting by managing to stand out via their personalities. We have our simple looking Amano, who\u2019s very bad when it comes to judgements due to his uncertainties. Nevertheless, he\u2019s a good MC since he\u2019s peculiarly zealous about certain type of games and will fight \u2018\u2019verbally\u2019\u2019 tooth and nails to defend his point despite sucking at playing games! He manages to come across very kind to others and it\u2019s his infectious passion for games that resulted into Tendou falling head over heels for him! Tendou herself is a big gaming fan (in secret) so others simply can\u2019t understand her infatuation for Amano which results into Tendou losing her \u2018Highschool Dream Girl\u2019 image. (Being REJECTED by a Nobody really hurt her image at school!) Even though she doesn\u2019t do much later, her depiction of a major crush was humourlessly presented to us which never got tiring. After all this is how a person with a real crush acts! The person goes through unstable amount of emotions without ever expressing it out loud. Uehara is another character who comes off looking cool but isn\u2019t as smart as he thinks! Often a prey to his own schemes due to bad decisions, results in being the root for the whole group problems! Aguri bonds nicely with Amano and she\u2019s all cute and innocent while Chiaki turns out to be even a bigger Gaming nerd than the MC himself! I liked how her story went along with the main arc and whenever she said \u2018Desu Desu\u2019. These 5 characters provide us with the bulk of relatable Comedy in a hilarious and ridiculous manner that will have you LOLing pretty hard! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty basic, though colourful and the character designs are by the numbers. Both the OP and ED were a stand out with very catchy music and bright visuals which is appreciated with great Voice Acting from the cast for both Subs and Dubs. The opening video boasts wonderful ingenuity by showcasing countless parodies of video games like Mario and Street Fighter and the work done on facial expressions were superb!  \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I found the anime funny and entertaining. Episode 5, now remembered as \u2018The Mother of All Misunderstandings!\u2019 was hands down the best episode the anime has to offer as it managed to deliver a perfect storm of emotions ranging from Jealousy, Love, Envy, Confusion, Shock, etc in a Comedic fashion! (I loved how the MC was totally oblivious to all it!) This reminds me of a movie called \u2018Crazy, Stupid, Love\u2019 which pulled of a similar scene of misinterpretations by Comedic means. But exactly like the movie, this brilliant plot unravelled too quickly as the anime failed to entertain us on this level again! The anime tries to repeat itself with the follow up of a Board game, but it just didn\u2019t have the same kick to it! And add in the pretty Meh ending, hurts your final thoughts about the show. Still the characters had their own side plots which were nicely demonstrated though the interactions between them remained the highlight of this anime. Certainly, recommend it to everyone as it\u2019s one of the good anime of this year!",

            "content": "Gamers! is one of the few anime I've watched where I gradually kept disliking it as it kept on progressing. I try to keep all airing anime up to date so that I can give reviews on them, and this is an anime I kept thinking \"great, its Thursday and another episode of this is out\".\r\nHonestly, the first few episodes of Gamers! were halfway decent, with many new characters being shown and a story line progressing all along with many people having personalities that were somewhat memorable.\r\nIt's animation is quite good and with the exception of the annoying cliche apologies the dialogue is good. Whattruly made me love the opening was of the many games that a large population of the world can recognize, for me it was the reference of Smash Bros and Player-Unknown's Battlegrounds.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after the first few episodes the show really starts to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, what really dropped my approval rating was what the show ended up being. This isn't about people and their different views on video games, which is by episode 2 what I was expecting. This is a shitty romance anime of people that enjoy video games.\\n\\n\r\nA whole lot of the episodes are spent attempting to have the main character join the game-club, which not only never happens, but seems to be fully forgotten. It's almost as if the episode shouldn't be there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent, however cliche each of them are. None of them are memorable whatsoever but Aguri is slightly distinct. The anime's main love interest is the typical \"good at everything but somehow secretly a part of an unpopular group\" and the main character is generic and boring, with nothing special except for his laid back gaming personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws of this anime are how unenjoyable and boring the anime becomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime turns into dialogue heavy excerpts of more than likely two people having a conversation about one of the five main characters and how they seem to be cheating on each other, with another one of the main characters.\\n\r\nI don't understand why this topic was prolonged so heavily, I've watched 9 episodes and in every single episode an issue occurs from a misunderstanding that one of the five people obviously know but are reluctant to tell each other. It's not the fact of what's going on being the problem, but how goddamn oblivious each and every one of them are about what their actions are.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes aren't memorable whatsoever and neither is the anime, many other animes have done a much better job of assumptions causing issues. The romance is not good at all, and so is its presentation of the romance.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was forced to describe the anime in a few words it would be: Bland, Boring, and Disappointing.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I almost dropped this anime from episode 1 because I got influenced by some reviews saying its 'clich\u00e9'. Note to self: Never read mal reviews before judging a show by myself ever again.\r\nJust know that clich\u00e9s do not automatically make a show bad. A very great example of a clich\u00e9s done right is Konosuba, which utilises the isekai trope to create a wonderful and humorous parody of the actual genre, and in my opinion, another great example is Gamers!. This turned out to be one of the most impressionable romcoms for me.\r\nThe reason I almost dropped this show was because I was overly judgementalon its first episode. Admittedly, the following  clich\u00e9s were a bit of a turn off at the beginning: \"high school game club\" and  \"otaku-pandering main protaganist\". Basically the premise of episode 1 at first felt kind of uninteresting and even unrealistic. \\n\r\nI decided to give this anime another chance after months because I saw that it had potential. After re-evaluating the character motives and  making the effort to actually think deeper into the actions of the characters, it made so much more sense. It's evident from episode 1 that the character motives in the entirety of the show can be sometimes hard to grasp and character's actions can often feel unreasonable or confusing (as expected of every drama show tho).  However they really are quite meaningful when given a second thought. The premise starts getting way more entertaining after episode 2 with the slight twist. What\u2019s hilarious is that the much hated \u2018game club\u2019 clich\u00e9 was actually almost never mentioned again in the show, despite spending 1 episode introducing it. It just shows how self-aware the humour is, by first baiting the audience into thinking \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those shows\u2026 .-.\u201d then surprising them and making fun of it. (tl;dr: so if you're planning to get into this show, be prepared for a little bit of confusion. if u want to understand every character fully, give everything some thought and it's actually quite meaningful)\\n\\n\r\nThe main appeal of this show is that it handles the relationship drama part of it really well. Its humour stems from how self-aware the show is to the many supposed clich\u00e9s, making fun of it and deriving humour from that. (I kind of see elements of Konosuba\u2019s humour in this show.) It also does the whole \u2018misunderstandings\u2019 thing better than most other shows by making light-hearted fun of it. I find it so funny because it makes fun of exactly what I LOATHE about many drama shows and actually making it work well.\\n\r\nSee, misunderstandings in anime, especially in romance dramas, were something that I always hated to the core. It always annoyed me to no end when shows used 'misunderstandings' as a main driving point of its plot as an excuses to either lengthen itself or to drive its melodrama. Shows like the second season of Kimi ni Todoke has fueled my hate for this because it JUST isn't realistic, the character's constant beating around the bush and not noticing the most obvious things just annoys me at how un-humanlike the characters become because of it. The problem is that most of the time, their misunderstandings can all be fixed if the characters just calm the fuck down, sit down and talk it out... Shows like that just feel very unnecessarily dragged out, insincere and boring. Drilling the frankly petty misunderstandings into our heads and making it the main point of the show be the drama that comes from them honestly makes it emotionally exhausting to watch.\\n\r\nOf course, I have seen a small few anime that actually effectively used misunderstandings, but that\u2019s hard to pull off, because you have to make the effort to make the misunderstandings feel genuinely realistic or relatable for the show to be actually be likable. (One example is Tsuki ga Kirei, I could get into why in another review)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when misunderstandings are used as a meta plot device to not only get great humour out of it, but also as a way to bond and develop characters, that\u2019s good shit. Gamers! does it so well. Notice how really it doesn\u2019t get sad and edgy all because of some stupid misunderstanding but it not only gets funnier, characters also know each other better and develop through those experiences.\\n\\n\r\nHere are some other small examples of self-aware humour that I laughed way too hard at, which made fun of things other anime did badly:\\n\r\n1. Having Uehara as the intelligent, NOT dense character that actually knows what\u2019s going on. The fact that he judges situations and can read people\u2019s expressions (like a normal person would) is just hilarious. Viewers can really relate to him as he actually reads into things instead of being any other dense character that does not give anything a second thought.\\n\r\n2. The fact that Uehara and Keita consciously calls everyone into meetups to clear misunderstandings LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN WOULD DO. It\u2019s so rewarding to see anime characters use common sense instead of beating around the bush.\\n\r\n3. Small things like the clich\u00e9-looking student council members of the other school or other blatant references to different clich\u00e9s like Misumi Eiichi's little section on the last episode. XD\\n\r\n4.  How the game club which was 'supposed' to be the main focus of the show completely became irrelevant later in the show.\\n\r\n5. The extremely amusing and exaggerated misunderstandings that thankfully were not unnecessarily over-complicated and edgy.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give this show a strong 8.5/10\\n\r\nThis show is great and it has some silly and lovable characters that unexpectedly develops through light-hearted drama and misunderstandings. The ending was an emotional pay-off and was greatly satisfying. Instead of being sad and edgy and unrealistic, it resolves all the romance and drama like a man, and in heartwarming and gratifying ways! You know a show is great when you actually like and care about every one of its characters. I have not even mentioned the \"Gamer\" part of this show, which I absolutely loved and related to. References everywhere, and it even teaches some really meaningful values for gamers at episode 4. Gaming is a huge theme (no shit) in Gamers! and fits into the contexts of the plot and characters so well: characters are bonded by and understands each other through the common interest of games. Maaaybe a little otaku-pandering but still relatable to most people. Yes there are some flaws that I won't mention here, but overall it's an extremely sweet and enjoyable show that can NEVER DESERVE THE \u201c4\u201d RATING. HMPH >.<\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll edit in more to this review when I can remember more necessary things to add. Right now I\u2019m too tired to remember everything I wanted to say. This was basically a drunken rant at 3 am after getting slightly triggered by the bad ratings in mal and wanting to do this anime some good. Knowing the fact that I almost dropped this show and that more people like me will because of mal reviews, I wanted to do this anime some justice. This definitely deserves more praise imo!",

If you checked off more than one of the options I listed, I got the show just for you! It's \"Gamers!\" The show where all of your characters are nothing more than a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to connect with each other.\r\nYou can't help but cover your eyes hoping it doesn't get any cringier. Seeing this makes me want to bawl my eyes out as the characters fail to interact with each other like regular human beings. It's a mixtureof cringe, frustration, and stupid fun rolled into one. First and foremost, I'd like to say, the show is a comedy. Personally, if a show has made me laugh countless times, I'd say it did its job correctly. I'm sure it is also safe to say that the show is one giant ball of confusion. At a certain point, you would hope that the confusions would be solved A.S.A.P. right and everything would be fine and dandy? WRONG! The confusion just keeps going on and on and quite frankly, it feels mundane. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to mention the casual and competitive gaming portion of the anime. Personally, I was hoping there would be more emphasis on the difference between those two as the anime is titled \"Gamers!\" but it seems to be more focused on the relationships between the confusion of the character's romances.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime opening and ending theme songs aren't special in any type of way either except that it sounds video game-y and the art is art.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this whole show up, there's a love/hate feeling with this anime. I had a good time laughing but also a good considerable amount of time cringing at everything that happened out of pure stupidity from the characters. To a certain extent, what they do is reasonable like being jealous and worrying about their partner cheating but the misunderstandings are just irritating. I had expectations that it was going to be a typical, otaku, video game club anime where the main character is a wuss which is kind of true but there were times when the characters stood up for themselves and I, personally, found that admirable in its own way. There could've been multiple ways where \"Gamers!\" could've been better but what I got were headaches and laughable cringe. Keep your dreams to yourself. The show is a slap to your face for having expectations.",

            "content": "I don't quite understand the people reviewing this. Are you seriously telling me this is relatable to how \"gamers\" behave?\r\nThat must be a joke, because in the first place, The \"Gamers!\" in the title is only to lure for viewers, nothing more. The plot itself has nothing relatable to video games, this series is all about misunderstandings and a boring/generic romcom plot.\r\nLet's start with the basics, the story is pretty bland, first 3 episodes do have a bit of game references and how the protagonists game and stuff. That's about it, after episode 4 the misunderstandings and the romcom start, but horribly. I understand themisunderstandings are the plot itself, but they are making it so they are slow paced and rather boring, at times it feels like filler when it obviously shouldn't be. It just feels like they are dragging it to at least make it up to 12 episodes because we haven't gotten any progress in the story so far, always at the same point, but it is a \"slice of life\". Althought, i wouldn't consider a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nMy general problem with these misunderstandings is that they are all the same, i expected them to improvise a bit and make them different than each other, but they only spoil on how a one cheats on another when it doesn't really happen, blah, blah... Tell me, where's the creativity in that? In the end, the plot doesn't move on because of this.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, the animation is nothing special, but i don't really mind it. The designs are really good for the most part. Environments are quite good looking and scenarios are fitting. The colour palette is quite nice and vibrant too.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music is top notch if you ask me, but i feel like the BGM does not fit with the scenes at times. VA are quite enjoyable, and really nice choice. The Op might be the only thing from this anime that includes Game references, the ED is enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the other problem i have with most reviews and the series itself. There's nothing from the character development and behaviour that make me think \"oh i act like that\" \"that has happened to me\" \"oh i hate that feeling\", literally nothing. Well, i didn't think anything of that because, the character development is horse poop, like the only character we know a bit is Tendou, no one else had a \"let me get to know thing\" thingy were we see their daily lives and stuff. We are already at episode 10, and i would've loved to see a bit of storyline for the game club Tendou has, i would've loved to see more from the protagonists as child' and how they got into games (But, obviously that won't be possible, this isn't a series about gamers)\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise was good, but not with an almost clickbait title \"Gamers!\", the series is just a generic romcom we see all seasons. Nothing new, nothing creative and nothing funny about it. I did wait quite some time to see if things would've gotten to the start point again, but nope, it's just the same over and over again. Edit: I'm dropping it, i'm just tired of this whole plot, it makes no sense. Lowered from 3 to 2 on overall.\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAs i'm quite repetitive, i'm sorry for any spelling or any grammar error i may have.",

And it didn't even have a real ending man..\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special only minor point i have to say here is that sometimes the chars look like robots, like when they zoom out on walking scenes etc there arms move like robots, wtf is this sh*t? can't you make them walk like normal?\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nthe characters sound like they are screaming all the time with there annoying voices, 3 different ending songs also? why?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nLike i said in the story, they were really good at competitive gaming, but then it turns out all this anime was just about pentagon of love and misunderstandings , no background on gaming, the mc is a total loser who can't do anything, he even sucks a** at games..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nMan what is this F**king piece of sh*t anime, it made me so angry, you have such a cool 'story' to work with and you just gonna change everything for a boring love/slice of life/school anime full of misunderstandings and endless screaming? cmn..\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2.2/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a ''scam'' and just uses the gamer tag to draw in more people, it has nothing to do with gaming except for the occasional gaming talk they have followed up by misunderstandings about them love triangle.\\n\r\nPlease do yourself a favor and never watch this.\\n\r\nalso please do not make a season 2.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Extreme Misunderstandings \u2013 the animation\", for better or worse.\r\nGamers is a bit of a misleading anime. The synopsis primarily gives off the vibe of being a slice of life club anime where the club in question would be focused on gaming. But that is not really what Gamers is about. Yes, there technically is such a club in this anime but it's a very minor part of it, and in reality Gamers is more of a stereotypical love polygon romcom. However, although it is certainly somewhat generic, the show has some decent merit to it all things considered, but ultimately ends up biting off morethan it could chew.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Gamers is an anime about romance-related misunderstandings. Multi-layered misunderstandings. You may think that this does not sound like anything out of the ordinary for a romcom at all, and for first couple episodes of the anime you'd be right, and they are quite average at best. However, past a certain point the anime starts going to such an extreme extent in order to complicate matters as much as possible that it starts bordering on sheer absurdity. It makes the types of misunderstandings you'd normally see in romcoms looks like peanuts in comparison, and it almost starts to feel more like a parody of the genre. Once this happens (around episode 6), the enjoyment value of the show suddenly climbs rapidly. Every character is quite clearly described and their somewhat na\u00efve personalities are easy to understand, so their respective misconceptions are quite logical from their own perspectives. Truthfully they are all pretty stupid in their own way, but as a whole it all makes sense and it is quite funny to watch. It becomes a sort of Fawlty Towers plot, where an initial misunderstanding is first conceived and then additional misunderstandings are added on top in order to sustain the logic of the previous one, setting off a chain reaction of exponentially increasing levels of ridiculousness until eventually everything comes crashing down in the most spectacular and hilarious way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Gamers though is that ultimately it turns out to be somewhat of a one-trick pony. The peak which the show reaches around the halfway mark is quite good, but after that it starts to deteriorate again. Because once pretty much all the misunderstandings have finally been resolved and the plot looks like it's about to take a new, quite interesting direction... it's like the story suddenly has a relapse where it decides that instead of trying something new, let's just bring all the misunderstandings back and do the whole thing all over again. The difference is that the second time around it's just not as funny anymore. The joke has already been demonstrated; you don't need to do the exact same thing again. Not only that, but I also felt that some of the plot developments which led to this relapse were rather unnatural to say the least; Chiaki in particular suddenly started doing some inexplicably stupid things that barely even made sense from her own perspective. It started giving me the feeling that the author was running out of ideas, but unfortunately this kind of plot doesn't have the sustainability to warrant going in circles like this.\\n\\n\r\nGamers does have some pretty amusing characters (albeit pretty dumb ones) and momentarily has some moments of brilliance. However, despite only being 12 episodes, this anime is honestly still too long. If Gamers had ended after episode 6 or 7 it would actually have been a lot better, because everything beyond that just feels like padding. It's an inconsistent show, but on average still a decent one I think. It has almost nothing to do with games though.",

The first 3 to 4 episodes are honestly pretty good, with surprises in how the main character acts, and how all the other characters react to him. \r\nBut then, from then on, it turns into a cluster of high school emotions.So much random drama, so many random \"He's cheating!!\" So much angst and randomness. And it loses any surprise, so that by the time the two you want to date (Presumably Tendou and Keita) start dating there's no more hype, and that leads to the next issue: The joke has already worn itself down. The joke being that Keita is socially awkward, probably moreso then anyone other then Hoshinomori (Who, for whatever reason, on episode 9, they start pushing for relationship between Keita and her??) \\n\\n\r\nWouldn't recommend this.

This serie has both:\r\n - The humour is just natural and hilarious. Thereare not the typical cliches of this kind of series, the plot create the perfect situations and the characters just need to follow what we, the 3D people, would do in the same situations. Who has never been wrong when thinking about what the girl/boy he/she like's has done with the guy/girl who was with him/her the other day?, well, that's what the writer of this show use to create the comedy.\\n\\n\r\n- The romance is the center of the plot (im not really sure if this is the correct way to say it in english lol), and is always evolving. You can be laughing about some joke or funny moment and in just 10 seconds you found that the plot is using that moment to evolve to something really interesting. Is not just that this show focus his plot in the romance, is that this show have a REALLY GOOD romance plot, or it is what seems up to the chapter 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally... i just want to apologize about my bad english, but i disagree with the score of this anime and i felt the duty of writing a review .\\n\\n",

This is the most satisfying romcom I've seen in a millennia. The best part is how it takes the trope of stupid anime misunderstandings and twists and turns it into the satisfying comedic mess that other anime would try to make you take seriously. It keeps weaving this web of needlessly complicated relationships between the 5 main characters that'll have you screaming \"JUST TALKTO EACH OTHER\" but they don't and it keeps piling on in the most ridiculous ways that'd put Tu love Ru to shame (probably not actually). What makes this particularly funny to me is how closely it mimics actual normies and their \"it's complicated\" relationships problems and how they could be solved with a simple conversation. I'm really not sure how it's gonna go from this point but I'll be happy to follow through.\\n\\n\r\nDespite dropping the emphasis on gaming pretty quickly I'm actually surprised at how accurately they portrayed the gaming aspects of the show. Like how hard it is to initially talk with someone when the only base you have to go on is that you play games, and just how easy it is to bond and befriend someone based on playing a game. It can be cheesy at times but that's just how gaming is, sometimes you have to use cheesy strats to get a win.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a groundbreaking exploration of a gamer's psyche by any means but it's been a fun and enjoyable experience that hasn't fallen into many cliches of a romcom anime so far. I'd recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "What comes to our mind when we hear 'Games'? Is it excitement? thrilled? seducing?.. I think it is.. Just like anime itself.. But what if.. There is an anime about 'Gamers'.. You know.. Typical teenagers that goes to high-school then they go home to not study, but game all day. Gamers on real life are like sand grains on the beach. They are too many. We cannot count how many sand grains out there am i right? Thus, games ARE really popular throughout our generation. From toddlers who play 'ABC' games, to adults who play 18+ games out there. Almost all of us are gamers.This season we are presented by an anime that you can summarize on 1 word only because of its title.. Yes.. I am talking about ''Gamers!''. The most cliched, cringy (I guess?) and misunderstanding anime out there on this season. While there are some poor stuffs about this anime like showing-off so much rip-off versions of games like in CSGO, Candy Crush and any other RPG smartphone games out there, there are some hidden good sides about this anime. With its very unique opening, to its unique romance style of an anime, I will discuss it if this anime is totally worth it to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nWe are presented by a simple story with a simple set of characters on this anime 'Gamers!'. No, really. Gamers forming a game club and a gamer inviting another gamer that plays smartphone RPG games and arcade games but ended up getting rejected because of the gamer boy's pride then after some episodes they formed like a gamers council all four of them. Simple. But as the story goes on and on. We are like forgetting the title of this series. Instead of 'Gamers!', we are getting introduced by a new title called 'Playing With My Heart'. 'Gamers!' focuses on the characters named Tendou Karen, Amano Keita, Aguri, Uehara Tasuku and Hoshinomori Chiaki, where all of them game AND have a roullette of misunderstandings of love and affections for countless of episodes. Though, the comedic factor is great on this anime because of the misconceptions of the main characters themselves, but the fact still remains that most people thought that this will be an anime that focuses on games itself. From the opening where they showcase so many parody of games, from the actual scenes where the other characters play it, we thought we will have a decent ''gamers'' anime. But instead, we were introduced by an anime about a sole rom-com. Not duo, or even trio, but a Romantic-Comedy Quadro. Though the story itself is interesting (dicarding the game itself but only focusing the romcom stuffs) but for some reasons, each episode of it focuses on characters asking question like ''Is Keita the boyfriend of Aguri?'' Or ''Is Tasuka the boyfriend of Tendou?''. The story was messy but funny at the same time..\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nArt style of the anime is vivid. It seems that its a bit more colorful than an usual one if you think but it adds up the emotions of each characters as well. The art is great on this anime, not only the character sketches and effects but also how the artist represent parodies of games itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAn anime is nothing without sound. Though some can watch anime without sound by reading the subtitles, but on this anime, i dont know if you can enjoy this one without sound. The opening and ending songs were quite fine for the ears to listen but how the background music tells the scenery change and all. Yeah sure this turned into a Romcom from being a gaming one but still. The sound here is splendid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nCringe. When the romcom started, thats the first word I come up to summarize it (especially the main character Keita). I mean cringe is a normal thing to everyone but as it goes on, it is sometimes painful to watch the other characters having cringy moments. It just hurts. Though they all suit with their roles and that was good and all, this feeling is hard to forget. The characters are very less on this anime compared to other Summer 2017 animes out there and this makes the anime a little bit not confusing to watch. So.. Less characters = fine story line (for this anime)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nWe are all watching anime for entertainment. Though not all the time. Some watch it for studies as well to get ideas for story writing and all. But please.. Don't pick ''Gamers!'' for a story to tell. Though, it has  a lot of good sides, but cringe is common on this anime. Comedy is fine and all. Romance is good but the characters' misunderstanding is quite cringy enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... 7/10 is i can give to 'Gamers!'. With its cringy characters puffing so many blushes on their faces, romantic-comedy at its finest and a story that can either make you laugh or punch the wall, a score of 7/10 is fine.. unless you hate the anime itself.",

            "content": "After catching up with the amazing slice of life-romcom, Recovery of an MMO Junkie, I wanted another game-related romance-comedy and I was hoping Gamers would touch my heart in similar ways. The production quality of Gamers was better than I expected. That opening, the references, the music, the voice acting, the art style\u2014it's fantastic! Though Gamers started off a little bit cliched, it still piqued my interest. I thought the pilot was just a basic starting point and the second episode introduced more characters that could get fleshed out later. That was my initial thought until the anime suddenly dropped the ball after the secondepisode to opt for an endless barrage of misunderstandings. Gamers is the kind of anime where people squirm, shake their head side to side a bit, and go \"it has its moments but it's not worth your time.\"\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how passionate about games they made each character but every time they interacted with one another, it seemed like the writers forgot the nuance previously given to them. They built and nurtured these great relationships in the second episode with tender moments only to make them one-dimensional again in order to pull off their misunderstandings gimmick. The gaming club concept could have worked to their advantage but they didn't stick with it. Misunderstandings killed anything good that could have been salvaged; the writing was very poorly thought out.\\n\\n\r\nThey also kept forgetting the girls were interested in video games and continuously used them as boys' sexual attraction, physically and emotionally which was so creepy. If the poor girls didn't completely forget they were into games, they were ashamed of sharing their passion and grew more obsessive about relationships and boys. Because of that, all of the characters kept jumping to their own conclusions about one another. Why write a whirlwind of confusion that would serve to irritate the audience instead of just communicating as friends and partners should? It's just plain bad writing. In addition to that, there were episodes where I was able to catch the ending CG and they were all creepy boob and ass shots of the girls in swimsuits. They're children and the skeevy producers need to rethink their careers.\\n\\n\r\nThis entire anime was a landfill of terrible ideas with few moments of fluff sprinkled into it. The writers would constantly forget that the characters enjoyed video games and then beat it into the viewer's head that they're gamers the next minute. I understand the need to create drama\u2014high school can be fraught with it\u2014but every plotline after the second episode became a string of one misunderstanding to the next. Most high school kids don't know how to gauge their emotions and express themselves, but the creators clearly had no idea how to portray adolescence without taking it to new levels of annoying. Pair that with the random creepiness of sexualizing teenage girls and you get this abomination of an anime. By the finale, none of the misunderstandings got sorted out and on the rare occasion that they did, it would soon be replaced by another. Gamers has its moments but it's not worth your time.",

            "content": "This is not a show about games, its a facade. The show is actually a frustratingly bad romance anime that relies heavily on misunderstandings.\r\nThe premise of the show is basic, it sets up the main relationship very quickly and has a sub-plot about video games, that is hardly relevant, but I believe has been put into the show just to pander to the otaku demographic. \r\nI don't understand any of the characters in this show, not because they are complex, but because they are so poorly written and their objectives and ambitions in the show are contrived and feel as though they are just ideasthat have been copied and pasted onto these blank canvas characters.\\n\\n\r\nSeeming romance is the show's main focus, you would think this would be the best part, you'd be wrong to think that. The characters are so bad that I couldn't seem to care about any of their relationships. The characters all seem to be mentally handicapped as they all brake down and misunderstand the actions of other characters and the show has a roundabout way of just avoiding them actually talking about these misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nKeita fails as a main character, he contradicts himself so often, most likely because of the poor writing, I feel as though there's a new main character each episode.\\n\\n\r\nMost likely no one looks towards a romance anime, looking for good animation, on this front Gamers! is passable.  Art and animation are both standard, I felt like I was hearing the same couple of tracks each episode, which made me feel as though the music in the show was a bit bland.\\n\\n",

I might be wrong about its direction (and I don't want to spoil anything), but so far I've liked the show's message. \r\nWhether or not you'll like thisshow greatly depends on your sense of humor.

One day, he sees the school idol and she invites him to her gaming club. After checking it out, he respectfully declines her offer, (probably because he sucks at video games) and the idol falls madly in love with him.\r\nArt & Animation - 8\r\nThe art and animation still seems to be top-notch. Nothing bad I can say about it, really. The way the claw on the claw machine moved swiftly was perfectly executed and very'flowing'. I'll have to say, Uehara's art style seemed pretty unique, but he still ended up looking cool asf.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe VA were enjoyable as usual, except for the MC. Like, for some reason, every time he spoke he just made me want to punch his brains out even more. Oh yes, and of course, the tsundere(worst type of dere) scenes were fine as usual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\\n\r\nOur cast revolves around some pretty cliche characters. A tsun, the 'best friend' character, shy, awkward MC, the 'moe' character, etc. They have some heavy 2D personalities, no real character development, but I mean, the only reason character isnt rated any lower is because of my man, Uehara. Oh, what a lovable bro character. I'm not even a fujoshi, but I hardcore ship him and the MC. Ah yes, I can see the doujins rolling out, the DOUJINS RO-sorry, where was I? The characters are 'ok' likable, and from what I've seen, the MC does get quite the amount of hate. (Hes pretty annoying tbh)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nMeh, sometimes an anime doesn't even have to be good to enjoy it. You see some people rating things like Konosuba a 5 because there's no story. Like, did you seriously watch konosuba for the story? I personally enjoyed Gamers! a lot so far, hopefully it doesn't dissapoint me. (I have shit taste, I enjoyed Eromanga for the first 4 eps too)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n\r\nSo far so good. Just so you know, 6 isn't a bad rating, so before you stampede into my profile comments, I'd just like to say, I ENJOYED IT, DON'T HATE ON ME PLS. (why am i even writing this part, nobody loves me enough to try to interact with me verbally)",

The anime is really about him liking this girl who is WAYYYYYYY out of his league. I'm talking big time, as he is on Earth and she is in Narnia, like man don't even try. But he does and this whole anime goes with thegroup he joins, well creates and it's really funny! Many misunderstandings but done right! Not cliche like \"Oh no you walked in on me having my hand on this girls chest, no it's not what it looks like...\" But real in world teenage problems and how teenagers would see simple things and go total overboard. Don't lie, we were once all and most still, we act like that ahahaha\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing special here, just you run of the mill clean cut art. Imagine any modern day HD anime set in a school and bam! THE DIRT IS GONE! Wait... Sorry... Bam! That's your art style!\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nReally good! You can totally relate to them! They're fun and all but where they shine is how they're different in many ways but around one certain thing the main character does, brings them all together. It's a true friendship! I also like how the friend of the main character becomes his friend, it's really nice!\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWant a Dub, Comedy, High School, Harem (Aspects), Games and a really chill anime to wind down your weekend arvo because we have jobs WHICH BREAK US DOWN AND WE STRUGGLE AND THE WEEKENDS ARE THE ONLY TIME WE HAVE TO OURSEL....

            "content": "This show is so much smarter and funnier than it has any right to be. It's got the same premise as a million other clich\u00e9 romantic comedies, this time with the gimmick that it's about a loser gamer otaku to justify all the idiotic things he does, as well as endear itself to a niche that will appreciate the game references (not that you necessarily need to understand them to appreciate the rest of the show, this show is about people, not games), but what sets it apart is it knows how clich\u00e9 it is and goes out of its way to surpass your expectations,or annihilate them. The show relies heavily on misunderstandings to move the plot along, and it flaunts this in your face like a proud toddler. Whenever something clich\u00e9 happens, it's treated as satire, dialing everything up to 11 in such an absurd way you are usually too busy laughing at the reaction faces or trying to piece together how this will affect the rest of the cast to care that they are completely unapologetic about their clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nIt's \"affects the rest of the cast\" part that makes the show feel different though, because there's so much more going on than there would be if this were a generic harem anime. First of all, the show doesn't revolve around the loser main character, a lot of Amano's importance in the plot is how he affects things that don't even really have to do with him. What's more, things do get affected, this isn't the kind of show that resets at the end of every episode, the characters all have dynamic relationships that change and evolve every single episode. You need to think to keep up, but it gives you plenty to think about while assaulting you with hilarious gag after hilarious gag. In this way, despite being incredibly clich\u00e9, you really don't have a clue what's going to happen, because they could pull pretty much anything and it would be in keeping with the tone of the show up to this point.\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, I did find 2 episodes noteworthily unfunny, the pool episode, and the final episode. The writers managed to make so many clich\u00e9s hilarious to me, but cheap fan service was not one of them, and the two episodes that featured it all more or less bored me. You might as well stop watching the show after episode 11, episode 12 did nothing to enhance the rest of the show besides a single hilarious scene featuring a side character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, still an absolutely hilarious show, probably my favorite anime of the season and worth checking out if you want a good time.",

I won't really go too into detail (no heavy spoilers, either) and I'll try to keep it short, but Gamers! was a sad mess. Sad in the disappointing way.\r\nThe plot was interesting in the beginning. The anime started out seemingly strong and appeared to me like it was going to be different than most clich\u00e9 anime we see nowadays. The characters seemed strong as well. It was funny and emotional when need be, but about halfway in, everything collapsed and became a giantmess of misunderstandings atop misunderstandings to the point where it wasn't funny anymore, especially considering how these understandings were so ridiculous and could've easily been solved in the first few episodes. The humor had died out and all that was left was frustration and me hoping the episode would just end. The whole plot, or what was left of what seemed to be a plot, fell into itself and hardly had anything to do with what was going on anymore. Each character slowly faded and it just became a jumbled mess that wasn't entertaining. The quality of this anime slowly died out each episode, and that's the sad, disappointing thing about Gamers!\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing was just wasted potential, in my opinion. There's tons of anime out there under the same genres as Gamers! that aren't as unsatisfactory as this one. Mediocre, at best.",

However there hasn't been a show in a while that has vexed me to this extent.\r\nLet's begin with the premise. Regardless of what the synopsis sais, this isn't about gamers, this is about teenagers in love. I know, not original, but it's also pretty much what every anime is about these days anyway. There are four characters that all have some kind of relationship with the main character, wether it be friends or crushes. The fact that most of these characters aregamers is only established in the first episode, and is quickly set aside for the rest of the series. In addition all of these characters have stereotypical personalities for the single purpose of some comedic gags/skits that often fall flat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat moves this shows premise along is just a series of misunderstandings and convoluted omissions, that could easily be resolved if any of the characters had any kind of common sense. Even when two or more characters are discussing the very topic that has been misunderstood, they arbitrarily refuse to mention the one fact that could resolve the matter at hand. This is lazy storytelling, it's trite and unimaginative.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough they introduce more characters eventually, with the express purpose of distracting the viewer from the previous issues, by creating more convoluted situations without resolving the previous matters. An analogy that comes to mind would be that this show is like a drawer you used to store cables in, you keep adding more and more cables in there and they keep getting tangled up, so the viewer is just stuck trying to untangle the massive amounts of cables. It's not fun, it's just frustrating and it never ends.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other aspect of the show is average at best, the art is mediocre and the music is inoffensive. There is no redeeming factor for this show that pushes it above an average score. It uses the premise that the characters are gamers to bait in gullible viewers, but none of the scenarios or the characters are really relateable if you are a gamer.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score is 4/10, because despite every other aspect of the show being average, the story progression itself is just frustrating and unbelievable, and drags the score further down.",

The anime started off very promising with actually showing us some gaming to help build up a storyline but after about episode 3 all of that goes away and becomes your standard/substandard rom-com(i love rom-coms but this ones not even funny). It basically delves more into the characters romantic relationships in what eventually becomes a love pentagon (not a triangle but a pentagon) all due to very easily solvable misunderstandings that could be fixed ifthe characters literally just talked to each other. When the misunderstandings between them cause drama for an episode or 2 i was willing to accept it as some light comedy until the misunderstandings literally engulf the entirety of the show lasting for 4+episodes.  Essentially this anime plays to the lowest common denominator of anime fans in that it has solely relied on the same 2 misunderstandings between character relationships to play off its comedy for 4+ eps which has gotten really annoying and stale. I say this because after episode 3 all the episodes are exactly the same, same setting,same drama, same comedy bits as if they literally just copy and pasted. Overall i had very high hopes for this anime based off the first few episodes but at this point i feel extremely cheated out of what initially had a lot of potential.Like imagine buying a cute puppy only for it to grow up into a rabies riddled monster that bites off 2 of your fingers even though you gave it all your love (thats this anime). I mean the writers aren't even trying anymore i don't know what else to say this is the only anime i've ever given  a 4/10 for and i'm being super generous. (keep in mind the other reviews are only so high because they've only seen 3-4 episodes which is the turning point for when the anime goes very very downhill)",

I came across Gamers while looking at the summer anime list and once I came across the genre \"Romance\" and \"Comedy\" I knew I had to check it out and I'm glad I did. \r\nStory 8/10:\r\nThe story isn't special. It's about a gamer kid who loves games so much that he attracts the attention of the hottest gamer girl in school and gets asked to join her gamer club which he hilariously declines. This rejection ultimately allows the main MC to make new friends and the start of misunderstandings happens from thereafter. Trust me, the story isn't really interesting but that'snot the strong suit to this anime, it's the character interactions. Many of the characters have some relation to each other, some characters have a crush on each other, some characters believe that another characters likes someone else, and some characters think that other characters hate themselves and with this spider web of misunderstandings, it opens up the hilarious premise of trying to solve everyone's misunderstandings with more misunderstandings. Honestly if you like stupid funny this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art really isn't special BUT the strong point to the art are the faces that the characters make. You can easily tell how a character is feeling and the drawings are a bit exaggerated to give it that funny element. Overall, art is solid.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nSound is solid. I like the opening, it's cute and well made. The voice casting of the characters are also solid. I like the main MC's voice as well the girl. It suits them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nI like the characters. None of them are specifically annoying and all of them are quite likable. There is never a moment when a character shows up and I begin to despise their existence. The character personalities are what make up this anime as they are all dumb in their own way so because I like the misunderstanding aspect of this anime I give the characters a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a light hearted enjoyable anime to watch. Trust me it isn't about games but GAMERS and boy is it hilarious. This show is relatable but in an exaggerated sense and the characters are delightful. If you like a romcom with a bunch of laughs and giggles Gamers is the anime for you.",

It's the type of factors that I look for in a cheery anime. It's also precisely the reason why I felt pretty frustrated watching Gamers!, like what a programmer would feel trying to fix an annoying bug among hundreds or thousands of lines of codes.\r\nThe story is basically a hit-or-miss and fluctuated at each differing episode. Having gamers as the main characters with a story of relationship dramas revolving around misunderstandings and teen insecurities is the summary.Glitchy I'd say. While it seemed to be a clich\u00e9d premise, for mindless rom-coms like Gamers!, it could had worked better if not for the contrived attempt in delivering humor, an integral part in the heart of what every rom-coms should successfully offer to the audience. So, what comes out of these failed running gags that didn't appeal much to me? It's the stupidity of the characters. It can be an entertaining element but that depends on the episode's plot. One episode had me laughing to tears while the others had me facepalming myself. The reasonings on their actions were random, which seemed like it's what the creators were trying to achieve but at least try to make it feel more natural or creative because they won't come across as fun baka characters. Other than that, I did actually adored some of their other ridiculous personalities leaving their stupidness aside. Combined together, they were quite an appealing cast, even sweet at times when games came into play. Them playing and talking about the games together, such as the culture, were pretty fun to watch and reminded me of my younger days when I was still a competitive gamer. Sadly, the given time slot didn't deliver a balanced story, focusing more on their acts of haphazard interpretations in their romance life. But the games and a couple of hilarious moments, which I admit did stemmed from their dumbness, were definitely the most enjoyable factor of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals didn't suffered much compared to the previous aspects. Some shots had a clumsy feel to it, particularly in the line work, but it didn't take away much from the main tone. Using a colorful setting engaged the silliness of this anime which it managed to portray. As for the character expressions, it said a lot about their personalities so what I felt about them can be traced back to the writing. For the most part, they were cute but depending on the scene, they were quite irritating too. In the most amusing scenes, the way they expressed their comical reactions had a strong impact on making me laugh. Colorfulness also blended in with the character designs too, and most of them boast an outer look in the side of attractiveness. Their exaggerative actions were livened up by the animation, which was not in the level of a masterpiece but not too shoddy either as it worked with the tone of the anime. I also liked the other bits of pieces that stood the anime out slightly more such as the use of game-like sound effects, making everything more fun. The text pop-ups that appeared occasionally also molded in a bouncy atmosphere. While the loud voice-acting did fit the aura of the characters, it's a sometimes situation of getting on my nerves and being an entertainment. Music-wise, the upbeat soundtracks matched the energetic nature, along with the complementary quality of the catchy OP and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nGamers! was a rollercoaster ride that was too bumpy to really get any satisfying enjoyment. By no means is it a horrible show but it's a weird one as I can be fully enjoying at one moment but completely be irked by some other scene. Well, this adventure was an interesting one but I'll go and turn off my gaming device for now. It's game over after all.",

Of course games! This might be an anime where characters are gamers and they would play and explore different kinds of games. Or maybe they are ought to compete with other gamers using their expertise on games. But it's not. This is really just a school romance comedy anime. \r\nThe first episode really caught my interest since itshows the different types of gamers and what games they are good with. But as I continued the second and then to next episodes, it became bad and painful to watch. My expectations were ruined but I did consider the theme of the anime in which \"loving games and enjoying yourself on playing games is the best thing as a gamer\" so I could continue. But the hell, the characters just kept on talking and spouting their ideals and perceptions on games and it became a source of conflict which is kind of annoying. But the most annoying part here are the misunderstandings of the characters. Characters are so dense and stupid and small things became a big thing. It was so annoying when you're watching like you wanted to throw the remote control on their faces but you can't because your TV might broke.  I kinda dislike the characters here, a plain and dense hero, Mary Sue heroine and annoying supporting characters. There are other supporting characters there who are way better but you won't get to see them often in the series and I'm kinda disappointed with that. \\n\\n\r\nSo this anime just typically depicts the lives of teenagers in their adolescent days. Kind of cliche but it's a gamer teen version. I did not enjoy this really so if you're looking for an anime wich really uses games as a plot and not just talk about games, then don't watch this. \\n",

            "content": "You know how in a lot of generic rom-com anime the main character is a bumbling idiot when it comes to love? Well imagine instead if every character in the show was like that, that is this anime. Also, the show could've honestly been about anything, what's more so driving is their passion, unlike shows like SAO or Hi-Score Girl where actual gaming was an integral part of the show, this show the characters just sorta like games, but honestly there's nothing wrong with that, it makes for a fantastic opening animation. I would say that the strongest feature of this anime is the unpredictability,it's legitimately difficult to guess what will happen next because everyone is an idiot, and while most of the characters are just the generic archetypes you expect from any rom-com the interactions with each other remain highly entertaining. It's a fun watch and a perfect filler anime if you're not looking for something you have to invest in, but rather just a fun watch.",

Chiaki at first mainly becomes a rival to Amano when it comes to gaming opinions, but she becomes a much more interesting character when she discover's he is her secret playmate on a game they play and seeing her trying to decide whether she should go after him was an interesting development for her character.\\n\r\nTasuku Uehara is someone who used to be like Amano till he changed his ways, in some ways he is a bit of a schemer since he tries to help out Amano and Chiaki from time to time, which tend to backfire on him as it makes his girlfriend suspicious, yet somehow he still manages to get himself out of the situation.....well mostly.\\n\r\nAguri is Tasuku's girlfriend, she was a surprising character, because despite being the jealous and worried type she really makes a lot of good points throughout the show making her seem like the smartest one there even though she's just basing everything off her love for Tasuku, but I feel like her role in all of this wasn't really that much, other than helping Amano and making the love shape situation even bigger.\\n\r\nKonoha Hoshinomori is Chiaki's sister, despite being introduced later on in the show, Konoha was pretty damn funny, ranging from her uncontrollable sexual desire to play erotic girl games to having a Tsundere personality made her a ball of laughter to have around despite her short screentime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style wasn't exactly mesmerising, the characters design's were ok I guess, I think the only thing that stood out for me was the recreations of games in the anime itself which were pretty good recreations if I'm being honest, but other than that it felt like another generic looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the op credit for feeling like the show is about gaming, which it really isn't in most cases and it was pretty catchy, but the ed didn't do much for me and I can barely remember the soundtrack so yeah, at least the op was alright.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this series was pretty much the forefront of it all, because for an anime that has Gamers in it there would be a gaming genre in there, but no instead it decides to be a Romance and even then it was a confusing one, because all of the characters keep having suspicions about each other forming one big love shape, until one of the characters confesses his feelings and then the situation changed, however at the same time it didn't, the characters still had doubts about each other and it just made the show a little annoying to watch until it was all finally worked out well apart from a few things.\\n\r\nI thought the comedy was hit and miss, sure there were some surprises and Konoha was absolutely hilarious alongside Karen who's character surprised me a little, but most of the jokes were revolved around the whole love shape, so some of the jokes just didn't stick with me and felt off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall despite the awkward romance situation and lack of gaming in general, this show still had some good points and had me watching till the end, however I don't really want another season of this even though there is still some things that haven't been concluded yet.",

And Gamers! definitely is one of those shows but it still manages to set itself apart. And that's because studio Pine Jam, understands what makes Rom Com's entertaining instead of just copy pasting stuff from other popular shows verbatim.\r\nUnlike most shows that use misunderstandings to unnecessarily to extent the plot, Gamers! uses it as it's main driving force. Almost every single moment will be misconstrued without fail, leading to utterly hilarious hijinx.\r\nAnother reason why this show stands outis because of how it treats it's subject matter. Gamers!, surprise surprise is actually about people who enjoy video games and the different ways they experience it as a medium. The show constantly takes this to heart, resulting in nuances such as how every member of the principal cast treats games differently but all the actual video gamers treat it as a matter of life or death in their own way, the dumb reasons that are behind the name of the character's avatars and how the character's actually play actual real world video games as well as games that are blatantly referencing other popular games, or how the cliche scene where the female cast members are jealous of each other's figure actually consists of a heated debate about the joy of difficult video games.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not revolutionary the main cast of Gamers! manage to have good chemistry between each other. Which helps make the fact that most of the plot being someone suspecting another for cheating a bit more believable.\\n\\n\r\nGamers! is not a revolutionary show. Nor is it something you go out to watch. But if you are a person who is a bit too invested into video games (like me, if the review didn't make it obvious) or are willing to follow a group of dumb teenagers doing dumb things you might find yourself having a good time.\\n",

            "content": "BuzzFeed presents: You Won't Believe What Happened To These Gamers!\r\nThis show is a giant click bait and I feel cheated having watched it. Spoilers ahead because its common courtesy to expose clickbait.\r\nGamers! is your stereotypical love-polygon in which misunderstandings, a mysterious childhood friend, and a perfect blonde girl gets you real frustrated because you're tired of watching people blush and apologize for 10 episodes.\r\nThere is actually almost nothing to do with video games. In fact, there are probably only 15 minutes of video game screen time in the 12 episode series, and 10 of the 15 are from the OP playing 11 times.\r\nLet's talk aboutthe OP. After finding this show and thinking it was about gaming from reading the title (lmao), I watched the OP and saw House of the Dead, PUBG, Smash Bros, Street Fighter, PopnMusic, and some other hype shit. \"There's no way this show can't be about games,\" I had thought after confirming by watching the OP. AYY LMAO.\\n\\n\r\nThen the show baits you in with episode 1, in which the stereotypical antisocial loser MC gets invited to play in his schools esports club with the school idol who happens to be 200 IQ, 10k MMR, Challenger, Grandmaster, Global Elite. It also introduces you to secondary characters who are interesting in their own right by being hyped as some of the best in the world at their respective games.\\n\\n\r\nBut unfortunately, the MC declines the offer and instead the show does a 720 and moonwalks backwards into a terribly written love dodecahedron in which video games are never to be heard of again. Suddenly, the esports club and its members cease to exist and the clips of the characters playing CSGO, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena are like a fever dream you can't really believe existed.\\n\\n\r\nThis show baits you hard and takes you on a rollercoaster ride where it feels like the show is trying its hardest to eat up time and make up dumb ways for the love dodrangle to grow even more complicated. You get this feeling of \"Its okay, this will end soon- I enjoyed Haruhi S2 even with Endless Eight in it,\" and you push into each episode only to be let down with the Endless Eleven. The show continually mocks you with the splash screen that plays before and after the commercial breaks- provocative pictures of a game controller and a PS4; surely there will be an actual video game related plot with all this teasing, right?\\n\\n\r\nThen you reach the end of episode 10 and then realize its too late. Episode 11 will inevitably be a continuation of the hokey pokey and the kids will turn themselves around. That's what it's all about. Then that leaves only episode 12 to continue/conclude/start(?) the plot, which of course is way too goddamn short a time to achieve anything significant.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the start of episode 12 starts to blow you away because suddenly it has to do with esports again and it brings back one of the beloved cool kids and the- nope, never mind. It's like after doing the 720 they decided to do another revolution and make it a 1080 to break the world record and redeem themselves, but right as they landed they ate shit and slid down a mountain. Episode 12 is a disaster in its own right. The main focus of episode 12 is to convince the main characters, and essentially the viewer, that gaming is a waste of time and money. Can you believe this shit. Even if what they say is true, keep in mind you have been praying to every deity you can think of that this show will start talking about video games and once they actually do, they tell you that your hobby sucks. The worst part is that the characters are actually thoroughly convinced until the last 2 minutes of the episode/season/plot when they realize that actually its not a waste of time and money because it just isn't.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I am not just giving this a poor review because I dislike romcoms or love-polygons, or anything like that. I am giving this a poor review because it really truly sucks. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no story or deeper exposition that this show ever starts or concludes, probably because they trashed all the world building done in episode 1. It seriously feels like a waste and almost makes you wonder why they even bothered building anything up to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are so basic and characters look like background characters from other high school animes- you almost wonder if this show is a gaiden for the unnamed characters from an actually decent high school series. Another big gripe is one of the characters is literally named Ugly and her hair is pink with brown roots, making it look like someone dropped a deuce on her head.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality varies wildly, and sometimes it seems like characters are the wrong size, their bodies are not in the right plane of existence with the backgrounds, and many times you will a shift in drawing/animation styles as if each scene was made by a completely different company. The last bit may or may not be a problem because the end of episode 11 actually seemed very reminiscent of ~2010 gainax which was neato.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is so forgettable I don't even remember if there's background music at all. The only thing I can remember is a short jingle that plays during the commercial splash screens.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, if you came to this show hoping for some semblance of a video game anime, just watch the OP, episode 1, and episode 12. You will miss absolutely nothing skipping the middle 10 episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime that starts very good but finish very bad is very sad. Notice that I used the word \"very\" 3 times, that's the evidence of my disappointment to this show.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nPlot? What plot? The story centered around Amano Keita, who is our typical lonely otaku but ofcourse despite being a loser, the most beautiful girl in their school, Tendou Karen developed a love for him. How? I don't know. It's just to sudden. Do love really works that way? And ofcourse Keita ignored that. Why? Because he is a otaku. Episode 1 is good, but later on, each episode is nothing but cringe. The potentialof the starting episode immediately flushed to the toilet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter design is unoriginal. Bland and too simple. All of them is so plain except Hoshinomori Chiaki Some animated scenes are very bad. Sometimes, their movement are smooth at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nIts surprisingly above average for me. Voice actress did a good job. OP and ED song are nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nAverage. 90% of screentime centered around our 5 main characters. Supporting cast is useless. Keita is also dumb as f---. Tendou is autistic. The only one who is fix is Uehara. Chiaki is also lovely. Her sister Konoha is also fine. Her body is...., fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nIt was a decent ride. It is just so sad that the later episode became to boring. Force drama is annoying. The love triangle is stupid. Comedic scenes are korny. I would have more fun if this anime is an ecchi. Atleast there is a thing to look forward for. There is a unexpected pantsu shot on episode 3 but after that, zero. The final episode had some awesome hot spring bath scene though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nPoor. Avoid this anime but if you are looking for some cheap entertainment, this might works for you.",

            "content": "The stereotypical gamer is an anti-social closet hermit who obsesses over leveling up their avatars and staying far away from social activity as much as possible.\u00a0 To poke fun at this stereotypical concept, we have Gamers!, a show supposedly about gamers and the kind of comedy that happens when they're put in a romcom situation.\r\nStory:\r\nBased on a light novel of the same name, Gamers! tells the story of a boy named Amano Keita with his life flipped upside down as the school idol Tendou Karen notices his dedication as a gamer and offers him a spot in the gaming club where she and several upperclassmenspend their afterschool hours practicing competitive gaming, using the prize money to improve and expand their clubroom with more trophies and better equipment.\u00a0 He rejects her offer and thus begins the romantic comedy involving these two adorably stupid gamers.\u00a0 If I said that was the plot, well I would by lying.\u00a0 Or at least...half lying.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality, Gamers! is the anime equivalent of a Bethesda game; you really want to enjoy it, but at the same time, it's riddled with a lot of bugs and ends up making the overall experience somewhat infuriating.\u00a0 The entire show spends its runtime focused on its five main characters as their relationships are tested because each character manages to find some way somehow to misunderstand every little detail and create their own headcanon for what's going on with everyone else but them.\u00a0 Of course it's done in a comedic sense, as it's all exaggerated and no one talks to each other in and attempt to clear up the problem because that would be too easy.\\n\\n\r\nThe upside to that is the fact that the show sucks you in with wanting to know what's going to happen next whether you want to or not.\u00a0 Cliffhangers are commonplace, and there are a couple of moments where the episode ends on such a dramatic note that makes you want to continue watching just to see what kind of result such a fuck up creates.\u00a0 Despite that, the cliffhangers aren't necessarily a good thing for this show.\u00a0 Each successive episode only feeds into the spiraling vortex of misunderstandings that at some points makes it really hard to tell if what's happening is going to end well for anyone.\u00a0 It's this kind of storytelling that turn the show's comedy into something of a niche, as personally I felt aggravated seeing what had transpire while I've spoken to others who like the show for what it displays.\\n\\n\r\nWhile certainly not a show that's actually about gamers (sure the characters are gamers, but that aspect is only touched on in their personalities rather than the storyline), Gamers! is a show that entertains by making as many things go wrong as it possibly can.\u00a0 Its story is certainly unique in that aspect, and more or less seems to fix up a majority of the characters' misconceptions and problems by the end of the series.\u00a0 So at least that headache is gone.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that oddly enough, the throwaway episode is of better quality than the rest of the series despite it being a DLC episode that actually talks (somewhat) about gamer mentality.\u00a0 I just find that...odd.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Stays consistent with its story\\n\r\n+ Throwaway episode somehow much better than the actual plot\\n\r\n+/-\u00a0 Pure misunderstanding comedy (depends on your taste in comedy)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSince the show's about gamers, let's talk about gamers.\\n\\n\r\nAmano Keita is...not that interesting.\u00a0 An avid casual gamer that looks like a generically designed male protagonist, Keita's character is probably the most uninteresting member of the cast despite being the protagonist.\u00a0 His main quality aside from really liking games is being an anti-social shut-in who can't fathom how to manage being more than what he already is.\u00a0 My main problem with him is how he shows quite a bit of promise as the main character due to his decisions in the early episodes at the beginning, but ends up becoming nothing more than a stand-in protagonist that does little to nothing to drive the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tendou Karen, the supposed main female protagonist of the show.\u00a0 With the early episodes showing her falling from grace due to Keita's initial refusal, Karen eventually becomes a lovesick girl being too shy to fully admit her true feelings.\u00a0 The initial promise for development is very clear, but the show outright refuses to use her.\u00a0 Along the way, the show basically shoves Karen to the sidelines, focusing on a different girl entirely as largely the show's main focus.\u00a0 In truth, Karen never gets the attention or development she deserves, and kind of makes the whole resolution at the end of the show meaningless because most of the time, both Keita and Karen aren't even in the same room.\u00a0 It's weird that the show basically refused to use her, and I really wish that wasn't the case because there was potential with how Keita as a casual gamer affected her thoughts on gaming as a competitive gamer.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Hoshinomori Chiaki.\u00a0 When I said another girl takes the spotlight, this is her.\u00a0 Personally, I attribute a lot of the show's problems to Chiaki, as not only does her involvement create the first set of grave misunderstandings that make up the show's plot, but the entire second half is devoted to contrived feelings for Keita, who many times the show has attempted to convince the audience THAT SHE HATES.\u00a0 The show puts so much focus on her that it shoves everything else to the side and makes her the star of the show as unlikable as that is due to the entire flip of who the show was about at the beginning.\u00a0 She also has a 'repeat phrase ending' where she says 'des des' or phrases of the sort every time she talks in an attempt to be cute.\u00a0 It's not.\\n\\n\r\nThen finally, there's the couple of Tasuku and Aguri.\u00a0 Can I just ask why the show makes such an attempt to crash and burn their relationship?\u00a0 Initially, we're treated to a sweet story of a girl and a boy falling in love as an explanation to their relationship.\u00a0 So why exactly does the entire series feel the need to have these two running in circles as well trying to find out if one is cheating on the other?\u00a0 It's something about this show that I really didn't understand and I honestly felt sorry sometimes cause what we could've gotten would've been sweet.\u00a0 Instead we get this sour storm of misunderstandings that I wouldn't have attributed to a couple who've been dating for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe only side character that's worth mentioning is Konoha, Chiaki's little sister.\u00a0 She only appears in the later episodes and is really just a supplement to Chiaki's character to add to the overall misunderstanding, so she's not really anything that important to note.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Initially good characterstics\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Later bad characteristics\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Pine Jam, the art for Gamers! is nothing too special.\u00a0 Indeed the quality is good, and the light color palette adds to the show's lightheartedness (supposedly), but not many things about the show is truly 'outstanding.'\\n\\n\r\nTrue there are stills in the show that do have higher production than the rest of the show (like the neon transition cards and the really nice illustrated end cards), but the overall quality of Gamers! isn't something to write much home about.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, but not outstanding art\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \"GAMERS!\" (how fitting) is what you'd expect from a lighthearted (supposedly) comedy show.\u00a0 It's a bright, poppy beat sung by the series's three main female seiyuus\u00a0 that, without the aspect of gaming, would be not memorable in the slightest.\u00a0 But with added retro gaming sounds mixed into the tune as well as visuals referencing a multitude of genres and games from retro to modern (is that a motherfuckin' PUBG reference?), the song ends up being a fun experience while watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nIts ED, \"Fight on!\" however is a slightly less energetic version of its OP sung by\u00a0Luce Twinkle Wink\u2606.\u00a0 Sure the song is ok, but it doesn't really have a memorable quality or aspect to it to make it unique or anything worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fun and memorable OP (relatively speaking)\\n\r\n-\u00a0 ED isn't that memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nInitially I thought that Gamers! was going to be my anime of the season.\u00a0 Its early episodes were fun, Karen was an endearing character due to her new lovesick nature, and it had a charm to it that had me anticipating every new episode.\u00a0 And now...I want my money back.\u00a0 I got so annoyed by this show and how the characters wanted to try and figure out and/or prove what they thought the other party was doing.\u00a0 You know you could just...I don't know, TALK TO EACH OTHER.\u00a0 It got to the point that I was on the edge of my seat praying that things wouldn't get worse than they already were.\u00a0 The ending was...(episode 11) I guess satisfactory enough to resolve things, but not enough to compensate for the gray hairs I sprouted from the stress at watching these characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nKaren.\u00a0 Karen being a character I liked was one of the few things that kept me going.\u00a0 Indeed she didn't get the attention she deserved, but out of everyone, she seemed to have the least amount of misconceptions out of the whole group and seemed to actually have interesting potential, as unfulfilled as that was.\u00a0 Also Aguri's love story.\u00a0 That was genuinely sweet.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nChiaki.\u00a0 Hate this girl.\u00a0 It's less so the fact that her character is why the show plummeted (although she did make a large contribution and I don't like her for that), but more on the fact that her introduction started the chain reaction of misunderstandings that the series is famous for.\u00a0 So I guess it's not all her fault, it's only some of her fault.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, unless you like to see misunderstandings in anime, do not watch this.\u00a0 The comedy factor that encompasses this show is niche, and not being a part of that niche will subjectively make you despise or at the very least not like this show.\u00a0 Personally I hoped that Gamers! would've been something else, but I guess not everything is like what you see on the box.",

            "content": "Conflicts come after another, which is why i\u2019m not mad at this series for being what it\u2019s supposed to be: an anime full of misunderstandings.\r\nGamers is an anime that involved modern gamers who are put into situations that sends some sort of misunderstanding to each characters. It\u2019s a RomCom SOL series where the conflicts and problems never stop. Once one problem gets solved, another one rises up. Sure it can get frustrated, but that\u2019s what this anime is, which is an anime full of conflicts.\r\nTo me, I fairly enjoyed the anime not as a story driven series with amazing plot, but for the characters themselves.Interestingly enough, I love each character. I love their personality and they way they interact with one another. So much chemistry is present when some talk to each that it\u2019s genuinely a good friendship. The only reason I might find them annoying is because they\u2019re put into a misunderstanding situation.  One thing I don\u2019t like though is how Karen become sort of...non present in the series. She hasn\u2019t gotten as much shine as I wanted her to. She seemed like a main character at the beginning. But after things were said and done, she practically became a non-existent side character. Even with that short amount of time I felt like she was still an ok developed character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance is lacking as it should be considering this was mostly a Comedy. It's not like the Romance was supposedly a big thing. But the vibe is still there.\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't anything too special, but I enjoyed the OP and ED a lot. The insert songs are pretty great and the appropriate usage of some of the soundtracks make it all the more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation isn't much. I do enjoy the character design and the animation is fair enough to enjoy it as much as I did. It isn't great nor is it \u201cbad\u201d. But it was at the acceptable level that I was fine with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus like I said is on misunderstandings involving our characters. I understand that it might get annoying at some points and will leave u just at a blank face, but I for one didn't find it all too annoying or just troublesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gamers is definitely not a show for everyone. It really will piss some people off and that's understandable. If you want something Romance focused, you can watch this, but don't come in with high expectations regarding that topic. However, if u want a lot of misunderstandings and comedy along with it, this series may be for you. Gamers don't really focus on the Gaming aspect at the end of it all, more like the people behind the controller and their daily lives regarding love and conflicts. It still was pretty enjoyable, although flawed, I was satisfied and had a good time. \\n",

            "content": "I get why a lot of people won't like this anime and why would they gave bad notes and such. First is the people create hype about what are they going to see, they expect a different anime. And that's because it sounds (and actually starts) as an interesting premise of modern gaming and a club of pro gamers. That would get the attention of a lot of different people, and a lot of them will find themselves disappointed about the actual premise of the series: a romance comedy with a small touch about videogames.\r\nAfter saying that, let's start with the actual review. \r\nSTORY-    7\\n\r\nThe story as a romance comedy is not outstanding, but it does the job. \\n\\n\r\nART    -    8\\n\r\nThe art is really well done, and the reactions in the faces of the characters are great too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND    -    8\\n\r\nThe music is good, it has some nice touches of videogame music here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER    -    6\\n\r\nThe series follow 5 characters, which form a romantic triangle and a couple that doesn't quite trust each other but still like the other. The small difference with other series is that the majority of the characters are gamers that love games in their own way. This is something that could have been done better, in my opinion their personalities could have more work.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT    -    10\\n\r\nAs usual it has the typical misunderstandings between the characters, this is the point that could be the reason of the love or the hate for the series. The misunderstandings are insane, they are really crazy, and the way the characters react make it really funny, by them being unable of clearing the misunderstandings as normal people, and talking but taking conclusions from what they see. This is the second reason why people might wont like the series, but for me it just adds to the charms, it's so irreal it's amazing, I love it!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL    -    9\\n\r\nFor me this series are a good example that if the parts aren't that great, in the end, what matters is the final product. The enjoyment I have for this series might be a little bit to high, but I cant do nothing about it, I love it! =D, every new chapter made me laugh and it made my day, and that's not something everything does. But I will also repeat, I totally get why people wouldn't like this anime. In the end, it's just my silly personal opinion,  I hope that if you watch it you love it as much as I did =D.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, but there were some things I really needed to say about Gamers!",

The MC areused as an experimental object where  their body are reverted to their young days with the help of some drug and forced to join high school again.\\n\\n\r\nGamers. Is it about a lifestyle of a pro-player in their competitive world? Or is it about some people who spends their days studying game? Or maybe any random story with game as the main story?\\n\\n\r\nNO. None of them. It's about some high school students with their misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\n\"Misunderstanding? What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\r\nEvery main character in this series can't communicate as a normal human being and ends up with some random and stupid misunderstanding which can be resolved IF ONLY they talk to each other instead of keeping their thought to themselves.\\n\\n\r\n\"What, really? But it can't be that bad, right? There's must be some kind of gaming element in it, right?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe black-haired boy is just a student who plays games very casually.\\n\r\nThe blonde-girl is a part of a gaming club which only explained in the early episode and never came back to the story again.\\n\r\nThe black-haired girl is a game developer but how is she developing her games is never explained. At least until episode 5 where i dropped this show.\\n\r\nThe brown-haired and his girlfriend are not even a gamer! Well, at least the boy used to be a gamer.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i'm not sure if these are enough to make a story called Gamers.\\n\\n\r\n\"Then where did that Gamers name came from?\"\\n\\n\r\nI think because the main characters in this story happen to love playing games. That's it.\\n\\n\r\n\"The fuck..\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, indeed. The fuck.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting a show with Gamer or at least Game as the main story, don't watch this one. You'll be disappointed. A lot.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr There's no Game or Gamer in this show. Just a forced and retarded romcom. If only this show is called \"Misunderstanding\", i'll shut my mouth since it fits the story.",

Everyone has a fair amount of screentime,yes but all they do is complain about their delusions on their crushes, we never really get to know their whole personalities and such. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the way it ended... made me tremble in anger how this whole anime is about fuzzy relationships and delusions and yet, they never fixed literally ANYTHING in the end. Please do not watch this, it's an anime that aren't aware of it's own genre. First it's about gaming then it's about miscommunications then it ended with nothing as if it's a storyless slice of life.

Or perhaps watch an anime about the lives of professional gamers? If you do, then I recommend you turn around and leave this page as soon as possible and never consider watching this show. \r\nThis show is for all the gamers out there. Now I know what you're thinking and no, not the ones who actually play games, that'd be stupid. This show is for the people who like gaming references while watching a bad romantic comedy. Don't worry, they don't justmake references, they tell each other how much they like playing games, so you know they are true gamers! They have transitions with gaming music while showing a girl holding a controller; HELL YEAH, that is how I know she's a gamer. They even use game lingo when they talk to each other, a key feature that only the truest of gamers possess. Now if you\u2019re still interested in watching this for the romcom aspect, I implore you to reconsider and I will explain why. \\n\\n\r\nThe only comedy in this show is the laugh you have when you wonder how this show ever came about. You\u2019ll laugh at the poor plot if you already recovered from your cringing. To avoid spoiling (like it matters), all I\u2019ll say is that the \u201cm\u201d in gamers stands for \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d; there are a shit ton of them. If you have a functioning brain, you should never come to any of the misunderstandings and conclusions some of these characters reach. I honestly believe the author never attended high school and is just assuming this is how a high school drama is. It honestly hurts me when I try to contemplate how they even came to some of these conclusions. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I will say that if you enjoy a good cringe (cause you\u2019ll be cringing a lot, I will warn you that your face may contort with the ungodly amount of cringing), you\u2019ll enjoy this show. While watching I do recommend you turn your brain off to avoid damaging it during the show. Now I got to go play some games to show everyone that I AM A TRUE GAMER! See you later gamer BROS!\\n",

The character design itself (visually) is appealing albeit predictable. The characters in general are mediocre at best.\r\nThe only saving grace is that some of the characters have a moderately cute personality, so you end up rooting for them. Alas, due to thelack of progression, this doesn't matter anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI personally did not enjoy this series at all. There are about two points where the story progressed in one way or another. For the rest of the show you're stuck in an odd sort of limbo, just waiting for something to happen. This feels a lot like watching paint dry. I found myself to struggle sitting through the last episode, but not dropping it since I was hoping for some form of closure or final stride forward. This too was denied.",

The jokes are funny, even if they tend to repeat themselves (kinda gets old after the eighth episode). However, the \"plot twist\" around episode 8 \"restarts\" the story and that is what kept me going to the end of it. So I rate it 6.\r\nArt : Flashy colors and overall good animations. Some of the animation, by being exagerated, is really funny. That's a 9.\r\nSound : I did not pay attention tothe music that much. I know that the OP got me hyped for sure. Also, I saw it in dubbed version and it was great, so 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Each one of them has a story, a personnality clearly different from the others. And their behaviours mix together pretty well. 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I watched it for the MAL Challenge and I did not regret it ! This isn't usually my kind of anime, but it sure was refreshing and fun to watch. It wasn't to long, I think exactly the good length. Maybe ep 12 bored me (especially with the bath scene, too much fan service). So it's a 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I recommend this anime to anyone who's not used to romcom animes. Bonus points if you're a gamer yourself, you will recognise many things in it (and the shameless advertisement for Arc System Works :p )\\n\\n\r\nI rate it 8!",

            "content": "Gamers! is an anime that initially you think is going is to be a show about gamers with a thinly veiled romance plot, only to be a romance plot with a thinly veiled gaming aspect. It's a show that relies on two things: the viewers tolerance and general understanding of the misunderstanding trope, and the heavy prominence of game mechanics references in relationship to, well, relationships and everyday life. \r\nThese two managed to work well on me, even as I'm one who generally hates misunderstanding tropes and usually only mildly likes gaming references. \r\nWhat pushes this show into entertainment and why it works so wellis the level of effort put into both the references and the misunderstandings themselves. The five main characters form a complex web of their own perceptions about what's supposedly really going on with everyone else. Characters that don't realize what kind of situation they're in perfectly understanding when one of their friends is bumbling up. It feels very true to life in that aspect, as each dumb teen is only perceptive enough to figure out one thing going on at a time and that's it. One of them even constantly tries to get the others into situations where they can talk it up only for the misunderstandings to pile up. All of this culminates in the sixth (and quite possibly best) episode, where the set-up and eventually pay-off is honestly good enough to stand on its own in a lot of ways. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing this show thrives on is its gaming references, which are clock-full in each episode. Rarely do they feel cheap or shoehorned in either, some even being quite subtly (took me about four episodes until \"Karen Tendo\" really set in) and others are used to build whole episodes out of, like in Karen's episode or most of Amano's. They go all out with the sound effects and the \"gameplay\" of the games in-universe, to the point that most of them feel like they could be real games. All this extra effort really shows and makes the games and characters feel more alive because of it.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, though, the series isn't perfect, and I think a large portion of that rests on the second half of the series. The first half is the perfect string of misunderstandings that were relatable and that connected with the viewer while the second half...fails to use all of them properly. The series doesn't even try to end on any conclusive note, although I don't think it necessarily needs to, it does use a few episodes in the second half to set up a conflict it never resolves it in-universe and personally it feels like we're getting at least a little cheated out of the possibilities of that one storyline. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though because of technical and story limitations in the end, I still highly recommend this show to people who are tired of stupid misunderstanding tropes and good rom-coms with a hint of gaming for extra flavor.\\n\\n\r\n~Howl",

            "content": "Gamers! is bad. It's a complicated mess that takes you nowhere at all. It's a train that takes you across the country only to drop you off where you started. \r\nThat being said, I still somewhat enjoyed Gamers! \r\nNow, where to start. I guess the humor. Not too awful. I had a giggle here and there, but as with most comedies, the jokes get repetitive and start drawing away from the actual story we're supposed to be getting. Nothing ever goes anywhere. Sure, progress is made in some relationships between characters, but its very minor pushes. one step forward, one step back. Gamers! just feelslike one of those scooby doo chase moments, where everyone's just running around in circles. Nothing is ever really resolved. My big issue with the anime, or should I say, another issue with this \"game\" anime is that there's just excessive speak of games. There actually isn't any games to be found. Hell, the game we see most is a flash mobile game...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do not help the story either. It's ironic that dating sims are spoken of as much as they are considering our MC is reminiscent of the MCs in dating sims. Nothing redeemable about him whatsoever, but everyone flocks to him, because again, he's the main character. Worse than this though is the ongoing gag that you get sick of the first time you see it, the misunderstandings. It wasn't fun 2 times in, it wasn't fun 30 times in. Communication isn't present between these characters, which is funny (more irony) when in real relationships, you'd consider communication to be  incredibly important. It's as if the show wants to irritate you, because some of the characters will fully share your stress and you think to yourself \"why won't you just say something\". It's a nightmare.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about the sound/music. The OP was nice, I suppose. The art style wasn't really anything out there either, there were some character designs that I just viewed as really average, but with a speck of flair. Characters like Aguri and Tasuko. They weren't anything remarkable, but they gave a bit more personality (not to say there's much unique) to their characters. This was easy to notice when looking at Keita. Makes you appreciate the small things, but then maybe that's a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all the trash talk spoken, how come I enjoyed it? Well, the main reasons are the ridiculous misunderstandings and the cliche cute moments. This is the rise and fall of the anime really, since these same things are what can make the anime such a turn off. The misunderstandings were fun to watch, albeit irritating, but only really bothered me when I realized they were complete comedic relief and filler. They'd be left unresolved and forgotten. A joy for a moment and then disappointing. I liked some of the chaos, but I was ultimately left dissatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nThe cliche moments and cuteness are kind of similar. This anime kind of has some identity issues sometimes. It's funny and stupid and then there's a sweet moment, or something really cute that happens and you can't help, but hope that particular relationship route works. Then we're back to comedy and the scene is forgotten as with everything.\\n\\n\r\nSo I give this anime rank: Diet Soda *Because like diet soda for me. Its pleasant for a second and then you're left with the aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's only if you don't watch episode 12, which is basically a DLC- err OVA. It kills the ending of episode 11 and leaves an even worse aftertaste. So pass on it unless you're desperate for more, somehow.\\n\r\n--\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nTo summarize nice and neat, what made this anime enjoyable?\\n\r\n\u2022The rare cute moments, the few laughs this anime managed to get out of me, the chaotic plot if you're into that and for me personally, Aguri. I won't lie. I fought through for that, she's adorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime disappointing? \\n\r\n\u2022Everything feels like filler, the misunderstandings aren't funny after awhile; they're painful, the show ends on an OVA, nothing about how any situation is handled is ever satisfying since you feel as though nothing is ever clarified and these characters have 5 second attention spans. The worst offense I can name is how this anime has a few things going for it, but so many inconsistencies, cliches and lack of identity that it's just another anime we'll eventually forget.",

            "content": "There are many good and bad anime but few that are insulting, unfortunately Gamers! Ranks amongst them...\r\nI\u2019d like to take a moment to address certain observations about the anime itself and its reception. Gamers! is self-aware, it seemingly understands the elements of camp it has and also utilises meta-gaming humour, albeit sparingly. With a presumably large portion of the anime (and by extension MAL) community also falling into the category of \u201cgamers\u201d, certain viewers might see Gamers! as a sort of representation of the individual gamer, gaming pop-culture or even the negative stereotypes of gamers, something that strikes close to home. \r\nNow with the aboveout of the way I\u2019ll Segway into my \u201creview\u201d......\\n\\n\r\nStory (or perhaps lack thereof)\\n\r\nGeneric? Not quite. The \u201cstory\u201d/overarching plot revolves around a group of gamers bound together by what can be best described as a clusterf*ck. Our protagonist is the scrawny socially awkward male that is Keita Amano, and while the majority of his actions are of good nature they tend to bite him in the arse. He is plain and uninteresting with the anime at one point commenting on how similarly he fits the mold of the generic self-insert visual novel protagonist. The pacing of Gamers! is for the most part fine and of not much note, what is of note however is it\u2019s reliance on its characters to drive the show forward, which both serves as its major Pro and Con.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way: I absolutely dispise the choice of colour scheme/pallet. While a problem most definitely not exclusive to Gamers!, the heavy used of pale washed out colours such as yellow, puke green, brown & navy blue is quite the sight. This is further aggrevated by its rigid animation, which is susceptible to limited depth of field, robotic like motion and occasional Character model morphing. By 2017 standards, the animation and artstyle are terrible. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI personally found the use of 8-bit sound effects to be a nice homage to its inappropriately titular focus. The rest of the soundtrack is really of not much note\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s)\\n\r\nThe main problem of Gamers! is its cast which is especially detrimental since (as previously stated) the bulk of the show is carried by them due to the barebones plot. for better or worst, none of the characters stand out due them all being equally crappy and annoying. Our protagonist is a spineless coward whose sporadic and almost random (unintentional) rhetorics almost inexplicable end up being all so inspiring to the rest of the mostly female cast. He is dull and annoying. Next, we have Tendou, whose only notable traits are subjectively good looks, affluent background and being the main romantic interest of the protagonist. Her main reason for liking the protagonist is well... never explained and as she puts it \"Just likes\" keita. Chiaki is just there (if you took her out of the plot, there wouldn't be much difference), while Aguri is frustratingly insecure and clingy and the same can be said of her on and off other-half Uehara. On a side note, what was the point of making him have a darker skin tone? I myself am dark skinned thanks to the nature of my day to day activities, a character who is written as an indoors person and is originally of much fairer skin should stay that way. Pointless rambling aside, you'd think that the main cast of a show called \"Gamers!\" would almost certainly be a shared affection for the aforementioned recreation and while that is partially true, the glue holding the cast together is none other than a cobweb of mutual distrust, insecurity, misunderstanding and lack of confrontation, which are definitely the hallmarks of building long-lasting and mutually beneficial friendships ( in case you can't tell, that was sarcasm). While there are moments where certain characters set up scenarios that should have clearly settled the matter once and for all, they all end up failing due to said characters chickening out or jumping the gun. It is also frankly quite astounding how the cast deals with cases of infidelity, which is almost disregarded to the extent that it could be considered brushed off or results in a short hissy fit of no significance. What should in most cases be an alarming call to action, is brushed off and dragged on for the sake of extending the \"compelling\" and \"hilarious\" character drama and I don't know if it's just me, but the people I know in real life would most definitely not take infidelity so lightly. And fine, perhaps one can make the case that the cast isn't serious about their relationships and maybe haven't really defined the clear boundaries of their relationships with their partners, but in all honestly slogging it through 10 episodes is annoyingly painful. And perhaps most insultingly was the way it ended, which was basically the show sticking the middle finger right up to it's 'gamer' viewers. The points they raise are fair in most regards but points that I myself couldn't give a rat's arse to seriously ponder. The lack  of chemistry, piss poor characters and almost insulting nature of \"gamers!\" in its use of its titular activity as a pathetic set up is nothing short of disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwords\\n\r\nSo, who is Gamers! for? The Gamer? The masochist? The high school romcom enthusiast? People who like to look at dull washed out shows with the color pallet of a playdough set? I do not know nor care but what I am most certain of is that it is not for me. It\u2019s too full of problems and is frankly quite insulting, would not recommend.\\n\\n\r\nBefore someone gets the wrong impression that I'm being a tad bit too sensitive about gaming, understand that \"Gamers!\" doesn't really give five craps about gaming itself, only utilizing it as part of the setup or as throwaway references. It is just patronizing not only to the \"gamer\" but also to the viewers in general, regardless of gaming background. \\n\r\nAlso what is with the ending title cards always being images of the female cast in swimsuits? I love me some cute anime girls in skimpy clothes but there really is no need to have it always be a female cast member in a swimsuit. \\n\\n",

My least favorite thing about the story is how heavily it relies on lies and misunderstandings in order to further the plot. Misunderstandings I can tolerate to a certain degree, and in some situations in the show (around the middle) it causes some pretty hilarious happenings.\r\nI loved Keita's rejection of joining thegamers club, especially after they really set it up as if that's where the series was going by introducing all the characters and giving them enough character to make them feel important. They aren't important to the main story, but it's nice seeing them when it occasionally cuts to Tendou in the game room.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the plot is the lack of resolution, in the end very little is wrapped up well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7:\\n\r\nWell animated, certainly looks like an anime made in 2017, but aside from being clean it doesn't have much else going for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5:\\n\r\nThis is mostly because I don't remember much of what the sound was like, I'll probably have a better idea when the OST is released.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7:\\n\r\nBecause it's a rom-com, there is heavy focus on the characters, and all of them are enjoyable people. I would rate this a 10, but the one thing I hate that they're almost all guilty of is the insane jealousy they so blatantly show. The show tries to play this up for laughs, but personally I don't think a character getting mad at someone else for being nice to them is all that funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7:\\n\r\nIf my enjoyment of this series was on a graph start steady, go up in the middle, then fall below where it started at the end.",

From here it turns into a love triangle circus comedy of who likes who/pin the tail on the donkey. The story could be summarized into about 6-8 episodes if the MC's played a lot less I'M DENSE cards, but that'sfor comedic effect which makes up the whole story so if dense characters irritate you i have some bad news.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly the characters where a nice change of pace to what is normally seen. There was your regular troupes, but it wasn't on the normal character it was a bit of a switch around from the norm, which was a nice breath of fresh air for a change. Each character had their own little likeable feature and it wasn't a case of really playing favorites too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: ?/10\\n\r\nAs per my last review, I don't pay a lot of attention to the music, so it either wasn't enough to hook me or I'm just tone deaf.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style was your standard moe try to get everything colourful and cute art style, but it wasn't super over the top, backgrounds looked crisp and not rushed to save money/time and the comedy scenes were done nicely as well with the change of art style for reactions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR\\n\r\nFrom the original premise of the show it changed completely into something that i wasn't really expecting, this is a reoccurring thing with game related anime, but it turned out not so bad, for a romcom it faired alright though the last episode may leave you disappointed (SPOILER AHEAD) as it really ends in episode 11 and episode 12 is just filler.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\\n\r\nOnly for the character aspect, as far as Romcom, Comedys and the like go, it was about on par with everything else. = No",

It's full of absurd misunderstandings, miscommunications and pure cluelessness generating tons of unnecessary drama, that prevents the two couples the show focuses on from getting together (obviously, we know from the start that everything will be fine in the end). There's an actual love triangle in the mix, but even that is obscured by the mountains of false signals and inability to speak out about their feeling on the part the main characters (and once more, we more or less know the conclusion anyway). In the end, afterthe amusing start, for many the series became irritating, as it's hard to keep suspension of disbelief while every new problem presented in the plot could be fixed with a few minutes of honest talk.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't think it's that bad/annoying, but I'm also a guy that liked School Days and a few other purposefully-frustrating shows \u2013 I'm OK with them when I know what I'm getting into. Gamers! is a comedy above all and I think the humour really works, the characters themselves and stupid situations they get themselves into are in most cases genuinely funny. Romance component of it, on the other hand, is questionable at best, with characters being either obsessed to creepy levels about their love interests or completely confused and unable to act on their feelings. The predictable outcome only makes it more disengaging on the part of the viewer \u2013 the only pairing I would actually enjoy to watch was obviously doomed from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"gamers/geeks\" theme is never fully forgotten, but really just serves as a background for the romantic story. The series have some amusing references and the nerd status of some characters is important to the plot, but never its main focus. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation and music are fine, but the visual quality deteriorated by the end of the season. The voice acting is also adequate, my favourite probably being Hisako Kanemoto as Karen. In general, the production qualities are good, but never blew my mind in any aspect (very good visual design of the main characters being maybe the one thing that stood out).\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I recommend this show to people liking comedy anime and not being scared of messy rom-com storytelling, that conjures more and more layers of drama out of thin air. It shouldn't be taken seriously and you shouldn't expect it to move you in any deeper way. It's rather a fun story that maybe had potential to be something more, but ended up as an amusing comedy to watch through on a lazy weekend \u2013 not a complete waste of time for sure, but nothing really memorable either.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MyAnimeList, so I apologize if anything here seems badly-written, amateurish, or anything of the such.\r\nIf I had to describe Gamers! in one word, I would say that it's decent. Nothing about this anime really stood out to me, and I wouldn't call it a memorable one whatsoever. It definitely did have its moments though, and was entertaining most of the time.\r\nThe plot revolves around Amano, your generic everyday guy who is, as the title of the anime suggests, a gamer. One day, while he's searching through the isles and looking at one of his beloved dating sims, Karen Tendou,the typical popular and well-loved student in his school, confronts him. She find out he's a gamer and feels obliged to ask him to join the game club. After visiting the game club and trying it out for a day, Amano decides not to join, as he thinks that the game club is not fit for him. The following events are consequences of that action, as Tendou gets to know him more and develops a huge crush on him and we're introduced to new characters along the way.\\n\r\nSome plot devices were far too overused which let them lose their charm a bit. The pacing was also a tad too fast yet slow for my liking, which is kind of hard to explain, but twelve episodes isn't enough to be well paced for most shows, and unfortunately Gamers! was one of them.\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty fun. Each one was their own individual and had their own unique characteristics, thankfully. Many shows tend to have the same character a thousand times but with a different physical appearance each time, and Gamers! wasn't one of them. I wouldn't say there was much character development, if any at all. The characters were a nice aspect of the anime.\\n\r\nThe visuals were okay, nothing special. The art and animation were weird and messed up at times, but they were good enough in general. To be honest, the comedic facial expressions were the best part in the animation in my opinion, because they did what they intended to do, which was being simply hilarious. Not the worst animation ever, but definitely could've been a lot better.\\n\r\nSounds are usually what these kinds of shows use to help them shine a little more, but the sounds in Gamers! were the same as everything else, normal. The opening theme was quite catchy though, and I found myself listening to the whole thing in most episodes. The rest was average, or at least nothing in it really appealed to me. I watched this anime dubbed so I can't really say anything about the voice acting, but the dub was adequate.\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching Gamers! for sure, and I also learned a little about gaming, because I myself am not a gamer and I have no knowledge about gaming whatsoever, so I guess it did help a bit. It did get annoying at times and had various unrealistic situations which made me question some things, but it was nice to watch nevertheless.\\n\r\nAs I said many times before, everything in Gamers! was good and sometimes above average, but that was all. If you're looking for a light-hearted anime to watch, you could give this a try. It is in no way a perfect anime, and I wouldn't consider rewatching it again, but it was a quick fun series to watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gamers! I've no joke that I can say about this anime's name.\r\nStory: 9\\10\r\nThe story is that of a generic gaming loving guy who has never talked to a girl before, and perhaps never even talked ot anyone outside his family before. The story revolves around a bunch of gaming addicts a pink haired love struck girl desperately trying to get with the people they love. This is an exception for 2 people, as they are already together at the start. However, due to many misunderstandings, their story will be about finding out if the other is cheating or not.\r\nThe story is generic, really. Yet theymake it as enjoyable as possible for the viewer. With some moments when the characters make horrid misunderstandings, and other moments that'll make you relate to the characters, as a gamer yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArtwrk: 10\\10\\n\r\nOne of the most recent anime I have watched is the Hajimete No Gal dub, as a reccomendation from lost pause. If you want an idea of the artwork, then it looks very similar to that. Was it made by the same studio? No clue, I don't research anime to that fine level of detail.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\10\\n\r\nI'm being harsh, really, I am. These characters are so loveable and amazing in the dub, that I feel like a horrid person. Yet are they very similar t other anime with similar premises to this one? Yes. Is that enough to rate this segment lower? Yes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\10\\n\r\nThis had me cringing at times, laughing at others, and nodding silently in agreement the rest of the time. The anime manages to be relateable and comedic at the same time. Like how Lee Evans (comedian) uses real life for his jokes, Gamers! does the same, but in a subtle way that only a gamer would understand.\\n\\n\r\nI'm in a Love \\ Hate relationship with the ending, though. It really will be needing a second season, so perhaps you might prefer to wait until that comes out to watch, as otherswise you'll be itching for a continuation!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\10\\n\r\nI will always say I rate overall on the chances of me rewatching, and for Gamers! it is easy; I will certainly be coming back to watch.",

            "content": "A farcical school rom-com that\u2019s one of the funniest anime I\u2019ve seen in a good while, even if it does slip up a little towards the end.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica defines \u2018Farce\u2019 as \u201c[A] comic dramatic piece that uses highly improbable situations, stereotyped characters, extravagant exaggeration, and violent horseplay.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s a form of comedy where everything is so overblown and ridiculous that the audience is never meant to take it seriously. Running on an outlandish series of comedic errors and exaggerated reactions, the main cast manages to convince themselves their video game loving friend group is a tangled web of love triangles, while in realitythere are only two non-competing couples. The show does this for the first half of its run and it\u2019s comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the second half the show made the mistake of starting to take itself seriously and the quality slips a bit. An actual love triangle develops, an unnecessary character is introduced, and there\u2019s less comedy to go around. The ED is even changed for a couple episodes, with much more melodramatic music and imagery. Gamers! never slips entirely into a dramatic series, but it really should have stayed a farce. To top it all off, the last episode is a filler spa episode centering around a conversation about DLC and fan-service that gets seriously ramped up in a series that\u2019s otherwise fairly tame in that department. The show should have stuck with comedy all the way, that\u2019s its best asset.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a flat 5 here. It does what it needs to do, has no major flaws, and looks nice enough, but I can\u2019t think of single thing it does unusually well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an English Dub series all the way. Comedy is just so much better in your native language, and the voice actors do quite well conveying the ludicrous, exaggerated emotions and rapid-fire dialogue necessary for a good farce. I haven\u2019t laughed out loud at an anime in a good long while, and this show did the trick.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fine, with the OP being a catchy and happy little pop song, but I really can\u2019t remember a single piece of music that played during the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nReal people don\u2019t act remotely like this, folks. I can sympathize with going in ridiculous over-analysis of a romantic situation only to draw the completely wrong conclusion, but it\u2019s heavily played up for rule-of-funny. The cast plays up their stereotypes hilariously, the generic, wishy-washy main character, the gorgeous school idol hiding a nerdy secret, the cocky schemer whose schemes always backfire on him, etc. The big mistake occurs in the second half of the show where the story tries to make these loons work in a scenario that\u2019s just a little too serious for them to handle well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed this lunatic farce of a rom-com. I just wish it had stayed that way to the end. As it is, the slight tone shift took Gamers! from \u2018great\u2019 to \u2018good\u2019.",

It was more about annoying misunderstandings left and right. Although Aguri told Tasuku that she looked at Amano as only a brother, he still decided to assume she was cheating.\r\nArt:\r\n7/10\r\nThe art seemed average quality. The style was appealing, the colors were bright, and there isn't much more to be said.\r\nSound\r\n6/10\r\nThe voices fit well with the characters and the acting was alright. There wasn't much background music. \r\nCharacter:\r\n3/10\r\nTbh, this was the worst part of the anime. Tendou is the exact definition ofa cliche mary-sue tsundere. Not to mention, she turned down many guys each day but decided to like boring ol' Amano on like the 1st or 2nd episode. All the characters handled seeing a guy and girl the exact same way; assume romance, run away, and have misunderstanding for like 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nThe anime was enjoyable, but it got quite boring after all the continuous misunderstandings. The misunderstandings kept disappearing and reappearing every like 2 or 3 episodes too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it was entertaining, but just got flooded out with the same misunderstanding.

            "content": "I dropped this anime after watching six episodes. However, after watching Hiding in Public's video about the anime, I decided to give this anime another chance. To be honest I hated the way this anime focuses on the love dynamics between the main characters while not giving much attention to what specifically they like about the games they played. If anyone wants an anime or manga that balances the enjoyment and appreciation of video games with subtle romance then I would recommend Hi-Score Girl. What I was beginning to like after the sixth episode is how the characters begin to understand one another when theyare not focusing on each other but when they are enjoying each other's play style when playing games or vaguely discussing what they like about the games. I wish the anime built this up more, but unfortunately it never does. The anime seems to be playing it safe with keeping the subject of enjoying video games minimal while putting out the romance gags. I liked how the anime breaks free from the trope of every girl falls for the main character by having one of the characters already have a boyfriend that she is serious about. It's interesting to see the other characters expect this character to fall for the main protagonist since it reveals both their and the audience's tendency to expect two people of opposite sex enjoying each other's company to be an item. I would like to see the anime dwell on this topic a bit more in the future. The final episode seems like an experimental episode to test whether the audience would tolerate the minimizing of the romance aspects of the anime for the contemplation of video games place in the life of each character. If the anime continues in this direction, then I would look forward for the second season and hope for the improvement. If not, then I guess I am done with this anime. I wouldn't turn to this anime for a great entertaining story but for its intriguing ideas it seems to vaguely play with. It barely breaks through for me as slightly above a sub-par guilty pleasure.",

            "content": "With a title like 'Gamers!' you'd think it'd be a show about, well, fucking gamers. Well, if you're one of those that believe that love is a game, then it technically is. A very bad example of gamers, but example of gamers nonetheless. \r\n'Gamers!' plays out similarly to your every other shounen rom-com, except instead of yakuza bs, you've got gamers bs gimmick. What little positives it has going for it isn't worth sitting through this shitfest for 12 episodes, so I'll just list these minor positives seeing as that way you can just pretend you've seen the show and skip it completely. \r\n- Ithas relatively decent amount of game references for the type of a show it is. They're not complex, they don't play any part in the actual narrative, they're just sort of there, but it can be fun recognizing them.\\n\r\n- You don't have to take it seriously 'cause the show itself doesn't take itself seriously\\n\r\n- You can watch first 1-2 episodes and the last, and comfortably say you've actually watched the entire show (I, myself, didn't have such fortune, as I watched it weekly. Damn me!!) \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that we've listed out the positives, let's get on with the actual review of this shitfest. 'Gamers!' plays out a lot like parody - considering that it takes cliche, generic settings or plotlines and exaggerates then to nTH degree - but I'm not sure whether it realizes that it's a parody. You see, just because you take a certain scenario and exaggerate it in any way doesn't make it immediately funny. Especially if you take something that was boring and atrocious to begin with. If someone wants to parody and make fun of the classic rom-com misunderstandings plot devices, you DON'T amp them up to fucking heaven. No, no you don't. It's not funny. Trust me, ooh trust me, it's not funny. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what do you get when the greatest problem of the show lies with what literally defines it? Well, you get 'Gamers!'. For the plot to play out the way it did, it was necessary for each and every character to literally be a pre-programmed AI that responds only when certain conditions are met. Say, a boy has a girlfriend. A boy sees his girlfriend with his friend (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people of opposite sex meet up without intention to fuck each other dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). Now, it's only logical for the boy to come out and ask his friend: Oi, you fucking my girl? Obvious, right? Well no, apparently not. \\n\\n\r\nSay, you think your boyfriend is cheating on you. After all, you did hear him say some other girl is cute (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people compliment members of opposite sex without intention to fuck them dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). So, what do you do? Well, you talk to him obviously. Ah, no, wait, that's logical thing to do. Better, let's meet up with his friend and do absolutely nothing except whine and complain about it. \\n\\n\r\nLook, I can stuff a lot of shit - especially if it's a comedy show - and especially if it's parodying something. But, even inside the fucking parodies, there NEEDS to be a baseline logic. Why the hell do you think that most of the recent spoof movies are hated almost universally? Because it's just a bunch of random shit that's not funny. And, believe it or not, I don't think it was 'Gamers!'s intention to parody anything. Yes, characters occasionally call out the absolute retardation that their situation is. But, BUT, just because you point something out doesn't mean you're parodying it, nor does it mean that it's okay 'cause you pointed it out. No, that shit doesn't work that way. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the story. Well, from those two prior example you can basically derive the entire story of this shitshow. There are five characters. None of them are capable of this human thing called talking. They all have immensely fucked up and skewed imagination. Let the bullshit commence. Let's not even mention that intervention of god's hand was necessary for any of this shit to even start. It's just... it's just plain fucking nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nBut don't worry. We've got ourselves an even worse part that the story. No, it's not the overall rating of the show. Well, kind of, but let's ignore that. Let's talk about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWe've got five of them. When you first begin the show, they all seem diverse enough; you've got your generic beta-male, your generic hot chick who's interested in him (for the love of me I never figured out why except for 'well, he likes games and so do I that absolutely means I need to fuck him'), then you've got the high-school debut guy, gal(?) airhead, and the fifth wheel. No, she's the fifth fucking wheel. When you dedicate 9 fucking episodes primarily to developing the relationship of other four (even though that 'developing' is kind of pushing it), and then just ignore every other character except for her, I ain't calling her anything other than the fifth wheel. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with such diverse cast, you'd think, I mean, YOU'D FUCKING THINK (RIGHT?!) that they all behave differently. RIGHT?! I wish. I wish someone turned psychotic in the early episodes and killed everyone. Ow man would that have been fun. Well, first and foremost, disregard who these characters are. The only time they act IN their character (uh...) is when they're talking. And by that I mean when people are voice acting them. That's all. All five of them - ALL FUCKING FIVE OF THEM - act exactly the same in every situation. Are they all fucking twins but they just haven't realized it yet?! \\n\\n\r\nI'd love to say these characters develop and grow on you. I mean, would truly love to say that. It would have meant I at least enjoyed the show partially. But, even if Satan were to set my asshole on fire right this very moment, I couldn't do it. These characters do nothing but run in circles for 12 episodes. If they all looked the same, and had the same voice actor, you wouldn't be able to tell one from another because nothing else defines them, especially after first 2-3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe boyfriend girlfriend pair should have never started dating. They have 0 chemistry. Fuck, I don't even know why is the girl obsessed with him so much (by the way, that's sort of a theme in this show; you don't really ever know why these girls like these guys so much, they just sorta do and you just sorta have to accept it). They don't trust each other. Fuck that. THEY CAN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. If you're that fucking insecure about being cheated on, ASK. If we were given nothing else about that pink-haired girl, we were shown that she's the proactive type. PROACTIVE TYPES FUCKING ACT. THEY DON'T SULK WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING. And the boyfriend guy, get this. So, at first, the dude just started dating her because, well, fuck, we needed a boyfriend and girlfriend pair but we couldn't think up a reason for them to date. But, don't despair!! He does eventually like her!! Why? Because she liked him back before he became 'hot'. The level of utter nonsense presented here is reaching levels we thought impossible people!! I've seen loves on first sight. I've seen loves because of a single act of kindness. I've seen loves 'just because'. I've seen all kinds of loves in all kinds of stories. But never have I seen someone date someone for a prolonged time, don't give that much shit about them, and then, without any chemistry, without any build-up, without any banter or anything else that quantifies a RELATIONSHIP, not just a romantic one but relationship in general, just fall in love or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our fifth wheel. I absolutely hate that guy. Oh, wait, He likes my games and he plays games with me. Ooops, did I say hate? I mean I absolutely adore, worship and love that guy!! Just fuck off. \\n\\n\r\nLiterally the only two characters that are given even a whiff of relationship development are our beta-male and blonde beauty. Hell, when compared with the rest of the shitshow, it actually stands out as something decent. But it's not. Oooh trust me it's not. I don't know why this girl likes this dude. And I don't even know why this dude likes this girl. I mean, I can sort of understand, she's cute and shit, so whatever. I mean, the dude doesn't even know what 'playing games for fun' means, and yet I'm supposed to listen to his spiel whereas he somehow convinces this chick that he's right? Fuck off with that nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, 'Gamers!' is anything except what its name suggests. It's an attempt at parody (I hope, I HOPE TO GOD IT'S AN ACTUAL ATTEMPT AT PARODY) that doesn't understand how to parody something so basic. It's like that retarded dog of yours that keeps chasing its tail until it gets dazed. Five characters act in exact same ways regardless of the circumstances, and it's just plain not fun. It's not entertaining. It's not funny. It's just fucking exhausting. Much like this review of mine.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's it. Go game on. Time better spent than watching this show.",

Some people say the game is fun. Or, that the game is a battle. If it's not fun why bother? If it's not a battle, where's the fun? These questions really dig deep into my understanding of how Gamers! truly imagines and unfolds its world. It's really a test that you pass or a quest that you fail. It is also a race against time. Fun and battle always lock together. \r\nGamers! embodies whatmakes these kinds of shows special. A truly unique look into how gaming clubs operate and how the members interact. Slightly awkward at first, but as the show unfolds we find that these characters have a tender and caring side for one another. \\n\\n\r\nBut Gamers! is something else. It is a journey, or a passport to new worlds. Perhaps even... an Odyssey. It's a look, a feel, an exploration. You really have to close your focus and open your mind. Yes, the journey requires the right ticket, and that ticket is Gamers! But in the end it's not just about where you can take Gamers!. It's where Gamers! can take you... so let's go.\\n\\n",

So what are some of the good things? So the anime shines with the sound and attention to detail for video games to be honest. I am a huge gamer so I definitely enjoyed this anime. Now I personally like the characters. The main guy is kind of oblivious to kind of common things. However this anime does show how awkward love can be. Now it does dramatize the awkwardness. However sodoes most anime. It is pretty well written too. I loved the conversations between all of the characters. It was hilarious to see a bunch of awkward nerds try to connect together. Now the story was a little too standard for me. It was like juuussst enough for the story to progress. I thought a few moments were kind of bland. Also one scene close to the end kind of seemed out of left field. However it seems like the reviews are very polarizing. So I would just watch it if you think you would like it.",

            "content": "When I first started watching Gamers!, I completely missed the point of the show. I wanted a show about...gamers doing gamer things (you know...hence the title of the show). After seeing so many online personalities praising the show as a well put together drama, I decided to give the show another show. And...I'm very glad that I did.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAs I mentioned in my opening, I initially misunderstood what the show was trying to accomplish. Instead of being a show about gamers, it is a show that is fully about the main cast failing at life while also happening to play/talk about games here and there.The show is absolutely a drama and one of the best parts about that is it strays away from being a melodrama. While there are moments you would see in a typical melodrama, the show seems to respect the viewer and not give into easy melodrama tropes. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I fell back into the show on the second viewing was the pacing. Plot devices are brought up and are (usually) completed in an interesting way without sticking around too long. If I had to list a nuisance though, it would be that the last episode is really episode 11 and that episode 12 is just there to entice people to buy the eventual blu rays (super fanservicy and a disgrace to the show). In fact it was so bad and such a waste of time that I'm docking an entire point because of it. Have your fanservice moments but if you are going to dedicate an entire episode to it (and mind you the last motherfucking episode), fuck you especially since we still have unanswered/unresolved plot lines after the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animations: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show sports a simple looking art style. The character designs however are really super clever. You can really tell a lot about each of the main characters by the way they are designed. This is amplified in the opening for the show. The layout of the city was also really interesting. I don't know how to fully explain this but this show felt like it really was in a sort of downtown setting unlike a lot of other shows that always seem like they are showing the same buildings in the background over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really shined in the art department was the quirky, derpy face moments that occurred during comedic moments. There would usually be a moment when a character misunderstands something or just does something stupid and this pop-out areas with derpy faces would fill the screen. It worked pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was actually pretty decent. There really isn't that many high-movement shots but what really struck me in a nice way was just the overall quality control of the animation. I couldn't really tell at any point where \u201cyeah they ran out of time here. Looks worse than the rest of the show\u201d. Now I cannot say that is true for some of the art quality (really takes a nose dive in some scenes) but overall the visual presentation was more than good enough for this anime season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the background music is pretty decent. Seeing how games are somewhat of a focus in this series, the studio did a pretty good job with finding music that fits within that demographic while also not breaking the tone of the scenes. It's more than just throwing some chiptune into a blender, there was some serious thought put into making the songs. Any sort of misc sound design went over my head. There wasn't a lot of moments for them to shine anyways since this is a pretty low-intensity show. \\n\\n\r\nVAs did an amazing job. Every VA sounds so into their on-screen characters. Really a super smashing job on that front.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the reason to watch the show. If you don't find yourself liking the main characters after the third episode, jump ship my friend. The whole point of the show is to watch these lovable idiots fucking misunderstand like...every situation thrown their way. The way the cast worked with each other was such a joy to see unfold. It's because of this that it is so painful that some things were left unfulfilled and open-ended after the final episode...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nYou don't even need to say it. Yes that I get that this anime is adapting an on-going series so my points about certain things being left in-the-air is dumb. No, fuck you. I do not care about the source material. The fact that the last episode was wasted (on needless fanservice) and we did not see important things come to a close almost makes me not want to recommend this series to potential watchers. ...but god damn it is a very well put together series. The characters just make the show so much fun to watch. You need to put this on your \u201cplan to watch\u201d list so that when more material gets adapted (hopefully), you will have a more complete experience than I did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Allow me to start by clearing up the first of what will be many misunderstandings: Gamers! is not about games or gaming. It's an anime about the people who play games - a loner who loves video games to death but is awful at most of them, an honors student who hides her gaming to maintain her image, a game designer with a fetish for fish, a casual who needs the aforementioned loner's recommendations to really get into gaming, and the casual's girlfriend, who looks at all of them like members of an alien species. Every character has clear and particular tastes and relationships withgaming, making them infinitely more relatable and distinct. Oh yeah, and all five form a love pentagon of epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nJust because Gamers! is about the gamers doesn't mean it can't show off their shared titular hobby, and Pine Jam packs GOBS of gaming references both specific and not. Even disregarding the OP and EDs - which are fantastic - the show itself incorporates plenty of references and behaviors that are instantly familiar to anyone familiar with gaming culture (the scene where Amano gets critted is particularly memorable). The staff are obviously passionate about gaming, and it shows through in every moment of the show, though the story leans on it less heavily in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the story, it seems like a pretty standard romcom laden with misunderstandings. Upon closer inspection however, the misunderstandings are impressively self-aware and carefully orchestrated for maximum effect. And with characters that feel as alive as this cast does, the misunderstandings and love pentagons become infectiously fun to watch. Seriously, having misunderstandings DOES NOT ruin this show. Clich\u00e9s can work if executed well, and they are very very well executed here.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, if a little unremarkable at times. The animation suffers pretty visibly as the show goes on, likely from deadline issues or the like (episode 10 was delayed like 12 hours), but it's never awful, and if you've already bought in to everything Gamers! is trying to do, it's easy to ignore. Plus, the more glaring stuff will likely get fixed on BDs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gamers! is a diamond in the rough. It's the rare hobby-focused slice of life that actually understands said hobby. The characters are likeable and well-rounded, and the romcom side turns out to be a blast. There's an inexplicable charm to this show - this is the most fun I've had watching anime in years - and even if it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, give it a shot and let it surprise you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I pretty much promised myself, that I will write atleast 3 reviews per anime season. It will propably be hard considering how lazy can I get, but I hope I can manage it.\r\nThis season I'm starting with Gamers!, because that's the anime I was propably most disappointed with. What started as a good comedy, turned out to be a show with terrible romance setup and decision making.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nFirst, let me say, there is not really much of a story in Gamers!. \"But that's normal in comedies, so what's so bad?\" you might ask. And the answer is, I dont have a problem with theactuall story. Yes, it's generic. Once again we have a school club, like we've already seen  million times before. The only thing that stoods out it that the club is about gaming. That counts only in the first 2 episodes tho, and after that you'll never hear about that gaming club again. However, the thing that was irritating me throughout the whole show was the love polygon that they've made. They based off that polygon on a couple of missunderstandings like \"wrong character is in a wrong place at a wrong time\" or \"a character seems something susspicious and makes a huge case of it, even if it was just a small thing\" and that was it. There was nothing more to it. And because of that, the whole anime is about five friends in a weird pentagon, where everyone is suspecing their lovers from cheating. Even thought it never happened and they could've explained it to themselves in a matter of minutes if they sat down and talked about it... Sadly they don't and so they take about 8 episodes in total to actually figure out that these cheating accusations are wrong, which is far from enjoyable. Oh and like I said, this anime has nothing to do with gaming. Few of the characters are playing a mobile game and they go to the arcade sometimes, and that's about it when it comes to games.\\n\\n\r\nBTW it maybe seems like I'm that type a guy who just thinks about everything too much and can't \"turn off\" his head while watching comedies, but this whole setup was just so lame I couldn't ignore it, even if I removed my brain completely\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nWhen you're making a comedy, likeable characters is an absolute necessity to have. Sadly enough, that didn't happen here and I can say that 3(sometimes 4) out of those 5 characters are worth of punching every single episode. The last one, Hoshinomori, is nice, but she doesn't stand out over normal comedy characters. The others are completely dumb and nobody uses their brain. Well, to be honest, even Hoshinomori doesn't use it, but atleast she's cute and not as annoying compared to others. Amano is your typical main guy with zero confidence, which is maybe popular in modern anime, but I personally hate it to the core. Karen is your typical girl that is a weeaboo even thought you would never guess is a weeaboo, which happens a lot in modern anime aswell. Tasuku and his chick are also generic, a \"cool\" guy and a \"cute\" girl, that both turn out to be very annoying in the end. \\n\r\nOverall, the characters are a big problem in this one, atleast for me. If you like to watch a group of generic and dumb idiots, this anime is propably for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nI did find the art to be very likeable. I like the stylization of the characters with the exception of Tasuku, because I absolutelly hate when boys have earrings. Otherwise the art was nice, but they could have paid more attention to details or not as important scenes (the scene parodying CS:GO was the worst looking thing I've seen in a while)\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nCan't even remember if there was any music in this anime, which is a failure in my eyes. Opening not bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nAnd here we come to the point when I can atleast recommend Gamers! in some aspect. It still is a good comedy. Despite the terrible setup, despite the annoying characters, the comedy is still in there and you will laugh. The gigs are good, the anime can make a fun of itself and the same counts for the characters. It's not the best comedy-wise out there, but is definetly a good one as the jokes are keeping the anime from \"waste of time\" territorium.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nWas a good comedy throughout it's way. Sadly enough, the comedy is hidden between the bad written parts of the anime and you'll need some solid nerves to actually find it. But if you do, you'll realise that this anime was not a complete waste of time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What if we made an entire show about that with like 6 different people that all think they love someone other than the one they're either dating or crushing on in the most confusing love polyhedron ever made.\"\r\nThat's the anime in a nutshell. While it sounds like an absolute headache and blue ball of a series there are plenty of great character moments thatmake the show all worth it. And it doesn't end with good character moments the characters themselves were all written really well and in some ways refreshing from your typical anime love story.",

What appears to be an anime about video games for the first episode or two quickly devolves into a dialogue-heavy comedy with lacklustre jokes.\r\nNearly all of the intended humour is based on misunderstandings and awkward situations. By the fifth episode, it falls completely flat. It's simply not funny 95% of the time. The animation is fine, but there isn't much to animate. Most of the show is just dialogue to set up the unfunny jokes. A large portion of that dialogue is shouting.\r\nThe characters are completely unlikeable. It may be possible to forgive the fact that they are completelyone-dimensional, but the fact that they are annoying is not acceptable. If I were to refer to the loud and annoying character, you would have trouble discerning to which one I was referring.\\n\\n",

This game club is basically just a room for member to play their favourite game, yes, they played DIFFERENT game in the same room.\r\nInstead of calling that club isa Game club i'd say that's a FREE cyber cafe at school.\\n\\n\r\n== If you really want to watch this anime just keep in mind that this is not an anime about gamers life but just another rom-com anime ==\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5\\n\r\nin the first 3 episodes this anime give you a combination between game and rom-com and that's appealing (i was going to give an 9 but..). In these 3 episodes are about their passion as gamers and their life, but in the next episode 4 - 9..... The downhill is just obvious.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters became more stupid than Ichika Orimura from Infinite Startos. \\n\r\n\"Misunderstanding\" became the plot for this anime so called \"GAMERS\", instead of focusing on \"how do I convince Amano join the club?!\" this anime turned out to be another cliche rom-com. \\n\r\nThe only thing we got from these 5 characters is only misunderstanding. here is list of the character ( game club member are excluded because they have nothing to do with the story AT ALL )\\n\r\nA: Amano\\n\r\nT: Tendou\\n\r\nU: Uehara\\n\r\nAg: Aguri\\n\r\nC: Chiaki\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simple: \\n\r\nA loves T\\n\r\nT loves A\\n\r\n(^ these two finally become a couple but it doesn't affect on their stupidity)\\n\r\nU & Ag couple\\n\r\nC loves A\\n\\n\r\nThe misunderstanding:\\n\r\nA thought U loves T (even after A & T become a couple)\\n\r\nT thought A loves C (even after T & A become a couple)\\n\r\nU thought Ag having an affair with A (dude, U & Ag already going out for  half a year and why didn't they even solve this problem in their time after school, like seriously)\\n\r\nAg thought U having an affair with C\\n\r\nC thought A is being played by Ag\\n\\n\r\nso it became a circle of misunderstanding and basically that's what 4-9 episode are look like :)))))))\\n\\n\r\nFor people who rate this anime by 8-10, I believe they rate it when only 3 episodes are released. And if they still rate it 8-10 even after episode 8/ 9 and not disturbed by how U & Ag never talking about this problem in their time, then I don't know if they even understand what they are watching.\\n\r\nIf you are in a relationship, you tend to trust to your partner and if anything seems suspicious you can ask everything you wanted to know about her/ him in a positive way ofc.\\n\\n\r\nI love rom-com anime but I really can't stand with this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nSigh.. this is where the story became boring, generic characters are always fine to me, but this anime definitely have no character development at all. \"Gamers\" really not a suited name for this anime, if they name it by misunderstanding-relate name or rom-com-trouble name maybe it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nEpisode 1 - 3 : I would rate it by 9 especially when they tell us the backstory of Uehara & Aguri lovestory.\\n\r\nEpisode 4 - 9 : \"What the f are they even thinking, you can't be Ichika Orimura all the timeeeeeeee!\"\\n\\n\r\nSeriously guys, at this rate in the next 3 episodes they would not have time to make it decent anime.\\n\r\nPerhaps in the next 3 episodes they just clearing up about the misunderstanding then AmanoxTendou and UeharaxAguri finally having their normal love life and some sh*t quote about being a gamer.\\n\r\nIn the end, that Game Club is totally BS :)))))\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this anime, then don't watch it. It hurts to watch these kind of ppl and their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe good thing from this anime is the Illustration in the end of the episode.",

            "content": "After watching a bunch of anime that has a plot revolving video games, I have come to realize that they aren't that good. I am a huge gamer myself and a lot of the anime out there are about video games, and I tried some of them and they are pure identical. \r\nFor this review I will focus on story/execution, art, characters and my enjoyment (minor spoilers MIGHT lie ahead.)\r\nStory/execution: Like any other video game based anime this one is about a high school boy that is recruited to a gaming club, but his interests aren't in taking video games seriously. First of all, thisshow is not really about \"gaming\", the characters just happen to be gamers, however in fact this show is sort of a love triangle rom-com. The fact that they are gamers is just a stretch and the anime could still exist without the fact that the characters play video games. That aside, this is supposed to be a comedy anime and one of the biggest problems that I have with comedy shows is that they might not be funny, and Gamers perfectly nails not tickling out a single laugh out of me. Plus most of the comedy in this show are just a repetition of comedy from literally any other rom-com. For example the trope where girl thinks her boyfriend is cheating and then his boyfriend thinks the girl is cheating and so on. Besides the failed comedy the best moments that the show actually provides is when it takes a serious tone. That emotional scene where a character tells another character some strong motivating words. In my opinion the series would have worked better as a drama, sadly they focused on the bad comedy instead. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty good for the most parts, it's nothing new though. The character designs and art style is something that we have seen thousands of times but it still manages to keep me invested enough.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: This show tries very hard to make the characters relatable to gamers and for the most part it succeeds. However they succeed by throwing a bunch of unnecessary references here and there to show that they have knowledge about gaming and it feels cheesy at a point. A lot of the times it also completely fails to be relatable at all because of the amount of times they say the word \"gamers.\" I bet nobody in the gaming community would highlight being a gamer as if it was some sort of a profession. However, it's anime and in anime anything goes. Something that I loved about this show is that it acknowledges it's surrounding and puts it to use. What I mean by that is, most shows have the main characters talking at the top of their lungs in a very public place and people around them couldn't care less. However, Gamers on the other hand have the characters actually reacting when our main characters talk very loud. Making the environment more realistic and lively. It's a minor thing but I still liked how they did that.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: The comedy obviously fell flat and bored me out of my mind. However the beautiful art style that I never get sick of, the some what relatable characters and the serious moments persuaded me to keep going.",

The synopsis werent so convincing either but i tried it out of boredom. \r\nTo be honest it is actually very good. The first episode tells us that is would be your typical no friends boy with the most popular girl. But on the later episode it gives us some character development. In terms of character development it is quite unbalanced, one is slower and the other one is faster. \r\nWhat i find interesting from this animeis that it uses all the characters on the right time and for the right purpose. They didnt left the characters in every episode. The comedy used here is also funny and not cringy. \\n\\n\r\nAlso if you are looking for a gaming theme in this anime, dont expect too much. It focuses on the daily life of a gamers instead and not really much on the games. One thing that lacks in this anime is it's clear way of expressing things. This anime is confusing in a way but is still really good\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a good anime for clearing up your boredoms and its story is not that cliche like other romcom anime.

So cleaverly made and so enjoyable. But i had to make my review a bit longer hehe so here we go :P)\r\nThe characters are so realistic, it's amazing to witness the things they think about and how they act and react to situations and to themselves! They are genuine people who're not only focussed on themselves and their lives,but also eachother and what I found very important in Anime is that characters improve themselves, learn from their mistakes and become better people or make good decisions. And that is something this Anime defenitly has! So far I've enjoyed every episode and I would REALLY recomment you give it a go if you like to just relax and laugh your ass off.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10!",

She is a super sute and interesting character, that I really like seeing. She is such an amazing character, so I'm kind of sad that she doesn't appear very much.\r\nAlso Tendou is a very funny character for me, but I guess I like Chiaki better.\r\nThis is a really nice anime and I love the cute art!

            "content": "I will edit this review later on but this is just some of my thoughts on how this series has been so far \r\n      Edit: 9th episode edit:\r\n      To me the first couple episode of Gamers seemed like it would be interesting and more towards actually gamers and gaming but as this series progresses it's as if they've completely forgot about the name of the series and just turned into pointless drama and confusion.\r\n      The confusion and needless drama between the main cast iswhat really broke the series so far for me. Noone knows what's actually going on and even if they are concerned about a misunderstanding that could easily be cleared up with words they just don't even bother to clear it up. It's honestly so frustrating to the point that you just pray every week that the confusion gets cleared up somehow. But it doesn't IT JUST F**k**G continues and even gets worse when they throw in another character. You'd think oh it's fine it looks like misunderstandings are ending in episode 8 but as sooooon as episode 9 roles in oh boy, u guessed wrong. \\n\\n\r\n      For the actual \"Gamers\" theme, Just a little bit of it is provided in each episode. It's mostly used to set up the plot, this and this happened because of games. That's it \\n\\n\r\n      Also i need to mention one thing and that is the filler episode (episode 4). They released it after the cliffhanger of episode 3 so I'm not at all sure why they did it. That episode had nothing important (so far) to the \"plot\" of the story. It was cute seeing the MC and the heroine together but it only leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth instead of being happy that they are spending time with each other. I wouldn't call it pointless character development but badly placed character development\\n\\n\r\n     As the series progresses you can see that the writer is clearly out of creative juices. If he messes up on one or 2 episodes then it's fine but so far it seems like this series is a goner. Not likely that you can save a series this f*cked when you only have 3 episodes left. \\n\\n\r\n    As much as i'd like to like this series, i just can't. It had potential. HAD is the key word. 3/10 uehara faces \\n\\n",

            "content": "Gamers! is one of the Animes released last year that I kind of cancelled out off my watchlist. I often see it here on MAL and on my several Anime communities including a Facebook Group which I am no longer a member of (whoever kicked me out of TGOOPH, your Mum's a hoe) and I get a good glimpse of what the Anime is about. What made me think it wasn't worth watching is because I am not a huge fan of Rom-Coms. Why? It's because most Rom-Coms only focus on the Romantic part and honestly, I have rather sophisticated standards when it comes toAnime Comedy and I often end up disappointed on how other famous, mainstream RomComs deliver humour. So with that being said, I didn't think it was worth my precious time.\\n\\n\r\nDays ago, I stumbled upon Gamers! again on a Telegram channel, and I thought there's nothing to lose if I give it a try so I went on and watched the first episode.\\n\r\nNOW. First episode gave off a full-blown stereotypical high school Rom-Com feel. I felt the *meh especially when a Blond Bishoujo appears before a mediocre-looking loser type MC. I was like;\"Oh great, its a club thing. This shit is going to revolve around club activities and shit. Ugh.\" I was ready to kiss Gamers! ass goodbye once the first episode reaches conclusion but on the last parts of episode one\u2015 BOOM!\\n\r\nOkay, say all you want about how little that certain detail was but that was the part where it got me hooked! \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was kind of a joke, but for me, in a good way. In my opinion, the characters are what really gives life to this Anime in a general perspective. I like the fact that they're all fucking clueless and suspecting and I think its totally stupid and that's what makes it funny for me. \\n\\n\r\nOkay so now, a lot of people are shitting on this Anime because it doesn't focus on the \"Gaming\" part and I can't help but roll my eyes over these comments like, does it really have to focus entirely on gaming just because the title is \"Gamers!\"? What a joke! It's all about a bunch of oblivious, Gamer-Otaku dimwits dealing with relationships. That's all. I think its actually fun that you don't get what you once expected from the Anime. If Animes always turned out to be how you wanted and expected it to be then where's the fun in that? You can't compare Gamers! to NGNL or SAO or Log Horizon or any other Anime that focuses entirely on gaming. It wasn't intended to be an Anime like those in the first place. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I gave it a 9 only because it was hella funny and I needed a cleanse after watching a shounen action-packed Anime. If you want a non-cheap laugh, this one's for you.",

I'd be lying if I said there weren't points where the constant misunderstanding train got extremely frustrating, and often it seems like the entire conflict could be solved if anybody in the story had an ounce of intelligence. However, the later episodes of this first season have started to really build interesting, powerful romances. I can see this working the same slow-burn role as Working!! did with its masterful three-season buildup, so I'm certainly interested in what comesnext, but there are definitely flaws in this show that I'd like to see ironed out in future installments.",

            "content": "Gamers! Is a series that has some good cute and funny moments, but ultimately suffers from a perpetual status quo. It follows tropes found in many romcom animes, though sometimes it manages to put a twist in it that will keep you watching a little longer.\r\n It also has several nods to gaming culture, and the last episode frames an engaging discussion on the pricing of games and DLC, if you don't completely miss it due to the fanservice. The show is good about showing and comparing different kinds of gamers.\r\nI enjoyed the first part of the series, when the misunderstandings were fresh and thegags were unexpected. The stories and relationships were getting really tangled up, but it felt like that it was building to a climax, which the show did provide about halfway through the series. It looked like a clear resolution was coming, but then the plot started to get tangled again, except this time the direction was not as clear, and the characters were making the same mistakes, and the season ended by pausing the tangled storylines and giving us *ahem* distractions. What looked like a cute rom com had turned into kind of a harem perpetuated by lies and assumptions. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that if the show got a second season, no substantial forward progress would be made. I would love to be proven wrong, but considering how similar the gags, misunderstandings, overreactions, and \"fixes that made things worse\" felt the same as the season progressed, I do not have high hopes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fine. The opening is wonderful and the character reactions can be quite fun. I would say it is standard. The characters draw on tropes but have some quirks that make them somewhat interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it wasn't bad, but it did get annoying toward the end. Watch it if you like crazy love triangles/rectangles/pentagons, awkward but cute high school romance, or gamer culture.",

            "content": "(*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*) \r\nI'm...a little torn on this one. On one hand, I really enjoyed the characters in this show, and I enjoyed a lot of the humor...but on the other hand, the plot is pretty repetitive, and pretty much ALL of the conflict in this show feels forced bc the characters don't think of simple things like, idk, communicating?\r\nOkay, so the main character is Keita Amano, a teenage gamer who doesn't have any friends and has a giant crush on Karen Tendou, the prettiest girl in school. Kind of generic, but hey, it's only episode one. Anyway, he's in this game store looking atgames or whatever when Tendou approaches him and invites him to join the high school's gaming club. He considers accepting her offer, but ultimately turns her down bc he finds them to be a little too competitive, inadvertently hurting her feelings. She then falls for him after he defends her from someone who badmouths her. Keita quickly makes friends with another guy, Tasuku Uehara, who initially seems like your typical dumb cool guy character, but is actually revealed to be a former nerd who used to love gaming but chose to give it up in order to become popular. He's pretty likable too, and so is his girlfriend Aguri, a sort of ditzy cat-loving girl with pink hair who we later found out liked Tasuku even before he was \"cool\". Finally, we meet our fifth and final \"main\" character, and my favorite, Chiaki Hoshinomori. She's a aspiring indie game developer and social outcast who Keita befriends in order to practice talking to girls. (See, he wants to get closer to Tendou, but he sucks at talking to girls, so Tasuku suggests he befriend Chiaki in order to practice.) Unbeknownst to the two, they actually already know eachother-see, they both have this online friend they play games with, and it later turns out that Keita is Chiaki's online friend and vice-versa. Anyway, after we meet Chiaki is when things kinda go downhill.\\n\\n\r\nSee, this show is SUPPOSED to be about Gamers, right? Well, it's really not. Rather, it uses gaming as a sort of platform to carry a really generic, stupidly complicated love story that creates drama inorganically and frustrates the viewer. Don't get me wrong, it's kind of funny at first, and the characters are overall pretty likable...but they'd be more likable if they just TALKED more, instead of what they actually do, which is create misunderstanding on top of misunderstanding. The overarching plot of the show is that the five main characters form a sort of weird love pentagon, and they all incorrectly assume that the person they like actually likes this person or that person. (For example, Keita begins hanging out with Aguri a lot after Tasuku starts acting kinda weird, so Tasuku starts to suspect that Aguri is cheating on him with Keita and that Keita is therefore betraying him.) Like I said, it starts out funny, but the jokes gets old pretty fast. It's hard to get invested in this plotline when the characters never stop to ask the obvious questions, and when they do, the other characters make really dumb mistakes and explain their situation in a way that actually makes them look MORE guilty. What begins as a fun gag quickly devolves into a repetitive mess, and the characters seriously never learn to just sit down and confront eachother about their suspicions in order to sort things out. Again, I don't dislike these characters at all, but I'd like them a heck of a lot more if they would just make smarter choices, and if the writing wasn't so darn repetitive. And maybe it'd be better if it had more to do with gaming, too. I stand by what I said about gaming being more or less just a backdrop, the characters will occasionally throw some weird gaming lingo into their dialogue and videogames factor into the overall plot of one or two episodes, but for the most part, again, it's just kind of an afterthought. What it really feels like is that the guy who wrote the light novels this is based on came up with an idea for a romance story, but then he realized it was kinda generic so he decided to make the characters all gamers to try to help it stand out. Replace the gaming in the show with some kind of popular Japanese sport like baseball or soccer, and the show really wouldn't stand out at all, it'd just be another generic high school anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character in the show is by far Chiaki, I really enjoyed her character overall. She has this big subplot towards the end of the season where she finds out Keita is her secret e-friend or whatever, and she ends up falling for him. But he's already kinda with Tendou, so she tries to break them up only to selflessly decide to leave them be and hide her feelings for him in the end. I actually found this to be incredibly relatable, and it honestly frustrates me that Chiaki DIDN'T end up with Keita. Don't get me wrong, I like Tendou as a character, but she doesn't have that much chemistry with Amano imo. The only thing they really have in common in videogames, and the only reason Tendou even likes him is because he defended her once and she found it kinda charming. With Chiaki, they actually have a connection, and she likes him because of said connection and how he's always supported her in her endeavors as an aspiring developer, even if he didnt realize it was her the whole time. Honestly, even though I didnt enjoy this anime very much, I'm still really interesting in seeing if it gets a second season, just bc I wanna see Chiaki and Keita end up together. Like I said, I dont hate Karen as a character, but she's just not a good fit for Keita imo. She's be a much better fit with someone else, I think. As for Tasuku and Aguri, they're both pretty adorable together, I wouldnt pair them with anyone else. \\n\\n\r\nDo I reccomend \"Gamers!\"? Yes and no. I'd reccomend it but only for the comedy and music. The actual plot is pretty infuriating, the whole \"love pentagon\" thing gets really stale by the end, and in the end I think the protagonist ends up with the wrong girl. Like I said, they could always fix that in a second season, but if the ending of the show is any indication this is a definitely one of those \"read the manga/light novel endings\" where the anime is more or less an advertisement and not a full adaptation, and even if there is a season two there's no guaruntee that they wont just keep Tendou and Amano together. I havent read the light novels since they havent translated them into English as far as I know, so I'm not sure whether they stay together or they go a different route. \\n",

            "content": "This story defied my expectations, I expected Amano in the first episode to join the game club and that would be the start of the story, but instead that's not what happens and the story takes a turn in the opposite direction. It was well executed and my expectations were defied many times which kept me hooked. I wasn't the most fond of the voice actor they choose for Amano because he sounded too much like a pre-pubescent girl, but that was easy to look past. Uehara was a great friend to Amano. I wish I saw more of a progression in the relationship ofAmano and Chiaki though. Overall, great show! I would watch a 2nd season if and or when it comes out.",

The actual anime has little to almost nothing about gaming actually.This review is about how disappointing the experience was.\r\nStory : The story is nothing special. It's the regular high school romance but this time it's about gamers I actually doubt that the story has a meaning at all. It's a manifest of misunderstandings all the way from the beginning to the end. Let me explain, each one of the characters comes up with conclusions based on the tiniest things. It's funny at the beginning, but asthe story progresses it becomes repetitive and irritating.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Probably the major breakthrough this anime has. The scenery is beautiful and relaxing and you get a vibe of the care that was put into the drawings.\\n\r\nCharacter development: Don't expect too much of it since the misunderstandings take over any possibility of that.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts : Gamers! is a good anime, might not be the best in summer 2017, but it still is enjoyable to watch. I might have had big expectations for this anime, to at least have some interesting gaming moments, but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. If you simply want a humorous experience with a relaxing vibe, then you might like it.",

It was fun, but I was expecting way more out of it. It might just be me, I guess I didn't really know what I was getting into. The good thing was that it was absolutely hilarious, but it seemed that they used up most of their funniness in the first few episodes.\r\nArt: I found nothing wrong with the art. It was nothing special, but I liked the parts with the commentaries on the screen andstuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was a bit repetitive, but I didn't mind because there was a lot of dialogue. Also, I liked the random sound effects they chose.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were pretty good, but they didn't really seem real. They just do stupid stuff and they don't really learn any lessons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a six out of ten. It was funny but I got my hopes up a bit too much. Maybe if I re-watched it I would like it more.",

Overall this anime has alot of Issues and problems that are very apparent but I still enjoy this anime a good reason why is because I am a sucker for anything really romance related.",

Seriously. \r\nFirstly, gaming has absolutely nothing to do with anything except a premise for how these people meet. That's not a huge deal, except the anime makes it out to be otherwise, so it's blatantly misleading. \r\nThe first two episodes were relatively enjoyable; itsets up some interesting or somewhat unique choices in animation, and some of the characters didn't turn out to be who I was expecting. With that said, later episodes drag each character through the mud to the point of it being physically painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime rests entirely on the premise of five people, three of whom are normally extremely skilled in navigating social situations, being unable to communicate with one another. It was incredibly predictable, and not in the familiarly-reassuring way. It's not believable, it's not cute, it's stupid.",

            "content": "Gamers is a decent anime, with no real flaws or screw ups. Heck, it's even pleasing to watch, and is deserving of a rewatch sometime in the future. However, to be truthful, despite the enjoyment i have of watching the show initially, it became painfully clear that Gamers was not the anime i expected it to be. I don't mean it in a bad way, nor a good way. I will elaborate in the story section. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN I DID NOT ENJOY IT\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe first major thing that caught my attention to watch this was the title itself, Gamers. In the synopsis, itsaid that Tendou wants to recruit Amano into the gaming club, leading Amano to find a side to gaming that he loved contrary to what the gaming club does. Sure, the premise seems intriguing so far. A daily life of wild, unexpected changes to the protagonist life, yeah, it's normal. However, with the title and synopsis talking about the gaming club and protagonist who loves gaming, i fully expected it to be about a gaming genre. Sure, there were references to gaming in the show, and all of the characters love gaming. However, as i watched on, the show felt more like a confusing love pentagon than it is a gaming genre anime. In fact, by the end of half the series, i became convinced this show had almost nothing to do with gaming other than the references made and minor gaming challenges, which did not comprise of even 30% of the entire show. Yes, it is funny and kinda creative to have an idea for a confusing love scenario entangling every characters, and i did enjoy the anime quite a lot. But, i was really disappointed in the way they derailed off the gaming genre, especially with the HUGE misleading title, Gamers. With most anime fans like me, the first and main thing that attracts them is always the title, synopsis, and trailer debuts. That was even how i got into gamers, just judging by the title itself had me intrigued. Needless to say, i was let down when i found out about this. Otherwise, this anime is actually nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot really anything special to mention here. Points for the side notes marking future character developments, and hinting at future plot storylines.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 9, for the very very VERY simple fact that i just loved the interlude melody. The first time i heard it, it was like i was taken back to my childhood gaming era, where everything was in an 16 bit graphic. The music was electronic, yet simplistic, and just full of that retro gaming feel in the modern gaming era. That 5 second interlude was enough to fill me with waves of excitement as a gamer, who spent his childhood years gaming. The op was ok, and ed was not bad, but the real reason i gave it 9 was just that interlude. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 (very minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nThere will be 2 kinds of people for this. People who LOVES the characters, or absolutely HATES them. There's not going to be any in between since most of the character build are the same, from genius Tendou Karen, to moe moe Aguri, in the sense that they are ALL DENSE!!! EVERY CHARACTER OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS SHOW ARE UNBELIEVABLY DENSE. Not kidding. If you love characters who have no idea who likes them, gets jealous over every little thing, evolves every single simple thing into something chaotically confusing, you will love them. Honestly, i don't find much of a problem, the similar character traits is what made the show funny, especially when all of them misunderstands a very simple exchange for something so chaotic i never even believed could exist in a romantic comedy saved for the harem genre. Baseline, they are funny, albeit quite annoying, especially Amano. All of the others are arguably  more likeable and funnier than Amano, especially Aguri and Tasuku xD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i quite enjoyed this show saved for the misleading premise and confusing, next to meaningless romantic misunderstandings. It would make hell of a romantic comedy if they redirected it towards that genre though, since the premise for it is actually really fitting and good.",

So the Overall Score I gave is 6. The main reason is that the whole story revolves around the 5 characters misunderstanding the feelings of each other. There are some gags that are hilarious due to these misunderstanding but still it is very exhausting watching them misunderstand each other. \r\nAnd what is very annoying in this anime is that these misunderstanding were not cleared and the story keeps on progressing until the last episodetherefore it makes you wonder why they still keep their relationship if they think their love one like the other.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the Art and Sound of this anime is outstanding, the art of the female protagonists are very cute and their details are very exquisite =))",

And don't even get me started on that OP. Overall I feel that the reviews that talk about the bad should give this anime another chance. In my opinion this is the best anime of 2017 and maybe even my favoriteanime. I know I have bad opinions (I used to think that Charlotte was the best anime).",

Honestly this was quite an interesting part of the Anime in the first episode and I thought: hey maybe he will get better at gaming and become some very good Gamer. \r\nSo I kept watching the first episode and at some point I was really excited likea little child because there is a so-named Game-Club. Nothing special you think? Oh I tell you it's an amazing club because the goal of the club is to win tournaments and make money with it. Basically ESPORTS!! I mean there even was a CS:GO copy!\\n\\n\r\nI was like \"Yeah an ESports Anime, that's what I was waiting for! \\n\r\nBUT then the main character get asked by his crush (who also is in the Game Club btw.) if he wants to join the club and get better at Gaming. \\n\r\nGuess what his answer was? \\n\r\nIT WAS A F***** NO.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the point where I knew this is going to be some stupid rom-com again and not even a special one..\\n\r\nI continued to watch it but it really didn't get any better...So sad\\n\r\nBoring story\\n\r\npoor characters \\n\\n\r\nWell and that's it.

            "content": "Mannnn, I really expected more of this anime, the art seemed so cute and all. Too bad it went to waste with its incoherent plot. A real shame!\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nFirstly, what the *? What am I watching here? At first, I thought that it was gonna be another one of those good rom coms with an awkward main protagonist that is greatly immersed in the gaming world. And well, I was right \u2014 except for the \"good\" part. The first few episodes were pretty cute, with the main character being oblivious to what the girl was on about (clich\u00e9.) His attitude was on point as towhat I had expected, which isn't all that bad. \\n\\n\r\nBut then it continued. The main character kept being oblivious, swirling into a blackhole of absolute oblivion of no return. Misunderstandings after misunderstandings, as soon as it comes undone, another rivals up to annoy us audiences.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI mean, yeah. The art is pretty cute, has that generic shounen quality to it. The character designs are not all that unique, but it represents the character's assigned personas, which is always nice. The color palette is pretty cute, which a slight pastel hue added to it, which I love.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't all that memorable, so I'm just gonna say that it was mediocre. It didn't pop out instantaneously for me, although it has its pop of cuteness, which accents the comedy aspect of the anime. The silly yet melodic soundtracks are pretty typical, to say the least, but it gave enhanced aesthetics of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis relates to the storyline perspective of the series, but yet here I go again. There was only one, yes, out of masses of characters that were placed into this anime, one that was not awfully unaware of the situation that was unfolding. And guess what, most of the time, he didn't act on it unless it benefitted his own relationship in any way. Seeing the characters interacting with one another was frustrating, and I couldn't take any more of that, which is, well, the reason I dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally felt a t t a c k e d when things simply refused to go the \"right\" way. To put it simply, it was a thwarting experience. What did keep me going was my urge to not leave the problematic situations that were occurring incomplete \u2014 but I couldn't take it anymore. Maybe I'm just not a very patient person.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nGod, I wouldn't willingly recommend this to anybody, to be honest. But if you can tolerate a few frustrating moments, it's a humorous anime with its cute moments as well. Personally, it was just terrifying (how oblivious the author could make all of these characters) but looking back, I guess it wasn't that bad.",

I saw the intro with all the games in it and expected something like \"Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?\" But instead of only an RPG with different games. Sounds stupid but that is how I came to this anime.\r\nAnd to a certain extend they are similar.  Nerdy guy loves games and a hot girl approaches him and invites him to join the schools Games Club. Here I though \"hey it is similar to Netoge were there was also this Game Club were they are playing comupter games\" But this is about it. In Gamers! the Game Clubis more like a door opener for the story to come. The characters you meet in this Club are totally insignificant. You will see them the first three (?) episodes and after that who cares. They don't matter at all. I mean really. Don't even bother to remember their names. \\n\r\nThe rest of the show is more like a dating sim. Hot girl falls in love with the nerdy guy. Some misunderstandings later Aguri thinks Uehara cheats on her, And much more. In one episode Aguri even made a chart with all the relations she thinks the characters are in. \\n\r\nIt is a mess. \\n\r\nAnd from episode 3 on they try to solve this mess. Honestly it is a bit too stupid. Sure it has its funny moments, all in all not my type of show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd wtf have they done with the last episode? This episode has nothing to do with the rest of the episodes. They are basically just sitting together and discussing about the price policy of games and wether DLCs are a good thing or just money grabbing bs. This Episode had more to do with games than the last 7.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Trying to watch this series was so frustrating to me, for many reasons.  First there's the whole (false) premise of the series.  This seemed so misleading because what I expected was a story centered around video games and the interactions resulting from them.  But what I got instead was an overly drawn out story about misunderstandings with the fact that they are gamers being a side thought.  It really seemed like they were struggling to figure out how to drag the story on longer.\r\nWhich brings me to my next point.  The story.  It doesn't go anywhere.  I foundmyself at the end thinking \"This story hasn't advanced at all, it is in the exact same place it was at the beginning\".  Just when you think something is going to be resolved and the story will move forward, it just turns right around and goes right back to where it was.  Right when a misunderstanding is seemingly about to be resolved, it just gets stronger and more tangled.  It does this over and over.  Sure, there were some parts where the story did move a little, but even then it felt stagnant because the way the characters acted around each other never changed as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were poorly written as well.  Sure, I get what they were trying to go for.  Super anxious teens that get into awkward encounters because they don't understand their own feelings quite yet.  But they went way overboard with it.  I expected them to be super awkward with each other at the beginning, but get more comfortable with each other as time went on.  That didn't really happen.  Sure, there were times the characters interacted seamlessly, but it was always short lived.  This was especially annoying seeing the couple that had been together for a while that were so uncomfortable around each other that they couldn't talk about their feelings with each other.  Yes, awkwardness happens with teens, but not this much.",

They didn't explain if she gave up or not, they go from ep.11 where she tries her hardest to try to spend some alone time with him and have a dialogue with him that kinda says how she feels about him then they drop the subject completely the last episode. The last episode had nothing todo with the plot of the show at all, it didn't advance the story one bit. The plot was a giant misunderstanding that was annoying to watch and I'm sure a majority of us waited it out to see if the ending was worth it but the ending was irrelevant to the plot. Ok character development and the art style wasn't bad but this is an easily forgettable show that a lot of us will add to our indexes",

A Light Novel adaptation about a gamer otaku that actually bad at gaming and the life he lives. The story is a slice-of-life, school, comedy, romance theme so, the story is not too heavy to absorb even by a half-brainer. There's a relationship going on from the very first episode but they put misunderstanding into the mix (making the story hard to watch at some point. But, if you intend to watch this, you'll get over it) It serves a pretty relaxing story and a lovable character.The art is not so good in my opinion. I watch 85 anime (with this 86 on my list) and the art here is just lower than average. I gave a 6 for the art. The characters are pretty interesting since the story makes them so. There's a wide variety of unorthodox cast here such as a combination of tsundere and deredere school beauty who fall for an extremely regular boy, a full-blown deredere girl that was too oblivious about a lot of thing, a tsundere that doesn't resort to violence when needed, an ordinary MC, and a jack-of-all-trades wingman.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good only for relaxation.

This is a feat not seen since Kimi Ni Todoke, a show which I also forgave due to memorable character design, animation, and music.\r\nThe misunderstandings in this show are painful towatch. Every episode has at least one scenario which it would be impossible for the misunderstanding to continue, but nothing gets cleared up anyway because the writers need to milk it for several more episodes. Hooray, plot convenience! This is not to say the show isn't funny - there are some pretty great jokes and hilarious scenes - but they are not worth sitting through the show. Most of us are anime otaku and video gamers, and this show is counting on you wanting to watch it on that fact alone... do not fall for it! There are better shows to waste your time on. Any decent scenes will inevitably show up as clips on your facebook feed, saving you the pain I endured.",

You\u2019ll like it if you enjoy the dramatic irony of characters agonizing over misunderstood lines and situations.  You\u2019ll dislike it if you wanted a serious focus on gaming, though Gamers! handles gaming in mature and non-cringey way (which I appreciated).  There\u2019s also not much as much character or relationship development as I had hoped for, so here\u2019s hoping for a second season!\r\nNote that gaming is not really the focus of the anime, but rather the string that ties ourcast together. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are good, especially so during ridiculous or emotional scenes.  I felt like the voicing was really, really good \u2013 certain vocal quirks build up some characters very well, and comedic scenes benefit greatly from characters audibly freaking out.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend for the great voice acting and silly romantic confusion.  Certain scenes are very sweet and well worth the watch if you enjoy that kind of thing like me.  Don\u2019t watch if you find misunderstandings frustrating, because that\u2019s really all the anime does.\\n",

LA is now something of a retro gamer as of late. What does this have to do with Gamers!, because Gamers! is relatable....to an extent.\r\nIf there was one statement LA would place on Gamers! plot, it would be \"a snowballing misunderstandings love dodecahedron with gamers of all sorts\". Now it's not a bad thing but it's also a good thing in a sense. As such, the misunderstandings the main cast goes through do let us see both sidesof the misunderstandings however the main cast do make the situation worse or are just dense to a degree, for a good side of all these misunderstandings is that characters who usually didn't interact with one anther start interacting with them and develop a friendship or relationships with one another. However the misunderstandings do at times interrupt the interesting gaming situations it does have and becomes more of a hindrance to the gaming atmosphere for characters quietly bickering or snowballing the misunderstandings even more for the sake of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters themselves, Aguri voiced by Rumi Ookubo is something of a casual gamer and is in love with Tasuku Uehara voiced by Toshiyuki Toyonaga who wants peace in the snowballing love dodecahedron, Aguri also has a friendly friendship with our main protagonist Keita Amano voiced by Megumi Han, a gamer who love playing ANY kind of games, whether he sucks at it or not in which he grabs the heart of Karen Tendou voiced by Hisako Kanemoto and the president of the school's game club and finally Chiaki Hoshinomori voiced by Manaka Iwami who Tasuku introduces her to Keita and they have a friendly tsundere relationship with each other. You can expect even from this that a love dodecahedron forms quite quickly. LA's favourite characters would be a tie between Aguri and Karen in this anime and no not even they are immune for them to START a misunderstanding let alone be targeted to one as well. As for Keita...yeah LA agrees that he's dense as hell at times but it isn't entirely his fault as multiple misunderstandings causes him to do what he does at times, Tasuku is an instigator but a peaceful yet karmic one at that and Chiaki just kinda took too long before her friendly tsundere relationship with Keita to be a more romantic one not to mention Chiaki caused a misunderstanding herself with Keita involving her younger sister Konoha voiced by Yuuki Kuwahara that made it worse as an extent...thus it felt like for LA that she'll never get closer to Keita even though she DID get closer to Keita as a result, just not as closer as Aguri (friendship) and Karen (relationship).\\n\\n\r\nThe gaming elements of Gamers! however is a decent watch where they make fun of games for comedy sakes but know in certain detail about the games in question, also the dialogue about gaming does transition into real life in many ways from how \"certain\" gamers act to that finale about DLC's and the many viewpoints of DLC's. LA isn't gonna say that Gamers! knows everything about gamers thus it MUST be relatable to gamers, LA is saying to CERTAIN gamers it does become relatable, misunderstandings of the characters in question not withstanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Pine Jam is pretty decent from the gaming aesthetics of the games that are referenced in Gamers!, the character designs are pretty distinct with the backgrounding being well done overall. If there was anything the animation did well, it is the gaming aesthetics will reel you in, character designs being secondary well for LA anyways.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, well Megumi Han crossdressing is good though it's not her vocals that are annoying but her character traits, LA really like Hisako Kanemoto and Rumi Ookubo as Karen and Aguri respectively. Manami Iwami was pretty unique in voicing Chiaki in a ways a striked something for LA and enjoyed her vocals, however best voice actor goes to Rumi Ookubo as Astolf- *ahem* Aguri...her genkiness is infectious!.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale?....misunderstandings are still going with relationships not patched up from those misunderstandings and instead we get a hot springs gaming DLC trip yeaaaah this being an adaptation from a light novel, LA was expecting no resolution from this besides Keita's beliefs of always having fun with games being the last message to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nGamers! is a definite tightrope act with it's flaws and strengths and sometimes vice versa having strengths and weakness they have as a result. Does Gamers! misunderstandings ruin the characters into making them idiots and NOT gamers, yes and no, yes as it makes characters look idiots and diverts the gaming element to it, but no in that it develop characters we didn't expect them interact with to interact with them and become friends and talk about gaming more but it's also no on doing misunderstandings correctly without it being annoying, Tsuredure Children in the same season did that right and NOT be annoying. Does Gamers! look at ALL gaming elements to a gamer, hell no, but it tries to be relatable to a certain group of gamers as well having certain degree of trivia and knowledge about gaming in general and to be able to be cheeky and funny about it's comedy using gaming as an element was nicely done. Gamers! is misunderstood in many ways from it's snowballing love dodecahedron misunderstandings, but it has it's own solid gaming personality about itself and that just isn't enough for LA to hate it...LA just can't.",

Same for sound.\r\nI enjoyed the references to Video Games thoroughly. Seeing some of my favorites on screen made them enjoyable but I understand why some don't like it. \r\nIt's a story about teens who have dumb romantic relationships that are all loosely connected through games. \r\nTendou is a boring character. Main character guy is a boring character. Uehara starts as an interesting straight-man type so he passes. Chiaki and Aragi are the only realized characters and I really like them for that. Their motivations areclear and I genuinely could relate to them (even if they cause stupid misunderstandings all the time for literally no reason). Tendou, I could understand as well but her motivations and character as a whole are genuinely obnoxious. Main character guy has no real reason to like her, she has no real reason to like him. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the relationship of \"Main Girl\" and \"Main Guy\" this show is pointless and is only really offensive because the plot revolves around pointless misunderstandings, as well as wraps up a couple of generally likable characters (Uehara, Chiaki and Aragi) in there, wake. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was perfectly mediocre. \\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers* Don't read on if you care (which you really shoudln't) \\n\\n\r\nThe last episode was a complete waste of time. Once you see Chiaki find our main character guy is her online friend, close your browser and go do something else.",

            "content": "The aspect I really like most about this show is the characters. They're all pretty likable, especially Tendou. The down side to that is that they're all pretty stupid. Each them keeps assuming the worst of each other romantically, and to be honest it got old after the first three or so episodes when the premise started. \r\nFor this reason, the storyline is pretty damn bad. It's really repetitive and gets old fast, even to the point of frustration. The only reason why I rated the show a 7 is because the characters were good.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the characters are all pretty solid. Amano,the MC, is probably my least favorite due to the fact that he's the densest of them all. He can't pick out the most obvious social cues. He might have no experience in that stuff at all, but he seems to know how to act in certain situations and not in others. To be honest, it seems like the writers made this for serious plot convenience. On the flip side though, Tendou, the main love interest, is goddamn adorable. My favorite character in the series. Even though she's pretty much perfect in every aspect, she loses her composure in Amano's presence and even when he's not there either. I still don't really know what she sees in Amano, but that'll probably get explained eventually. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the plot in itself, my other concern with this series is the order of arcs that this anime decided to go with (though it's likely based on the LN). Episode 12 seemed disjointed and ill-fit to be the finale. Meanwhile, episode 11 had more closure, and did a better job in cementing the relationship drama that was plaguing the series for the entire season. It was weird going from 11 to 12, where the characters just went back to bickering about relationships and getting into the same misunderstandings as usual.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a nitpick, but I don't really know why people say this show is an accurate description of gamers. Growing up in NYC from age 8-18 (2003-2013), I was never called a nerd in a derogatory manner. Gaming wasn't that niche, and it's been growing in terms of popularity over the last two decades. In high school, this stuff was practically popular. To be fair though, I wasn't at the top of the social food chain (being in the middle is the most accurate description). This is also NYC, a pretty developed city by social and societal standards (stuff like students talking back to teachers is really rare), so that could have an effect. This is all anecdotal. It could be different for other people who grew up at the same time as I did. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd recommend checking out this show. It's not exactly the best in terms of romance, because the characters spin in circles, but it's pretty funny at the same time. You'll get frustrated, but it's also really satisfying when things finally go where they're supposed to.",

To put it plainly, this is one of the most frustrating animes I have ever seen. \r\nThe premise starts off interesting: A \"loner otaku\" gets invited to a gaming club but rejects the invitation as it does not satisfy what he truly enjoys about video games(the loner aspect). That premise only held interest in the show for the length of 3-4 episodes, and then it turns into an abominable mess of misunderstandings. This on its own is fine by me since you have to build a plot from somewhere,especially when it comes to rom-coms. The issue for me was that the entire plot then became about various misunderstandings that could have all been solved through one measly conversation. BUT NO FUCK THAT MAYBE THE CHARACTERS SHOULD TAKE ANY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT OR ACTION AND TWIST IT TO BE AS CONTEXTUALLY NEGATIVE AS POSSIBLE. THAT MAKES FOR STELLAR STORYTELLING. MAYBE THE CHARACTERS SHOULD ALSO BE AS BRAIN-DEAD STUPID AS POSSIBLE AS WELL. YEAH I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

            "content": "So in my blurry semi-wakefulness I accidentally wrote what I thought was the perfect review for this anime after watching the latest episode! *clears throat*\r\n\"GYAHAHA!!! Gamers! never ceases to make me repeatedly hit the surface of something in gleeful amusement. It's turned into something entirely different to what seemed to be the original premise and I just can't wait to see just how far the author can take this BS!\"\r\nAnd trust me, there is a lot of BS.\r\nLet me explain with a little more depth (or go watch it before I spoil you with pure reasoning):\r\nSo we start the anime with a certain Amano Keitawho seems to basically be the relatable facade of our own gaming selves personified. At this point, everyone (who hasn't read the synopsis) will assume this anime will be a lovely ball of relatableness for us gamers. And then they introduce more characters who are themselves other types of gamers. The title is perfect, this will be an anime about different types of gamers and how they get along! All hopefully, without the stereotypical 12 year old who screams murder at everyone else when the team loses except perhaps, as a fleeting cameo and a joke in the backdrop. Perfect, riiiight? \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the first misunderstanding the creator of this work made was the one with the viewers, while he brazenly sets up the real show in broad daylight.\\n\\n\r\nSo... this is a good time for you to go watch it, rather than reading the rest of the review. And I can't decide whether you're lucky buggers or unfortunate bastards, because by now, you probably don't have to wait a week for every episode! I'll leave you to interpret that statement by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the snowball started rolling, most of us probably didn't catch on immediately... because who actually writes a story like that?! When misunderstandings are usually either solved quickly which furthers character development or dragged on into excruciating eternity. I'm too amused at the entire situation to be ashamed that I didn't catch on quickly enough. One of the many misunderstandings in a complex web gets dissolved and many more take its place, piggybacking on the different social awkwardnesses of each unique gamer (oh, the title didn't lie, it's just misunderstood). Although the characters that were introduced in the first episode... they're just... kind of not really there, since they're not the focus of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI just love it. It's brilliant, bombastic, lighthearted fun, all at the expense of the characters. An anime Midsummer Night's Dream turned up to eleven if you will. \\n\r\nIf you're an Amano, you'll just enjoy it for what it is. \\n\r\nIf you're a Tendou, you'll get serious and then don't understand what the fuss is about.\\n\r\nIf you're an Uehara, you would probably get salty over stuff out of your control. \\n\r\nA Hoshinomori is going to get absolutely annoyed over all the trickery this anime has thrown at you (I think there's probably a lot of these)\\n\r\nAnd an Aguri... might just stay blissfully unaware. \\n\r\nDid I get the characters right? I hope I did xD",

So, she shows the club to him, members introduce themselves. Oh well, I know where are we going, I guess this is going to be about this guy creating relationships with allthe members, well, no problem with that, I actually enjoyed the comedy so far so..\\n\\n\r\nWa..wait a minute.. did he just? rejected the invitation!?!?! BUT WHY ? ARE YOU STUPID? OH LOOK! HE IS THINKING THE SAME! \\n\\n\r\nWell, definitely he is stupid, idk where this is going, wait.. he is actually giving her actual reasons, wow! I really understand this guy!\\n\\n\r\nBeing pretty much a casual player, I understood his point perfectly though if this was enough reason to not join the club is debatable.\\n\\n\r\nOk episode 2 now, well I guess, she'll find a way to convince him to actually start what this anime is about, his life in the club. Oh wow, this Uehara guy is yelling hard at him, well, this should be enough to convince him to join the.. WAIT! OUR MC DOESN'T GIVE UP! OUR MC IS GIVING HIM A PIECE OF HIS MIND! YEAH! \\n\\n\r\nAnd look! the perfect girl falled completely for our mc due to his manly action!\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is how I fell for the anime, I haven't talked about the former couple, but they are also seem important and fun to watch so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode 3 and 4 don't have more of these moments, pretty much because the characters and where this anime is going is already settled. Also, I must be honest, yelling for the jokes so much started to annoy me a little. But I still found it really fun overall and worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to finish my \"why I like this\" kind of review, I feel very related to this feeling of \"I don't want to commit to it\" of the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the blue-haired girl is awesome too.\\n",

            "content": "It is heavily based on misunderstandings due to back communication skills that you can see coming from a mile away. I won't lie to you about that. It is what it is, and some people won't get much past that if that breaks their immersion. You will find an incredibly funny and light story about true geeks of a wide variety learning to deal with their weirdness and overcoming some of their personal fears and anxieties.\r\nAs a very light comedy, don't expect to dive into the feels like you would with the big Slice of Life names you all know. When you watch this youwill see people change their views of: others, themselves, life goals, relationships. All for the better, and all very naturally through events that were shown to happen. The word \"naturally\" does assume that you're fine with my first paragraph...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not formulaic, even if they do fit into some sort or archetype. The protagonist is very bland, but much more in a sheltered and realistic kind of way. How you would expect a softspoken, short and shy otaku. Not at all like the blend spineless protagonists we get once in a while. He tries harder than he should to please people, but he's not without opinion and doesn't get pushed around by the very outspoken people around him, who eventually become his friends.\\n\\n\r\nOnly one of the main 6 characters is not a gamer, but she's still a weirdo in her own way, and both of these facts are put to great use in the plot. One of the 6 main is a huge fan of eroge and dating sims, and she's pretty much the emotionally smartest character. Unfortunately she is a bit of a side character, considering the other 5 are the ones that really carry the plot in every episode, but her participation is brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"cool guy best friend\" does follow a pattern more than the rest of them, but the writing behind the character is nothing to pass on. He cares a lot for his buddy Main Character, and is able to see through a lot of the main misunderstandings. He tries his hardest to course correct the group's inevitable explosion of mistrust, but due to his own lack of communication skills, combined with him taking sides on the Best Girl War for his buddy MC, he fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nI won't explain anything about the Best Girl War, because if you've read this far and you haven't watched this, you should stop wasting time here and go watch it. Okay, maybe I'll leave it at: both combatants are incredibly different and I'm of the opinion that The Best Girl For the MC, is not The Best Girl.   ___    In fact, The Best Girl may even be 'The Best Girl for the 'The Best Girl For the MC' '. If you found that confusing, than you should also stop wasting time here and watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note: there's some very out of place fan service, that may catch you by surprise, but it wasn't too bad to get me uncomfortable or anything.",

            "content": "When you see the title of this anime you'll probably expect an anime about gamers and you will see some gamers in the show, but the main character is not one of them. I never thought an anime could piss me off this much, but when they call people that mostly play mobile games \"gamers\" I knew this anime was gonna piss me off. A more honest title for this show which could have made it even somewhat acceptable is \"gamers\" instead of gamers implying that they're not gamers at all which they're not. \r\nThe story largely revolves around the concept of romance and whatnotand portrays it poorly at that. There's practically zero gaming or gaming related things in this series, so you might be deceived. I would be fine with the romance, but I don't see how any female could ever be attracted to the protagonist unless he got Scrooge McDuck levels of rich.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the most dis-likable character in the show is the protagonist you know you've done something wrong unless he is meant to be hated in which case I applaud the effort. Amano Keita is the equivalent of the people that play mobile games like angry birds exclusively and call themselves gamers. I don't think there's a single character trait he has that is likable, he's basically a walking \"punch me\" sign.   \\n\\n\r\nIn summary if you expect any good romance, something that will make you laugh or something gaming related you'll be left pissed off.",

            "content": "\"Gamers\" has a unique curve of quality.  The beginning of the show is amazing and it seems to only get better until the viewer nears a midpoint where all of the characters have met each other and the love pentangle begins.  The show surprisingly picks back up and closes in an elegant finish in the last two episodes, supporting the potentiality of the show had it not focused on the heavy love story.\r\nI loved the show for all of the gaming references and vivid characters.  There is no denying that the writers had a great understanding of what it is like tobe a gamer.  The only, and I do mean only, bad thing about the show was the middle where the love pile is overly focused on.  If characters could proceed through regular actions and the love story was a side gig, the show would have been excellent; the potential of the show is especially evidenced in the last episode where the characters just interact and talk about video games during a regular trip.  The writers even wrapped up the drama in an excellent way, where all of the characters seem to look past paranoia or pressures of love and enjoy themselves.  The parade scene that wraps up the main story arc was especially written with a lot of care and detail that some people may not have caught - I felt like this scene resolved any conflict in the show and opened up gateways to possible future outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nI do not know who decided to put so much focus on the love story, but if it had not been piled on so thick, the show had the potential of earning a 10/10.  I would be very interested to see the creators make a slice-of-life show based on the last episode's ability to bring up interesting arguments, use clever word plays, and write in a way such that the characters are self-aware they are part of a television show.  The music, art, sound, characters, and enjoyment were all held back merely by the love story and I would love to see the creators' next big projects.",

            "content": "Soooooooooooo.....Yup......Gamers is the anime i'll be reviewing today and...It has an exclamation mark at the end, as you can probably see..If you're blind i'm sorry can't help you with that.\r\nAnd where to start really? Maybe with the story? Yeah let's go with that and see how it plays out..\r\nOk then, the story is about gam...No it isn't actually. You see my dear friends this anime apart from the first and maybe the last episode where they vaguely talk about games, is a rom-com kinda deal. So the anime starts with Amano Keita-one of the most basic lads in anime-who,one fateful day,meets the Gamer Club PresidentTendo Karen..And SHE is not basic at all..In fact i'd say she is a solid fucking 8.\\n\\n\r\nNow before you call me names you'll regret cause i'm one to bite back and bite hard, i mention the rankings because Karen falls for the beta male and basic as fuck protagonist..What a surprise, right? Well no..Cause Karen as it happens invited Keita to her club and the next thing you know is he rejected her with a killer smile and that was that..She was head over heels for him. And that is actually very realistic cause people always want what they can't have..It becomes an obssession of some sorts which leads to broken marriages and one parent families and kids starting cocaine and robbing marts and raping old ladies in dark alleys..You know, the small things.\\n\\n\r\nThen Karen starts stalking the brave knight while he gets to live a life full of naked and willing otaku gamer girls, who are there to please his needs, no matter how sick they are..I guess sick here means playing a video game other than Candy Crush?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd from there starts a whatfuckery the world has yet to witness the likes of. All you need to know is that there are couples and every single individual thinks that their other half is cheating on them when in reality they don't..I wonder if the writers actually wanted to make an anime about a swingers club but the studio wanted to make it more family friendly,which is another word for no fun.\\n\\n\r\nOh and remember that club i mentioned earlier? Well that club and indeed it's 2 other senior members are nowhere to be seen after the first episode, which is a shame really cause one of them was a girl and let me tell you that bird had titties the size of a planet.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the love octagon..Other than the 2 cast members i mentioned earlier there are also some other characters such as Tasuku, a former geeky gamer who somehow turned into the Japanese equivelant of Brad Pitt. Then we have Aguri, Tasuku\u2019s pink headed girlfriend and Chiaki, a lone wolf type of gamer and last but least Chiaki\u2019s younger sister whose name i can't be bothered to remember or search cause i have better things to do, like ending my life probably..All you need to know about her is that she's there to add a little slut spice into the already fucked up mix of gangbangery.\\n\\n\r\nSo a fucked up story NOT about gamers apart from the fact that they just identify as such,a cast built just to see how far a swinging club can go and what you end up with is a fun anime to watch..And i really can't put my finger on it, cause it really shouldn't work, but it's a joy to watch. Granted the title and the story on paper are misleading but then again it's still a silly anime and one you can watch after, say, binge watching a heavy duty series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by no means boring with their little shenanigans and quirks. Every character has something to show about....Apart from development that is. So if you're on a look for an anime with characters that are interesting and show some actual growth then this is not the one for you. This is meant mostly as a break from these anime, that's the only way it can make sense in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation and music go things are pretty much standard. The characters are your standard anime fellows and the backgrounds are nicely done...It's a 2017 lineup anime so production value is very good..Unless you happen to stumble upon an anime with FUCKIN' CGI  in it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and VA are there surely..Opening and closing songs are very nicely done to keep in touch with the game theme..Even though the anime is about imaginary cheating.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up then, Gamers is by no means a great anime and after 10 mins of watching it you'll forget everything about it. But it serves its' purpose if you want something fun and light before you go and watch Tokyo Ghoul for example.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Yeah, why not..Just for the laughs while having a nice soothing drink it's ideal.\\n",

However looking back at the anime its isn't particularly that great however well executed except for the last episode. The problem lies with alot of misunderstandings when it happens once or twice its not reallya problem, however, it occurs entirely throughout this entire season sometimes for gag, sometimes dramatic moments its fairly inconsistent on that front.  The greatest aspect is really color palette it doesn't have the staleness that a lot of A1 picture shows have ( alot not all) and animation wise its solid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation of some characters are weak and the plot plots are at times not well develop in particular the last episode was ridiculously bad.  I have to know re-edit this review before i gave it a solid 7 however actuality this show is a 6.5 at best not good but bad just well executed still i recommend. \\n\\n\r\nI deleted my old review because it didn't feel adequate enough \\n\\n",

Another problem I have is the ending. \\n\r\n{spoilers alright? okay nice} \\n\r\nI don\u2019t count episode 12 as a ending because it\u2019s just another episode. The ending, episode 11, sucked.

            "content": "I guess you figured out already that this anime has little to do with games.\r\nI'll be rather short because this anime doesn't really deserve an intricate review. Honestly, I am writing all this just because how fucking angry this piece of shit anime has made me.\r\nOne day my bro sent me a pic from this anime where you could clearly see a Dark Souls 3 game copy, I was all like \"huh, an anime that actually appreciates gaming as a thing and does recognize what modern games really are\". Luckily, I decided to postpone the show for better times.\r\nThen I stumbled upon that opening videoon YouTube one day and I was like \"OH DUD PUBG REFERENCE IN AN ANIME? NO FUCKING WAY!\". Once again, however, I decided not to watch the piece.\\n\\n\r\nPiece because it's a piece of garbage. Got it? No? ok\\n\\n\r\nOne day I had that fucking spark in me, y'know, I really wanted to watch a fun, maybe even braindead anime, so I remembered about this GAMERS! thing and decided to get my hands on it. Tell you what: my expectations were pretty low, but what I've experienced is fucking terrible even by my \"low expectations mode\" standards.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching the first episode and I noticed all those game copies on shelves being references to different games and I was very hyped indeed. However, I noticed something being really off with the series so far: it's the fucking piece of shit cringe-worthy protagonist, who is by far the worst fucking take on a mc-kun made by anyone. I think. The dialogue is just unbearable, even the most polite and shy human being would not behave like THAT monstrosity. It's just horrifying and overwhelmingly underwhelming at the same time; the only thing the protag-kun is good at is MAKING ME FUCKING CRINGE. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the next episode MC hooks up with some dude who made a \"decent human being\" impression on me. Dem dudes go to a game center and play some arcade Persona 4, idk. Apart from MC giving me conniptions it was fine. Made me B E L I E V E once again that this anime was actually about games and all that.\\n\\n\r\nThe next couple of episodes SHIT GETS REAL. So instead of a gaming-theme anime we get absolutely fucking CLICKBAITED into some... uhhhhhhh how's it called? ROM-COM, and as far as I am concerned this is a whole new low even for the rom-com standard. So, you see, there's that \"love hexagon\" (now that I think about it, maybe it's a pentagon? oh noes, better say octagon because I just can't care less at this point) that is purely born because of sheer misunderstanding between characters, that, may I point that out, could be EASILY solved with a normal fucking human talk. Our characters are too fucking anime for that shit though. Better just ruin everyone's relationships because HUMAN PERCEPTION IS OVERRATED.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the show turns out to be some borderline netorare hardcore shitshow. Don't get me wrong, it's genuinely hard to watch. I dropped this right at the 5th episode as the madness just seemed to carry on and I it was clearly obvious that from here on out this whole \"misunderstanding\" process is the main gimmick of the show. It gets awkward and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nMy mathematical knowledge is more than enough to estimate the scores as following:\\n\\n\r\nStory: \"2/10 where are the gaems at boi\"\\n\r\nArt: \"6/10 nuffin special\"\\n\r\nSound: \"4/10 OP sucks and chiptune is bland\"\\n\r\nCharacter: \"1/10 top 10 anime protags you would wish to fucking murder\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 2/10.\\n\r\nOne point for the fact that there are some people who rated this 8-10/10 which is very funny and entertaining indeed, one point for Tendo slipping on a banana peel allowing me to scream \"GO HOME GAMER GIRL\" in satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an abysmal experience, please spare your time, do yourself a favor and don't watch this absolute legendary trashy show.\\n",

            "content": "This one started really strong. It subverted a lot of traits of the slice of life genre always with great comedy to go along or just getting you completely by surprise. It took one of the genre worst tropes, using a misunderstanding to take the plot in the way the writer wants to, and basically made fun of it. There were 3 times as much misunderstandings but they were always comical and so were their repercussions, and when the plot took itself seriously it actually seemed like something that would actually happen. It was pure chaos but in a good sense, it was unpredictable, funny,self-aware and almost satirical...for the first 6 episodes. \\n\r\nMy score would be much higher if the show stopped at its sixth episode. Because it seems that most of the staff\u00b4s creative energy seems to have been spent there. The last 6 episodes don\u00b4t completely lose the magic of the beginning, but they almost do. The first few are still kinda funny but none of them will surprise you anymore, it kinda did in episode 9 but not nearly as much as before, it becomes a generic romcom without anything to set it apart in this oversaturated genre. The laughs became few and far between and followed the cliches of the genre so well it became exactly what it made fun of in the first place. The characters were still likable, although the moe got turned up to 11 in these last six episodes. But their interactions were still fun to watch, to be fair it got giggles out of me here and there but I never laughed out loud like before. And the passing, one of the best parts of the first half, slows down so much it that it gets painfully slow and feels like nothing happens in each episode.\\n\r\nIn short, it\u00b4s like the studio made the first 6 episodes, then got A1-pictures to do the rest. And for some reason they made episode 12 seem like an OVA. The first 6 episodes get an easy 8 but the last 6 barely get a 6, it averages out to a 7. But I recommend you stop in the first half unless you either just really like the characters or if you don\u00b4t mind a generic series.",

            "content": "Well. I was definitely caught off guard by this anime. I'll give them props for that.\r\nI went in, expecting the cliche rom-com and harem and part of me came out, wondering what exactly was it that I just watched for the past 6 hours. Was this an attempt to create something unique?\r\nFirst of all, the show itself was definitely funny, filled with humorous moments as every character had their \"inner dialogues\" conflicts, which added oil to the fire.\r\nThere was also something remotely different about this anime: exaggerating drama out of the extraordinary, ability to create ridiculous miscommunication and a semi-peak of character development that needlesslyfell short after the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDoes that make this a masterpiece? Not at all.\\n\\n\r\nDid this had the potential? With this type of generic MC, not in a million years.\\n\\n\r\nYet. Something still drew me. Beckoned me to finish it as I wonder what sort of twisted reward I will earn if I finish the show.\\n\\n\r\n\u203b STRENGTH \u203b\\n\\n\r\n- Unexpected twists. The first episode, I thought the two Senpais from the Game Club are somehow going to have a relevant role. Needless to say, that did not happen for the rest of the show as it took some sort of detour. I find that interesting as it kept me wanting to find out where this show is going to take me.\\n\\n\r\n- Funny. Rom-Com genre. It delivered. I am satisfied and had a couple of good laughs.\\n\\n\r\n- Different POVs. I personally liked how the show dived into each character's head and thoroughly expose their thoughts for our entertainment.\\n\\n\r\n- Character Development. It was there, but not in the way I expected. Some characters grew while few rose and fell stagnant. While some just remain the same.\\n\\n\r\n- Filled with drama. I think this was the huge highlight of the show. There is always some sort of drama happening because some character misunderstands a situation or have an unlucky moment with fate. It's like watching preschoolers have an argument over a toy car.\\n\\n\r\n- Art. Animation. Music. Tunes and melodies were on par, the animation was nicely drawn and there were smooth transitions. But of course, that is to be expected during this era of anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u203b WEAKNESS \u203b\\n\\n\r\n- Deviation from the plot. You can change the topic of games to entirely something else like hentai or food and it would function well enough its own. This was not an anime about games but more on drama, miscommunication and stupid people doing stupid things.\\n\\n\r\n- Generic characters. Your everyday weak AF MC that cries and whimpers over the simplest things. Don't forget the most popular hottie along with some nerd girl who turns out to be a gorgeous babe to fall for MC for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\n- So stupid it hurts. Might have lost a couple IQ here and there as the entire crew are completely oblivious. All of these can be solved if people were honest with their feelings but then again, we want to watch stupid people do dumb things so we can laugh at them for our own pleasure. But it was just too much.\\n\\n\r\nDid this show had potential? Perhaps but based on how divergent the plot was, I highly doubt the direction the producers take can bring them back on what is already a lost comedic cause.\\n\\n\r\nWould you rewatch? Maybe a few highlight moments here and there. Not on kissanime but on Youtube. You know those short clips? Yeah those will do just fine and deliver the same punch.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch this show if you have time to kill or looking for a good laugh at stupid characters with the mentality of 5-year-olds. However, if you are looking for an anime on games, look elsewhere because this does not have anything to do with people playing games.",

            "content": "Given that watching anime is already considered a kind of geeky hobby it's probably fair to say that most people in the anime community could be classed as 'gamers' in some way, so besides making a show that stars and panders to otaku, a show that stars and panders to gamers should be a safe bet for any anime studio. When I saw the title and premise of this show that was certainly my first thought anyway, and as a non-gamer I had little interest in what I assumed was just a lazy cash-grab aimed at a completely different demographic to myself, but then itgot a Simuldub so... here I am 12 episodes later.\\n\r\nThe more I watched the show and saw others' reactions to it, the more I realised this show was definitely not aimed at me both because I'm not a gamer and because I don't particularly care for romance anime, but despite feeling frustrated with the show at times because of both these things I still came back week after week. For that reason I'd say Gamers! is still a good quality show generally even if it's not personally for me, and I'm glad I watched it for that reason if nothing else. \\n\r\nSo, what specifically did I find frustrating here? It isn't, as you might expect, that I didn't understand any of the terms used or the references made - I only remember one or two odd lines I didn't understand throughout the whole show and even though there were a lot of references I didn't know, I was expecting that so it didn't bother me - the real problem I had throughout was the way the show seemed to revere gamers as some kind of rare, distinct species separate from regular humans with a hobby non-gamers couldn't possibly ever get their heads around. The portrayal of Aguri, the lone non-gamer in the group of friends, illustrated this whenever she talked about games with the others with the last episode in-particular really trying to hammer this point home. Now I must say I, personally, don't play games because my visual impairment makes it near impossible and I don't enjoy watching others play games, but I still understand why other people find them fun. Aguri, however, seems unable to wrap her head around this idea at all, which I found infuriating. All humans like doing fun, challenging things and while it may be hard to understand the motivations of more extreme gamers, none of the characters in this group of friends could be considered extreme - they're just dedicated fans and it isn't rocket science to understand why they like gaming, yet the show presents the idea that games are fun like it's some little-known nugget of wisdom only the chosen few know. \\n\r\nIn the end this was my biggest gripe with the show, as even though I didn't care for the romcom elements I still found all the characters (bar the protagonist, but alas you can't have everything) very likeable and fun and everything felt like it was executed well generally. I can't say I'd ever want to re-watch Gamers! but it certainly wasn't a bad experience, which is more than I can say for some shows of its ilk.",

If I start to dislike ananime at any point, to a certain degree, I just won't watch it. As I watch more and more, I become pickier, so my completed to dropped ratio becomes smaller and smaller as time goes on; but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSTART-O:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI feel as though people are being too hard on this aspect. The story had to focus on the extreme tropes of the characters to introduce them in a dramatic way; I believe, to get you more invested in them. So the first half of the show (more like the first third, but whatever) is focused on character introduction and dramatization of the way they live their lives. Once that is over, it heavily focuses on the drama surrounding the characters in a much more unique way than I have seen in many of the anime is this genre. Its biggest highlight is the hilarious comedic overtone that affects the story as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nA place where this anime really hits me is certainly not in its general character art or its background art, but rather in the hilarious, intentional way it draws its characters. It's absolutely hilarious to watch the way the characters forms change in response to what happens to them or those around them. It was what made me come back after dropping it after episode one, and what kept me laughing hysterically throughout the show. By far my favorite quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs were pretty great, especially on the art side (affects the above score, obviously). The music definitely fit during the great moments of the show and was overall decent. Not memorable in the least, however. Lastly, I don't pay much attention to the music, so this is as much as I could come up with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are obviously what made the show as good or as bad as most people feel, I believe. In my opinion, I loved the characters (to a degree). The way they interacted with one another, the inner monologues, the reactions to events, the way they changed flow suddenly occasionally. I loved it all, which is another reason why I enjoyed myself so much. However, they are also all very flawed in many ways. They lack really any depth beyond how they act, so you can't really connect with any of them on a deeper level at all (which can also be a good thing, since it means focusing more on the overall picture; at least for me it did). I really loved one of the characters and felt like she grew more as a character than any of the others, by far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed myself throughout the course of the show. I loved many aspects of it!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for each category:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Dry in the beginning, got much better in the second third of the show. Many will disagree; it depends entirely on taste I believe. The pacing is weird and it changes quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation of the characters is what made me keep watching, and it only got more hilarious as the show went on. I really enjoyed this particular aspect of the show. The artwork itself was average or subpar.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say, OP is great, EDs are fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Love and hate relationship in many ways. If you read any part of my review, I would like if you read this one in particular.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really liked it, but it definitely has its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I give an 8 as both a perfect average of my scores, and what I generally feel it deserves. Not great, but definitely better than what many have to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Any tips would be much appreciated as I have never written a long comment, much less a review of an anime, at any point in my anime career. Look forward to writing more. Thanks again.",

I went into it not expecting much but was literally surprised at episode one.\r\nIt's the way the show surprises you that makes it so great. Sure there's a plot that spans the entire season, but the feel of each episode is quite independent of one another. They play with your expectations. It's an anime that will both defy and reinforce stereotypes, and then make fun of itself for doing so. \r\nThe situational comedy is great. You will cringe for sure, but not so hardyour muscles cramp! I found myself shouting at the characters on multiple occasions. You like them all, but, much like Tsurezure Children (which also aired Summer 2017), you pity them for their lack of being able to express their feelings and all the glorious miscommunications that result.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, there is actually some good commentary on how many gamers actually feel and some of the pitfalls of the gaming industry. It's an enjoyable ride!\\n\\n\r\n- Kevin",

            "content": "Gamers! is a anime about... ya know, a bunch of gamers. I love the fact that this anime was able to incorporate romance into the story. In fact, I would even say the anime revolves around romance, whcich I was definitely not expecting when I read the title and summary this anime had.The story and plot in this show is sort of meaningless and uncertain in a way ( you will understand when you watch it ), however, it was still able to keep me curious and want more. Each character has well defined characteristics and very unique personalities,  which was really fun tosee how they would work together. Overall I enjoyed this anime very much and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good romance/comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to this anime would be the ending. It seems rushed and unfinished. It doesn't give even the slightest satisfaction (tbh there really isn't any satisfaction in the whole anime), but then again, most romance animes don't give you a ending that you want. That being said, the ending of this anime makes you wonder why they even bothered to make the show, since literally nothing gets solved, no one does or did anything different than in any of the other episodes.",

            "content": "Well, well, well. Here we are. It's finally over people... Misunderstandings the Anime is finished, and has left me feeling robbed and empty after having such an unfulfilling ending that gave me no closure. Lets get into it shall we?\r\n*MAJOR SPOILER BELOW*\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story here gets a 6, mainly because it was pretty decent from the start, but then the amount of pointless misunderstandings that actually aren't very relatable to myself (since I am a pretty heavy gamer/Otaku) just hit me real hard. I felt like they kind of wasted a lot of valuable assets when it came to those countless misunderstandings. I was actuallyreally interested when Tendou and Amano got together. What I really wanted to see was some more actual development and depth with their relationship, not just stupid misunderstandings that could easily have been resolved with a few words (better yet, just leave that s*** out of the damn anime). Yes, I understand, the characters are supposed to be that way, but honestly speaking, no gamers I know actually think the way some of these characters did, or like, overthink like they did. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nArt gets a 9 here. I just liked the art style thats all. Character design was pretty good, but Amano was pretty bland when it came to looks, but that's just part of his character, so I'll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing too special or bad for the sound here. OP was ok, ED was ok, so I didn't have any problems here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nHere we are, the Character section. Now, everyone who watched this Anime can agree, that Amano is a rather bland character. Sure, he does have a little more that meets the eye, but like, I feel that him representing a gamer is kind of unfair. A lot of people think that gamers are people that are really shy and somewhat hard to talk to. In some cases, that's true, but at the same time, why couldn't they at least make him slightly less of a dense f***boy and give him some more  personality? I feel like gamers IRL are actually really interesting when it comes to personality. As a gamer my self, I can say that my personality is one of my more appealing traits. The, \"being shy\" part of the Anime was fairly relatable, but it was slightly over the top.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI kind of enjoyed this Anime, but honestly speaking, the ending was absolutely dreadful. It gave me no closure, left me feeling absolutely cucked in terms of how much time I invested into it, and I just wish that they didn't just s**t out a garbage ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI really considered giving this an 8, but the ending really just killed everything for me. The ending was essentially the nail in the coffin for me. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that was just my opinion, I'd say that you should try the first 5-7 episodes and see if you like it. I never drop any Anime that I start watching, so I just bear with it ti'll the end. Later Everyone!",

            "content": "(Minor spoliers)Gamers, a show about a romantic pentagon. Loner Amano-kun gets the school idol to fall for him, and a romantic wacky hijinks ensues. Seems pretty clich\u00e9, but I don't really care how unoriginal a show is anyways. What matters to me is how shows execute these ideas to form interesting stories and likeable characters. So let's dive in. \r\nStory 6(9)/10:\r\nThe first thing to note is that while the story is pretty interesting, there is a huge problem with the pacing. Now it isn't as bad as it sounds, the pacing problem doesn't occur in the middle of episodes but rather between episodes. In someepisodes, notably episode 3 and 6, the romance and comedy goes blazing forward, pushing me to the edge of my seat and wanting to see more. In other episodes however, like episode 4 and 12, the show slows to a crawl, and after a couple of minutes you'll to start to realise that this episode pretty has nothing to do with continuing the story whatsoever but rather delves into a side story. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes also drop the score for me considerably, as the series ends with barely any of the conflicts that arose during the show resolved at the end. While the characters still got together halfway through the show they don't really show any signs of developing at all, even though they spend a lot of time together and such. \\n\\n\r\nThough I still really enjoyed the episodes that progressed the plot and were funny and interesting, and the relationships that develops during those episodes are also interesting and entertaining to watch. In order to enjoy this show to the fullest and avoid the pacing issues I will recommend you to skip a few episodes listed below and read my summary instead. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4: Shows Karens life, and shows her spending time with amano in an arcade. They're relationship does not change at all, and in fact it's kinda infuriating as nothing is resolved.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7: Karen and Amano go on a date to the pool, but they run into Chiaki along the way too. Similar to episode 4, nothing really changes. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9: Chiaki accidentally reveals to Amano that she is somewhat important to him. But then she says that it's her sister for some reason and then Amano just goes \"oh, okay\" and it's barely brought up again and doesn't impact the story, like what the fuck. Again, nothing changes. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12: They all go on a trip and talk about DLC's. Nothing is changed or resolved. This anime actually ends at episode 11. \\n\\n\r\nNow it may seem that the anime is actually shit from my summary above, but don't misunderstand. Only those episodes are shit. The other episodes range from decent to amazing. If you skip these episodes the story easily jumps to a 9 out of 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to note with these characters is that while the characters themselves aren't too phenomenal, the way they interact with each other or in other words the character dynamics are amazing and entertaining. This is one of the reason why those episodes above are bad. This story needs the whole or almost the whole cast to be together in order to be entertaining, and that's a good thing since the majority of the show has all the characters together. But still, let's analyse the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAmano: Your classic loner character that is actually pretty friendly. He's okay and he sparks some of the hilarious misunderstandings, but without Uehara with him he's pretty bland, and that's one of the reasons the episodes above were bad. \\n\\n\r\nKaren: The perfect girl that develops an deep love for Amano. She's also pretty boring and bland when she's perfect, as with most perfect characters. The only way to keep perfect characters interesting and not irritating is to construct comedy around them, and this show does it pretty well most of the time. And that's another one of the reasons the episodes above were bad. \\n\\n\r\nUehara: The actual main character of the show IMO. He's a representation of the reader really, understanding most of the plot and plays the straight man that doesn't usually go stupid. He's also really funny and brings the other characters together in an amazing comedy harmony. His presence is one of the reasons why the show is so funny and fast paced. This show won't be anything without him.\\n\\n\r\nAguri: Pretty interesting and good. Nothing really much to say. \\n\\n\r\nChiaki: Also pretty decent character, though her refusal to let Amano know that she's someone special to him is pretty infuriating. \\n\\n\r\nKonoha: Now I'm not sure why they even introduced this character to begin with so late in the show. Not to mention she does nothing to contribute to the romance and instead makes the misunderstandings a whole lot worse. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Art: Don't really care, I skipped the OP's and ED's most of the time and I find that the most important part a show is the plot and characters anyways, not the music or art. Even shows with shit art like welcome to the NHK are amazing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: \\n\\n\r\nI'd say I enjoyed this show quite a bit. While it can be infuriating at times especially during the episodes that didn't progress the plot whatsoever, and another part of the show that can be annoying is that the show doesn't really resolve a lot of the conflicts set up, but aside from that the show is still funny and the romance is still entertaining. I recommend everyone watching this show if they want a good laugh.",

The show main focus was on the interaction between the main characters while adding references to games and gaming culture. \r\nThe story is in your typical romance-comedy that you may be familiar with but this time the misunderstandings that occur between the characters are amped up to an absurd level for comedic effect. The result is a ridiculously fun watching experience from the first episode to the last.\r\nThe art and art style was good. The end cards and the transitional slidesat the break times stood out for me. I didn't notice the soundtrack most of the time I was watching but when i did,  it was decent.

            "content": "BOY OH BOY, love sure does turn you into an idiot.\r\nGamers! was a great surprise to watch this season and I'm glad so many people made this series one of the most popular. The story is mostly about our 5 protagonist who are avid videogame enthusiasts (most of them anyway) and how they deal with teenage romance. And man, was it also really fun to watch.\r\nThe strongest point here in the series is probably the way these guys handle misunderstandings, or actually, how much they suck at handling them. Yes, this story is more about misunderstandings with romance than games and that's good! I wasexpecting yet another club-based series where we see the daily shenanigans of our characters while they play games and just be kawaii and shit. But that was absolutely smacked down to the ground on the very first episode. This isn't a club anime, this is a story about love and friendship, and how if we don't express what we really feel then silly things are bound to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest, most incredible things about the series is the punchline delivered midway through the season, a scene that took several episodes to build a momentum so high so they could drop the bomb on us in a way that made that episode one of the best ones I can remember from recent years in a series. From that point on the story takes another turn and focuses more on the relationships between characters and the way they really feel about each another. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single character is also great, each having their own personalities and quirks but without forgetting that they are all still teenagers, and the way they handled romance and failed miserably was hilarious. The situations they are presented, either during their romantic ordeals or afterwards were also well handled and awkward but in a cute and good way, they're teenagers after all living in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the negative points here is probably the production. The animation in some episodes is just terrible, but that's fair considering there's not even action here. There's also not really a set story, nor a progressive plot, just teens being teens and playing games from time to time. But I guess that's my only complaint with the series, everything else was just pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short: this is a romantic comedy, not a club-based series with a slice of life. The comedy is hilarious and the characters really charming. There's not too much of a conflict here, so this series will be enjoyed by people who are more into harmless stuff and comedy than action packed conflicts. And I? As a romantic comedy junkie I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 9 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "You would think a show titled Gamers! would revolve around games right? Well that's what I had thought too but Gamers! is really just about gamers and their crazy daily antics. I was expecting a show revolving around some gaming club, but I was rewarded with an extremely amusing love pentagon and honestly, I'm not complaining ;) \r\nThe main catch of Gamers!, I personally feel, is how relatable it is. What I initially thought of as a boring cast of highschool students slowly grew on me as we delve deeper into their personal lives and how their world functions and how they were shaped intothe way they are now. Each character is unique and quirky in their own way that it made the show so enjoyable!  \\n\\n\r\nAnd now moving on to the crux of the show, the romcom aspects. Honestly this is the dumbest and yet entertaining romcom I've seen. It does go in horrifying circles and while that tends to leave me frustrated and annoyed at such dragged out plot, Gamers! absolutely nails in its execution because of how well the dynamic of the characters' relationship with one another have been established, and thus crafting the platform for hilarious scenarios. Each character is given decent screentime and through their lens, we get to see how they view the wacky situation at hand and we laugh at their overthinking, their misunderstandings, and their foolishness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gamers! is definitely a show to check out if you desire something light hearted and fun :>",

This is a underrated and hidden gem for this season.\r\nWhen i first saw gamers i didnt expect anything because it is likely to have a typical plot where the main character is good at gaming and then the prettiest girl on the school suddenly likes him and just like his dream comes true and everyone is happy. But of course there are still hot chicks and there is a girl namedtendou she is the prettiest chick in the school and ends up liking the main character but you can expect some plot twist. Pretty face,smart,rich and everybody likes her that whats make that girl act like a btch who thinks she can get anything bcs she is pretty, i just hope bitch like that treated worse so she knew that world doesnt only revolves around her. Fckn btch.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is some slice of life genre too in this anime and its pretty good, at some episode you will leave with a smile on your face not because fanservice but because its touching and heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway\\n\\n\r\nActually i dont like this type of anime but Gamers isnt just about gamers itself but there are many hillarious comedy inside, friendship and even love triangle(sixangle even). The main thing that got me hooked to this anime is because i like comedy and what i mean comedy is it needs to be funny like gintama,sket dance,etc that kind of comedy that actually make you laugh and if you are a fan of comedy then im sure you will like this anime\\n\\n\r\nAmano the main character is actually just a guy who enjoy playing games for fun and not for competition, and actually his skill is pretty average or even sucks. Amano is having a blast when he is playing game not because he got mad skills but because he truly enjoy playing the game itself and i think this is the first time we have an anime like this, if you like comedy you can expect to be entertained by this anime. Its nothing serious really this anime will surely make you laugh and maybe if you are in bad mood or having bad day and you want to watch something funny then this anime is right for you.\\n",

While the characters right now may feel like it'll just fill the check-boxes of typical high school stock models, this series can get by with simplistic characterizations because its potential lies in the characterinteractions more than anything. This is a celebration of gaming as a community after all.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, however, Gamers is an  you wouldn't feel bad missing out on. It has shown lopsided execution with a penchant for slapstick humor that can grow old easily, especially if its not your type of humor. The artstyle is less-detailed which enables more fluid animation but it's largely centered around the aforementioned slapstick comedy and the OST is nothing standout.\\n\\n\r\nBut the  is not without potential, despite its abysmal first episode which I feel I must warn you about.

After this point, the story completely derails. The characters of the club room after forgotten about, the \"gaming\" concept that the title suggests is stomped upon and moved to second or even third priority. \r\nAt this point we are stuck in a loop of stupid characters, childish romance and \"misunderstandings\". It's basically become reliant on overused tropes with characters having any sense of rationality as tobe \"living\" removed from them and made into subdued puppets with one specific unchanging personality trait remaining.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I want to say with this is 2 things:\\n\r\n1: The writer of the LN ran out of ideas of how to progress his plot after the introduction stage OR the adaptation of it just forgot which parts were important of progressing a story past the introduction and instead focused on \"popular gags\".\\n\r\n2: The romance theme that became 1st priority is of childish quality, and anything that is \"gaming\" related or story related is instead turned into a tool to drive that romance genre forward in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong on my opinions of \"How I think this show should have been\", I don't really care if it's about games or romance, but it's currently too warped to be either believable or enjoyable for any of the factions (unless you're tired, bored, or just want to see anime girls).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nScore: 5.\\n",

I got super excited by the opening because of the mini homage they did for Street Fighter which is an all time favorite game of mine. As I went on with actually sitting down and watching this it slowly began to irritate me and bore me. \r\nHonestly the first 6 episodes are alright but get pretty bad as they go on. \r\nOut of the 5 characters Amano is the only one I was able to relate to during certain scenes.Other than that none of the characters were great. I didn't really like Karen as a character, from what I understood she was trying to keep appearances up and then eventually became a boy hungry girl.  One of the things that was most annoying was having introduced Konoha, she provided nothing but dragging on this whole desu desu liking Amano. \\n\\n\r\nThe faces were honestly were all that kept me going they could get pretty funny at times. I thought episode 2 was great because of how they told how Aguri and  Uehara met. The anime seemed really dragged on with the whole misunderstandings and I can't believe they couldn't just settle things once and for all instead of having these meet ups and trying to catch people in lies. \\n\\n\r\nI know this anime is suppose to be about misunderstandings but why is it titled Gamers??? Its almost false advertisement except for the fact that desu desu is a game developer, and a good portion of the cast avidly plays video games. I wouldn't recommend this anime at all, I trudged through it thinking it would get better but sadly it doesn't.  The ending was very anticlimactic and episode 12 I didn't even bother watching because I was told the anime honestly finishes with episode 11.",

One other thing though is that i found it hard to keep up with at times and honestly it deserves a second season toclairify things and to further a story that i know they can take a whole lot further than they have. but anyways , i would recommend this to anyone who likes video games, romance, some slight humor, and that they don't mind a little bit of fanservice.",

It had nothing to do with video games.\r\nAlso, the final episode was just a shill for $60 games and overpriced DLC. You can see how badly the characters were developed by how 2-3 characters at once would have the same opinion and/or did the exact same headnod action. They have no individually from each other. I just watched it till the end to give it a chance, but it was consistently horrible and unbearable to watch. cringe/10",
