However, the sound is actually good in general, especially the OP by TK and the voice acting.\r\nPlot/Character:\r\n120 chapters in 12 episodes... THERE IS NO FUCKING PLOT! I have read a bit of the manga and I'm still lost; it's too fast and we get no explanations or understanding of what's going on. Due to this pacing, all the characters that have been thrown at us get NO development althoughthey seem cool and you really want to understand them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nHonestly, I've given up on tokyo ghoul as an anime; it needs the brotherhood treatment badly. It baffles me how people are giving this shit 10/10s and 9/10s, I can't imagine how deluded they must be, this deserves a 5/10 at max! Please, do yourself a favor and read the manga.",

            "content": "Mangaka: I made a sequel to the Tokyo Kushu manga, wanna read it?\r\nMe: Sure, let's see... yeah, this story is fucking awful, every single character was practically mind-raped, the art is so messy I literally can't tell what is happening during these action sequences and there is just too much text for this to be called a manga. Let's face it, this wouldn't be passing any editor's radar if the series was less popular.\r\nStudio Pierrot: *teleports behind my back* pssst, kiddo, we can easily make this thing 7 times worse, just watch.\r\nIt's no secret that Tokyo Kushu is a problematic franchise. This for the simplereason that its anime adaptations are messy to say the least. The first season stays loyal to the manga, the second is non-canon, the third one is based to a manga sequel and assuming that who ever is watching it has also read the manga since anime prequel that leads to the events seen there doesn't exist. And now when the series is for the first time ever getting some consistency with its making, the outcome is --well--  this fucking thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this sequel is impressively bland. It's so uninteresting and boring that it's not even worth of getting mad over. The whole thing relies on some supposedly fucked up society and edgy hierarchy system where the plot itself is filled with side characters that are in no way whatsoever believable and cliches so lousily written and executed that it could as well be a parody. Following the story line is hard as hell because the scenes change and story advances in such a tempo, yet nothing that happens really seems to matter because that's how the story presents itself. Half of the entire dialogue, on the other hand, could be replaced with the line \"because I am bully.\" and the series would be the exact same thing. The \"drama\" writing is so edgy and hard-try sad that I am mainly feeling disgust whenever some suicidal little girl declares their \"darkness\".\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I ever found this to be good at all are the main characters. I read the whole manga just to see if ships sail, but it was still worth it for few reasons: The characters interacting with each others offers some nice chemistry. The banter is pretty fun and the character centric comedic reliefs -- that rarely are have the real focus, rather work in the background -- are cute and almost relaxing to witness at times. The whole thing with its SoL side had a real \"big family\" feel to it, and personally, I came to appreciate it for that reason. Now, whoever made this anime adaptation clearly didn't see any charm in that so instead the only thing they really are showing here is the awfully written main story and every single lackcluster of a fight scene. *yawn*... I guess. Some supposedly badass dude said: \"645 is the numbers of times I could have finished you off during this fight.\" Conveniently, I considered dropping this series the exact same amount of times during it. If the action + drama and supposed horror / psychology side of the story -- not to leave the beyond fake mystery side unmentioned -- all were replaced with nothing but (the) slice of life content, this thing would still not be \"good\" but it certainly would be better. \\n\\n\r\nJust to quote urbandictionary: Mind rape occurs whenever one's brain feels as though it has been assaulted viciously by some event or thing in reality. This applies to half the cast as it is. Since the setup for Kushu Re was executed with memoryloss cliches and writing equally pathetic to that, an extra effort is required to make the thing believable and to make any sense now. So what did Pierrot decide to do? To not even try! 2 cour total is enough to cover 180 chapters worth of manga, it seems. So often when I see a character do something, I wonder who is this person? I know who they are supposed to be, but what they do is just not what their character originally was or what it was developed into. Needless to say, it is not pretty to watch. The pacing of this thing easy to sum up with a meme = fast as fuck boii. The sense our story and characters make = n/a. However, what really makes no sense at all is how the anime adaptation is being dealt with by the studio. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season had good production values no matter how it is looked. Its opening song was the biggest meme since Shingeki no Kyojin, every bit of the art and audio was used to make the series better than it would've otherwise been. It was pretty and sounded good. Smart decisions. The second season didn't suffer from many problems considering these departments. Especially the whole scene that leads to the ending is magnificently done no matter how I look at it, production-wise, that is. This season and the 3rd are way more loyal to the awful manga art. The action scenes are almost as messy and tension-lacking as in the source material -- sometimes not even animated. There are not many things currently going in the series that I find worth of praising. The OP is fantastic tho. Tokyo Kushu has been going for worse since the beginning and there seems to be no end to that. \\n\\n\r\nAs a person who doesn't especially like Tokyo Kushu, I did quite enjoy seeing this thing destroy itself over the years, but at this point it's not even funny anymore since it being awful has become a part of the consensus already. After episode 01, I was supposed to casually insult all teenage action anime by stating this is the exact same thing as all of them, but damn, at this point even I myself couldn't buy that statement anymore.",

            "content": "So, to preface, this is my first review, so bear with me here!\r\nIf you enjoyed this anime, good! That means you got something out of it that I couldn't! But I, for one, didn't! So, with that said, let's get into it, shall we? Tokyo Ghoul:RE is.... Quite an atrocious anime. You've probably heard this a 1000 times by now, and so I'll be the 1001st.. Never have I been so disgusted with a form of media until now. Save yourself, and don't waste your time with this.\r\nStory - 4\r\nThe story of this season is overall pretty dry and flavorless. These arcs are just notvery good. Period. I thought this was the case in the manga, as well. After a CERTAIN MAJOR INDIVIDUAL'S PASSING, the quality in story just drops. Every theme TG wished to take on just seems to loosely hang on as everything is dragged away by the boring narrative. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the hundreds of scenes that were just flat out REMOVED from the anime to make room. These scenes, believe it or not, are kind of important, and are needed to progress the story properly. \\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Funimation needed to start a weekly podcast to EXPLAIN what was going on in this series. THAT'S when you know you REEEEALLY messed it up.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 2\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of it all. I would rather watch a 5 year old's slideshow on microsoft powerpoint than sit through this again. The artstyle is generic, the animation is static, and everything is colorless. It's appalling to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are more still frame shots in this series than anything else, and that, in my opinion at least, is a really big shame. I'm still hoping for another studio to pick up this series and do a reboot, because Pierrot obviously did NOT do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are the most horrid examples of this. It's always just slideshows. It's all just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound WOULD be the strong part of the anime, considering the soundtrack for this series was beautiful and actually felt appropriate for the series, but.... One issue.\\n\\n\r\nNo new tracks were written for this season, and the studio kept reusing the same tracks over and over and over and over. Needless to say, it's more redundant that water torture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the TG manga were the strong spot. And so, believe it or not, when you take away everything that makes a character believable, relate-able, and interesting, you get generic stick figures that no one cares for. And that's just what this studio did. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into detail, for that would be entering spoiler territory, but in short, all the characters had a majority of their traits, backstory, and justifications removed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 \\n\\n\r\nI hated this anime, if you can't tell already. To say I didn't enjoy ANY of it would be a lie, however. I liked the opening theme by TK and a few of the tracks on the OST (before they got so stale to me I couldn't stand them, of course) but that's pretty much it. From the animation to the poor story telling.... All of it is just a big loss. I would actually sit there during each episode, looking at the time and saying to myself, \"Is it over yet?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1\\n\\n\r\nIt's pathetic. I've listed all my reasons as to why I think this. I'm not gonna preach high and mighty about the manga, it has flaws too, but if you want to enjoy this series, read the manga. That's all I need to say about it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd again, if you somehow enjoyed this heaping pile of trash, good on you!",

They're just unfair in my opinion, because I believe that no matter how trashy a series can be it'll still have its own ups that are worthy of some more points at least.\r\nHowever, this is the one series (season in particular) that is going to make me change my mind.\r\nThe amount of rubbish they packed up here; from horrible pacing, to lousy animation, to poorly developed characters, to lacking intensity, to inconsistent story that keeps jumping from one place to another incoherently, just makes anyone ignore whatever positive you can find (though I doubt you canfind any, even sound is not so good compared to previous seasons) and make the series unwatchable overall.\\n\\n\r\nI just scrammed through the first 4 episodes because I had a genuine curiosity to see how they're going to handle my favorite chapters in the manga, I'd say.

            "content": "This review will cover both Seasons of Tokyo Ghoul re:\r\n\"YA DONE FUCKED IT UP\"\r\nAngry Joe.\r\nBack in the summer 14 anime season, there was a little star anime called Tokyo Ghoul. After that first season ended the series quickly gained popularity from anime fans from the world making it the success. While manga fans beg the differ around due to its content skipping the first season was a decent adaptation that did a good job at bringing in anime only fans to Sui Ishida work. One anime season later the second season of Tokyo Ghoul came out which was titled Tokyo Ghoul Root A a confusing,poorly animated and horrendously adapted train wreck not only saddened the anime-only fans but pissed a huge chunk of manga fans. When I finished Root A. Tokyo Ghoul Root A was so bad it killed off a big chunk of the anime fanbase for the series where they all decided to read the manga which while reading it they opinions of the anime drastically changed for the worst where people my self-included no longer consider even the decently handle first season to be good.\\n\\n\r\nNow fast forward 3 years later we have the Tokyo Ghoul re anime adaptation and let's just say that this show was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nAm not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is one of the worst animes ever made because not only this show is an absolute failure a manga adaptation but it's also a failure of an anime product to a point where simply doesn't function correctly and trust me when I say this that nothing more infuriating than an anime that doesn't function at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said let's begin with this broken butchered feast.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nTaking place two years after\u00a0the CCG\u2019s raid on Anteiku. The Aogiri Tree is growing stronger than ever and the ghouls still continue to pose a huge problem for CCG. In an attempt to exterminate the ghouls, CCG creates a special team called the Quinx Squad where humans have undergone surgery and have gained special ghoul powers.\u00a0 The story follows, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half human who is Quinx Squad He has been trained by the special class Investigator Arima Kishou and who seems to be missing memories of his past or more likely of the person he used to be.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nUhh, there are so many things wrong with the story alone I seriously don't know where to begin and even then talking about this shows problems gives me physical pain. I honestly cannot believe of how awful this series and with that said let's start talking about this dreadful story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first mistakes that Tokyo Ghoul re was how the plot presented itself to the viewer. Instead of getting a half recap episode where it shows us showcases the Kaneki vs Arima you know the fight that was non-existent in Root A the show decided to jump to straight to the action while horrendously introducing its new chararters. I understand that Studio Pierrot wanted to get straight to the action and all but there should be least some decent transition piece from original series to re: This is just straight up ADHD pandering and this poor transition piece alone really highlights how poorly directed this series is especially re:S2 where everything goes to shit in terms of writing and dialogue.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Tokyo Ghoul re is an absolute disaster\u00a0in every level. Despite this show being 24 episodes mind, you the series moves at a fast pace like a typical battle shounen the fast shounen pacing clearly doesn't work in Tokyo Ghoul re as the series was meant to be this psychological horror\u00a0drama series that has a lot of chararter and story building. Not this broken ass shounen series that completely butchers everything that the original series has set off.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for this broken mess is the direction. Am not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is easily the worst directed series I have ever seen in my life. LIKE HOLY SHIT!!! So many awkward scene transition, awful camera positioning and abysmal shot composition and framing.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wondering why I haven't touched the plot for Tokyo Ghoul re: Well that's because the plot is a complete lobotomised bastardisation of its own source material where all the story elements that happened in the source material have been butchered to oblivion where it no longer makes any sort of sence.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was so horrendously broken Funimation had to go out of the way to explain the all the events of Tokyo Ghoul re on a live stream and even then they are having a hard time explaining thanks to this shows pathetic pacing and directing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of Tokyo Ghoul re: is a complete abomination that shouldn't have seen the light of day. Screw you Studio Pierrot.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nThe characters don't fare much better and that's the tragic part because these characters can be good but the pacing and direction completely kill these characters before they can even open them damm months. Another thing that makes the characters even worse is how the series loves to introduced new characters and like with the original series they barely left an impression in the narrative as they show once or twice then they are never seen or at times ever heard from again...\\n\\n\r\nKaneki/Haiseki is a boring and inconsistent husk of a chararter. Outside of him being a broken adapted chararter to the core thanks to Studio Pierrot and the staff being the show being incompetent as hell he just boring and inconsistent edgy who does edge/nerdy thing for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought Touka was already useless enough in Root A you ain't seen nothing yet because apart from having set with Kaneki in S2 she literally does nothing at all. What a way to kill a chararter even harder.\\n\\n\r\nThe Quinx Squad are all bland and uninteresting as they just exist to move this broken plot along. The same thing from Arima as well all the returning chararters from the previous series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters. Well, let's pretend I never said that because they all just appear and disappear as they please.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Tokyo Ghoul re were about as interesting as watching DSP Gaming Persona 3 let's play and the way the characters were treated were worse than reading a bad Naruto fanfic.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nOh boy, where do I even being with this trash on a visual level? The first 2 seasons of Tokyo Ghoul did not have the best production values but both seasons at various point had some decent animation that actually worked. Tokyo Ghoul re: both seasons has none of that as it contently remanded to be a poorly animated shit show from start to finish. Studio Pierrot took very good looking art from the manga and reduced them into the muddy toilet bowl as the show at various point looked like it was drawn and coloured in freaking DeviantArt in the year 2004 and as a result, the chararters designs in this show look liked dogshit. The background scenery is even worse as the show loves it uses its blacks, greys, white and dark blues for the scenery giving the show a dark, depressing feel. Unfortunately, I don't think Tokyo Ghoul re understands visuals directing because despite the show being Quote \"Dark\" the show's dialogue as well the fight scenes that scream shounen bias all over the place.\\n\r\nThe animation in Tokyo Ghoul re is somehow even worse.\\n\r\nSaying that Tokyo Ghoul re: animation is a travesty is a fast understatement. \\n\r\nI'm not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re has the absolute worst animation I have ever seen from this decade. Yes even worse than The Master of Rock Bottom. While the animation of the master of rock bottom was a complete abomination least you can somewhat laugh at the animation on that because it was pretty hilarious at certain points. Tokyo Ghoul re has none of that, in fact, I can go as far that even hentai's are better animated than Tokyo Ghoul re: Where do I begin with this nightmare. For starters the consent still frames are out of control as scenes look like it was done in Adobe After Effects in under a day. The fight choreography is piss poor the use of budget cuts were out of hand and show is simply a poorly animated shitfeast that had no care or soul.\\n\r\nThe worst thing about the animation about Tokyo Ghoul re were the horrifying camera shake for the action scenes Holy hell I have never seen relay on camera shakes to simulate character movement in my life and I have seen The Asterisk War, and Black Clover where both of these shows abuses its camera shakes to quote simulate epic moments. However, it's so much worse here as unlike those two shows were they some okay animation every now and then this series feels it was animated by someone who has just learned to use Adobe After Effects. WHAT THE F***.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin of Tokyo Ghoul re: is the second season poster. Not only the poster is filled with massive spoilers that can annoy the viewer especially anime-only fans who haven't touched the manga but it looked it was done in Adobe Photoshop in less than an hour.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul re like with the show butchered narrative and production values is bland and uninspired. Yes, it may had some iconic track that played from the original but the show poor direction kills it as the show seemed to play them in very inappropriate scenes. The example of this happens in the last episode of season 1 as the series decided to play happy ending song while all the sad scenes were going on.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes were pretty decent for what they were but the ultimately not that memorable\u00a0\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub well let's not go there as it just as bad as a whole script and production.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWow just wow. I honestly cannot believe that this series especially Season 2 was a thing.\\n\r\nHow did this anime even got released without getting cancelled?\\n\r\nHow did anyone greenlight this script?\\n\r\nThis isn't an even an anime adaptation.\\n\r\nThis is easily worst anime of 2018 MY GOD!!!\\n\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT!!!\\n\\n\r\nNever before I have seen an anime this incompetent and broken in my life.\\n\r\nThe story is a badly paced mess that with filled with asspulls and plot holes that are never explained at all to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all blander than cardboard as they are all empty shells of their manga counterparts. The production values were horrendous that is filled with trash directing, abysmal music including voicing acting was terrible. This is easily hands down the second worst anime I have ever seen period completely de-throwing The Asterisk War and Darling in the Franxx.\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen the anime yet please do yourself a favour and read the manga and pretend show got the Tsukihime anime treatment where it simply doesn't exist at all.\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot I hope you guys are happy now because you took one of the best modern manga series out there and turned it into one into objectively one of worst animes to ever exist.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would give a score out of 10 but this show was fundamentally broken on every level I had to create a new rating just for this pile of waste.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul re: gets the final rating off.\\n\\n\r\nCEASE TO EXIST!!!\\n\\n\r\nA butchered story that was only made worst with horrendous pacing and directing.\\n\r\nVisually looked like their were fished out of a toilet.\\n\r\nCharacters are lobotomised versions of their manga counterparts.",

Yet alas it was here and we didn't get a single recap of what happened or whats going on they expected us to know everything, and it took all my brain power to figure out what was happening and it was really nice in the end.\r\nTHEN we have this season and boy if u thought that seasons story was messed haha you haven't even seen this one. Its story is a completedisaster ud think i am watching another show. I legit thought i had missed some episodes, they don't explain shit! I am so confused here i don't remember any of the characters long enough it is so rushed, they rushed the last season which I kinda enjoyed the whole Sasaki Haisai thing and it reminded of the old TG.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is like absolutely terrible, at this point i am just watching cause of the art and action, the story matters no more its ruined, and I am sad to see such a good anime go to waste :(",

            "content": "\u201cIf Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.\u201d\r\n-ZephSilver, MAL \u201cHall of Famer\u201d, June 2015\r\nBrilliant quote. Now, here\u2019s my not-so-professional version of that famous statement:\r\n\u201cIf Parasyte is a Kobe Beef Steak dinner, then Tokyo Ghoul is a previously frozen, pre-prepared Salisbury Steak meal\u2026.with preservatives to last through seasons.\u201d\r\nAlright, that\u2019s out of the way. Let\u2019s start with the prelude.\r\nFrom even the very first season, I was never really a big fan of the Tokyo Ghoul series in its entirety, and I\u2019m REALLY tired of people telling me that I should be reading the manga version of the story. Regardless of whether or not Iread light novel or manga versions of certain anime, it should not have that big or significant an impact on my impressions, feelings, experience, and/or analysis/critiquing of the anime adaptations themselves, because I honestly feel that the adaptations are their own things\u2026their own piece of work or art (or at least attempts to be so, half-hearted or not). How I feel about a certain adaptation\u2019s loyalty or faithfulness to its source should not be something prioritized when making a serious judgment on it. This is personally how I feel regarding LN/manga adaptations, being an individual who prefers to be an anime-only fan and viewer, and I would only check out some of the source material for purely out of my own separate curiosity.\\n\r\n(This review will mainly encompass TG:Re 2nd Season, but it will also involve aspects from the previous RE season as well as the first two TG seasons. Because of this, the grade given by this review may not necessarily be the same as the one I gave for this season in particular.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\r\nFor starters, like with the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:Re tried to document a compelling psycho/horror story about a young man named Kaneki who treads between living as a human and living as a Ghoul, and the conflict surrounding him and the companions he made.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s backtrack a little bit here: the TG story itself starts off fairly decent, where it portrays the livelihood and strife of Ghouls in human society. Due to their carnivorous nature, being only able to sustain off the very species they most physically resemble, Ghouls are often the targets of countless acts of discrimination, which include, but not are limited to, law enforcement, public fear, and general hostility. Ghouls are still very much like human in terms of emotion, sociality, and just about everywhere else, except biologically; because of this, living peaceful lives is something they value (at least what the show tried to portray in the first season). This kind of setup was what Tokyo Ghoul tried to utilize to distinct itself or put itself a cut or level above the usual urban horror or semi-vampire stories out there.\\n\r\nWhile the initial setup and ideas were very good on paper, the overall execution of the show was an underwhelming mess. For my perspective at least, the entire show just seemed like a redundant showcasing of material that would belong more to shounen (or shounen-esque) show; basically, Tokyo Ghoul is practically a shounen series disguised as a beautiful-looking, one-of-a-kind psycho/horror story. The entire Tokyo Ghoul anime series also suffered from a considerable lack of exposition and details, so it fails hard in trying to make the show\u2019s plot/narrative easier to understand. Another issue the Tokyo Ghoul anime has is its complete, utter lack of a sense of proper pacing. The pacing of the entire story, for the most part, only moves at one speed: FAST. Fast and Furious.\\n\\n\r\nFor the TG:Re series by itself, the story is extremely incongruent with the story from the first two seasons, resulting in a complete lack of cohesiveness and siegeway. I\u2019ll explain why.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what we should know from the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul mixed its levels of extreme violence with fleeting moments of beauty and/or emotion to demonstrate that the Ghouls are genuinely striving for normalcy amidst the atmosphere of brutality, and the struggles they go through in their attempts to achieve that ideal peaceful livelihood. The taste of coffee and the tranquility of a coffeehouse, due to Ghouls being able to at least enjoy coffee like humans do, are the sole two things that Ghouls and humans can share peacefully, so the usage of the coffeehouse in the first and second seasons as a base for the Ghouls to set up a peaceful coexistence makes so much damn sense.\\n\\n\r\nWith the two RE seasons, most of that pretty much went out the window. Tokyo Ghoul:Re basically betrays almost everything positive that the two \u201cOG\u201d seasons tried to use, abandoning the storytelling elements altogether. Tokyo Ghoul:Re, as a story, doesn\u2019t seem to really know what it\u2019s doing or where it\u2019s going, as it bounces between several different points of ongoing conflict as well as foregoing any necessary content that would act as important transitions or siegeways. Thus it does not seem to let us as viewers try to understand or comprehend just exactly what the heck is going on. The way it goes about trying to introduce new characters and plot points makes me feel like (or realize) that the TG:RE story in particular is just\u2026.without a soul. There are no moments where the story tries to make contrasts between brutality and beauty. Nearly all the characters on either side of the conflict no longer seem to fight for something important and precious that they\u2019ve lost\u2026they seem to fight for the sake of triumphing and looking supposedly like the good guys. I\u2019m gonna be real here\u2026.there is no absolutely no sense of good guys or bad guys, and not in a good way. The whole chaotic jumping from battle to battle to battle\u2026prevent us from having emotional impressions for the characters\u2019 reasons to keep fighting and struggling. Additionally, practically all the main characters, who were the focal point in the first two seasons, are pretty much all sidelined, and barely make much of a difference in TG:RE\u2019s story progression. Because this also defeats the narrative and thematic parts of what Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s original concept had, it has to get me and others wondering: \u201cWhat was the point of all that effort in storytelling in the first season? Was that just all for naught?\u201d Instead, we get a whole amount of just over-edgy tones, clich\u00e9 lines, useless plot points, forced drama, etc\u2026..literally everything that ROTS under the sun.\\n\\n\r\nART: 2/10; SOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nContrasting to the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:RE\u2019s animation quality has considerably dropped, especially during this second season. In terms of animation quality, the majority of this season felt more like a slideshow, which resulted in messy, tensionless action and cringeworthy half-hearted attempts to bring emotion. Not much else to say here\u2026it\u2019s just plain awful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtracks, I\u2019ll just go ahead and say this as probably part of the minority. I don\u2019t really like the Tokyo Ghoul soundtracks on a personal level, but I\u2019ll at least say it\u2019s still really nice, and does make an attempt to fit the theme of the show itself; additionally, it at least keeps the Tokyo Ghoul fans interested. As for the voice acting, though, there\u2019s no sense of genuine emotion, and feels forced now, compared to the first two seasons; it\u2019s as if the voice actors themselves were starting to give up on the whole season themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna be someone to excessively chew out Kaneki as a character, aka TG\u2019s version of Shinji Ikari\u2026I\u2019ll let someone else do that. Besides, that by itself is not necessary anymore\u2026why? Because it\u2019s literally EVERYONE at fault. The reason for this is because the utilization, characterization, and development of the entire cast is virtually non-existent. The show basically introduced a bunch of new characters so suddenly and expected us to care about them right then and there, while ignoring all the characters from the previous two seasons that we actually do care about, as well as deconstructing them to certain degrees to further render them irrelevant to the plot. Because of the story\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d pacing and drastic change of themes from the first two seasons, there is no real sense of progression in any of the characters, not a single one. All we really can see in the character department are just mindless husks specifically programmed to emulate fake emotion, resulting in obnoxious, overly dramatic lines that make us cringe more than feel for them. It is also because of this that we tend to easily forget who\u2019s who, even if it\u2019s the main characters\u2026apparently the show neglected to properly address the cast\u2019s collectively similar-looking hair colors and hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\r\nThis could\u2019ve been a 0/10, in all honesty. From the first two seasons, I actually did enjoy seeing the fleeting moments of emotion and beauty, because like I mentioned earlier, they symbolized the Ghouls\u2019 struggles to live normal, peaceful lives. Even though I still though the first season was still barely sub-par, those were good moments that I can appreciate.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re, however, throws the good stuff ALL away. Throughout both RE seasons, the show became one of those kinds where it felt like a chore to watch, just for the sake of seeing how this messy conundrum of a show that tried to take itself seriously, ends. The attempts at dramatic lines and edgy violence during the fights are just laughable.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what\u2019s even worse? The story was so discombobulated that Fumination, in order to address the amount of confusion from the viewers, started a weekly live stream of the series where they explain everything leading up to the TG:Re story and what\u2019s happening in each episode. THAT\u2019S NOT A GOOD SIGN AT ALL.\\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the real reason why it\u2019s 1/10 instead of 0/10: TG:Re Season 2 Episode 7, (or TG:RE Episode 19). Yes, the infamous sex scene. The sequence leading up to that point was especially quite hilarious, I\u2019ll admit, and the comedic gag in the \u201caftermath\u201d of the intercourse was pretty amusing, too. Sadly, though, the sex scene by itself was screwed by the aforementioned bad quality of just showcasing slideshows. If the production crew had any sort of common sense by that point, then they should\u2019ve just at least put actual quality in that scene and make the show a hentai for at least 10 minutes\u2026is that too hard to ask? If the show is already so bad overall, they should at least give us a fleeting moment where we can say \u201ctotally effing worth it\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re\u2019s lack of effective storytelling, overall character development, nonsensical rapid pacing, and degrading animation quality is of diabolical proportions. As an entire story and series, Tokyo Ghoul is probably one of the most overrated series I\u2019ve ever watched in my life, making the likes of Sword Art Online seem all too innocent and actually justified, and that says quite a lot. This second season of TG:Re by itself is one of those shows where I can actually say is \u201cobjectively bad\u201d due to the lack of execution, direction, quality consistency, and overall character management. A better alternative to Tokyo Ghoul has already been mentioned at the start of this review: Parasyte The Maxim. That show has far better storytelling and characterization of the cast, as well as better handling of the themes, metaphors, and moral messages.\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re one of those Tokyo Ghoul fanatics who want to watch the show for the sake of quenching your own Ghoul-like hunger, go right on ahead. I\u2019m not stopping you. It\u2019s your choice to make, not mine. As for the general anime fan, I\u2019d suggest watching just the first two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul, and then just stop and avoid the TG:RE mess entirely, cause it\u2019s really not worth seeing the story deconstructing itself and the theme it wanted to show from the start.\\n\r\nOr better yet\u2026.just read the manga and save your life.\\n",

            "content": "\"SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST SEASON OF TOKYO GHOUL:RE\"\r\nIt's fair to say that the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:re didn't leave a good impression on fans of the series (In fact, I think it made it worse). The problems that Root A had only got worse in Tokyo Ghoul:re with its only saving grace being its soundtrack. And with Root A no longer being canon, it kind of left Anime only's confused as to what the hell was going on (Although the story did not help with that). It would probably take a miracle for the anime franchise to redeem itselfand this second season would have to be the one to do it. I mean it couldn't get any worse, right? Well you would be wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax and grab your torches and pitchforks as I present to you the anime review of the the second season of Tokyo Ghoul:re. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHaise Sasaki is no more. Kaneki has regained his memories and now wants out of the CCG. Exploiting a ghoul raid on the max security complex for ghouls, he, along with his ghoul friends, manages to escape and now plans to end the bloodshed between humans and ghouls. By becoming their leader, he wants peace. Meanwhile, the CCG has tracked down Aogiri's base of operations and raids it, hoping to put an end to them once and for all. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say too much because that would mean I would had to go deep into spoiler territory. Not that it matters at this point. The story kind of goes back to the roots of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul and asks the question \"what is the difference between a human and a ghoul?\" Only this time, it is done much, much worse. To begin with, the story's pacing is awful. For example, Kaneki starts off as Kan-EDGY for a couple of episodes, only to revert back to nice Kaneki who just wants to protect his friends after two episodes. There is no development in the story to progress story threads and character arcs as it is all rushed to get a conclusion. Now, I've never read the manga. The anime is the only time I've experienced as to what Tokyo Ghoul has to offer. But it is clearly obvious where parts of the story have been just gutted out. There is little build up or over arching development here to get us invested into the story or its characters. It rushes from one part of the story to the next in order get to a conclusion. Not allowing the time to develop your plot just leaves people confused. It makes them go, \"what the hell is going on?\" \\n\\n\r\nYou could take the story less seriously, but that is clearly not a good option. This kind of story needs to be paid attention but without the depth of its world and its characters, then you just leaving us to not care about the plot whatsoever. With the messages and themes Tokyo Ghoul tries to leave us, not caring about the plot because there isn't alot there to get us invested just tosses all of them aside and so we are left with a plot that is just going through the motion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the characters. Depth is clearly lacking in these characters to get us invested. Now considering that there are so many characters in Tokyo Ghoul now, I know not everyone is going to get a fair share of development. But when important characters don't get good development, it has a repercussion on the rest of the cast unless they really stand out. In this case, none of them stand out. You would think that Kaneki would stand out and accepting who he is and what he has become, but nope. He's as boring and lifeless as the rest of the cast. The only character that got a sense of real closure to their character arc was Urie as he has slowly been able to stand on his own two feet and forge his own path while acknowledging those around him. Everyone else just get rushed conclusions to their character arcs. \\n\\n\r\nReturning characters also get little development or reasons as to why they have returned. Instead of me going, \"Oh cool, he/she is back.\" I'm just like \"Ummm, who are you again? Oh yeah, now I remember you.\" There is a lack of fanfare to get us hyped about these returning characters to make the overall plot more interesting and make it more dynamic. It can be the same with established characters because some of them I barely know and the show wants me to care for them, But I don't care. I don't care for them because it seems the anime doesn't care about them. So why should I? \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is once again pretty lackluster and feels even worse than before. The fight scenes especially feel lackluster with the cheap ways of animating a fight scene. This includes shaky cameras, cutaways and basically treating it like a slideshow. It really makes the fights have less impact and don't invoke a sense awe or grip that the fight should invoke. Considering the amount of fight scenes in this season, that's a big negative. The art design as well feels uninspired as it just looks so bleak and bland. Tokyo Ghoul hasn't really been known for its animation quality. But here, it just feels even worse than before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this series. It just sounds so beautiful and wondrous. You can listen to the music and just forget all of the bad that has come from this series. It has always been a highlight of the Tokyo Ghoul franchise and here is no exception. It continues the trend of this franchise having great music. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening as well is great. TK returns for this opening called \"Kartharsis.\" Along with the great vocals and instrumentals, the visuals are also nicely symbolic, showing how Kaneki will always keep going, no matter what persona he adopts. While not as beautiful or colourful as Unraval, its probably the second best opening out of the four we've got. It's funny, no matter how crap the series is. The openings are always agreed on to be one of the best. The ending sequence does show us some beautiful art; backed up some nice vocals to calm the viewer and realise the beauty in this world. \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub was always considered, by me, to be one of the more underrated dubs out there. Austin Tindle puts in another good performance as Kaneki as he brings a very humble Kaneki yet he can also bring a good serious tone as well. Other performances like Adam Gibbs as Urie, Brina Palencia as Touka and pretty much the rest of the cast are also well done. They managed to make the material they were given work which is honestly surprising.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nThis mess of an adaptation of one of the most popular manga of all time has been a travesty. At this point, I wonder who Tokyo Ghoul's anime adaptation is for. It ain't for the anime only's because with them probably being lost in what is going on and Root A not being canon doesn't help. It ain't for those who read the manga because they just watched this show be mangled into a shell of what it is supposed to be. Even die hard fans must be dissapointed in this. Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is probably the worst in the franchise and since this anime franchise has been going down hill since the first Tokyo Ghoul season, that's saying something. I can't care for the story or its characters because there isn't enough there to make me care. Its animation is lackluster than ever and the soundtrack can only go so far to make it slightly better. I heard this season was adapting at least 120 chapters. 120 CHAPTERS! You can't adapt that much without the story suffering as a result and it shows here. \\n\\n\r\nI hope someone, someday reboots this franchise and is able to recapture the magic that made the first season of Tokyo Ghoul so enjoyable. Give it the treatment it deserves. But for now, we look back at what is probably one of the most overrated anime franchises of all time and makes us wonder if it could have been so much more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 3.4/10 Recommendation: Don't f***ing bother\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul does not deserve all the hate it gets. Is it perfect? No. But is it as bad as everyone wants to make it out to be? No. It\u2019s understandable that fans of the manga would be upset over what even I will admit is a flawed adaption. But does that make the show bad? While yes being confused over who some of the characters are was annoying, I still loved watching this show and seeing characters I've come to enjoy grow up. Before I go into the review I want to clarify that this review will be a overall of all four seasonsbut I will focus mainly on the two Re seasons. I will also state that I have only read the first manga and not yet Re. Overall Tokyo Ghoul does a solid job of giving its viewers a 6-8 out of 10 anime that takes its own way of telling the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10): Not much to say on this one. The animation is beautiful. Characters are colorful and lifelike. The kagune and everything else ghoul related always looks intense with a touch of horror. Backgrounds look lifelike and when there's a scene in Kaneki\u2019s head it always gives that feeling of being inside a consciousness. Animation should not be a deter for this show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice Acting (8/10): While not part of their planning I do detract for the english cast, the gap between the two casts is just to wide but I only take away half a point for it. It loses its other points for background music, for a intense and deep show the music just never seems to want to add to what's going on. However the brilliant openings and endings as well as A+ voice acting gives the show a high score. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): While a mixed bag the characters from Ghoul are some of the most widely known and influential. Hell I still do the Kaneki finger crack two years later. Others like Touka, Juzou, Hinami and the the quinque group, allow for a variety of personalities and character development. While not always flushed out the development is there and shows that these characters are more then just what they were made out to be. The characters of Ghoul make the show, as much as everything else helps the variety of people to be attached to allows the show to touch who it does. However we must all bow to down to the ultimate puffball Saiko.\\n\\n\r\nPlot (5.5/10): Yeah here\u2019s where I gotta be critical. The story is a mess, the first two seasons did a decent job of telling a storyline but all that went down the drain in Re. I don't know if it was just the amount of anime I watch in a week, which is a lot, but I felt like I could never remember what happened in the last episode. Obviously their were a ton of characters that we knew nothing about and just had to accept were there. I mean the whole \u201ctwist\u201d in the last season with the Washuu clan made me pause and think if any of these people were mentioned before. So yes the story is a complete mess, I understand it's hard to put everything from a manga into a anime but if that's the case the studio should have requested longer seasons or just made it fully original. Either would of been better then what was produced. However at the end of the day the story stumbles together into something that is still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Taking away the many things wrong with Re and Ghoul as a whole, I enjoy watching the show. It gave me a story about a boy who just wanted to protect the things that made him happy. It has made me friends and given me laughs and the euphoria moments of nostalgia. If someone didn\u2019t enjoy this show and kept watching it, it was only so they could complain about it more. But to me and I'm sure many others out there, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that provided the entertainment that it was made to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7-8/10): I can't really pick a grade for this. I would say for Re season 2, it gets a 7 but Tokyo Ghoul as a whole gets a 8. A series should not be punished because the studio making it twisted the plot. While the mistakes of this show do detract a lot, the positives that people don't look at still make it a very enjoyable show. A lot of the hate that Ghoul gets is because of fans who are upset, and while I can understand that, a show does not deserved to be tanked just because you don't like how it was made. The Tokyo Ghoul anime will go down as one of the most controversial but life changing shows, with a helping of impactful and memorable characters, especially Saiko. \\n",

So keep in mind that I fully understand you, even tho I've read the Tokyo Ghoul manga.\r\nSo, I had a friend that started reading the manga way back then and he always told me that the manga was better than the anime and that I should read it. I kept hearing this from not only him but from the whole anime community. So when the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:Re came out Ifelt forced to read the manga cause I lost so many important things that have only been explained in the manga... I was lost, I didn't know what was going on, they were rushing the anime so hard... and now they're doing even worse since they re cramming 120 chapters of the manga in 12 episodes, and let me tell you, that is a fckin JOKE! It is simply not possible but whatever. With that being said I decided to give a chance to the manga. Let me tell you that it was the best thing I could've done to fully enjoy what is Tokyo Ghoul, the character development feels so good, the mental progression of Kaneki feels even better and we can actually understand what Kaneki is feeling. It's simply wonderful how reading the manga made me an even bigger fan of Tokyo Ghoul (and keep in mind that it was one of my favorite animes by the time). If someone comes to me and asks \"Do you recommend watching Tokyo Ghoul?\" I'll just say NO, I do not. I'll not tell them to read the manga cause since they don't read manga or are not already engaged in the series it is ok for them to not read the manga, but if you love Tokyo Ghoul, PLEASE, go read the manga! I swear you will not regret it!\\n\\n\r\nI just felt like saying this since Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is being a complete joke to the series, please kids go read the manga if you love TG, if not just drop this shit. It is not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nSorry bad englando.\\n\\n\r\n Have a nice day! :)))",

But, we have to judge on what we have. Not what's missing from the series that Everyone doesn't know.\r\nNow I understand and sympathize with long time TG manga fansand I Know why TG gets all this hate but I do not think it deserves this much hate and low low scores as the adaption stands right now with only 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the animation was sometimes bad or nonexistent\\n\r\nYes, every single fight could've been better, and longer.\\n\r\nYes, I was confused on the story and shouldn't have to read the manga to understand what's going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I thoroughly enjoyed this series because I went alittle out of my way too.\\n\r\nThere were so many good moments in this season I just feel the good outweighs the bad here,  and the most important parts of the story that were not skipped were very very good and well done.\\n\\n\r\nI Can't give this series a mediocre score, because I have discovered it through the anime and I genuinely enjoyed the whole ride.

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul: re is the biggest mystery anime of all time without even trying. It never shows all of its cards, it doesn\u2019t clue you in on the show\u2019s meaning, it shows what it wants to show and dips. Personally, I\u2019m more inclined to like this sort of story writing, books/anime like Overlord did it best in my opinion but the problem with this is that it wasn\u2019t intentional. Clearly, there was some sort of disconnect on what the manga was portraying and what the anime was able to deliver and something went wrong, I have several theories on why that happened but that\u2019s notimportant, what\u2019s important is whether or not I\u2019d recommend it (I won\u2019t).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul started off really strong in the series and I fought tooth and nail to defend it even though all its confusing storylines, but I\u2019d only recommend it if you\u2019re willing to solve any questions by yourself (by using the wiki) because the anime isn\u2019t going to answer any of them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves, the Tokyo Ghoul:re manga really wasn\u2019t that good in the first place, so when Studio Pierrot was told to make an anime adaptation of this they were fighting an uphill battle. Not only that but they were only allowed to use 12 episodes per season so they had to cram. This, of course, led to some scenes getting cut in a manga where it already felt like scenes were cut from the final draft making the whole thing a lot worse. The actual plot wasn\u2019t really that bad but they tried to paint both sides of a story by making EVERY OTHER CHARACTER an insufferable asshole the whole time to paint both sides as awful as humanly possible and it made it almost impossible to root for anyone. That being said there were a few moments the anime managed to keep which were really nice (not enough, but there were still there).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSay what you will about the story but HOT DAMN were (some of) those kagunes BADASS. I feel like all of the art budget went to the fight scenes which really doesn\u2019t matter since 90% of the show was pure fight scenes. This does, however, mean that anything else no matter how serious or impactful to the story, never looked as good as it really intended to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nI can\u2019t lie, I loved the opening AND closing, its one of those shows where you watch youtube videos of both the Opening and the Ending. Voice actors were more or less on top of it, they all fit their roles to a T, funnily enough, though, all of the best voice actors spoke the least. Finally, the sounds of kagunes activating sounded badass, but without a good reference, I can\u2019t say for sure whether its top of the line or bottom-tier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nMy favorite part of any show would be its character development, unfortunately, the only person to ever receive any sort of character development would be Kaneki. This could\u2019ve been negated with a cast of reasonably written characters but as I said earlier: every other character were written to is insufferable as possible so that\u2019s COMPLETELY out of the window. I honestly would\u2019ve cared at all if Kaneki acted like\u2026 well\u2026 Kaneki in more than three scenes I would\u2019ve given this a higher score. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nGotta give points where its due, while I was confused the entire time the action scenes were pretty top notch in terms of enjoyment so I\u2019d give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis show is 100% flash no filler, it's like the recently completed: Baki (2018) without even trying which is actually not a good thing at all. I would\u2019ve recommended it unless:\\n\r\nYou\u2019re not looking for a story\\n\r\nYou have the time to search through the wiki/manga to answer all your questions. \\n",

(as much as I appreciate the anime returned to having a song from TK of Ling Tosite Sigure as opening, sinceLTS' emo music is perfect for openings of psychological or drama series) mediocre, in lack of better terms, and the rushed pacing of a sore attempt to adapt +120 manga chapters in 12 episodes either sometimes makes the characters' decisions make no sense in the context (what context lol) or takes a lot of character development some had in the manga by toying around with the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that yet this isn't by any means the worst season says a lot about this supposed anime adaptation. Let's not forget how Root A provided us with a cheap opening that made the last two episodes of Evangelion look decent in comparision (and the song they picked, man we're talking bout an earrape) and with a non-canon, deeply flawed plot that, by some herculean leap in logic, had Kaneki re-written as an edgy character with a Stockholm Syndrome joining the organization that kidnapped and tortured him [there were subtle hints of the storyline of Kaneki's gang being skipped or rewritten prior to Root A, as the season 1 finale showed Banjou and his allies freed by Tsukiyama instead of Kaneki, ffs], and totally skipped his quest for revenge in the manga. But let's keep it to this season only...\\n\\n\r\nAmong the things this season skipped so far: cutting off some important parts of the Rushima Landing arc (including Eto's arrest by the CCG which happened somewhere in between the Tsukiyama Extermination and Rushima Landing, Mutsuki's capture by Torso, OF ALL THINGS, since it's pretty much the catalyst of his future mental instability and establishment as an antagonist), Arima's full explanation on what the Sunlit Garden is, Irimi and Koma's survival, the CCG Lab Raid... and I could do this all day. The point is, so much of the original pacing was skipped that the storyline as shown in this season doesn't connect, all thanks to Studio Parrot's decision to cut everything that could've made it connect in the first place, and so if you might want to pick up the manga to understand whatever the fuck is happening here.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I can only hope the future will someday bring a reboot animated and screen written by a more serious studio, and honestly keep watching this only to satisfy my own curiosity as to how much can this series get screwed.",

It was a story full of subtle details, philosophy and psychology.\r\n I remember reading through the same chapter a couple of times and each time discovering something new: things thatpreviously appeared to be negligible attained meaning and revealed another side of the story to ponder about. After reading a recent chapter I would go to Youtube and watch people analyse it, pointing out details that were really mind-blowing.\\n\\n\r\n And now to the tragic part: NONE of that is present in the anime. All the details and peculiarities from the manga were discarded in favor of flavorless combat and showing off. The story itself is terribly rushed. If you haven't read the manga you probably won't recognize half of the characters that appear on screen. Almost all character-bonding and character-building scenes and dialogues were cut which in turn made moments that were supposed to be powerful drab and tasteless.\\n\\n\r\n If you neglect character development then you'll have to pay the price of everything losing value: basically after you're halfway into the anime you stop caring about the plot and everything that's happening on screen and that's the genuine tragedy that befell this anime.\\n\\n\r\n I wouldn't recommend watching this to anyone, there's nothing you'll find here, except for probably decent music, which still doesn't redeem this anime. Truly, a great disappointment.",

You won't understand what is going on if you don't already know the plot beforehand. The anime cuts out all the exposition and context clues that are crucial to understanding the story, and leaves a jumbled mess of confusing events. All the scenes that should have emotional weight don't because there is no build-up to it. Tense high-stake situations become comical instead because of the horrible animation and lightning speed adaptation of a plot that jumps the shark.\r\n\"Please someone tellme what is going on.\" - Kuki Urie, in a scene that seems to break the 4th wall.\\n\\n\r\nThis show should be considered fan service for manga readers who want to see their favorite chapters animated and colorized. When looked at it that way, it isn't too terrible. The character designs stay surprisingly consistent throughout the whole series with no horrific deformations. Studio Pierrot took some creative liberties and animated an exciting Arata armor fight scene. The kagune stay true to their manga designs, and were sometimes even impressive - Tatara and Saiko's come to mind. It was exciting to see Kaneki's final form in action.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? If you haven't read the manga, it's a hard no.

            "content": "Mangaka: I made a sequel to the Tokyo Kushu manga, wanna read it?\r\nMe: Sure, let's see... yeah, this story is fucking awful, every single character was practically mind-raped, the art is so messy I literally can't tell what is happening during these action sequences and there is just too much text for this to be called a manga. Let's face it, this wouldn't be passing any editor's radar if the series was less popular.\r\nStudio Pierrot: *teleports behind my back* pssst, kiddo, we can easily make this thing 7 times worse, just watch.\r\nIt's no secret that Tokyo Kushu is a problematic franchise. This for the simplereason that its anime adaptations are messy to say the least. The first season stays loyal to the manga, the second is non-canon, the third one is based to a manga sequel and assuming that who ever is watching it has also read the manga since anime prequel that leads to the events seen there doesn't exist. And now when the series is for the first time ever getting some consistency with its making, the outcome is --well--  this fucking thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this sequel is impressively bland. It's so uninteresting and boring that it's not even worth of getting mad over. The whole thing relies on some supposedly fucked up society and edgy hierarchy system where the plot itself is filled with side characters that are in no way whatsoever believable and cliches so lousily written and executed that it could as well be a parody. Following the story line is hard as hell because the scenes change and story advances in such a tempo, yet nothing that happens really seems to matter because that's how the story presents itself. Half of the entire dialogue, on the other hand, could be replaced with the line \"because I am bully.\" and the series would be the exact same thing. The \"drama\" writing is so edgy and hard-try sad that I am mainly feeling disgust whenever some suicidal little girl declares their \"darkness\".\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I ever found this to be good at all are the main characters. I read the whole manga just to see if ships sail, but it was still worth it for few reasons: The characters interacting with each others offers some nice chemistry. The banter is pretty fun and the character centric comedic reliefs -- that rarely are have the real focus, rather work in the background -- are cute and almost relaxing to witness at times. The whole thing with its SoL side had a real \"big family\" feel to it, and personally, I came to appreciate it for that reason. Now, whoever made this anime adaptation clearly didn't see any charm in that so instead the only thing they really are showing here is the awfully written main story and every single lackcluster of a fight scene. *yawn*... I guess. Some supposedly badass dude said: \"645 is the numbers of times I could have finished you off during this fight.\" Conveniently, I considered dropping this series the exact same amount of times during it. If the action + drama and supposed horror / psychology side of the story -- not to leave the beyond fake mystery side unmentioned -- all were replaced with nothing but (the) slice of life content, this thing would still not be \"good\" but it certainly would be better. \\n\\n\r\nJust to quote urbandictionary: Mind rape occurs whenever one's brain feels as though it has been assaulted viciously by some event or thing in reality. This applies to half the cast as it is. Since the setup for Kushu Re was executed with memoryloss cliches and writing equally pathetic to that, an extra effort is required to make the thing believable and to make any sense now. So what did Pierrot decide to do? To not even try! 2 cour total is enough to cover 180 chapters worth of manga, it seems. So often when I see a character do something, I wonder who is this person? I know who they are supposed to be, but what they do is just not what their character originally was or what it was developed into. Needless to say, it is not pretty to watch. The pacing of this thing easy to sum up with a meme = fast as fuck boii. The sense our story and characters make = n/a. However, what really makes no sense at all is how the anime adaptation is being dealt with by the studio. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season had good production values no matter how it is looked. Its opening song was the biggest meme since Shingeki no Kyojin, every bit of the art and audio was used to make the series better than it would've otherwise been. It was pretty and sounded good. Smart decisions. The second season didn't suffer from many problems considering these departments. Especially the whole scene that leads to the ending is magnificently done no matter how I look at it, production-wise, that is. This season and the 3rd are way more loyal to the awful manga art. The action scenes are almost as messy and tension-lacking as in the source material -- sometimes not even animated. There are not many things currently going in the series that I find worth of praising. The OP is fantastic tho. Tokyo Kushu has been going for worse since the beginning and there seems to be no end to that. \\n\\n\r\nAs a person who doesn't especially like Tokyo Kushu, I did quite enjoy seeing this thing destroy itself over the years, but at this point it's not even funny anymore since it being awful has become a part of the consensus already. After episode 01, I was supposed to casually insult all teenage action anime by stating this is the exact same thing as all of them, but damn, at this point even I myself couldn't buy that statement anymore.",

But I, for one, didn't! So, with that said, let's get into it, shall we? Tokyo Ghoul:RE is.... Quite an atrocious anime. You've probably heard this a 1000 times by now, and so I'll be the 1001st.. Never have I been so disgusted with a form of media until now. Save yourself, and don't waste your time with this.\r\nStory - 4\r\nThe story of this season is overall pretty dry and flavorless. These arcs are just notvery good. Period. I thought this was the case in the manga, as well. After a CERTAIN MAJOR INDIVIDUAL'S PASSING, the quality in story just drops. Every theme TG wished to take on just seems to loosely hang on as everything is dragged away by the boring narrative. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the hundreds of scenes that were just flat out REMOVED from the anime to make room. These scenes, believe it or not, are kind of important, and are needed to progress the story properly. \\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Funimation needed to start a weekly podcast to EXPLAIN what was going on in this series. THAT'S when you know you REEEEALLY messed it up.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 2\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of it all. I would rather watch a 5 year old's slideshow on microsoft powerpoint than sit through this again. The artstyle is generic, the animation is static, and everything is colorless. It's appalling to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are more still frame shots in this series than anything else, and that, in my opinion at least, is a really big shame. I'm still hoping for another studio to pick up this series and do a reboot, because Pierrot obviously did NOT do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are the most horrid examples of this. It's always just slideshows. It's all just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound WOULD be the strong part of the anime, considering the soundtrack for this series was beautiful and actually felt appropriate for the series, but.... One issue.\\n\\n\r\nNo new tracks were written for this season, and the studio kept reusing the same tracks over and over and over and over. Needless to say, it's more redundant that water torture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the TG manga were the strong spot. And so, believe it or not, when you take away everything that makes a character believable, relate-able, and interesting, you get generic stick figures that no one cares for. And that's just what this studio did. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into detail, for that would be entering spoiler territory, but in short, all the characters had a majority of their traits, backstory, and justifications removed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 \\n\\n\r\nI hated this anime, if you can't tell already. To say I didn't enjoy ANY of it would be a lie, however. I liked the opening theme by TK and a few of the tracks on the OST (before they got so stale to me I couldn't stand them, of course) but that's pretty much it. From the animation to the poor story telling.... All of it is just a big loss. I would actually sit there during each episode, looking at the time and saying to myself, \"Is it over yet?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1\\n\\n\r\nIt's pathetic. I've listed all my reasons as to why I think this. I'm not gonna preach high and mighty about the manga, it has flaws too, but if you want to enjoy this series, read the manga. That's all I need to say about it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd again, if you somehow enjoyed this heaping pile of trash, good on you!",

Tokyo Ghoul Root A was so bad it killed off a big chunk of the anime fanbase for the series where they all decided to read the manga which while reading it they opinions of the anime drastically changed for the worst where people my self-included no longer consider even the decently handle first season to be good.\\n\\n\r\nNow fast forward 3 years later we have the Tokyo Ghoul re anime adaptation and let's just say that this show was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nAm not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is one of the worst animes ever made because not only this show is an absolute failure a manga adaptation but it's also a failure of an anime product to a point where simply doesn't function correctly and trust me when I say this that nothing more infuriating than an anime that doesn't function at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said let's begin with this broken butchered feast.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nTaking place two years after\u00a0the CCG\u2019s raid on Anteiku. The Aogiri Tree is growing stronger than ever and the ghouls still continue to pose a huge problem for CCG. In an attempt to exterminate the ghouls, CCG creates a special team called the Quinx Squad where humans have undergone surgery and have gained special ghoul powers.\u00a0 The story follows, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half human who is Quinx Squad He has been trained by the special class Investigator Arima Kishou and who seems to be missing memories of his past or more likely of the person he used to be.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nUhh, there are so many things wrong with the story alone I seriously don't know where to begin and even then talking about this shows problems gives me physical pain. I honestly cannot believe of how awful this series and with that said let's start talking about this dreadful story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first mistakes that Tokyo Ghoul re was how the plot presented itself to the viewer. Instead of getting a half recap episode where it shows us showcases the Kaneki vs Arima you know the fight that was non-existent in Root A the show decided to jump to straight to the action while horrendously introducing its new chararters. I understand that Studio Pierrot wanted to get straight to the action and all but there should be least some decent transition piece from original series to re: This is just straight up ADHD pandering and this poor transition piece alone really highlights how poorly directed this series is especially re:S2 where everything goes to shit in terms of writing and dialogue.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Tokyo Ghoul re is an absolute disaster\u00a0in every level. Despite this show being 24 episodes mind, you the series moves at a fast pace like a typical battle shounen the fast shounen pacing clearly doesn't work in Tokyo Ghoul re as the series was meant to be this psychological horror\u00a0drama series that has a lot of chararter and story building. Not this broken ass shounen series that completely butchers everything that the original series has set off.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for this broken mess is the direction. Am not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is easily the worst directed series I have ever seen in my life. LIKE HOLY SHIT!!! So many awkward scene transition, awful camera positioning and abysmal shot composition and framing.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wondering why I haven't touched the plot for Tokyo Ghoul re: Well that's because the plot is a complete lobotomised bastardisation of its own source material where all the story elements that happened in the source material have been butchered to oblivion where it no longer makes any sort of sence.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was so horrendously broken Funimation had to go out of the way to explain the all the events of Tokyo Ghoul re on a live stream and even then they are having a hard time explaining thanks to this shows pathetic pacing and directing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of Tokyo Ghoul re: is a complete abomination that shouldn't have seen the light of day. Screw you Studio Pierrot.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nThe characters don't fare much better and that's the tragic part because these characters can be good but the pacing and direction completely kill these characters before they can even open them damm months. Another thing that makes the characters even worse is how the series loves to introduced new characters and like with the original series they barely left an impression in the narrative as they show once or twice then they are never seen or at times ever heard from again...\\n\\n\r\nKaneki/Haiseki is a boring and inconsistent husk of a chararter. Outside of him being a broken adapted chararter to the core thanks to Studio Pierrot and the staff being the show being incompetent as hell he just boring and inconsistent edgy who does edge/nerdy thing for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought Touka was already useless enough in Root A you ain't seen nothing yet because apart from having set with Kaneki in S2 she literally does nothing at all. What a way to kill a chararter even harder.\\n\\n\r\nThe Quinx Squad are all bland and uninteresting as they just exist to move this broken plot along. The same thing from Arima as well all the returning chararters from the previous series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters. Well, let's pretend I never said that because they all just appear and disappear as they please.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Tokyo Ghoul re were about as interesting as watching DSP Gaming Persona 3 let's play and the way the characters were treated were worse than reading a bad Naruto fanfic.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nOh boy, where do I even being with this trash on a visual level? The first 2 seasons of Tokyo Ghoul did not have the best production values but both seasons at various point had some decent animation that actually worked. Tokyo Ghoul re: both seasons has none of that as it contently remanded to be a poorly animated shit show from start to finish. Studio Pierrot took very good looking art from the manga and reduced them into the muddy toilet bowl as the show at various point looked like it was drawn and coloured in freaking DeviantArt in the year 2004 and as a result, the chararters designs in this show look liked dogshit. The background scenery is even worse as the show loves it uses its blacks, greys, white and dark blues for the scenery giving the show a dark, depressing feel. Unfortunately, I don't think Tokyo Ghoul re understands visuals directing because despite the show being Quote \"Dark\" the show's dialogue as well the fight scenes that scream shounen bias all over the place.\\n\r\nThe animation in Tokyo Ghoul re is somehow even worse.\\n\r\nSaying that Tokyo Ghoul re: animation is a travesty is a fast understatement. \\n\r\nI'm not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re has the absolute worst animation I have ever seen from this decade. Yes even worse than The Master of Rock Bottom. While the animation of the master of rock bottom was a complete abomination least you can somewhat laugh at the animation on that because it was pretty hilarious at certain points. Tokyo Ghoul re has none of that, in fact, I can go as far that even hentai's are better animated than Tokyo Ghoul re: Where do I begin with this nightmare. For starters the consent still frames are out of control as scenes look like it was done in Adobe After Effects in under a day. The fight choreography is piss poor the use of budget cuts were out of hand and show is simply a poorly animated shitfeast that had no care or soul.\\n\r\nThe worst thing about the animation about Tokyo Ghoul re were the horrifying camera shake for the action scenes Holy hell I have never seen relay on camera shakes to simulate character movement in my life and I have seen The Asterisk War, and Black Clover where both of these shows abuses its camera shakes to quote simulate epic moments. However, it's so much worse here as unlike those two shows were they some okay animation every now and then this series feels it was animated by someone who has just learned to use Adobe After Effects. WHAT THE F***.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin of Tokyo Ghoul re: is the second season poster. Not only the poster is filled with massive spoilers that can annoy the viewer especially anime-only fans who haven't touched the manga but it looked it was done in Adobe Photoshop in less than an hour.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul re like with the show butchered narrative and production values is bland and uninspired. Yes, it may had some iconic track that played from the original but the show poor direction kills it as the show seemed to play them in very inappropriate scenes. The example of this happens in the last episode of season 1 as the series decided to play happy ending song while all the sad scenes were going on.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes were pretty decent for what they were but the ultimately not that memorable\u00a0\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub well let's not go there as it just as bad as a whole script and production.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWow just wow. I honestly cannot believe that this series especially Season 2 was a thing.\\n\r\nHow did this anime even got released without getting cancelled?\\n\r\nHow did anyone greenlight this script?\\n\r\nThis isn't an even an anime adaptation.\\n\r\nThis is easily worst anime of 2018 MY GOD!!!\\n\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT!!!\\n\\n\r\nNever before I have seen an anime this incompetent and broken in my life.\\n\r\nThe story is a badly paced mess that with filled with asspulls and plot holes that are never explained at all to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all blander than cardboard as they are all empty shells of their manga counterparts. The production values were horrendous that is filled with trash directing, abysmal music including voicing acting was terrible. This is easily hands down the second worst anime I have ever seen period completely de-throwing The Asterisk War and Darling in the Franxx.\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen the anime yet please do yourself a favour and read the manga and pretend show got the Tsukihime anime treatment where it simply doesn't exist at all.\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot I hope you guys are happy now because you took one of the best modern manga series out there and turned it into one into objectively one of worst animes to ever exist.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would give a score out of 10 but this show was fundamentally broken on every level I had to create a new rating just for this pile of waste.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul re: gets the final rating off.\\n\\n\r\nCEASE TO EXIST!!!\\n\\n\r\nA butchered story that was only made worst with horrendous pacing and directing.\\n\r\nVisually looked like their were fished out of a toilet.\\n\r\nCharacters are lobotomised versions of their manga counterparts.",

Yet alas it was here and we didn't get a single recap of what happened or whats going on they expected us to know everything, and it took all my brain power to figure out what was happening and it was really nice in the end.\r\nTHEN we have this season and boy if u thought that seasons story was messed haha you haven't even seen this one. Its story is a completedisaster ud think i am watching another show. I legit thought i had missed some episodes, they don't explain shit! I am so confused here i don't remember any of the characters long enough it is so rushed, they rushed the last season which I kinda enjoyed the whole Sasaki Haisai thing and it reminded of the old TG.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is like absolutely terrible, at this point i am just watching cause of the art and action, the story matters no more its ruined, and I am sad to see such a good anime go to waste :(",

            "content": "\u201cIf Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.\u201d\r\n-ZephSilver, MAL \u201cHall of Famer\u201d, June 2015\r\nBrilliant quote. Now, here\u2019s my not-so-professional version of that famous statement:\r\n\u201cIf Parasyte is a Kobe Beef Steak dinner, then Tokyo Ghoul is a previously frozen, pre-prepared Salisbury Steak meal\u2026.with preservatives to last through seasons.\u201d\r\nAlright, that\u2019s out of the way. Let\u2019s start with the prelude.\r\nFrom even the very first season, I was never really a big fan of the Tokyo Ghoul series in its entirety, and I\u2019m REALLY tired of people telling me that I should be reading the manga version of the story. Regardless of whether or not Iread light novel or manga versions of certain anime, it should not have that big or significant an impact on my impressions, feelings, experience, and/or analysis/critiquing of the anime adaptations themselves, because I honestly feel that the adaptations are their own things\u2026their own piece of work or art (or at least attempts to be so, half-hearted or not). How I feel about a certain adaptation\u2019s loyalty or faithfulness to its source should not be something prioritized when making a serious judgment on it. This is personally how I feel regarding LN/manga adaptations, being an individual who prefers to be an anime-only fan and viewer, and I would only check out some of the source material for purely out of my own separate curiosity.\\n\r\n(This review will mainly encompass TG:Re 2nd Season, but it will also involve aspects from the previous RE season as well as the first two TG seasons. Because of this, the grade given by this review may not necessarily be the same as the one I gave for this season in particular.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\r\nFor starters, like with the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:Re tried to document a compelling psycho/horror story about a young man named Kaneki who treads between living as a human and living as a Ghoul, and the conflict surrounding him and the companions he made.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s backtrack a little bit here: the TG story itself starts off fairly decent, where it portrays the livelihood and strife of Ghouls in human society. Due to their carnivorous nature, being only able to sustain off the very species they most physically resemble, Ghouls are often the targets of countless acts of discrimination, which include, but not are limited to, law enforcement, public fear, and general hostility. Ghouls are still very much like human in terms of emotion, sociality, and just about everywhere else, except biologically; because of this, living peaceful lives is something they value (at least what the show tried to portray in the first season). This kind of setup was what Tokyo Ghoul tried to utilize to distinct itself or put itself a cut or level above the usual urban horror or semi-vampire stories out there.\\n\r\nWhile the initial setup and ideas were very good on paper, the overall execution of the show was an underwhelming mess. For my perspective at least, the entire show just seemed like a redundant showcasing of material that would belong more to shounen (or shounen-esque) show; basically, Tokyo Ghoul is practically a shounen series disguised as a beautiful-looking, one-of-a-kind psycho/horror story. The entire Tokyo Ghoul anime series also suffered from a considerable lack of exposition and details, so it fails hard in trying to make the show\u2019s plot/narrative easier to understand. Another issue the Tokyo Ghoul anime has is its complete, utter lack of a sense of proper pacing. The pacing of the entire story, for the most part, only moves at one speed: FAST. Fast and Furious.\\n\\n\r\nFor the TG:Re series by itself, the story is extremely incongruent with the story from the first two seasons, resulting in a complete lack of cohesiveness and siegeway. I\u2019ll explain why.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what we should know from the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul mixed its levels of extreme violence with fleeting moments of beauty and/or emotion to demonstrate that the Ghouls are genuinely striving for normalcy amidst the atmosphere of brutality, and the struggles they go through in their attempts to achieve that ideal peaceful livelihood. The taste of coffee and the tranquility of a coffeehouse, due to Ghouls being able to at least enjoy coffee like humans do, are the sole two things that Ghouls and humans can share peacefully, so the usage of the coffeehouse in the first and second seasons as a base for the Ghouls to set up a peaceful coexistence makes so much damn sense.\\n\\n\r\nWith the two RE seasons, most of that pretty much went out the window. Tokyo Ghoul:Re basically betrays almost everything positive that the two \u201cOG\u201d seasons tried to use, abandoning the storytelling elements altogether. Tokyo Ghoul:Re, as a story, doesn\u2019t seem to really know what it\u2019s doing or where it\u2019s going, as it bounces between several different points of ongoing conflict as well as foregoing any necessary content that would act as important transitions or siegeways. Thus it does not seem to let us as viewers try to understand or comprehend just exactly what the heck is going on. The way it goes about trying to introduce new characters and plot points makes me feel like (or realize) that the TG:RE story in particular is just\u2026.without a soul. There are no moments where the story tries to make contrasts between brutality and beauty. Nearly all the characters on either side of the conflict no longer seem to fight for something important and precious that they\u2019ve lost\u2026they seem to fight for the sake of triumphing and looking supposedly like the good guys. I\u2019m gonna be real here\u2026.there is no absolutely no sense of good guys or bad guys, and not in a good way. The whole chaotic jumping from battle to battle to battle\u2026prevent us from having emotional impressions for the characters\u2019 reasons to keep fighting and struggling. Additionally, practically all the main characters, who were the focal point in the first two seasons, are pretty much all sidelined, and barely make much of a difference in TG:RE\u2019s story progression. Because this also defeats the narrative and thematic parts of what Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s original concept had, it has to get me and others wondering: \u201cWhat was the point of all that effort in storytelling in the first season? Was that just all for naught?\u201d Instead, we get a whole amount of just over-edgy tones, clich\u00e9 lines, useless plot points, forced drama, etc\u2026..literally everything that ROTS under the sun.\\n\\n\r\nART: 2/10; SOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nContrasting to the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:RE\u2019s animation quality has considerably dropped, especially during this second season. In terms of animation quality, the majority of this season felt more like a slideshow, which resulted in messy, tensionless action and cringeworthy half-hearted attempts to bring emotion. Not much else to say here\u2026it\u2019s just plain awful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtracks, I\u2019ll just go ahead and say this as probably part of the minority. I don\u2019t really like the Tokyo Ghoul soundtracks on a personal level, but I\u2019ll at least say it\u2019s still really nice, and does make an attempt to fit the theme of the show itself; additionally, it at least keeps the Tokyo Ghoul fans interested. As for the voice acting, though, there\u2019s no sense of genuine emotion, and feels forced now, compared to the first two seasons; it\u2019s as if the voice actors themselves were starting to give up on the whole season themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna be someone to excessively chew out Kaneki as a character, aka TG\u2019s version of Shinji Ikari\u2026I\u2019ll let someone else do that. Besides, that by itself is not necessary anymore\u2026why? Because it\u2019s literally EVERYONE at fault. The reason for this is because the utilization, characterization, and development of the entire cast is virtually non-existent. The show basically introduced a bunch of new characters so suddenly and expected us to care about them right then and there, while ignoring all the characters from the previous two seasons that we actually do care about, as well as deconstructing them to certain degrees to further render them irrelevant to the plot. Because of the story\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d pacing and drastic change of themes from the first two seasons, there is no real sense of progression in any of the characters, not a single one. All we really can see in the character department are just mindless husks specifically programmed to emulate fake emotion, resulting in obnoxious, overly dramatic lines that make us cringe more than feel for them. It is also because of this that we tend to easily forget who\u2019s who, even if it\u2019s the main characters\u2026apparently the show neglected to properly address the cast\u2019s collectively similar-looking hair colors and hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\r\nThis could\u2019ve been a 0/10, in all honesty. From the first two seasons, I actually did enjoy seeing the fleeting moments of emotion and beauty, because like I mentioned earlier, they symbolized the Ghouls\u2019 struggles to live normal, peaceful lives. Even though I still though the first season was still barely sub-par, those were good moments that I can appreciate.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re, however, throws the good stuff ALL away. Throughout both RE seasons, the show became one of those kinds where it felt like a chore to watch, just for the sake of seeing how this messy conundrum of a show that tried to take itself seriously, ends. The attempts at dramatic lines and edgy violence during the fights are just laughable.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what\u2019s even worse? The story was so discombobulated that Fumination, in order to address the amount of confusion from the viewers, started a weekly live stream of the series where they explain everything leading up to the TG:Re story and what\u2019s happening in each episode. THAT\u2019S NOT A GOOD SIGN AT ALL.\\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the real reason why it\u2019s 1/10 instead of 0/10: TG:Re Season 2 Episode 7, (or TG:RE Episode 19). Yes, the infamous sex scene. The sequence leading up to that point was especially quite hilarious, I\u2019ll admit, and the comedic gag in the \u201caftermath\u201d of the intercourse was pretty amusing, too. Sadly, though, the sex scene by itself was screwed by the aforementioned bad quality of just showcasing slideshows. If the production crew had any sort of common sense by that point, then they should\u2019ve just at least put actual quality in that scene and make the show a hentai for at least 10 minutes\u2026is that too hard to ask? If the show is already so bad overall, they should at least give us a fleeting moment where we can say \u201ctotally effing worth it\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re\u2019s lack of effective storytelling, overall character development, nonsensical rapid pacing, and degrading animation quality is of diabolical proportions. As an entire story and series, Tokyo Ghoul is probably one of the most overrated series I\u2019ve ever watched in my life, making the likes of Sword Art Online seem all too innocent and actually justified, and that says quite a lot. This second season of TG:Re by itself is one of those shows where I can actually say is \u201cobjectively bad\u201d due to the lack of execution, direction, quality consistency, and overall character management. A better alternative to Tokyo Ghoul has already been mentioned at the start of this review: Parasyte The Maxim. That show has far better storytelling and characterization of the cast, as well as better handling of the themes, metaphors, and moral messages.\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re one of those Tokyo Ghoul fanatics who want to watch the show for the sake of quenching your own Ghoul-like hunger, go right on ahead. I\u2019m not stopping you. It\u2019s your choice to make, not mine. As for the general anime fan, I\u2019d suggest watching just the first two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul, and then just stop and avoid the TG:RE mess entirely, cause it\u2019s really not worth seeing the story deconstructing itself and the theme it wanted to show from the start.\\n\r\nOr better yet\u2026.just read the manga and save your life.\\n",

            "content": "\"SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST SEASON OF TOKYO GHOUL:RE\"\r\nIt's fair to say that the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:re didn't leave a good impression on fans of the series (In fact, I think it made it worse). The problems that Root A had only got worse in Tokyo Ghoul:re with its only saving grace being its soundtrack. And with Root A no longer being canon, it kind of left Anime only's confused as to what the hell was going on (Although the story did not help with that). It would probably take a miracle for the anime franchise to redeem itselfand this second season would have to be the one to do it. I mean it couldn't get any worse, right? Well you would be wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax and grab your torches and pitchforks as I present to you the anime review of the the second season of Tokyo Ghoul:re. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHaise Sasaki is no more. Kaneki has regained his memories and now wants out of the CCG. Exploiting a ghoul raid on the max security complex for ghouls, he, along with his ghoul friends, manages to escape and now plans to end the bloodshed between humans and ghouls. By becoming their leader, he wants peace. Meanwhile, the CCG has tracked down Aogiri's base of operations and raids it, hoping to put an end to them once and for all. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say too much because that would mean I would had to go deep into spoiler territory. Not that it matters at this point. The story kind of goes back to the roots of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul and asks the question \"what is the difference between a human and a ghoul?\" Only this time, it is done much, much worse. To begin with, the story's pacing is awful. For example, Kaneki starts off as Kan-EDGY for a couple of episodes, only to revert back to nice Kaneki who just wants to protect his friends after two episodes. There is no development in the story to progress story threads and character arcs as it is all rushed to get a conclusion. Now, I've never read the manga. The anime is the only time I've experienced as to what Tokyo Ghoul has to offer. But it is clearly obvious where parts of the story have been just gutted out. There is little build up or over arching development here to get us invested into the story or its characters. It rushes from one part of the story to the next in order get to a conclusion. Not allowing the time to develop your plot just leaves people confused. It makes them go, \"what the hell is going on?\" \\n\\n\r\nYou could take the story less seriously, but that is clearly not a good option. This kind of story needs to be paid attention but without the depth of its world and its characters, then you just leaving us to not care about the plot whatsoever. With the messages and themes Tokyo Ghoul tries to leave us, not caring about the plot because there isn't alot there to get us invested just tosses all of them aside and so we are left with a plot that is just going through the motion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the characters. Depth is clearly lacking in these characters to get us invested. Now considering that there are so many characters in Tokyo Ghoul now, I know not everyone is going to get a fair share of development. But when important characters don't get good development, it has a repercussion on the rest of the cast unless they really stand out. In this case, none of them stand out. You would think that Kaneki would stand out and accepting who he is and what he has become, but nope. He's as boring and lifeless as the rest of the cast. The only character that got a sense of real closure to their character arc was Urie as he has slowly been able to stand on his own two feet and forge his own path while acknowledging those around him. Everyone else just get rushed conclusions to their character arcs. \\n\\n\r\nReturning characters also get little development or reasons as to why they have returned. Instead of me going, \"Oh cool, he/she is back.\" I'm just like \"Ummm, who are you again? Oh yeah, now I remember you.\" There is a lack of fanfare to get us hyped about these returning characters to make the overall plot more interesting and make it more dynamic. It can be the same with established characters because some of them I barely know and the show wants me to care for them, But I don't care. I don't care for them because it seems the anime doesn't care about them. So why should I? \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is once again pretty lackluster and feels even worse than before. The fight scenes especially feel lackluster with the cheap ways of animating a fight scene. This includes shaky cameras, cutaways and basically treating it like a slideshow. It really makes the fights have less impact and don't invoke a sense awe or grip that the fight should invoke. Considering the amount of fight scenes in this season, that's a big negative. The art design as well feels uninspired as it just looks so bleak and bland. Tokyo Ghoul hasn't really been known for its animation quality. But here, it just feels even worse than before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this series. It just sounds so beautiful and wondrous. You can listen to the music and just forget all of the bad that has come from this series. It has always been a highlight of the Tokyo Ghoul franchise and here is no exception. It continues the trend of this franchise having great music. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening as well is great. TK returns for this opening called \"Kartharsis.\" Along with the great vocals and instrumentals, the visuals are also nicely symbolic, showing how Kaneki will always keep going, no matter what persona he adopts. While not as beautiful or colourful as Unraval, its probably the second best opening out of the four we've got. It's funny, no matter how crap the series is. The openings are always agreed on to be one of the best. The ending sequence does show us some beautiful art; backed up some nice vocals to calm the viewer and realise the beauty in this world. \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub was always considered, by me, to be one of the more underrated dubs out there. Austin Tindle puts in another good performance as Kaneki as he brings a very humble Kaneki yet he can also bring a good serious tone as well. Other performances like Adam Gibbs as Urie, Brina Palencia as Touka and pretty much the rest of the cast are also well done. They managed to make the material they were given work which is honestly surprising.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nThis mess of an adaptation of one of the most popular manga of all time has been a travesty. At this point, I wonder who Tokyo Ghoul's anime adaptation is for. It ain't for the anime only's because with them probably being lost in what is going on and Root A not being canon doesn't help. It ain't for those who read the manga because they just watched this show be mangled into a shell of what it is supposed to be. Even die hard fans must be dissapointed in this. Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is probably the worst in the franchise and since this anime franchise has been going down hill since the first Tokyo Ghoul season, that's saying something. I can't care for the story or its characters because there isn't enough there to make me care. Its animation is lackluster than ever and the soundtrack can only go so far to make it slightly better. I heard this season was adapting at least 120 chapters. 120 CHAPTERS! You can't adapt that much without the story suffering as a result and it shows here. \\n\\n\r\nI hope someone, someday reboots this franchise and is able to recapture the magic that made the first season of Tokyo Ghoul so enjoyable. Give it the treatment it deserves. But for now, we look back at what is probably one of the most overrated anime franchises of all time and makes us wonder if it could have been so much more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 3.4/10 Recommendation: Don't f***ing bother\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul does not deserve all the hate it gets. Is it perfect? No. But is it as bad as everyone wants to make it out to be? No. It\u2019s understandable that fans of the manga would be upset over what even I will admit is a flawed adaption. But does that make the show bad? While yes being confused over who some of the characters are was annoying, I still loved watching this show and seeing characters I've come to enjoy grow up. Before I go into the review I want to clarify that this review will be a overall of all four seasonsbut I will focus mainly on the two Re seasons. I will also state that I have only read the first manga and not yet Re. Overall Tokyo Ghoul does a solid job of giving its viewers a 6-8 out of 10 anime that takes its own way of telling the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10): Not much to say on this one. The animation is beautiful. Characters are colorful and lifelike. The kagune and everything else ghoul related always looks intense with a touch of horror. Backgrounds look lifelike and when there's a scene in Kaneki\u2019s head it always gives that feeling of being inside a consciousness. Animation should not be a deter for this show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice Acting (8/10): While not part of their planning I do detract for the english cast, the gap between the two casts is just to wide but I only take away half a point for it. It loses its other points for background music, for a intense and deep show the music just never seems to want to add to what's going on. However the brilliant openings and endings as well as A+ voice acting gives the show a high score. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): While a mixed bag the characters from Ghoul are some of the most widely known and influential. Hell I still do the Kaneki finger crack two years later. Others like Touka, Juzou, Hinami and the the quinque group, allow for a variety of personalities and character development. While not always flushed out the development is there and shows that these characters are more then just what they were made out to be. The characters of Ghoul make the show, as much as everything else helps the variety of people to be attached to allows the show to touch who it does. However we must all bow to down to the ultimate puffball Saiko.\\n\\n\r\nPlot (5.5/10): Yeah here\u2019s where I gotta be critical. The story is a mess, the first two seasons did a decent job of telling a storyline but all that went down the drain in Re. I don't know if it was just the amount of anime I watch in a week, which is a lot, but I felt like I could never remember what happened in the last episode. Obviously their were a ton of characters that we knew nothing about and just had to accept were there. I mean the whole \u201ctwist\u201d in the last season with the Washuu clan made me pause and think if any of these people were mentioned before. So yes the story is a complete mess, I understand it's hard to put everything from a manga into a anime but if that's the case the studio should have requested longer seasons or just made it fully original. Either would of been better then what was produced. However at the end of the day the story stumbles together into something that is still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Taking away the many things wrong with Re and Ghoul as a whole, I enjoy watching the show. It gave me a story about a boy who just wanted to protect the things that made him happy. It has made me friends and given me laughs and the euphoria moments of nostalgia. If someone didn\u2019t enjoy this show and kept watching it, it was only so they could complain about it more. But to me and I'm sure many others out there, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that provided the entertainment that it was made to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7-8/10): I can't really pick a grade for this. I would say for Re season 2, it gets a 7 but Tokyo Ghoul as a whole gets a 8. A series should not be punished because the studio making it twisted the plot. While the mistakes of this show do detract a lot, the positives that people don't look at still make it a very enjoyable show. A lot of the hate that Ghoul gets is because of fans who are upset, and while I can understand that, a show does not deserved to be tanked just because you don't like how it was made. The Tokyo Ghoul anime will go down as one of the most controversial but life changing shows, with a helping of impactful and memorable characters, especially Saiko. \\n",

So keep in mind that I fully understand you, even tho I've read the Tokyo Ghoul manga.\r\nSo, I had a friend that started reading the manga way back then and he always told me that the manga was better than the anime and that I should read it. I kept hearing this from not only him but from the whole anime community. So when the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:Re came out Ifelt forced to read the manga cause I lost so many important things that have only been explained in the manga... I was lost, I didn't know what was going on, they were rushing the anime so hard... and now they're doing even worse since they re cramming 120 chapters of the manga in 12 episodes, and let me tell you, that is a fckin JOKE! It is simply not possible but whatever. With that being said I decided to give a chance to the manga. Let me tell you that it was the best thing I could've done to fully enjoy what is Tokyo Ghoul, the character development feels so good, the mental progression of Kaneki feels even better and we can actually understand what Kaneki is feeling. It's simply wonderful how reading the manga made me an even bigger fan of Tokyo Ghoul (and keep in mind that it was one of my favorite animes by the time). If someone comes to me and asks \"Do you recommend watching Tokyo Ghoul?\" I'll just say NO, I do not. I'll not tell them to read the manga cause since they don't read manga or are not already engaged in the series it is ok for them to not read the manga, but if you love Tokyo Ghoul, PLEASE, go read the manga! I swear you will not regret it!\\n\\n\r\nI just felt like saying this since Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is being a complete joke to the series, please kids go read the manga if you love TG, if not just drop this shit. It is not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nSorry bad englando.\\n\\n\r\n Have a nice day! :)))",

But, we have to judge on what we have. Not what's missing from the series that Everyone doesn't know.\r\nNow I understand and sympathize with long time TG manga fansand I Know why TG gets all this hate but I do not think it deserves this much hate and low low scores as the adaption stands right now with only 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the animation was sometimes bad or nonexistent\\n\r\nYes, every single fight could've been better, and longer.\\n\r\nYes, I was confused on the story and shouldn't have to read the manga to understand what's going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I thoroughly enjoyed this series because I went alittle out of my way too.\\n\r\nThere were so many good moments in this season I just feel the good outweighs the bad here,  and the most important parts of the story that were not skipped were very very good and well done.\\n\\n\r\nI Can't give this series a mediocre score, because I have discovered it through the anime and I genuinely enjoyed the whole ride. I DO hope for a reboot obviously as well but TG anime was 1000x better than having nothing. Thats for sure\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 and that's all the matters imo\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\r\nThe expectations for Tokyo ghoul is very high, I think the Studio did a Very good job GIVING them the benefit of the doubt and circumstances. \\n\r\nIt IS worth the watch despite what everyone says, BUT with Some context and love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul: re is the biggest mystery anime of all time without even trying. It never shows all of its cards, it doesn\u2019t clue you in on the show\u2019s meaning, it shows what it wants to show and dips. Personally, I\u2019m more inclined to like this sort of story writing, books/anime like Overlord did it best in my opinion but the problem with this is that it wasn\u2019t intentional. Clearly, there was some sort of disconnect on what the manga was portraying and what the anime was able to deliver and something went wrong, I have several theories on why that happened but that\u2019s notimportant, what\u2019s important is whether or not I\u2019d recommend it (I won\u2019t).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul started off really strong in the series and I fought tooth and nail to defend it even though all its confusing storylines, but I\u2019d only recommend it if you\u2019re willing to solve any questions by yourself (by using the wiki) because the anime isn\u2019t going to answer any of them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves, the Tokyo Ghoul:re manga really wasn\u2019t that good in the first place, so when Studio Pierrot was told to make an anime adaptation of this they were fighting an uphill battle. Not only that but they were only allowed to use 12 episodes per season so they had to cram. This, of course, led to some scenes getting cut in a manga where it already felt like scenes were cut from the final draft making the whole thing a lot worse. The actual plot wasn\u2019t really that bad but they tried to paint both sides of a story by making EVERY OTHER CHARACTER an insufferable asshole the whole time to paint both sides as awful as humanly possible and it made it almost impossible to root for anyone. That being said there were a few moments the anime managed to keep which were really nice (not enough, but there were still there).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSay what you will about the story but HOT DAMN were (some of) those kagunes BADASS. I feel like all of the art budget went to the fight scenes which really doesn\u2019t matter since 90% of the show was pure fight scenes. This does, however, mean that anything else no matter how serious or impactful to the story, never looked as good as it really intended to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nI can\u2019t lie, I loved the opening AND closing, its one of those shows where you watch youtube videos of both the Opening and the Ending. Voice actors were more or less on top of it, they all fit their roles to a T, funnily enough, though, all of the best voice actors spoke the least. Finally, the sounds of kagunes activating sounded badass, but without a good reference, I can\u2019t say for sure whether its top of the line or bottom-tier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nMy favorite part of any show would be its character development, unfortunately, the only person to ever receive any sort of character development would be Kaneki. This could\u2019ve been negated with a cast of reasonably written characters but as I said earlier: every other character were written to is insufferable as possible so that\u2019s COMPLETELY out of the window. I honestly would\u2019ve cared at all if Kaneki acted like\u2026 well\u2026 Kaneki in more than three scenes I would\u2019ve given this a higher score. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nGotta give points where its due, while I was confused the entire time the action scenes were pretty top notch in terms of enjoyment so I\u2019d give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis show is 100% flash no filler, it's like the recently completed: Baki (2018) without even trying which is actually not a good thing at all. I would\u2019ve recommended it unless:\\n\r\nYou\u2019re not looking for a story\\n\r\nYou have the time to search through the wiki/manga to answer all your questions. \\n",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of Tokyo Ghoul. It's easily #1 on top of my favorite series, ranking above even some live action I enjoyed. That's the reason I keep watching this, and the reason I can't enjoy it. I mean, really... It feels like Studio Parrot are deliberately screwing up with manga adaptations, and this one they screwed big time; the art has gone from... ok in season 1 to what it feels like comics literally got animated this season, the soundtrack is... (as much as I appreciate the anime returned to having a song from TK of Ling Tosite Sigure as opening, sinceLTS' emo music is perfect for openings of psychological or drama series) mediocre, in lack of better terms, and the rushed pacing of a sore attempt to adapt +120 manga chapters in 12 episodes either sometimes makes the characters' decisions make no sense in the context (what context lol) or takes a lot of character development some had in the manga by toying around with the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that yet this isn't by any means the worst season says a lot about this supposed anime adaptation. Let's not forget how Root A provided us with a cheap opening that made the last two episodes of Evangelion look decent in comparision (and the song they picked, man we're talking bout an earrape) and with a non-canon, deeply flawed plot that, by some herculean leap in logic, had Kaneki re-written as an edgy character with a Stockholm Syndrome joining the organization that kidnapped and tortured him [there were subtle hints of the storyline of Kaneki's gang being skipped or rewritten prior to Root A, as the season 1 finale showed Banjou and his allies freed by Tsukiyama instead of Kaneki, ffs], and totally skipped his quest for revenge in the manga. But let's keep it to this season only...\\n\\n\r\nAmong the things this season skipped so far: cutting off some important parts of the Rushima Landing arc (including Eto's arrest by the CCG which happened somewhere in between the Tsukiyama Extermination and Rushima Landing, Mutsuki's capture by Torso, OF ALL THINGS, since it's pretty much the catalyst of his future mental instability and establishment as an antagonist), Arima's full explanation on what the Sunlit Garden is, Irimi and Koma's survival, the CCG Lab Raid... and I could do this all day. The point is, so much of the original pacing was skipped that the storyline as shown in this season doesn't connect, all thanks to Studio Parrot's decision to cut everything that could've made it connect in the first place, and so if you might want to pick up the manga to understand whatever the fuck is happening here.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I can only hope the future will someday bring a reboot animated and screen written by a more serious studio, and honestly keep watching this only to satisfy my own curiosity as to how much can this series get screwed.",

It was a story full of subtle details, philosophy and psychology.\r\n I remember reading through the same chapter a couple of times and each time discovering something new: things thatpreviously appeared to be negligible attained meaning and revealed another side of the story to ponder about. After reading a recent chapter I would go to Youtube and watch people analyse it, pointing out details that were really mind-blowing.\\n\\n\r\n And now to the tragic part: NONE of that is present in the anime. All the details and peculiarities from the manga were discarded in favor of flavorless combat and showing off. The story itself is terribly rushed. If you haven't read the manga you probably won't recognize half of the characters that appear on screen. Almost all character-bonding and character-building scenes and dialogues were cut which in turn made moments that were supposed to be powerful drab and tasteless.\\n\\n\r\n If you neglect character development then you'll have to pay the price of everything losing value: basically after you're halfway into the anime you stop caring about the plot and everything that's happening on screen and that's the genuine tragedy that befell this anime.\\n\\n\r\n I wouldn't recommend watching this to anyone, there's nothing you'll find here, except for probably decent music, which still doesn't redeem this anime.

You won't understand what is going on if you don't already know the plot beforehand. The anime cuts out all the exposition and context clues that are crucial to understanding the story, and leaves a jumbled mess of confusing events. All the scenes that should have emotional weight don't because there is no build-up to it. Tense high-stake situations become comical instead because of the horrible animation and lightning speed adaptation of a plot that jumps the shark.\r\n\"Please someone tellme what is going on.\" - Kuki Urie, in a scene that seems to break the 4th wall.\\n\\n\r\nThis show should be considered fan service for manga readers who want to see their favorite chapters animated and colorized. When looked at it that way, it isn't too terrible. The character designs stay surprisingly consistent throughout the whole series with no horrific deformations. Studio Pierrot took some creative liberties and animated an exciting Arata armor fight scene. The kagune stay true to their manga designs, and were sometimes even impressive - Tatara and Saiko's come to mind. It was exciting to see Kaneki's final form in action.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? If you haven't read the manga, it's a hard no.

From the very start that it was announced, we all knew that this was going to be a failure.\r\nWhy? Well, here's a brief rundown. The previous adaptation--Tokyo Ghoul:Re-- was an adaptation that had its goods and bads and was an average show in my opinion. It was 58 chapters of the manga compacted into a twelve episode series, and I thought it was all right. I'll tell you something: the manga has had 58 chapters of it adapted, and it has 179 chapters in total. What do you think happened with the other 121 chapters?Well, you guessed it! They threw it all into a grinder and got out a huge piece of crap. It could've been at least two more seasons or something else, but Studio Pierrot went and shamed Ishida's work to the point where we actually dislike this. Where's Tokyo Ghoul Brotherhood?\\n\\n\r\nI have very bad feelings for this anime adaptation. It went from being bad to very bad to average to just a point of horrible that I want to vomit on the ground on this.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain it: the story was rushed in a manner that made even the viewers confused at what was happening. We started this anime with just the brief moment of a war on the island with no context taken to it besides they're on a mission to exterminate them. How did they figure out? What measures were taken? We don't know because this was rushed. We didn't even get to see Kaneki and Touka being a husband and wife for more than just one episode after their marriage, and Kaneki's already getting torn apart back and through. The story also gave out an atmosphere where we couldn't even feel any emotion from it. There was no sadness or anything during the scene with Rize and Kaneki. Some of the scenes looked like a slideshow of panels that felt a bit stale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - it's horrible. The only good things I saw were probably Kaneki losing his virginity on No Nut November, and Ichika Kaneki. I couldn't get the best out of my most enjoyed characters like Furuta, and it feels like we only saw 1/3 of the whole entire manga that was just animated. We didn't get any proper characterization that took place slowly, it was just a rapid change, which sounds a bit weird.",

            "content": "The anime version of Twilight\r\nThe world\u2019s largest emo fest\r\nThe series that shows us steak but gives us cat faeces\r\nThis uh\u2026 adaption? For the train wreck manga has come to a calamitous halt. Sui Ishida, real name Stephenie Meyer, has had her second coming climaxing in this blimp explosion of an anime, you mustn\u2019t look at the carnage but how can you not!\r\nBella and Edward\u2019s anime counterparts are finally given end to the ridiculous scenarios they find themselves in. Them, all of Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s characters are expertly crafted to be as boring and shallow as possible, and a most distinguishing trait is that it ignores thegood characters to focus on the bad. First series had Rize, Amon, Hide and Itori but the series was like na here\u2019s Touka, caf\u00e9 person number 1, every character focused thereon after. Then Tokyo Ghoul Re-set forgot about them and introduced even worse characters, somehow.\\n\r\nWhy have good characters when you can have Naki, background prop, ink blotch number 2 and the anime gleefully follows suit. Oh, and refrain from blaming the anime for shortfalls in the source material, we won\u2019t hear about fan favourite Eto (that mummy thing) or even Kaneki\u2019s daughter (she\u2019s called Renesmee, same as in Tokyo Ghouls inspiration, Twilight) but thank goodness were hear what happens to the non characters, whatever their names even were, and what happens to third police officer from right and so forth. We have a glimpse of Rize, but literally a glimpse on the poster, again the whole show steak cat muck thing.\\n\r\nStephenie Meyer was once again wielding the fire reducing her female characters to Toukas and Bellas. Touka was a capable fighter, had dreams but Stephenie decided na, you\u2019re reduced to damsel (well, gloomy, boring, physically and emotionally abusive quite frankly awful person) in distress. And who needs life goals and aspirations when Touka has fulfilled a woman\u2019s role in Stephenie Meyers world, namely to marry Kaneki and bear his children. Same with whatever the woman police officer was called, capable investigator but she was placed on the side lines and existed solely to be together with Amon. Thank heavens that what came across as largely accomplished woman learn their place in this skid mark series, huh. Virtually all the interactions, especially the relationships are deliciously hammy, mind. Kaneki and BellaTouka, Amon and doesn\u2019t warrant a second glance, they don\u2019t even like one another. I mean they\u2019ve been apart for years, they react to each other as if they came across a hobo pleasuring himself in the street. Wholly unconvincing bonds between the lot of them, you could tell Stephenie wrote this tripe, disguising her name was doomed from the start. Everything in this series is such a cheap imitation of actual human interactions.\\n\\n\r\nStory: chunder/10 Stephenie Meyer must have huffed an especially large amount of industrial strength glue when she forgot about her previous work to make her power rangers big super happy fun fun action sequel. Like Twilight she had vampires and werewolves but was like \u201cgotcha! Watch me make this dive!\u201d Same with when she wrote Tokyo ghoul, she was like \u201cyou\u2019ve seen what I done with vampires and werewolves, now gulp up my take on ghouls and investigators, run for your lives children!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe real read between the lines story of Tokyo Ghoul, namely those awful gays are an overarching evil that need to be finished and the dinosaurs as well, comes to an end. Furuta the \u2018fabulous\u2019 villain was making the most of his limited time on account of being a ghoul/having the \u2018gay disease\u2019 AIDs and naturally vanquished by holy mystical Kaneki with cross like kagunes. Editors were likely responsible for having crass gay stereotypes Nico and Tsukiyama survive, but of course they don\u2019t end up with anyone (all the straight people are paired off to live happily ever after, of course). Oh, and these 'dear friends' of Kaneki just want to be around him to cannibalise him, because that's what they do, dur. Mercifully Naki has multiple babies with a lady thank gracious he got out the \u2018gay lifestyle\u2019. Nothing does hate these people, sly low cunning propaganda like Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: ?/10 this is somewhat tricky, a mark can\u2019t actually be given for animation because there is none. Well unless PowerPoint slides made on Microsoft paint count? It\u2019s a tough one, really not sure. In any case, I\u2019m not saying this to be dramatic but with some manga and anime sketches I can\u2019t actually tell which ink spill is supposed to be which. I mean looking at the anime gets you pondering whether is that supposed to be one of the characters or the pavement? Your guess is as good as mine, it's the deep questions like that which keeps people awake at night.\\n\r\nThe only thing that can be stated with absolute certainty is that dear sweet Stephenie Meyer illustrated her manga by hoisting up her crotchless knickers and rubbing her matted grizzly bear faecal smeared bum beard all over the pages. She then flung the dripping rags at the animation studio and commanded them to make it even worse, and they did exactly that with this anime adaption. \\n\\n\r\nIt is really quite awful; I don\u2019t know why they did this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Uh, well this is awkward/10 what can be seen is incredible, it\u2019s astonishing beholding this expertly crafted pile drive. Tokyo Ghoul is the anime equivalent of people creating a snot wall, or those who stockpile their own used tampons because I don\u2019t want to know why. Can us mere mortals ever truly understand why people would hoard crusty socks used for masturbation, keep their grandmothers soiled pantaloons on hand at all times, or have Tokyo Ghoul related content amongst their possessions? It\u2019s horrifying, but okay so long as you don\u2019t physically come into contact with it, at least that\u2019s what it all wants you to think!\\n\\n\r\nBerserk has a reputation as a great manga that unfortunately had a bad anime adaption. Tokyo ghoul is to Berserk what Twilight is to Harry Potter, it\u2019s on the opposite end of the spectrum. Whilst Berserk and Harry Potter are outstanding, their polar opposites are anything but. Both Twilight and Tokyo Ghoul were shockingly bad series to begin with and then given a worse anime adaption in Tokyo Ghouls case. It\u2019s very impressive really, with Tokyo Ghoul from manga to anime they\u2019ve managed to make the worst possible stench imaginable even more noxious, well done I guess?\\n\\n\r\nThe moot point, and what people are failing to understand is that this was all done on purpose. Tokyo Ghoul had potentially interesting characters, focused on the bad ones. They could have had great storylines but chose the boring avenues, it could have been good but it was deliberately made bad. And that\u2019s before we even get to this screamer of an anime. At this point it's not really a laughing matter at all. Tokyo Ghoul was spot on the money about being a tragedy, but this final anime redefines the word. I just don't understand why the animation studio took this route. They have a captive audience of Twilight/Tokyo Ghoul fans. It is then decided that violently hacking off a good ninety percent of a disconsolate \u201cI can\u2019t find my greasy emo black fringe extensions, Tokyo Ghoul knows how I feel\u201d manga to make this travesty anime would be a sensible idea.  \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul\u2019s legacy as some chemical weapons grade filth series in the same vein as Twilight... no, below that is resolutely secure. This anime in particular will reap the negative reception it\u2019s earned with flying colours/shades of black\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nBut then again that is what it was after. Tokyo Ghoul succeeds in what it set out to do: be the ultimate plane catastrophe series to see who prods it with a stick. \\n\\n\r\nStephenie Meyer created Tokyo Ghoul for the sole purpose of pointing and proclaiming: \u201cBehold! Now people can no longer slate my magnum opus Twilight as the worst thing ever in every sense of the word, because Tokyo Ghoul has taken it\u2019s place, and so Twilight is now good in comparison\u201d \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why Tokyo Ghoul was made.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:read the manga....haven't heard that one before *ahem* sarcasm people *ahem*.\r\nOk, so a bit of detail on LA's experience towards the Tokyo Ghoul series as a whole, the original season was a nice entry point into the franchise and what Kaneki Ken went through and his struggles of being a human eating ghoul, then Root A happened and the mere fact that it's non-canon due to :re is saying something and all the better for LA to NOT remember that botched sequel. Now onto the actual :re part and well, besides the new characters and new settings, LA gave :re a chance, got usedthe new characters and Tokyo Ghoul for once gave character development to the new cast as a result, left LA completely in the dark as to HOW Kanek- Hais- Ken? is but LA was the rare few people who saw something in :re, ohhh the first season had some major pacing problems and killing it's new cast \"just because\" but still and now we come to...it's second season and what is the final conclusion of the vastly popular Tokyo Ghoul series and........-sigh-.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season didn't really learn from :re first season's failings and only carried the formula it had for itself only to hurt and confuse the audience for those who haven't read the manga as to why some characters were so important and the like. This second season continues it's trend of having a HUGE incident occurring and multiple fights and characters developed only some of them having the axe and them having little push towards the plot and gave Kaneki and his allies some measure of HEAVY plot armour as a result. Oh the major events that occur utterly changed things from this second season to a greater degree than it's first season and as a result made Kaneki Haise switch hands MULTIPLE times, but overall the erratic pacing was what crippled the entire experience for LA, characters just dies with their little backstory and that's it, not to mention trying keep track of multiple fights happening at the same time made LA care LESS for the majority of the cast that weren't affiliated with Kaneki either, it was padding for LA. \\n\\n\r\nDue to this second season being the conclusion to the story itself, there is this large scale incident involving Kaneki and Rize and Kaneki having an existential self reflection on his life and him wanting to protect everyone, his philosophy he had in the original first season and this kind of touches were great to be honest, but was bogged down by the shoddy adaptation and how the anime just wanted to rush and get to the good parts didn't help things either.  With speaking of things LA did like from :re's second season, LA did like Saiko Yonebayashi voiced by Ayane Sakura even from her first appearance due to her being the glue holding the :re cast together and she got some decent screentime and more or less LA's investment in her wasn't in vain either. Finally, once Kaneki and Touka reunited, LA actually liked their time together and the subsequent stuff that happened to them, it made Kaneki's want to protect and his ideology be that more solid as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Studio Pierrot was \"decent\" at the very least, it had the typical Tokyo Ghoul aesthetics to them though LA will say some of the fights did feel like Bleach just with monster abilities instead of swords but that was just LA...ohh yeah Pierrot did Bleach too...huh. Nonetheless the animation wasn't that bad to be honest, LA saw it as Pierrot last hoorah in ending the series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was decent to, with Natsuki Hanae as Kaneki, Sora Amamiya as Touka, Ayane Sakura as Saiko and Maaya Sakamoto as Eto on the top of LA's head. Look, Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season has a HUGE roster so LA won't go through them all, but if LA had to pick an MVP in all this....Natsuki Hanae, he kinda just had to be for LA, mainly and obviously due him voicing the central focus of it all, Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tokyo Ghoul series for LA felt like the opposite to what LA feels about the Sword Art Online franchise in some sense, they both have their ups and downs but Tokyo Ghoul's adaptations just made bad decisions and didn't learn from it with LA squarely blaming Studio Pierrot and the director Odahiro Watanabe with it's erratic pacing and outright confusing, hard to keep plotlines, where Sword Art Online from their failures LEARNED from it. LA really didn't wanted to compare to very popular animes in two very different genres but it's just what LA sees.\\n\\n\r\nNow is it horrible?...actually yes, LA can't ignore it or sugar coat it any other way, erratic pacing, nothing characters, rushed plotlines, characters with way too much plot armour while characters get hit with plot poison wanting us to care for them...but their dead, so why bother?. Tokyo Ghoul:re's second season has it's small gem of moments but they are just that, moments and because of that the flaws seriously outweighs the strengths Tokyo Ghoul accumulated and maybe LA was struck with Stockholm syndrome but LA kinda wanted Tokyo Ghoul to succeed, but this was NOT how it should hade been executed and LA can't give the anime a free pass because of a few characters and moments.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:read the manga... just read the manga....\\n\\n\r\nAnd the clown laughs again.",

            "content": "Normally when I'm a fan of a series and a poorly made sequel is made I get upset because of what was squandered but, this season doesn't do that for me. Every episode you watch just makes you feel empty or absent minded.\r\nThe worst part of the show is for sure the pacing, so many characters are doing so many things it is hard to tell what is really going on furthermore, this makes everything that characters do, dull and uninteresting. I've not read much of the manga but, from what I have it was pretty well paced. I had hopes that Tokyo Ghoul: Rewould fix its pacing issues from the last season but, it got 5 times worse. In one scene Kaneki and Touka were just sitting in the coffee shop and Touka abruptly asks him if he's a virgin then, they have sex and that's basically how it goes down I'm not over exaggerating. This wasn't set up really at all prior it just kind of happens so, you kind of just watch the show and say, okay. You don't get mad because of any missed opportunities but, just shrug everything off.\\n\r\nSince this is a somewhat pure adaptation of the manga. The manga does go into much more detail of what is happening in the story making it all the better for it. However if you have read nothing of the manga and only watched the anime events happen and you have no idea how things got there. For example what happened to Hide, apparently Kaneki did something to him that made him into this darth malak type thing from SW:KOTOR basically, part of his throat is gone and you have no idea how that happened if you haven't read the manga. Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA not being apart of the story then not showing what had happened in place of that really hinders the story. You shouldn't have to read the manga in order to have a basic understanding what is going on in the current story for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really like to give ratings this low because I feel like why would I watch 10 episodes of a show that I felt deserved a 3 but, nothing I've ever watched has made me care about the show this little. If characters get close to death or if the show tries to ask thought provoking questions I don't care at all. I'm a fan of Tokyo Ghoul but, here I don't care about what happens to any of the characters or to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the pacing is bad which infects all aspects of the story and the characters, it is impossible to tell what is going on, any actions taken by the characters leaves zero emotional impact on you, voice acting is flat, animation is very lazily made and fight scenes are dull. I give this show a read the manga instead/10",

Having the story revolved around Kaneki, you would understand he is the mediator between the character organizations. It should be understandable that overall, the plot, i would say, was very thrilling and on behalf of all romanticists, I got what i wanted and nothing more. \r\nThe art style changed and the story didn't accurately follow with the manga, but either way, the story line in the manga and the story line in the anime were both thebest it could be (though i prefer the anime because of certain parts in the manga).

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:Re, despite it's terrible pacing, story telling and character development, is still able to at least tell somewhat of a coherent story. \r\nThe director's goal was to adapt only the best parts of the story and get straight into the action. However, this created many gaps in the story. The character's backstories were either turned into a slideshow/montage or basically removed entirely. On top of that, many characters' personalities were also affected which all led to deaths where in which no one was invested in the character yet. That right there is just one of the reasons why this adaptation turned out as badas it did.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nEven though I said above that it told a coherent story, that does not mean that the story was good. As someone who has read the manga, there are many things that were left out of the anime that helped build characters up from the ground and made them more human. Normally, some of these things are cut out anyway from most anime adaptations; however, the sheer volume of these segments being cut out began to build up subsequently creating these gigantic holes in the plot. The story chugs through extremely quickly. You see fight scenes that have emotional/epic music playing that only last like 3 minutes? Yeah that happened in TG:Re...\\n\\n\r\nUse this as an example: Around 130 chapters were covered in 19 episodes of anime. That's around 7 chapters per episode! Most anime cover 2 or 3 if their pacing is good. This can however be attributed to Studio Clown's lack of funds or time maybe; though it doesn't excuse the shoddy storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nEvents were also switched around or removed from the manga which led to very puzzling results. Where is my E L E C T R O C U T I O N ?   ; )\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nWhilst Tokyo Ghoul:Re's frames looked somewhat decent. There were many inconsistencies in the art and it was more so the animation than anything. Whilst I wouldn't go as far as to say the fights were unwatchable, there were times where I felt the animation was terrible. There were many still frames which were basically used to pad up run time. Whilst there was never a moment where in which nothing happened (since they removed all that stuff), this meant that animators had to constantly adapt fight scenes with lots of action. This started to become more noticeable towards the end of the series when their animation got progressively worse. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 \\n\r\nThe music was pretty good actually. I would have rated it higher if it weren't for the way they transitioned from song to song. Not only that, I believe that aside from Katharsis, the opening, no new soundtrack was created for this season of Tokyo Ghoul. However, I may be mistaken as I think I heard a song I'd never heard before in the final moments of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the song transition was terrible. This is to be expected since the director is transitioning scenes too fast. It goes from Calm > Buildup > Fight Scene > Sad Song > Flashback > Rinse & Repeat extremely quickly. You'd have to watch the show to understand. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nWhilst I do think the characters are interesting in the manga, I have to go off my opinion of how these characters were portrayed in the anime. Many characters had their backstories slashed and basically removed. \\n\\n\r\nThere were scenes in the manga that didn't happen in the anime. An example would be the thing with Mutsuki and Torso (if you've seen it you know what I mean). During this segment, a certain event was left out which basically shows Mutsuki's transformation in personality and shows her obsession with.... *insert spoiler here* \\n\\n\r\nIt is events like these that are removed from the story that basically create a shallow character. Due to the pacing of the story, many characters' thoughts and personalities are basically removed from the anime thus, causing unrelatable characters etc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 \\n\r\nBare with me here. I came into this anime knowing it was going to be terrible. That made it pretty much all the more better as I was able to enjoy the anime more fully thinking about different things. Mainly the fact that I was surprised at how well they adapted the anime considering the pace they were going at. When you ignore many of the problems with this anime, you can watch it just for the sake of seeing the action. If you're one of those action brutes who only look at fighting, you might end up enjoying it. If you ignore the flaws you'll enjoy this too. However, I don't blame you if you don't like this anime as it's pretty terrible in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, this anime, despite it's flaws, still gets a 6/10 from me. It's pretty average and comparing it to some other stuff from this season. \"COUGH\" Imouto anime. I still think this anime is at least pretty average. Although if you were to compare it to some other anime of this season, you'll find that it gets completely destroyed by it's competition. Which may have affected people's opinions since they'd be comparing it to other things they'd seen. Same with me though. Compared to all the things I've seen, this anime is pretty average. It isn't good, it isn't bad but compared to most of the stuff I've seen recently, it falls pretty low on the list. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like Tokyo Ghoul and are debating on whether you want to watch the anime or not. If you are an anime-only person. If you don't want to waste your time. DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME! Oh and you've probably heard about the Funimation stream to explain the anime's plot to you lmao rip\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Rushed story, garbage pacing, super rushed, meh art, lots of inconsistent frames, good music, badly implemented, shallow characters with no development, lots of events left out of the anime, confusing plot (director's fault), it's average at best so keep that in mind. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nYou won't really be getting any thrills out of this anime adaptation. So try to keep an open mind when watching this train wreck of an anime. Also, Touka x Kaneki was steamy ;)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After four seasons the Tokyo Ghoul franchise has come to an end with Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2. It did not end on a good note though, as this is arguably the worst season of the franchise.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nAlthough there seems to be some kind of story in this anime, many parts are cut out, leaving the viewer very confused as to what is happening during the anime. It feels as if you need to read the manga to understand some of the things going on during this season. One of the first problems is that there seems to be a pretty large gap between the firstseason of Tokyo Ghoul:re and this second season, leaving out seemingly important information and character development. This probably shouldn't have been rushed and it therefore would have probably been better if they made this season at least 24 episodes. The second point is, as mentioned earlier, that many parts during the anime are cut out, making it seem like you have a scene, skip many scenes and have another scene. This is not how you would write a good anime. The third problem is that Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA has not happened in the universe of this season and that the anime therefore refers to things which have only happened in the manga, leaving anime only viewers (like me) pretty confused. This is not how you make a good anime adaptation from a manga. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art of this season were very average compared to previous seasons and many other anime. In some scenes almost no frames are used, just sliding over some still scenes and in other scenes the characters do not really look like how they are supposed to look. It would probably have been better for Studio Pierrot to have taken more time to produce this anime, as seen with the other aspects of this season, the quality seems to be very low. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound of this anime is probably its best point. Many of the better music themes from previous seasons have been used, although I do not recall any new music themes. The opening theme song also is pretty good. The voice acting seemed to be decent as it did not really stand out to me, as well as \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nAlthough there certainly seems to be something going for the characters in this anime, the anime seems to skip over many important points regarding them, just like what has happened with the story. For example, Kaneki seems way different at the beginning of this season than at the end of the previous season, so you wonder what happened to him, although it never really gets explained in this season. Other important character moments seem to be skipped over as well. This problem also causes a loss of much character development, as characters seem to get character development off-screen, or it is so briefly explained in the anime that it seems illogical. There also seems to be a lack of motivation the characters have as they seem to be fighting for something which is only explained briefly, not at all, or only explained a bit after the fight. The last problem I have with the character section of this anime is that development in character relationships is mostly skipped, like the relationship Kaneki has with characters like Touka.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nThis anime really was not enjoyable for me, as I constantly looked forward to the episode ending. Only the opening theme and very few other points in the anime were pretty enjoyable to me. You might enjoy this anime more if you are a Tokyo Ghoul fan, because you can see many of your favourite characters, but for me it was not enjoyable at all. Even the fight scenes, which were some of the most enjoyable points of the previous seasons of Tokyo Ghoul, were very boring to me in this season, as the animation was not very good, the fight choreography seemed to be decent at best and the motivation behind the fights was not very well executed either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 (3,4/10)\\n\r\nOverall, this season of Tokyo Ghoul was very bad, it skipped over much important information regarding the story and the characters, as well as the animation and fight scenes being average at best. I have heard some people say that there is need for a reboot of the Tokyo Ghoul franchise. As I have not read the manga, I do not know how much better the anime could be, but this season definitely makes it seem like a reboot of the anime would do the manga a lot more justice, with the amount of story and character development skipped in this season.\\n",

As a result, character development as well the main story suffer greatly. Plot holes are left unexplained, characters feel as if they are there only because they really have to.\r\nOnly to add to how bad the adaptation is, the animation is very poor. The anime mainly consists of scrolling scenes with little to no movement by thecharacters. Fighting scenes feel dull, slow and easily become boring. For some reason, unlike the manga, this adaptation adds a set of special effects which make no sense what so ever and are not present in the manga, putting it to shame and making it look like characters have \"super powers\" they do not actually have. (most noticeably lightning bombs and other various lightning based effects, similar to those of DragonBall)\\n\r\nThe only positive thing I can admit was good is indeed the opening, visuals aside, the music is among the best I have ever heard and comes from TK, an artist whom I hold a lot of respect for. (\"katharsis\" by TK)\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do strongly recommend the manga, I must warn you not to watch the anime as it is but a disappointment and a distorted ugly version of the story it is based on.",

            "content": "Hi there!\r\nThis is my first review so bear with me. I've only seen the anime, so keep that in mind when reading this review. Hope you enjoy!\r\nI was kind of looking forward to see if they could reverse the wrong doings on the Root A season. Unfortunately, that's not what happened, let's get into it!\r\nStory 1/10: The first season of :re put me on the back foot and I thought it was just thrown out there. The story had no connection and you only got to know a couple of characters well. Regardless, I thought the second part would at least grab a bit ofthat connection we got from some of the characters and go from there. But... they didn't...\\n\r\nInstead Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season is a mishmash of fighting cut scenes with no story telling and a dreadful character development. There's no back bone to the story and the all the characters that are introduced to us die within 20 seconds. There's legitimately no story to this anime and it's completely unfathomable that the studio let this through. The amount of incoherence in the story details followed by insane power creep on virtually any character not named Kaneki/Haise makes me question the creators of this show/manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: the fight scenes aren't bad. But since that's the main focus of the show now, it's makes me question where they actually employed their budget since once in a while you see stick-men rather than well drawn characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Not good, not bad, just mediocre. You never get a real connection between the fights and the sounds the weapons seem to create. There's no music in the background that actually sticks to you and  besides the opening, the music sounds very dull overall. Most of the characters sound similar and are far from uniquely sounding. Very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10: The lack of any story telling destroys any ambiance created in the previous season/part. The incoherence and lack of general context is something that made me question several times what the characters focus and intentions were. On another note, several of the interesting characters they present us with are either fan service or to just use them as cannon fodder. It makes no sense to me how these characters were treated. They should've been built up, they should've been given context, a motivation, a passion, a hobby, something they love, something they hate. Instead what we got was just a 10 second cut scene presenting the characters followed by them being destroyed by humans.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10: From the very first moment, the only feeling you get by watching this anime is confusion. You're confused about how it starts, confused about who the hell are these characters that keep popping up out of nowhere, even confused about what the hell is the goal in this story. You're so confused you don't get to enjoy much of anything. Then in the middle of the anime they decide it's time to bring back some old favorites just to please the fans. However, there's no connection to what's their role in the story nor how we even got to that point. This mess of an anime is just that, a mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: If you want to just watch mutated dudes beating, slashing, crushing each other to death, with no particular reason, then watch this anime, otherwise don't. There wasn't a moment when watching this that I felt my time watching it was valued by the creators and the fact that they actually released this makes me very sad and disappointed in the studio and the Mangaka. Hopefully in a few years from now, an actual decent studio will pick this manga and make this a legitimate good anime.",

Simply because they skipped so much stuff that you cannot possibly understand how they came to this situation. You won't have the background where it explains the story of some characters like Miza Kusakari a.k.a. \"Three blades\" or the past of Karao Saeki a.k.a. \"Torso\". They don't even show how some characters got to where they are.\r\nIn the end, I wouldn't recommend watching this anime excepted if you did read the manga and you just want to watch an animated versionof what you read.",

            "content": "I will be completly honest with you guys, I was always a HUGE Tokyo Ghoul fan, but Tokyo Ghoul:re was without a doubt my least favorite season of Tokyo Ghoul and this second season is surprisingly even worse than the previous...\r\nThe story leaves out an INSANE amount of content from the manga and skips so many important scenes and pieces of content. While I was watching the first episode I genuinly thought to myself WTF is going on multiple times, and so far I keep on getting these thoughts for every new episode that releases. Personally, I only believe that the Story is dreadful, allthe other pieces of this anime are as they should be, but I still believe that a good Story is fundamental for a good anime. \\n\r\nAnyways, I gotta admit that this anime OP is my second favorite for Tokyo Ghoul (right after Unravel of course) and the music and soundtrack are also great. The Art is the same as the other previous seasons of Tokyo Ghoul (Thank god!), so that remains unaffected. As far as the characters go, this new season does nothing but blast new characters and old ones that I forgot even existed, this got a bit confusing for me but if you are a hardcore Tokyo Ghoul fan you shouldnt really experience any problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict: I rate this season of Tokyo Ghoul a solid 5/10. The story is just dreadful and with a bad story you cant really have a good anime. <3\\n\\n\r\nEdit: My bad, I thought another studio worked on this anime because thats what I heard from another comment on another website. I didnt research this fact and I included it in my review. I have changed up my review and deleted any false information regarding that topic. Sorry! <3",

Of course you don't, he was removed from season 2.\\n\r\nThe animation is horrible, the movement of the characters is always stiff and lifeless, no surprise because studio pierrot is not actually animating the show, its the backup studio and other outsource animating studios.\\n\r\nThe only good thing from this anime is the soundtrack and the voice acting, which are amazing and i hope if we ever get a reboot they keep the voice actors\\n\r\nAnyways its a 2/10 for me, you're better of reading the source material",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season is the final installment of the Tokyo Ghoul series.\r\nThis latter half of Season 3 can be described in two words: wasted potential.  Tokyo Ghoul - the series as a whole - has suffered from setting standards that it simply cannot continue to meet.  Every new season ends up becoming a bigger disappointment than the last.\r\nThe storyline for this half of S3 was haphazard at best.  The episodes didn't follow a strategic path and failed to make any dent in the concerns viewers tend to have as a series begins to end.  If anything, this season only causedfurther confusion and frustration for avid fans looking for a clean wrap-up of the series.  The plot was overly complex to the point of boredom.  The ending was wholly unsatisfying and left more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was consistent with the first half of S3.  Most of the art and characters were given an 'upgrade' from the art style found in S1 and S2.  Whether this is a positive or negative change is up to the viewer; I personally preferred the art found in S1/S2.  The various backgrounds and settings for scenes were not inherently memorable - they weren't entirely devoid of intrigue either.  Many character designs were slightly modified from S1/S2 but the difference was subtle and did not adversely affect the goals set out by the show.  All animation was fluid and non-choppy.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English SUB of the show and I can attest to quality from both the voice actors and SFX crew.  No voice actor felt significantly out of place and the majority of the voices meshed with their respective characters from the get-go.  The intro music is loud - it wasn't my cup of tea.  In contrast, the outro music is light and relaxing.  At times the only part of an episode I truly enjoyed was the outro.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was utterly disorganized in this season.  Many characters were behaving in ways unbecoming of the image they set out in S1/S2.  This, by itself, isn't a negative thing if background information is given attesting to the change.  Instead, viewers were left wondering why suddenly friendly characters were battling each other and enemies were teaming up without rhyme or reason.  Some characters would suddenly turn upon one another and then weep when one is fatally wounded - most action scenes made little-to-no sense.  The majority of characters also belonged to a group (CCG, Goat, Clowns, V, etc) - these groups were forging and betraying alliances constantly amongst each other.  Another issue I found with the show is the random buffing and nerfing of characters.  Certain characters were unnaturally strong without having any reasons given leading viewers to constantly question who should win in a fight.  That being said, most characters were unique and memorable to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't enjoy watching this season of Tokyo Ghoul.  The plot, character development, and ending was brazen and littered with lazy writing.  The final battle's finale did not match up with the final scene depicted in the show - the show doesn't bother to explain how certain characters are seemingly 'saved' behind the scenes.  I'm sure many Tokyo Ghoul fans will enjoy this season simply because it is part of the franchise.  I'm also certain that many fans will dislike it for being a disappointment to the initial standards set out by S1.  I don't regret finishing this half of S3 but I certainly don't expect to re-watch it any time soon.  Unfortunately, this season missed the mark in a blatantly obvious manner.",

While the first season of re at least tried to introduce you to new characters and tried to help you understand characters' motivations it's like the second season completely gave up. At the core the story is interesting enough, but when you look deeper all you're left with is a feeling of confusion. Who are these new characters? Why are villains from Tokyo Ghoul suddenly good guys and why have good guys now bad guys? If you want people to be ableto follow along at minimum viewers should be able to understand characters' motivations for switching sides. Of course reading the source material will help you understand an anime better, but if you make an anime that relies on you having read the manga to be able to even follow along then you've just made a clusterfuck.",

I kept looking at the time, saying \"when will this finish?!\".\\n\\n\r\nart - 2\\n\r\nwhat's with the shading and highlighting?! as a professional artist myself, everything confused me. there was like no saturation, and the shading was gross and out of place. one thing that stood out to me was Suzuya's eyes. they looked inconsistent from the previous seasons and the manga.\\n\\n\r\nat least the hair highlighting wasn't like lightning bolts. and there was some pretty good realistic aspects. one thing i did appreciate from the previous serious was the beautiful artwork at the end of each episode, but this serious had none of that. that disappointed me as well.\\n\\n\r\nsound - 4\\n\r\nthey kept reusing the same tracks over and over, and it became annoying. tokyo ghoul has an amazing sound track. their op/endings and background music (including Glassy Sky) was beautiful in the first seasons. there was nothing unique about this season.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 4\\n\r\nso yes, the characters do development. Urie becomes strong, Kaneki leaves the CCG, uh.. Touka becomes less of an asshole.. Uhm.. There isn't really that many different changes, huh? the characters become more and more generic and predictable. They seem to even become inconsistent. To be honest, I miss the old Suzuya. There isn't too much to say about this for me.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment - 2\\n\r\ni wasn't impressed, and i wasn't enjoying very much about it. that's why it took me so long to finish it. i forced myself to watch it. this ruined the series if you ask me. I liked the others, and this Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd season was a complete disappointment. \\n\\n\r\noverall - 3",

            "content": "I think that for anime adaptation of anything it can be approached by different possibilities. It's either you read the material and then watched the anime or you know some details about the source material but haven't really read it or you completely watched the anime without knowing anything. With the tokyo ghoul franchise I knew the existense of the manga and some minor details about it so my opinion on the entire anime series only rely on what the community is telling me and some small research.\r\nStory 1/10: I have no idea what the hell is going on.\r\nThe first season while feels rushed andincomplete it was still entertaining and knowing that it was only the first season I knew the possibilities for deeper exploration on the origin of the of the ghouls and characters can still happen in future seasons. Then root A happened. And then re and finally this re season 2. Idk what got to me thinking that things will get better when it isn't the case for this anime franchise. Things just happens and every episode I give less shit about what's happening and just waited for the anime adapt the highlight of the manga which 9/10 doesn't fucking happens and if does happen I just couldn't care since the anime's pacing is way too fast. Characters just appears and dies or tell you that they're dead but not really? What the hell man!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10 I counted 73 characters listed on this anime and has only 12 episodes.\\n\r\nThis is the anime's biggest mistake. Whoever was in-charge thought that they can fit 73 characters under 12 episode and expects the viewers to care about them. Is that a joke? If I didn't look it up I'll probably only remember 15 name if I really tried and that's not including their significance in this anime since most the characters introduced in this anime just dies 5 minutes after their introduction or the worst offenders are those characters that \"died\" in previous season but SURPRISE WE'RE HALF-GHOUL NOW AND NOT REALLY DEAD. Kaneki changes personalities with each new season that really doesn't make any sense at all seriously he can be in the transformer's franchise. Finally Rize the most interesting character seems like an after thought and they just added her back when they remembered the viewers we're looking for her. I still can't believe how she died right from the beginning from the dumbest reason and kaneki a half-ghoul turns into a god mode when the plot calls for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art 2: it's just there.\\n\r\nWith poor story and characters I really couldn't care about the sound anymore. I only watched the entirity of the series just for the manga highlight at this point so watching it raw or without sound doesn't really matter. They also used the same trick from re season 1 and making the battle happen at night so less censoring will be noticed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: The saving grace fight that I thought would make the anime at least more enjoyable was so dull I stopped caring anymore for anything.\\n\r\nI won't lie, the teaser from re season 1 for kaneki vs. Arima got me interested and thought they'll fix my biggest disappointment in root A but no they just fought in a white place and everything else was extremely underwhelming. From there I just watched this trainwreck just because I watched the previous 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2: Watch season 1 read the manga and the 2 ova. I don't know what got me to finish this anime but here we are. If you really loved this anime I envy you since you found enjoyment in something I tried to like but couldn't.",

Seriously mate, kill it with fire. \r\nWhy it is so bad:\r\n- The amount of fillers, omg 5min has pass just watching each and every character take turns to smile, and blink, or just look at each other. The amount ofmethaphorical mental mumbo jumbo too. the amount of dialogs that dosen't help anything. \\n\r\n- Fightsceens are shit, an unstopable boss appears, no one can kill, then somebody throw a softtoy at it then it just dies, like come on!!

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul re: 2nd season....  \r\nTo start off , I would like to let people know that Tokyo Ghoul is one of my favorite series if not my favorite series and I just have to say this anime was pretty disappointing if you are a manga reader(me).  If you are an anime only, then yeah, it is a decent series.  You might be confused at some points but you will enjoy it but i will just tell you, READ THE MANGA\r\nStory: Kaneki and his memories are back in the final season and he finds himself trying to unite and create peace betweenhumans and ghouls as the leader of the ghouls.  But he has trouble as he tries to take on everything by himself and learns the hard way that he has to rely on others.  The story for Tokyo ghoul is a great one.  It is creative, it makes sense and you will really get into it.  The ending though, they don't bother to tell you what is going on with ghoul and humankind and if they are getting along or not. Some of the characters you have grown to really care about, they don't tell you what happens with them which sucks if you are an anime only. Overall great story, kinda lame ending\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art is definitely mediocre at best.  The characters look stiff and just not that good.  Granted, they did pretty decent with the fight scenes but it really could have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Thats one thing I will praise the anime about is the music soundtrack.  They are all really good from the opening song, the music that is played during an episode and the ending song.  Some personal favorites for me are Glassy Skies and Remembering.  All characters voice actors did a good job too with a standout being the voice actor of Furuta.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Honestly i don't know what to say here for the characters except that Kaneki is still pretty badass especially when he is Black Reaper Kaneki and that you will definitely enjoy Furuta.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Overall:  Like i said before, if you are an anime only, you will like it.  If u are a manga reader, you will be disappointed. \\n",

I really enjoyed binging both series (especially re:) \r\nHowever, the jumble[swear word] that the second season is, I don't entirely know how to explain it. Mostly because I had no [swear word]ing idea what was going on. Now I'm not a manga reader (I know, I'm cancer. I'm sorry) and it seemed like in order to understand the characters you needed to be a manga reader since the pacing of the show was lightning fast and it introduced so many characters way too fast (Thiswas apparent in the first season but it's very major in this season). At times I had to go on my phone mid-episode to look up the characters being mentioned because MANY characters had little development and with so many characters I barely remembered any names. Characters like Arima and Tatara (I had to look up his name lol) seemed to be portrayed as really big things but they turn out to only be a footnote in the whole story(Now this may be a Manga issue but I am yet to read the source material). In addition, the first 5 mins of the show were confusing \\n\\n\r\nNow the animation/art isn't bad. It really isn't, however, the beautiful [swear word] art of Ishida's is majorly lacking. The watercolor is so beautiful and I wish the series's art emulated that. Now the music, to me is one of the best things, with TK from Ling Tosite Sigure returning for the opening and a great ending by osterreich, as well as a beautiful insert song composed by Yukata Yamada and sung by Tate McRae.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this season, so far is a major disappointment and with the series already halfway done, I don't think the show will recover from the extremely confusing and unreasonably faced paced start.",

( A lot of people don't understand the story after reading the manga so you cannot hope to understand it after just watching the anime )\r\nThen, you're hyped for Arima's fight with Kaneki, what do youget? 1 EPISODE with a small portion of the fight that happened in the manga, how can I even cry to that, wasn't it supposed to be an emotional death? What happened??! Not to mention the entire show is being rushed since season 3...\\n\\n\r\nI love Tokyo Ghoul but I can't watch this season and say it's good 'cause it's not, it's literal trash.",

But to be completely honest, I felt like Juuzou was one of the few characters going through the slightest bit of character development in the 2 re seasons. If you've read the other reviews for this season, you can probably guess how I feel about it. Very inconsistent, lots of content skipped, etc. Overalljust very poorly adapted. Seasons 1 and 2 were fairly good, especially season 1. It's a shame that it ended on a much lower note. \\n\\n\r\n(But seriously, a Juuzou series would be pretty rad.)",

            "content": "The 4th season of Tokyo Ghoul stands out as a textbook example of a manga to anime adaptation failing to meet the expectations of the manga fanbase, and receiving slightly more negative reception than it deserves as a result. Does re 2nd Season deserve a lower score than the previous seasons? Yes, it does. The plot is clearly on a rush pace to the point where you can tell they are skipping through things even if you have not yet read the source manga. Studio Pierrot absolutely should have split Tokyo Ghoul:Re into three seasons, but due to whatever time or budget constraints they decidedto cram a whole lot of chapters into a whole lot of nothing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever ...for people who only watched the anime and have not yet read the manga, the legions of 1/10 scores on here are going to seem overzealous. Re 2nd season is completely watchable if you can ignore the fact that it isn't doing the source material justice. At the very least, it's far better than some of the generic seasonal trash that has been given a similar average rating. For what it is worth, this final season managed to at least tie a lot of the loose ends from previous anime seasons and end the series on a decent feeling note. But oh boy, the amount of character development they left out is really sad. It's a noticeable downgrade from the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, which made sure to focus much more on the emotional impact the characters were going through. Re and Re 2 suffer from a noticeable lack of this aspect that made the first two seasons great. Reading the manga shows this is a problem more with the anime than the story as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Re: 2nd season I couldn't help but notice a pattern to what was left out. Anything that wasn't well touched in previous anime seasons continued to be ignored. It seems Pierrot made this for anime-only viewers and decided that they didn't care about people who were expecting this to actually follow the source. This is a usually foolish move, as shown by all the negative reviews. In conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul: Re 2 has three possible scores:\\n\\n\r\nDid you read the manga and have any expectations that this anime season will be faithful? 2/10\\n\r\nDid you read the manga but are OK with the anime doing its own thing? 6/10\\n\r\nAnime only viewers? 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI will give it a 7/10 just to weight these scores out and leave it at that. Re 2 isn't nearly as bad as some of the flak it's getting, but it all really depends on what you personally expect from the show.  \\n\\n",

Haise dying is what made season 1 a success we got to see the break down of kaneki before his build up and to just bring him back? AND KANEKI WASNT EVEN TRAUMATIZED OR EVEN HAD ANY REACTION to haise suddenly being alive. this is meant to be horror and thriller and its complete crap. i try so hard to be fair and positive and god I'm sorry but its awful. \\n\r\nim gonna complain about the art too, i preferred the old art style much better. this one made them look funny and i didn't like the hair gradients because they weren't present in the first season. and how did character age up so considerably between season 1 & 2 of re? \\n\r\nthe only nice things about this anime was the soundtrack tbh, almost as good as TG season 1. good job for not messing up the sound team. but the story made me want to rip my brain apart.",

Tokyo ghoul is a incredible manga series that got itself an anime adaptation back in 2014 that exploded in popularity. the 2nd season went the anime only route... was not as great and got quickly removed from cannon. 3rd season beginning of RE:? I could not have possibly been more hyped for this after 4 years of absence. and the first half did not disappoint while it was confusing for anime-only's anime only viewers were not the target audience. It follows the manga cannon and is less about epic fight scenes and more about character and plot. So then howdoes this second half fair?\\n\\n\r\nto put it bluntly: HOW THE FUCK DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN? Dammit Pierrot you had a winner! I'm the kind of guy that gives SAO a 9/10 to 10/10 to put how disappointed I am with this show into perspective. they RUSHED THE HELL out of the 2nd half to the point the story is literally non-existent. so therefore by extension the character is non-existent too. what happened to all those Urie internal monologues? guess we don't have time for those anymore! art is passable and the soundtrack somehow manages to remains stellar as always despite being part of this mediocrity. The 2nd season has it's moments (like about 3) that remind you of what this could have been... but then it gets swept away by this is utter bastardization of the source material that happens like the other 80% of the time! I honestly have conflicted feelings, while I was fine with watching it I was also very disappointed with it, I do not have the heart to rate it a 4 so it's a 5. this is the first anime I have watched that I genuinely have to give below a 6 for. (you probably think I haven't watched anime much based on that but that's due to me looking up and only watching shows with serviceable ratings such as not to waste my time.) \\n\\n\r\nTokyo ghoul re: season 2 was a waste of my time. It will most certainly be a waste of yours. I feel sorry for all the manga readers  that had to watch this. your best bet if you're interested in re: is to  watch the first season of re: stop right the hell there and read the manga from that point onward. I think it's best we all just pretend this never happened.",

            "content": "\"At this point it's not even worth talking about\"\r\n(May contain spoilers for previous seasons)\r\nIt started in summer 2014 with the first adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul Manga airing. The anime remained faithful to the manga and the story itself was interesting combined with some gore and it attracted a large audience and ratings were good too. Both manga readers and anime only watchers were happy.\r\nThen came the \u221aA. Now in the first season they had 12 episode and serialized about 50 chapters of manga that is good. But in second season they still went with 12 episode series but decided to finish it there. Now theoptions were either to compress 94 chapters in 12 episodes or change the story and omit some details and they went with the later which left the manga readers furious.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward 3 years, in spring 2018 came the adaptation of tokyo ghoul:re , now the RE manga itself was a bit tricky because fight scenes were not very well drawn and for some reason the author decided to revive every dead character. Now the anime adaptation decided to completely forget about the \u221aA and assume that everyone has read the manga which was definitely not the case and this time it left every anime only watcher confused and scratching their head because they don't know most of the things that happened in the second half of the Tokyo Ghoul which Studio Pierrot decided to throw in dump.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally 4 years later after the starting of Tokyo Ghoul we've reached the bottom of the pit after descending every level for 4 seasons. That's right I'm talking about the Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2. Now with this one they had the same situation as in \u221aA either follow the manga by compressing it or write it on your own like they did in \u221aA. But they thought hey we've already done the later now lets try the former and not much to say they failed miserably. This time they somehow managed to make both manga readers and anime only watchers angry, confused and disappointed. Anime only watchers didn't even know what was going on half the season and manga readers were very disappointed with the terrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n(Just read the manga if you're curious about the story)\\n\\n\r\nThe story does follow the manga but at the same time it doesn't with almost every detail getting omitted which leaves characters as hollow as 1 dimensional objects with no development at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThere is no character development. WIth almost every character getting revived we have about 3 times more characters than episodes which leaves no development to anyone at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nOnly the OP by TK was good, rest of the osts were of the same quality as the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animations were pretty ok compared to the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's like a disappointment which everyone predicted and it came out to be just that way.",

If you're somebody who didn't or does not want to read the manga I could not understand how you would understand or derive any enjoyment out of the plot of these twelve episode which represent around 60-70 chapters of the manga. \r\nThe opening and ending themesare the best things it has going for it. \\n\r\nThe animation and art overall are better than expected but that isn't saying a whole lot. \\n\r\nAll around it's a pretty poor adaptation of the culmination of a series which had its fair share of flaws. I think anyone who hasn't read the manga would be hard pressed to make sense of all of the characters and what is going on. This speaks volumes because the overall plot is not all that complicated. \\n\r\nHowever more importantly I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the manga would suffer through watching it. \\n\r\nI would like to say that this isn't the typical elitist read the manga because it's better post. The adaptation was just really poorly handled all around for Tokyo Ghoul, and these last 12 episodes in particularly so.",

            "content": "The epic conclusion to a beloved story. Told across 2 manga series, with a total of 4 anime seasons. It has one of the largest casts, each with their own motivations and roles to play throughout the story, and each of them has their own character development arcs. It is a grand story, one that gives you the sense that there is so much going on in the background, that will all somehow interconnect with each other in the end. The romance is desirable, and the action sequences are next level. Overall, it is one of the greater series out there, which I think everyoneshould atleast give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe story I just described however, is not Tokyo Ghould:re's anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, is the most disappointing anime of 2018. I beg you to refrain from watching this, and instead read the manga, or else your opinion of the series as a whole may be forever destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nI truly pity the anime-only's, because you guys are probably so confused with what's going on, or will be. Because, they don't explain anything. I'm honestly not surprised, since they took over 100 chapters of the manga, and squeezed it into 12 episodes. Some of the new characters you don't even get to know! They just have their names called out to by other characters, and that's the only way you can identify them. Like, who the hell thought that it was a good idea to do this?!\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the story is so convoluted and awkwardly told that you end up not even caring anymore about what's happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is low tier, and the animation is clunky. It just looks bad, because of how they animated it using such a small budget, I would assume.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the only redeeming quality of the show. The OP and ED are pretty nice, even if they can't compare to the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. The V.A.'s weren't bad, but some of the sound effects sounded a little off. Not enough to bother you honestly.\\n\\n\r\nAs I previously stated, the characters are all just thrown down the dump. Anime-only's will never get to know them, or even care about any of them. Plus, this might be nitpicking but, they completely messed up Touka's hair color. She intentionally dyed it a light blue, which you can see from the manga cover, yet they didn't change that here in the anime. Atleast get the character design right, if you're just going to completely ignore everything else! Furuta's character however, was done rather well. I enjoyed his antics, even if they were messed up.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still mad about not getting to see Hsiao animated, or even introduced properly. Atleast the gigantic oppai's would have slightly redeemed the show.... xD\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes were the worst. You can't even tell what's going on most of the time, not that you'd care about it by the time you got there. Now, I'm not saying every episode is bad. There were some good ones, but the majority far outweighs the minority.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy seeing the conclusion of Kaneki's struggles, but I just wished that the journey leading up to that could have been done better. Give it better animation and more time. Get the character design's right, and stop jumping from place to place in the story as if you're doing a flashback sequence for the entire season. Then maybe, just maybe, Tokyo Ghoul:re would have been a good anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review! I hope you have a wonderful day, wherever you are!",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul got way too complicated. I haven't read the manga, but from what I've heard, this anime is a disgraceful adaption. I would assume that the manga was actually able to introduce characters and pace the story well where the anime could not, and that is why this season was an awful way to end the series. Though, it may not be the end, which is even worse. \r\nSo, like I said, this season was overly complicated. It kept me from caring about anything too much. This carries over from last season, but this was handled so poorly as far as the characters go.The anime essentially gives you a bunch of characters, tells you you have to care about them, and then doesn't tell you WHY you have to care about them. It doesn't even SHOW why you have to care about them. So, basically, I spent this season watching fights and developments and epiphanies and conclusions happen for every character under the sun when the series should've stuck with what gave it its charm in the first place: Kaneki. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was done awfully as well. I couldn't really follow it because it jumped around way too much. Even if there wasn't a big time skip, there was a lot of character development that was just glossed over. The anime would give you point A and point Z without anything in between. I'd get hooked on part of the story developing, and then it would just fizzle out or reveal its conclusion right away. There was no suspense or excitement when I was watching this. The one thing I was waiting for finally happened in this season, which is why I didn't rate it lower, but they still kind of botched the whole thing because it was way too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nSomehow the season managed to have touching end despite me not giving a damn about most of the characters, but overall this season was a big disappointment. It kind of feels like you can't watch it unless you already know what's going on beforehand, but even the people that do know what's going on and have read the manga don't like the anime, so Tokyo Ghoul is kind of just a flop. No offense. \\n\\n\r\nEverything else was pretty average. The art was fine, the sound was fine, I didn't have to force myself to sit through the episodes, but I didn't have a good time watching it. I will say that the story slowed down and became enjoyable toward the end, but that's about the only good thing I can say about the anime overall. My advice: give up on the Tokyo Ghoul anime.",

It was kind of understandable what was happening in the beginning, but after seeing Episode 8, I gave up trying to understand the situations that were appearing in front of my eyes. They're seemingly attempting to cram as much of the Manga in as they can without any regard to the viewer's knowledge.\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nIf you have seen Tokyo Ghoul:re, you'll be pleased (or not) to know that the Art style and Animation is identical. Thevisuals are nicely made. As always, the Opening is breathtaking, as with every other Tokyo Ghoul Opening.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nThe sound quality is good with no audibly displeasing parts as of writing this (8 Episodes out of 12). Opening is katharsis by TK, which is honestly fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (2/10):\\n\r\nThere was character development, don't get me wrong... but it was just way too god damn fast. It's as if you'd see a potato and the next second it's mutating into a massive killing machine that has absolutely no control of itself anymore, gets killed a minute later, and then turns out to be still alive, but never appears again because it's time for the carrot to do its quick entry.... Did you understand that? No? Me neither. Welcome to Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nIt would've been a easy 7/10 if they'd stick more or less to the same speed as the beginning episodes. It would've been even higher if they'd have built it like Tokyo Ghoul:re and maybe given us a 3rd Season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10):\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, it had the potential to be so much better, but after a while it became so chaotic I had to give up and just watch it without asking the story behind it. Needless to say, I feel betrayed and disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAs of writing this, I still have 4 episodes to go that I will watch, but it's most likely going to be playing on a secondary monitor, with me focusing on something more important.",

If Root A had something interesting to offer us, although non-cannon, Re:2 is basically an empty shell rushed out the door for money.\r\nIt got to the point that I have started reading the manga to catch-up and understand what the hell is going on. First part was quite decent, although some character development has been cut during production. Part 2 feels like 3 seasons crammed in 12 episodes, some of them just a generalization of events. Black Reaper features in 2 episodes, King in 6,and Dragon just 4, not counting the final chapter which needs some respect too.\\n\\n\r\nReally disappointed by this release. Studio Pierrot murdered Tokyo Ghoul. And instead of redemption, we see it fade away and die, with bitter taste in our mouth, like eating some horse intestines...",

Now it is nothing but a mess.\r\nI had to search all over Google for an explanation what the f*ck is happening. Otherwise it looks like a random compilation of events and characters coming out of nowhere. Literally. There is a moment when Tsukiyama jumps out of the shadow during the fight and noone ever explains where did he come from, why did he come or what happened to him before or after the scene. Nothing!!!\r\nP.S. I rate5 only the worst anime, that's why this one gets a 6...(meaning it still can get worse)",

            "content": "This will be my first review.  I will try my best to my point across and avoid any spoilers the I can.  As a fan of the Tokyo Ghoul franchise I feel the need to write a review for this anime.  \r\nI grew up in the Toonami generation, watching shows like Dragon Ball Z, Yuu Yuu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, Rurouni Kenshin, Gundam, and other shounen action anime.  However, it was only until about 4 years ago, when the rebooted Toonami aired and they started showing Crunchyroll ads during commercial breaks, that I was introduced to a whole bunch of other animethat I wasn't unaware of at the time.  \\n\\n\r\nIt was around this time that I stumbled upon an anime call \"Tokyo Ghoul\" and I fell in love with it, so much so that I also bought the first 7 volumes of the manga.  While I love Tokyo Ghoul I will admit it has it's flaws, (mostly the fact that the anime cut out some scenes from the manga).  However I still liked the first season.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward 4 years after the first season and we now have \"Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season\" and while I wouldn't say it's unbearable to watch, its hard to stay engaged with this anime seeing how poorly Studio Pierrot is handling it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nThis is the main problem with the show.  I haven't read the manga for :Re yet so I don't really know what is happening at this point.  However, you do not have to have read the manga or have watched a lot of anime in general to tell you that this show was rushed.  Everything in this show is going by too fast, jumping from one scene to another.  Because of this it is hard to get a grasp of what is going on.  There is not enough time to get to know the characters or to get a grasps of the situation at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6\\n\r\nCompared to the original TG the art seems prettier.  However when it comes to animation its a bit lacking compared to the original.  It has it's moments though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe best thing I can say about the second season of :Re is that they brought back TK from Ling Toshite Shigure to do the op.  \"THE OP Katharsis IS FIRE\", it rivals \"Unravel\".  Other than that sound is alright, however they use various sound bits that came from online somewhere that you might have heard before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the characters.  Kaneki does seems a bit cooler than he was in the first season of :Re.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5.5\\n\r\nThe story is not being handled well.  However its still \"Tokyo Ghoul\" and concept is there, which is fine by me.  So there is still some enjoyment to be had with this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul :re 2nd season could have been great, however that is not case.  Maybe its because Studio Pierrot is also working on Black Clover and Boruto, so the team working on TG :re might not have had much in terms of resources and had to make do with what they had.  If that's the case I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not say don't watch this anime, but if you decide to watch it, don't expect too much or you will be disappointed.      \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*This my first review*\r\nIn this review I will mention previous seasons of a Tokyo ghoul, so some spoilers may be mentioned. \r\nSeeing as Tokyo ghoul was the first anime I watched completely and manga series I read as it was being published, it has a special place in my heart. Nonetheless that does not excuse the fact that this series did get worse each season, and has large plot holes for anime only watchers. \r\nIn my opinion I thought the first season of Tokyo ghoul was was enjoyable , followed the manga well (only missing a few points) and was something I would recommend watching.The animation was fine and captured fight sequences to a good enough standard, plus you can\u2019t forget the rightfully popular OP \u2018Unravel\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u221aA\\n\r\nThen the second season rolled around... wow. With all the aspects of the first season and some awesome OST\u2019s. it looked promising at first glance, but it didn\u2019t follow the source material (for the most part) and is basically not cannon.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re \\n\r\nAfter a long wait, Tokyo ghoul:re aired. Due to the fact  Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA didn\u2019t follow the events of the manga anime only watchers were left confused. I thought it would be okay though, and regain the great timing, animation and story aspect of the first season that Root A missed out on. I sure was wrong... in my opinion the entire 2 seasons of Tokyo ghoul:re felt rushed, covering way to many chapters in the first episode alone (only getting progressively worse as it continued) I didn\u2019t like the art style in TG:re and the animation was poor. Resulting in the fight sequences feeling somewhat static. The only redeeming feature of Tokyo ghoul:re for me was the soundtrack, with some of the tracks from previous seasons it made me feel nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I would say just skip watching Tokyo ghoul:re and read the manga instead. I like Tokyo ghoul as a whole, but just wanted TG:re to end so I could watch something else. Obviously this is just my personal opinion, and it\u2019s good if you enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul:re even though I didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Probably the most disappointing modern adaptation to date, both Anime only watchers and Manga hardcore fans that claim the source material to be a masterpiece, all have turned their back on the abomination that one body could take for granted, \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re\u201d, with the prequel being just as controversially bad, this sequel of the same name told us to hold its beer, and that wasn't even half of the story.\r\nI'm an Anime-only watcher, I never read a single chapter of the Manga, and never was exposed to any of the \u201cspoilers\u201d you see being spammed on the internet.\r\nNevertheless, and given both recent adaptations, they remainone of the worse comebacks ever, at least in my experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10):\\n\r\nJust like the prequel, and even more, the pacing was ridiculously fast, even my Manga reader sibling commented on how fast and confusing it was, let alone for Anime-only watcher normie me that had no idea on the chronological order of anything that happened in the season, literally, they go from one period of time worth of content to another with no alert, and it isn't a bad thing to do per se (Baccano! is a great example on how to accomplish that the right way), they themselves made it not work somehow.\\n\r\nThe progression as well as poor and bad-received from my part, I was basically starting at the screen trying to figure out what was the meaning of what's happening, it felt more like a chore than actual entertainment.\\n\r\nAside from the bad direction, the story, in general, fell by a great margin in terms of quality, and I can see the potential there, a lot of turn around moments and twists didn't have such impact, and most were forced and out of nowhere, like you'sd have episodes houses up to five or six big reveals, and none of them gives the other a moment of breather to tone down the intensity, no, it was more like a global traffic accident. Like, what is a Kagune anymore?\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nProbably the only decent aspect that \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re 2\u201d has going on other than the vocals.\\n\r\nAnd even that wasn't for the most part, there are the big moments of shine that have a noticeable rise in quality, but almost the majority of animation was just a lazy bad move from their part, most talking about the distorted anatomy and the slow movements on scenes that were supposed to feel faster.\\n\r\nI do give them one thing though, and that is the backgrounds, so realistic and do standout on their own and yet make a great job blending in the other not-too-realistic characters, and it works flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nSee that eight? That's talking mostly about the opening theme song alone, Katharsis gave me a new aura to associate Tokyo Ghoul with. As much of an iconic Unravel was, I just can't help but give Katharsis the crown that Unravel held for so long, it just works perfectly, especially for a story with the same atmosphere as Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\r\nThe voice acting, on the other hand, wasn't my proudest experience here, a lot of screaming was involved, and you know how bad that can get.\\n\r\nToo bad they did not bring back some of the old soundtracks along, like the fantastic \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d. Just why did they think changing to something new would work better?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\\n\r\nA true shame, I do believe that Tokyo Ghoul had some of the greatest characters, that is until the \u201c:re\u201d adaptation joined the chat. There is particularly no sense in dealing with something called \u201ccharacter development\u201d in this shitfest of colliding misfits.\\n\r\nIf anything, that was an intentional downgrade, the interesting Kaneki for instance, goes from his raging emo depression to a normie nerdy looking guy, to then out of the blue breaking the emo records once again, and all of that in the same episode, bruh, catch a breather, will ya?\\n\r\nAgain, they went with the biggest weakness of the prequel and introduced a ton of other characters that we never got any background about, more specifically, think about it like crowd characters with names that they keep shaving up in your face the entire episode.\\n\r\nThere were a lot of interesting backstories with huge potential, but they just didn't live up to my expectations, with the return of some characters we long thought were dead, and the death of many others, sense loses its meaning and you end up not giving any L's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\r\nBasically, when you're too into some Anime that you don't enjoy anymore, but still dedicate some time to watching it for the sake of completing it, and I'm a completionist as I like to call myself, if it sucks, I'll rant in the review.\\n\r\nI did, however, experience one of my new favorite songs, Katharsis, that's probably the only good thing I'll remember about this adaptation, it really does feel bad, how such a big renowned series like this, gets such a low-level conclusion, even after a long time of wait from us fans.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\r\nSo glad I went through this, and so sad at the same time for how bad it was. If you're already planning to watch this, chances are you made it through the first three seasons, and only this abomination is still standing between you and saying \u201cI watched Tokyo Ghoul\u201d.\\n\r\nIt's adaptations like this that make you appreciate how great shows like \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia\u201d have it, I'm not trying to steer any controversy here, if you like your Tokyo Ghoul, then nobody is stopping you from seeing this season, again, I'm just stating my opinion, and it's far from being a fact.",

FEW SPOILERS AHEAD\"\r\nSeason 1 is the best, while Season 2 is good but this last... is the worst. \r\nThe first episode is good but when i finished it.. it seems the anime is been rush or something. Plot hole is really obvious in this last season of Tokyo Ghoul. They can do much better than that. I read some reviews too, they're quite in distaste of what happened in this last season. For me i think they can pull more story for like \"How the two friend of Renji Yomo became part of Clowns\" namely Uta and Itori, there's no emphasis of story howthey became part of Clowns. Second is the character development of Kaneki is good tho but became too rushed, i never read the manga or light novel but they're not giving him the same justice of Season 1 which is more successful than other sequels. \\n\\n\r\nI really want to asked them how CLOWNS formed, what happened to Amon Koutarou after fighting Kaneki, character development of other characters. There's a lot of plots that they can put in but they never invest their mind into it so its really disappointing. (Maybe lack of money is involve too so it looks rushed to me).\\n\\n\r\nFighting parts too have many flawed, they're seems lazy and as i said before, rushed!!! For some anime lovers who love this anime my advice is don't expect too much because it will leave you heart broken but if you enjoy this last season then its good for you. To those who didn't like this after watching it, just read the manga or light novel you'll feel much better.",
