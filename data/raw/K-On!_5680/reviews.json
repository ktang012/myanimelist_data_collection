            "content": "Mod Edit: Minor Spoilers mentioned.\r\nI'm just going to say this straight away: These kind of animes bring out the silly little girl in me. And as I'm a 19-year old guy, it's kind of an unexpected thing, even for me. And I mean this in the most positive way possible.\r\n\"K-On!\" follows the story of Hirasawa Yui, a girl who lives a life similar to your average person on the net, except for the internet part. It's difficult to explain without using the words \"carefree\" and \"lazy\". In a way, she probably reflects a majority of people I know, including myself, except for the fact shedoesn't really have any real life issues other than school. This changes however when she decides to join the Light Music Club, where she now has to learn and play guitar. We also got 3 other characters that will be focused on: Ritsu (drummer), Mio (bass), Tsumugi (keyboard), followed by another one half-way through the first season, namely Azusa (guitar). Inbetween their \"goal\" to reach fame, they have a few concerts and a lot of fun. Quite lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is memorable, but unoriginal and consisting mostly of filler to build character. However, I myself don't consider this to be a bad thing at all. With animes like this one, filler is what pretty much drives it, and I love every single minute of it. Each episode being just as silly, and if not even sillier than the other. Although it doesn't beat Lucky Star, but if you've seen that, you know that's a difficult thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself is great and quite catchy, but I'm not a big fan of Yui's singing. I know this might piss some people off, but hey, it's my opinion, and I prefer Mio on the mic anytime. The first ED is in this case also my favorite song in the anime, \"Don't Say Lazy\". The instrumentals are great, although not that original, but still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is cute and silly, and like I said before, combined with cute voices I often find myself randomly squeeing simply because of how cute it is. If it didn't have that factor, I would be far less interested in this anime. There are animes for all kinds of people, be it sci-fi, action, romance, drama, adventure, etc. But for me, comedies are my thing because they distract me from how stupid life can be from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are a lot of fun, and very different in personality. We got Yui who, as we know, is carefree and quite lazy, and tends to be awkward on the weirdest of times, but in a cute way. Then, we have Mio, who's pretty much the opposite of Yui, shy and easily scared. Ritsu is energetic and a bit of a devil when it comes to pranks, especially aimed at Mio as they are childhood friends. Tsumugi, who's not as energetic as Ritsu, but still enjoys the little things in life, and she's also the \"rich kid\" as you may call her, but thankfully you won't notice that in this anime. And later on we get Azusa, a very serious junior girl, but also easily distracted and really silly at times.\\n\r\nAll the characters share one thing: They're happy high school students who like to play music. The bond they have is emphasized in the anime, as each episode tries not to leave anyone out. And once again, that's one of the things I love about it.\\n\\n\r\n\"K-ON!\" is not for everyone, but if you like cute and silly characters with a cute and silly story, then I definitely recommend giving it a shot. Just don't expect any real seriousness, except for when they prepare for concerts. For me, it's a proper balance of a funny story, with funny characters and fun music. It's definitely not original, but as long as it's executed properly, it doesn't have to be, as long as it's fun. And yeah, like I said pretty much a million times... This anime sure is!",

            "content": "If K-ON! is the future of slice-of-life moe anime, then the genre is dying. Now, I myself am personally a great fan of the niche genre and have delighted in viewing many anime falling under it, no matter how silly or inane. That's because I don't mind having to turn off my brain to enjoy anime, but I expect to be compensated for doing so, be it by making me laugh, warming my heart, or leaving me with something to remember. K-ON! splendidly failed in all three ways multiple times throughout, and came off as a shoddy effort all around.\r\nBecause a slice-of-life moe series isoften devoid of any ongoing plot of significant importance, it must rely on the day-to-day circumstances of the characters, presenting them in new and inventive, yet somewhat familiar ways in order to keep attention. Surprisingly enough, K-ON! follows a linear, though loosely connected story, but does nothing of interest with the day-to-day circumstances. It's as if the staff decided that it was okay for the girls to be lazy and uneventful because it's slice-of-life, to which I must say \"NO NO NO\"... had to get that out of the way. I'll be serious now.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters need to be interesting enough to actively engage in following their exploits. Harsh as it may be to say, it was a waste of time to follow around a main character like Yui. I could rant for hours on end about Yui, but to sum her up, she's a mentally challenged nutcase. Now, I can excuse character stupidity as long as the main character has qualities that redeem said stupidity, be it fierce independence, reliability, or if it's made clear she's meant to be the butt of everyone's joke. Yui has none of these qualities. She is an idiot, and no one ever discourages her from being an idiot. Minor spoiler alert, but it must be said... I am absolutely furious at the gall the staff had to have Yui comment in Ep. 12 about how much she has changed. In the entire series, she does not grow even a little. What a crock.\\n\\n\r\nEnough about Yui though, there are other characters to focus on; all of who range from average to above-average. They're all likeable too, but far too simplistic. With no real inventiveness to the situations they end up in as previously stated, I had expected their personalities to be clever enough to make up for that lack. In this, the staff succeeds to a degree, but nothing comes from it. Everyone is essentially the same at the beginning as they are at the end and there is very little proof that any of them have grown as friends, regardless of what the series wants us to believe.\\n\\n\r\nIn the matter of technical aspects, K-ON!'s fluidity is remarkable but the style is such that it comes off incredibly choppy, and at some points downright ugly. It felt as though Kyoto Animation spent a ton on making it fluid and in doing so, took from the budget that allowed for the actual artwork itself, excusing the instruments which often look better than the girls themselves. While this tradeoff doesn't work entirely, it could be far worse. In addition, because this tradeoff comes from animation maestro Kyoto Animation, it is doubly worse.\\n\\n\r\nThough this is a show about a music club, the BGM is boring. Thankfully, a killer OP/ED combo and some fantastic inserts make up for that. On the acting front,the amateur seiyuu all sound like younger versions of already successful seiyuu, like how Mio's seiyuu Yoko Hirasa sounds not-too-surprisingly like a younger Aya Hirano. This isn't to criticize their talents, though. The fact that these newcomers are so lively and fits their character perfectly from the start is a compliment, one of the few I have given the series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all of the above, K-ON! to me came off as a cheap way for Kyoto Animation and Pony Canyon to make money. There is little effort, the characters are rather flat and unchanging, and everything in the news about it from merchandise tie-ins to Oricon charts leads me to believe it's one giant marketing ploy rather than an honest effort of a series. For this, I cannot say I enjoyed all of it, though it was good sporadically. However, as I said in the beginning, if these shoddy attempts at slice-of-life moe are what we as anime viewers choose to support and demand more of, we are killing the genre as we speak.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give K-ON! a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "This review is going to be broken down into the 5 parts that MAL focuses on with each section getting critiqued.\r\nStory:\r\nAs you know by the description on the anime's page, K-on is suppose to be about Yui Hirasawa and joining of saving of her high school's light music club, with the problem being that Yui has never read music or knows how to play a guitar. Slowly a few of these problems get cleared up but the main bulk of the plot goes no where whatsoever. You can come in at any episode and still get what's going. The anime is heavy on the theme\"light and fluffy.\" to which when watching it you don't have to know anything nor necessarily be there the entire episode to know what is going to happen and that's the main problem, like every other \"moe\" anime it's generic and predictable in the events category.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is probably the biggest problem with the show in my opinion, the art. Seriously I can guarantee you that the studio used a step by step handbook and stencil set to create yui, mio, ristu and mugi, it's what is seriously killing the industry today in my opinion...generic characters. There is nothing that makes any one character in K-on stand out. The backgrounds themselves are nothing to praise about either as they are the standard school, bustling street/shop and from time to time inside one of the girls home scenes. To sum it up the art lacks originality and there is no direction for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is probably the only place that K-on climbs up outta the rubbish category. The times that you hear music made by the club it's actually not that bad and can be catchy at times, and with it's suppose plot revolving around music you'd think to hear it a lot but it's quite the opposite, the girls spend more time sitting around being airheads then trying to do anything music related.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat can I say,all of the characters of K-on have traits that superficial. They all are generic and no one has anything that makes them unique or stand out. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAfter watching 13 episodes, I can say overall the enjoyment was just another thing including original art and characters that the show was missing...I mean it was boring and painful as well as predictable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nK-on is a light and fluffy fan service anime to which it hosts no original art and set of characters. If your looking for something to which you don't need to think or understand maybe you'd enjoy k-on but even then your going to have to endure lackluster scenes of boring pointless conversations to which watching windows screen saver can provide more enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "K-ON! is inconsequential fluff. One might compare it to popcorn or cotton candy: a tasty treat, but if you're looking for a meal, it will leave you looking for something more substantial after it's done.\r\nK-ON! follows the tried and true formula of cute girls doing cute things. Based on a 4-koma comic, the series is about several high school girls who form (technically join, but all the previous members graduated) a light music club and follows their activities. The music itself often takes a back seat to the antics of the girls, and audiophiles may find themselves somewhat disappointed if they go in expecting detailedattention to techniques or references to real life bands (there are a couple, but few and far between). There are two concerts in the thirteen episode series, but neither is as impressive as the one from the Live A Live episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (one of Kyoto Animation's earlier shows), but still very enjoyable. The most common scene in the series features the main girls sitting in the club room snacking on tea and cakes while discussing various mundane events, particularly with the more dedicated girls trying to get the rest to practice.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all have their own distinct personality. Yui, the main character, is the some clumsy and adorable airhead. She joined the club hoping to play an easy instrument like the castanets but ends up playing guitar because the club needed a guitarist. Ritsu is the energetic idiot of the show, drummer, and club president because she was the one who dragged everyone else into the club. Mio is Ritsu's long time friend, and the sensible, serious one of the group. She writes the groups songs, and plays the bass. She is also the most moe character, being the prettiest, easily embarrassed, and terrified of ghosts and yucky things. Mugi is the pianist. She comes from a wealthy family, and thus is a source of amusement by displaying the difference in wealth between rich people and normal people. She is also the provider of the tea and sweets that are regularly consumed at the club meetings. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few regular minor characters, too. Ui is Yui's younger, but more mature and reliable sister. Yui has a friend named Nodoka who joins the student council, which means her role is essentially to let everyone know that Ritsu has forgotten something regarding paperwork for the club. Sawako is a music teacher who is recruited as the club adviser in one of the more memorable scenes of the series. Also, a late addition to the cast is Azusa, an underclassman who is much like a miniature version of Mio.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are generally cute, with the kind of big round faces typical of most Kyoto Animation works. Background art is consistently good, as is the animation, which should come as no surprise. When characters are shown playing their instruments, there is generally more attention to detail than seen in anime to the point where the sound properly matches the characters actions. The singing at the concert features the same style animation as Live A Live, where you can just about lip read the lyrics (if you know Japanese, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the series can generally be described as light and fluffy, both the background music and the couple of songs the girls play at their concerts, with the exception of the closer, which rocks a little bit harder than rest. The voice acting fits well all around, with Yui being notable for regularly coming off as someone who isn't all there, fitting her character well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to close saying this show is like Azumanga Daioh with a music club, but that's about the easiest comparison I can make, and not too far off a description.",

Might as well ride the HYPE train and see WTF this show is all about. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n::FULL REVIEW::\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhat do you get when you add four cute girlfriends with the desire to form a music band, situational comedy, and every style of moe an otaku can think of? You get K-On! (or kei-on-bu). Just of a group of girls trying to follow their dreams... sounds very cliche' doesn't it? Well it is and this show oozes cliche'. The setting to the sitcom all the way down to the catch phrase onomatopoeia's  like kyuun and hyaan. It's very obvious from the start of episode 1, that the story isn't trying to mess with the success of current trends and tries its very best to run with whats popular with the anime crowd. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the set of stories set through each episode are not terrible by any stretch. Its just very \"same old same old.\" If you watch this you'll quickly recognize if you love it hate it after about two episodes. As for me, I love it but can't really feel attached to the storyline considering the amount of parts that are skipped. It almost feels like the show has a bad case of A.D.D. when it skips the important stuff. Trust me, they do it ALOT.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art direction has its high points and its low points, but overall the art can't go a little higher than mediocre. Just observe the op/ed theme songs for the show. Typically, the theme songs have higher production values than the actual show itself. They are indeed better artistically, but it still looks very low quality. Another areas that i could not help but notice in the artwork would be the disproportionate loli scenes and the spaces between their hands. You'll see what I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nI can't turn down the entire art direction down though, as the style does reflect the manga quite accurately most of the time. But I believe most of the time and effort (and probably money) went in to replicating the girls instruments with their real life counterparts. Mio's vintage lefty Fender-Japan JB62/3TS, Ritsu's Yamaha Hipgig JK6F46MK, Tsumugi's Korg TR76 (which is ~$1300), and Yui's VINTAGE Gibson Les Paul Standard Guitar, are all represented with great painstaking detail. The honey burst colors of the bass and standard guitars, the indentations on the Zildjan cymbals, even the correct amount of knobs and switches on the various Marshall amps (usually the JCM900 is shown the most). They even go far as to showcase even more instrument types throughout various locations like the Sonor Delite Stage 1 drum set in one of the girls summer home. Sadly, the instruments are just mere props that aren't shown in action very often as one would hope in a music-themed anime. But when they are in display, everything else, including the girls, pale in comparison to their details. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs usuall, sound is the toughest to score, since its either really good or really bad. But typically its really good, so my standards are set much higher than what most would probably do. The voice acting is above average considering today's standards. Any female seiyuu these days can pull off moe moe voices very easily. As like all the other music anime before it, its main selling point is the music and how its integrated into the series. Now if you cant stand J-Pop/Rock then I'm sure you will probably drop this series. Unless you're a moe otaku and in that case, you'll watch this show religiously. But for a 13 episode series, they play just the right amount of songs, and they manage not to keep playing the same song over and over to the point of insanity like Kirarin Revolution did with Bararaika. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are, of course, cute and lovable. Their actions and reactions are all spot on scenes of cute humor. And all the jokes about each other are always sure to bring out a chuckle or two. The chemistry is also a very good mix which proves that the standard 4 B's of personalities (brash, bashful, boorish, and benevolent) can never falter for great story telling.\\n\\n\r\nEverything they see, say, and do is just insanely cute. It might not be of that loli persuasion but its all moe that gradually increases its moe powers even more with every episode.  Be that as it may, they are great characters, but they are by no means very original in the character designs. Sadly, I too (as millions of other people have fallen under Mio Akiyama's spell and forced me to give it an 8 out of 10... \"Moe Moe ~Kyuun!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the time I spent watching this show. I never felt like this was a waste of time or anything of the sort. Maybe its because I love school comedies or Mio's ability to bring the whole country of Japan (and the world) to its knees. Regardless, its still fun to watch these girls try to get by and reach their goals together. Its obvious as to why such a simple show is appealing to the masses. It has all the right components and the constant bombardment of moe scenes will defintiely make any moe fan's heart flutter. It defintely has its flaws (in some important places) but since it is so short, you get just enough story progression to enjoy it.",

However, putting aside its massive popularity, how does K-ON the anime fare? Read on and find out.\r\nBefore I start the review there are some important questions you should ask yourself:\r\n1.

Do you hate slice of life animes?\r\n3.Are you looking for an anime with a memorable story?\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you might as well turn around and ignore K-ON!, and save yourself (and the fans of the anime) some rage.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n+ Even though the synopsis talks about girls trying to keep their light music club alive, allow me to say this now...K-ON'S MAIN FOCUS IS NOT ABOUT THE MUSIC. However, this anime is a laid back slice of life anime about the lives of the girls in the club.\\n\r\n+ Despite being ridden with cliche scenarios and episode themes, K-ON manages to achieve a certain level of entertainment which keeps the viewers coming back to it.\\n\\n\r\n- Like I said before, the episode themes are full of cliched scenarios which might bother some.\\n\r\n- Some episodes repeat the same themes, which can make the show look repetitive at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ The character designs are absolutely adorable\\n\r\n+ The animation style is easy to digest and simple on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\n- The animation quality however, can sometimes drop significantly and some times look downright bad.\\n\r\n- A lot of the actual music playing scenes are not show and instead we are given shots of still images. Definitely to save some budget on difficult hand movement animation.\\n\r\n- For the standards set by KyoAni in the past, the animation for K-ON! could be considered rather underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Even though music is not the main focus of the anime, the song gives you quite a bit of nice insert songs which are all very catchy and enjoyable.\\n\r\n+ The Opening and Ending songs are both IMO extremely good.\\n\r\n+ For such a relatively new voice cast, K-ON!'s voice acting is superbly done and is sure to put these seiyuu's on the fast line to popularity.\\n\\n\r\n- The actual BGM soundtrack is nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (don't mind my score...I just love moe and im a fanboy ;_;)\\n\r\n+ Despite being cliched, the characters are just absolutely adorable and loveable.\\n\r\n+ moe, moe, moe, and more moe....thats what these characters are 90% of the time. (and I dont complain)\\n\r\n+ The interactions between the characters provides some very enjoyable comedy and very light and fluffy times. (lol bad joke)\\n\r\n+ Even the supporting cast is extremely likeable and yes....very moe.\\n\\n\r\n- Every character follows a stereotype which has been already overplayed in countless animes.\\n\r\n- If you hate moe, you might DESPISE the characters (most likely lol)\\n\r\n- There is a small unbalance in the amount of screentime and attention given between the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot lie, K-ON! is an anime that one enjoys mostly as a guilty pleasure. This is defiinitely not my favourtie anime to have aired on the Spring 2009 season. But its definitely one of the most enjoyable ones i've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall K-ON! is an anime which is not meant to break any records or set any standards. The anime is not an epic tale, nor is it a comedy gold mine, this anime is just fun...If you want an anime which is just cute to the extreme and just plain fun to watch, then by all means watch K-ON! I am sure it will not disappoint you.",

However, as members of the light music club, great responsibility is put on them. As of episode 4, nothing seriously mind-bending has happened, but the individual characters drives the story forward in their own fashion, rather than some evil villain who pulls all the strings.\r\nArt:\r\nRatherthan making overly complex drawings and animations for a light-hearted series like this, PONY CANYON made the right choice and keeps the drawing simple, filling out the expectations in regards to the theme and mood of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that an anime about music should have more than just the regular \"run off the mill\" music that other series uses. K-ON! does a great job at this, the opening and ending are addictive and stylized while the music they play themselves are rather crisp and somewhat matches what they do in the picture.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, the characters are pushed onto the stage, one by one and they entertain you with nothing more than their own personalities and imagination. It hold together pretty well, especially since the whole lot is a blob of moe.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters are archetypes and only moderately unique in terms of behavior and looks. However, the well-performed voice-acting gives the characters even more traits and distincts them from each other and other generic anime characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, K-ON! is a great series for anyone who enjoys a good laugh, is attracted to moe and doesn't mind the fact that the series is just about a bunch of girls who wants to play music for some reason or another.",

No, I'm not talking about my reality TV show--I mean K-On. \r\nYui, the resident retard-moe, has herself an unfabulous predicament: she needs to join a club. What a coincidence that Moe, the tsundere (i.e. mood swinging bitchy stick in the mud) bassist and her best friend Ritalin the genki drummer have a club that needs members. The light music club. By \"light music\", thinkof that elevator junk you hear in between waiting to get to your floor and wondering who cut the cheeze. So Mio, Ritsu, Yui and the big-brows rich girl Mugi all get together for moe band sessions. Sounds dumb, right? IT IS. But what makes this anime so good then!? \\n\\n\r\nIt does the fabpossible and makes the lives of teenage girls actually INTERESTING. Have you ever been around teenage girls? Gossipy bunch, none as innocent and fun-loving as the keion-bu. Which is why this anime is a work of genius: it's a fantasy! In this fantasy world, it's okay to take the short bus to school like Yui does. It's okay to be a totally frigid buzzkill like Mio because when you got a pair of knockers like those--who cares? This world is full of cake and sparkles...it's almost like the inside of my house.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a lot to be desired, especially Mio who is undeservedly the most popular girl. If anything, I'd rather chillax with my bro Ritsu or score some preemo you know what from Mugi. Chick's loaded. Only Cuba's finest, from her! Hell, I'd hang out with that Christmas cake teacher because death metal chicks are pretty wild anyway. Azunyan makes a good pet, because really...what else is she good for?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has got it all: blobby cute girls who do all kinds of kyun~. It probably is no better than other exploitative sacks of moe crap when you look at it on a surface level. But K-On does something that makes it commendable: it knocks the competition back by being as pandering as possible in a way that WORKS. For using and abusing the system like that, well, I'm mightily impressed. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets a solid nine fabulouses out of ten.",

            "content": "I picked up \"K-On!\" envisioning it as some kind of healing, mundane slice of life in the same vein as \"Aria the Animation\", something nice and gentle that would help soothe my severe withdraw symptoms brought on by finishing \"Hikaru no Go\". Even though on the surface I mostly got what I was looking for (it is mundane, and it is a slice of life), the end product was a huge disappointment. It's a bit like one of those twisted fairy tales in which some greedy guy makes wishes to the devil or a genie or something. Even though his wishes are all granted,fulfilling all the criteria that he specified, none of the result turns out to be what he wanted - there's always something very wrong with what he ends up with.\\n\\n\r\nIt took me a few episodes to figure out what's wrong with \"K-On!\". First of all, it starts off disappointingly dull. I'm one of the most patient of viewers, but even I found my attention wandering frequently, and I kept having to rewind to see what I'd missed - and usually the answer turned out to be \"not very much\". It's rare that I get really bored when watch anime, especially given my fondness for the more mundane slice of life shows, but \"K-On!\" managed to seriously test my patience (it took me half a year to finish).\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I realised something worse - \"K-On!\" is MOE. Not as blatant as \"Clannad\", but still, it's all about cute girls doing cute things for the sake of being cute. It also serves to explain why I found it to be dull, given that I have no interest in watching artificially cute girls doing mundanely cute things, and there isn't much else to be found in the show. I find it interesting to compare \"K-On!\" with \"Aria the Animation\", which is also about cute girls doing cute things. I don't know whether it's because I watched \"Aria the Animation\" before and \"K-On!\" after \"Clannad\", a show that is so moe that it's caused me to develop allergic reactions to anything vaguely resembling cute, but with \"Aria the Animation\", the cuteness seemed more innocent; the natural calming beauty of the settings also made \"Aria the Animation\" less one dimensional, and it just seems to have a charm about it that's severely lacking in \"K-On!\".\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I was unimpressed by \"K-On!\", I must admit that towards the mid-series, the slice of life settings began to work its magic, and I found the series growing on me ever so slightly, I even started finding it mildly amusing and enjoyable at times... and that's when the makers of the show decided the time is ripe to give its targeted audience more of what they want - that is to say, the more obnoxious cliches of anime. Unsatisfied with just having cute, clumsy girls procrastinating over homework and cutely drooling over sweets and \"cakies\", they started rolling out the dreaded maid outfit and the cat ears etc. The already limited quality of the series took a dip and sunk to a new low as the girls started spending a lot of time inflicting these the disturbing costumes and distasteful accessories on one another. Obviously, the shy characters would meow pitifully as they are victimised, but of course at the same time they also show signs that a part of them is secretly enjoying the experience. Yes, of course they like it deep down - they're moe blobs after all! Anyway I'm sure you get the picture, so lets move swiftly on...\\n\\n\r\nThough \"K-On!\" is about a music club, they do so little music-related activity that it's easy to mistake it for something else (like, a show about a cake eating club, for example). When it comes to the subject of music, the series is the antithesis of \"Nodame Cantabile\". The latter emphasises the importance of hard work even when the musician is already ridiculously talented. In \"K-On!\", however, we have Yui, someone who'd never played an instrument before, but who very quickly started reproducing face melting solos she hears with apparent ease, and is able to immediately master the techniques demonstrated to her. And she does all of this with just a small amount of casual and unmethodic practice. As I am also learning to play an instrument, this complete undermining of the effort required really doesn't sit well with me. I know it's not supposed to be very focused on the music, but come on, they could have at least made *some* attempt to make it seem less like a piece of cake!\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin actually came when \"K-On!\" tried to do some character development in an episode towards the end of the series. For the first half of that episode, I was bewildered because the characters were acting quite strangely. Then I realised what the episode was trying to achieve - it was going out of its way to create a rift between a couple of characters in order to set up a kiss-and-make-up scenario. Upon realising this, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the fact that they botched up the attempt so badly that it reached a painful level of transparency. Perhaps the makers were better off keeping things simple and sticking to pandering to the moe crowd as they're clearly incapable to doing anything more substantial\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, \"K-On!\" is an interesting specimen for being a slice of life without a soul. Compared to, say, \"Azumanga Daioh\", which is not a slice of life (yes I know it revolves around mundane things, but it's clearly very comedy inclined and not too concerned about being down to earth), but radiated that pleasant warmth associated with a good slice of life, I can barely feel anything in \"K-On!\", and I certainly don't have any fondness for any of the characters. Something feels fundamentally wrong with the series - the creepy elements dispels any sense of innocence and charm it might otherwise have had, and once you strip away those elements, what's left is disturbingly hollow. Perhaps I'm being overly harsh on an anime that I consider mediocre, and sure there are anime out there that are a lot worse (like \"Clannad\"), but I guess I'm feeling rather grumpy that \"K-On\" shattered my naively comforting delusion that slice of life shows can't be anything short of pleasant. \\n",

            "content": "Before I begin this review it must be noted that I am not a moe hater. Shows centralized on moe are fine so long as it succeeds at its task. What is not fine is a show that is completely false advertising.\r\nComing into K-ON! you would expect to see a show about girls getting into a band and watch them enjoy the experience of learning to play music. While we don't exactly expect for them to get all that dramatic or serious all the time, it's still nice to see the struggles of learning to play music, the effort it takes to get good, andto get the overall culture of it as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what I did see was none of this at all. Much like many other poorly made animes on hobbies and sports, K-ON! did an immense disservice in portraying what it means to be in a band. The dedication, hard work, the love for music, the love for the culture of music, and even the simple know-how of instrument playing was completely nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nAs a viewer, I find this very dissatisfying. Are we to sit here and really believe that characters like Yui can sit around slacking, eating cake, and hardly practicing at all with almost no knowledge can suddenly be this guitar genius on a concert stage playing these songs perfectly? Even as far as musical geniuses go, there was a lot of hard work and toil and passion put into their craft.\\n\\n\r\nBut fine. Clearly this anime never intended to be BECK with moe, so it's fine to adjust our perception of this anime begrudgingly so. However, even for an anime centralized around moe, or more specifically for this show \"cute girls doing cute things,\" the show was hardly entertaining. Ignoring the fact that the characters for me were just utterly dull or annoying, the activities and antics of the girls were not really amusing.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that is 1 cour does need two cliche \"beach\" episodes. Eating sweets the entire show was not \"cute,\" and really the characters hardly lended themselves to being likable due to their utter lack of depth. None of them seem to be anything but 2 dimensional the entire show's run.\\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a distinction between moe shows with depth and subtle complexities and shows like this, which is essentially moe blobs without soul or substance. This compounded with the fact that is false advertising created a horrible viewing experience for myself. If you were looking for a show that was in any way supposed to be about a nice group of girls truly learning the experience of a musical band, this is probably not for you. If however you are satisfied with looking at what you see is cute animated moving images of cute girls doing mundane tasks, then enjoy it as you would like.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say that this show neither succeeds at being a being an anime about music nor at being a moe show, which I would call a complete derailment of what this show is both advertised and presented as.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is a slice of life show and I really mean they just take a slice out of anything they find amusing (which I probably didn't) and put it in the show. A day in the life of a high school girl who happens to be in the light music club. Some of these \"slices\" though tend to lead to very boring and I mean boring episodes. I think I was asleep half of the season watching thiswhich is good because I had more energy then when I think about it. Then they throw in some moeness. How much of it. Constantly. Yup...I mean every episode is a freaking moe blob. I don't hate or love moe, but geezuz guys can you easy up on it for a bit. I'm not Takanashi from Working! here. So for story? A pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nHmmm. At first I thought it was decent, but when I further look at it was pretty mediocre. That fuzziness effect they try to do when moving around is, in my opinion, just lazy animation. It really takes away from what other wise could be some decent artwork. Not to mention the fact that we are constantly bombarded with chibi and moe images. After a while it just plains get you so pissed off you want to step on some ants.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThere were some catchy songs in this show, which is a nice touch for a band/slice of life type of show, but it just isn't good enough to save it from utter crapness of the rest of the show. I give it a decent 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nDreadful. None of them have character. They are so predictable and boring, no wonder no guys are in this show, none of them would like these idiots. Just think of them as Kim Kardashian clones without the hot body, that's what the characters of K-on are like. A give it a 2. At least a couple times I laughed...a couple...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nWhen I finished this show, I just kind of stood there and thought to myself. Is that it? Is this what people were raving about how \"cool it was. blah blah.\"  I think I need to bang my head against a wall a few times to see what these raving reviews see, because frankly, I don't see it. K-On to put it simply, is stupid. Hell it's even worse than the harem anime types or those old 15 fps animes that bombard you with violence...and to think I thought the 2nd season would be better. It was the same lame jokes, characters, etc. GOD almighty help us. K-On is crap. Let us pray there isn't a 3rd season.",

Does anyone even know the story of this show, anyone?! No, well thats awkward. K-on, the show that has cute ass girl who drink tea, eat and have fun.....and play music. Not really but you could put that in a sense. What is this show about and the point of it? Absolutely nothing, but not in a bad way. This is that type of moe-show thats there in case you wanna sit down and relax, it isn't a show that keeps you on yourfeet, you could close your eyes and still at least enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nThe story as I said, there's none, so these 4 girls have formed a group known as the 'Light Music Club' , their goal is to just have fun and play music I guess. And thats it, we get introduced to a childhood friend, a music teacher with marriage issues and no male character like any where. Only in like one scene, well thats sexist for men. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole point here is that K-on dosen't need a story, its cast should keep you going for 13 episodes, the story is just there to tell you whats going on. Its just a show where girls wanna have fun, nothing more than that. And if you don't like that, there's millions of other moe-anime waiting for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is nice, it suits the show really well, its filled with vibrant and calm colours to let you explore, it shows k-on's world is like a world that has world-peace.....only in an anime world kids!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty damn catchy same with the ED, they really make you hope you get more music like that through the show, but nope, just some tea, well hey at least we have some music here and there....oh wait we get like 2 songs. One generic japanese moe-song and a good attempt at a girly song that does well. Thats all for the music, for a show mainly on the aspect of music, its dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe chracters are pretty cliche here, you have a light headed girl who's rich (Mugi), the shy-ass girl (Mio), the strong-independent girl (Ritsu), the 'kawaii' girl thats there just to be cute (Azusa) and a retard (Yui). \\n\\n\r\nEach have their own traits but not too much special, its the characters you'd expect in a moe-anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nNow this is the reason I actually continued this show, the show is so damn cute, and there's downright moments that kill make you either go AWW! or just nosebleed, literally.  This is really the point of this show, its fluffy and cute. There's some jokes here and there but they don't make you really laugh, they miight make you chuckle but thats really it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nK-on is a cute and relaxing show in case you need a break after watching something long as hell and terrible, if you're bored or depressed, this show should make you feel all better. Girls just wanna have fun, that is k-on in a nutshell.",

            "content": "Having spent most of my summer engulfed in the world of engineering, I figured a series based on music would be a great distraction. Tack on some hyper-energetic high school girls and a slice-of-life setting, and K-On\u2019s light-hearted charm naturally piqued my interest.\r\nThis premise is undoubtedly what makes K-On so captivating. As a whole, the show never attempts to step beyond its means; it sets itself out to be simple fun and undoubtedly succeeds. Despite operating off a number of base gags and jokes that find themselves revisited from episode to episode, the series never seems to drag. Ultimately, the musical aspect of the show,while central, pales in comparison to the harmonious play of the characters, and serves primarily as a catalyst to move the story along \u2013 the music does not shape the girls, but rather the girls shape the music. I admit this might disappoint some viewers, but it provides K-On with more universal appeal; though it refrains from excelling in any one genre, it dabbles in several quite well, and manages to juggle humor, drama, and music without any sign of awkwardness.\\n\r\nFrom air-headed Yui to feisty Ritsu to feminine Mio to whimsical Tsumugi, the cast certainly can\u2019t make any claims to originality. In fact, the series sticks so hard to the tried-and-true formula of slice-of-life comedy that its sole claim to uniqueness stems from its inclusion of music as a focal point. While the characters feel like largely recycled archetypes, great lengths are taken to flesh them out to be as endearing as possible. In this way, the series seems \u2013 in a strange manner \u2013 both fresh and vivacious, and manages to fill its thirteen episode span without much tedium. Just as the antics begin to slip into monotony, the anime comes to a close, wrapping up its finale with an expected, but very fitting, encor\\n\r\nK-On certainly branches out from Kyoto Animation\u2019s standard fare, as although the animation works well for a \u201ccutesy\u201d feel, the level of detail is noticeably poorer. A number of menially important scenes feel washed over in quality, and make the visual production seem rushed. Still, as a whole, the animation generally works well in that it aptly captures the girls\u2019 cheery enthusiasm. Motion and framerates are as crisp as ever, so where the show lacks detail, it makes up for it with raw energy.\\n\r\nJapanese bands should really stop writing English lyrics into their songs. Sure \u201clazy\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d might rhyme, but rhyming does not a coherent sentence make. Anyway, aside from that little quip, I can\u2019t think of anything much to say about the music other than that it\u2019s catchy. All the band\u2019s insert songs make you bob your head along with the beat, and the opening theme delivers the free-spirited feel that pervades the entire series. With solid voice acting to boot, the audible aspects of the show play out in much the same way as the visuals: they don\u2019t break any new ground, but they do their job well.    \\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the story section, K-On\u2019s cast is remarkably unremarkable. Though they all do a fantastic job at connecting with the viewer, they fit the archetypal mold too snugly for my liking.  While I found their interplay fun and amusing to watch, I could never shake the sensation that I\u2019d seen this material before but with different faces. Unlike the truly successful comedies such as Fumoffu! and Minami-ke their characters flaunt no memorable twists, which leaves them simply as good. Still, the musical premise gives the series enough edge to allow much of this to be overlooked, as the band environment adds sufficient flavor story-wise to draw the viewer into their experience. In the end, the characters are little more than a bunch of ordinary high school girls getting together to do what they enjoy, and perhaps their largely generic feel is what gives them such overarching charm.\\n\r\nThough K-On is certainly not Kyoto Animation\u2019s best work, it passes the acceptability test by a wide margin. While lacking the originality and flair that have defined the studio\u2019s previous works, the series manages to be entertaining regardless and avoids making any glaring faults. At thirteen episodes in length, K-On makes a point not to overstay its welcome; it\u2019s fun, amusing, and enjoyable for its span, and can easily find its way onto the shelves of fans of many different genres.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nK-ON! is a slice of life anime with no real story. Its about the day to day lives of cliche moe characters that form a band and do everything BUT actually play music.......for the most part.\r\nThe majority of the time is wasted with the characters eating cake and talking about a bunch of random nonsense that isn't delivered as good as in anime like Lucky Star, neither is it as funny, and it gets old pretty fast. The final episode (12 or 13 doesn't really matter what you consider the final) is pretty anti-climatic (like most slice of life series) and just leaves muchto be desired. What a proper ending for a moe, high school girl, slice-of-life anime be like.....I dunno. A graduation?\\n\\n\r\nSince its KyoAni after the OVA you wont see any more K-ON! for a long time so you know this will never get any real closure. Not that these kinds of animes are about that .....but still...\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nAs usual KyoAni does a solid job. The backgrounds looks nice, the food (which gets tons of airtime =P) looks delicious, and all the little things are detailed with extra characters all looking different with actual faces. :O\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is either love or hate is those damn blank eyed gooey faces. I cant really explain but when ever they do or say something stupid there's an equally stupid or ugly face to go along with it. Ive seen it before obviously but they spam them in the anime and it gets a bit disgusting instead of cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nWhat I found the most disappointing about K-ON! was that this anime, which is about music,has such a weak soundtrack. This is short and simple. The OP was terrible and cringe worthy. The ED was surprisingly decent I'll admit. But none of the insert songs are memorable. They also come off as korny and cringe worthy. Yes I know moe moe kyun anime or whatever but Haruhi and her God Knows performance was epic and a really good song on its own. The same can't be said for any of the music in K-ON!\\n\r\nThe Seiyu were pretty solid throughout but some annoying voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nThe cast is all cliche female moe characters. Rather than explain em all all I'll just say none of them are interesting. You have definitely seen them in tons of different anime already. Im not against moe or anything like that I do enjoy it. But this is just overload and rather than be cute its annoying. Yui and her stupidity and clumsiness isn't cute its stupid and annoying. Mio and her scaredy cat attitude isn't cute its annoying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nK-ON! is certainly enjoyable but in small doses. I pretty much rushed through the series to get it over with and move on to something new since I originally planned on watching it during its airing schedule. Its not a good anime but its not a terrible anime. Its just there and if you're hungry for moe this is good to satisfy you as long as you take small bites. (Watch 1, 2 eps a week) Running through it will definitely bore you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6  (Fair!)\\n\r\nPretty much explained in Enjoyment. Not good not terrible.",

            "content": "A lot of criticism surrounds K-ON! It is usually based on that it supposedly doesn't deliver what it should. Well I'm going to say that's all rubbish. What makes K-ON! stand out is simple: It's refreshing. (A word I will be using a lot in this review)\r\nThe story is great for providing that breath of fresh air not found in similar programs. The moe aspects are what makes this a really nice watch, and the humour on top is even better. You shouldn't be disappointed because it's going to put a smile to your face. Unless... Unless you were hoping K-ON! was going to bemore music based. Sadly it isn't and I'll be honest I was looking for more of the band playing. There are only 2 real performances in the series comprising of 13 episodes. There should have been more of a focus on the music aspect, but what you get is good enough to keep you happy. The refreshing nature of the story keeps you from wondering if it would have been better if it was more music orientated.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching K-ON! I was worried that the instruments used would be unliscensed rubbish. How wrong I was. There is so much attention to detail in the guitars, the amps etc. that they make everything look basic. That isn't the case though, character design is fantastic, they all look unique, and the setting used (the school) is refreshing. It really made me happy that Kyoto Animation took the time to make the focal point of K-ON! really eye catching. It is worth watching if you are a music fan to embrace the detail used. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used in K-ON! is outstanding. The opening theme is refreshing, the ending theme fun. They are described as the \"Light Cusic Club\" but this isn't the most accurate western reflection of the term \"light.\" The songs featured in K-ON! is out and out rock and I could not help headbanging a little. It doesn't seem refreshing but when it's all said and done I was very happy at the end of them playing. The voices of the characters suit so well I can't think of anything that matches. The shy but strong Mio who is the most moe of the characters has a voice that really befits how she acts in situations. The bombastic Ritsu has a match made in heaven voice. If it weren't for the voice acting, the relationship between Ritsu and Mio wouldn't seem right. As for the rest of the characters, they have been acted very well on most parts. Some of the minor characters are satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are great. I love the contrast between them all. Yui, Mugi, Ritsu, Mio and Asuza all have a uniqueness which is refreshing when they sit around the table while drinking tea and stuffing cake. It enables for varying discussion, which is again, refreshing. (I told I would use it a lot) It's great they paid so much attention to detail to make sure that what each character does reflects not only their personality, but their design. I mean, it would be weird for Mugi to be the dumb one, because she doesn't look dumb, there are other characters for that job. This is something I'm glad of. It makes critics look like they were watching something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I'm going to correct the critics. K-ON! DOES deliver what it should! It delivers the refreshing day to day activities of a group of girls, which puts a smile on your face. It is thoroughly enjoyable for it offers unique story, design, and sound which you can enjoy. However I have to look at both sides and agree that a lot will be disappointed by the lack of focus on the music, as some would perceive K-ON! as something that sets out to be purely something dedicated to music. Even so, you'll still enjoy the music that is offered, even if it might not be as much as a lot would want. K-ON! is unique in the slice-of-life/moe genre, and that is what makes it: Refreshing! 9/10",

            "content": "There are anime that build a huge hype around them and turn out below average. Then, there are anime that do the same but they still manage to meet expectations of their fans. Which group does K-On! belong to? In a way, both. While it completely manages to please fans of slice-of-life and comedy manga, even some people that love K-On! admit that nothing actually happens in it. That\u2019s where people that like their anime with plot facewall to oblivion. \r\nStory:  1/10\r\nWhy such low rating? Because there is nothing to rate. The only signs of story were at the very beginning and even thenit was way below average. Basically, the story is that a new girl, Yui, joins Light music club but can\u2019t do music. Of course, that she is wholeheartly accepted into the club. Why not after all? What would be musicians doing in a music club? Another plot happens, about in the middle, when another girl, Azusa, but this time she can play guitar, joins. That\u2019s it, say bye bye to plot. All they do is drink tea\u2026 when they actually do something.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nArt, the only good thing about K-On! yet it\u2019s probably where people divide into fans and haters. Simple reason, you either love it or hate it. Art, just like everything else, is played for laughs. Deformed characters are in every episode and design is something between a moe loli and Voldemort.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1/10\\n\r\nDO NOT go into this expecting an anime based on music. Even though it wants you to believe it is, it isn\u2019t. Practice is very rare to see here and even if it happens most of it is just pointless jamming. Concerts are even rarer (2 in the whole season) and, again, they\u2019re played for laughs so they\u2019re about stage fright (driven into dumb extremes), songs a 5 year old would write (no kidding), the \u201cgroup\u201d being anything but in-tune, etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nI hate it when people rage over a show and ignore its good points because they dislike it. Characters were the strongest point of K-On! after art. There aren\u2019t many and while some are similar they still manage to keep their diversity both in nature and looks. However, don\u2019t expect any character development or any characters that would serve other purpose than comic relief. The cast is full of stupid, hypocritical, useless and annoying characters that would be hated until the end of time if they were in a different kind of anime. However, they still have a charm to them and a very strong moe factor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\r\nEven though I have sort of mainstream sense of humour (most of the mainsream anime make me laugh easily), I couldn\u2019t even smile at any of jokes here. Humour is mostly based on a stupidity or awkwardness of a character. Like inteligent jokes? Keep away from this as far as possible. The only reaction I had to these \u201cjokes\u201d was staring at it with my jaw dropped wondering whether it was supposed to be funny or show the characters\u2019 idiocy. I watched this because of boredom and I believed it would get better eventually. It didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nTo me, enjoyment, plot and characters make most of the rating, in that order, so art could be perfect and it still would get low rating. (I found the art stupid so it wouldn\u2019t help much anyway) I didn\u2019t enjoy the series but you might. The only thing you should ask yourself if you have a lot of time on your hands and if you enjoy watching moe characters drinking tea. If so, by all means watch this. If not, maybe you should try something else.",

            "content": "Based on the 2 episodes so far...this show can be summed up in 10 words :\r\nLucky Star without the otaku reference and with music instruments.\r\nFor a more in-depth look, read on.\r\nStory\r\nWell...its about 4 girls joining the light music club hoping to start a band of their own and perform in front of a sold out audience (presumably). There is a plot here (somewhat) unlike Lucky Star, but that plot is loose and gets diverted at certain times. In a nutshell, the plot will be followed loosely so if you want a powerful story, you ain't getting one.\r\nArt\r\nThe art is appropriate for this kind of show.Its not mind-blowing nor is it mind-numbing. Simply put, it fits the show and thats all it needs to do.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMOST. AWESOME. ENDING. SONG. EVER. The opening is good as well, but man, the ending is just addictive. Based on the 2 themes itself, the sound is damn good. It'll be promising should other songs be as good as these two in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nStandard Lucky Star character archetypes are used here. The four girls in K-on are basically the four girls from Lucky Star in a different paint. \\n\\n\r\nTechnically :\\n\r\nRitsu ----> Konata\\n\r\nMio  -----> Kagami (with a slightly diminished tsundere attitude)\\n\r\nTsumugi ----> Miyuki (without the megane)\\n\r\nYui ----> Tsukasa\\n\\n\r\nIts obvious after the first episode...so listing it down doesn't really spoil anything. (If you have never watched Lucky Star, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about anyway)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhat made me enjoy K-On more than Lucky Star is this :\\n\r\nIt doesn't have a crap pilot episode.\\n\\n\r\nK-On doesn't open with a 10 minute long discussion of food so it doesn't bore in the first scene itself.  As its just 2 episodes, its pretty darn amusing to see the girls try to form their band\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you like Lucky Star, you'll sorta like this. If you hated Lucky Star, you should give it a shot anyway, since its better than Lucky Star (yeah,flame me later). I have hopes on this show, and hopefully...it doesn't disappoint.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: Minor Spoilers mentioned.\r\nI'm just going to say this straight away: These kind of animes bring out the silly little girl in me. And as I'm a 19-year old guy, it's kind of an unexpected thing, even for me. And I mean this in the most positive way possible.\r\n\"K-On!\" follows the story of Hirasawa Yui, a girl who lives a life similar to your average person on the net, except for the internet part. It's difficult to explain without using the words \"carefree\" and \"lazy\". In a way, she probably reflects a majority of people I know, including myself, except for the fact shedoesn't really have any real life issues other than school. This changes however when she decides to join the Light Music Club, where she now has to learn and play guitar. We also got 3 other characters that will be focused on: Ritsu (drummer), Mio (bass), Tsumugi (keyboard), followed by another one half-way through the first season, namely Azusa (guitar). Inbetween their \"goal\" to reach fame, they have a few concerts and a lot of fun. Quite lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is memorable, but unoriginal and consisting mostly of filler to build character. However, I myself don't consider this to be a bad thing at all. With animes like this one, filler is what pretty much drives it, and I love every single minute of it. Each episode being just as silly, and if not even sillier than the other. Although it doesn't beat Lucky Star, but if you've seen that, you know that's a difficult thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself is great and quite catchy, but I'm not a big fan of Yui's singing. I know this might piss some people off, but hey, it's my opinion, and I prefer Mio on the mic anytime. The first ED is in this case also my favorite song in the anime, \"Don't Say Lazy\". The instrumentals are great, although not that original, but still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is cute and silly, and like I said before, combined with cute voices I often find myself randomly squeeing simply because of how cute it is. If it didn't have that factor, I would be far less interested in this anime. There are animes for all kinds of people, be it sci-fi, action, romance, drama, adventure, etc. But for me, comedies are my thing because they distract me from how stupid life can be from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are a lot of fun, and very different in personality. We got Yui who, as we know, is carefree and quite lazy, and tends to be awkward on the weirdest of times, but in a cute way. Then, we have Mio, who's pretty much the opposite of Yui, shy and easily scared. Ritsu is energetic and a bit of a devil when it comes to pranks, especially aimed at Mio as they are childhood friends. Tsumugi, who's not as energetic as Ritsu, but still enjoys the little things in life, and she's also the \"rich kid\" as you may call her, but thankfully you won't notice that in this anime. And later on we get Azusa, a very serious junior girl, but also easily distracted and really silly at times.\\n\r\nAll the characters share one thing: They're happy high school students who like to play music. The bond they have is emphasized in the anime, as each episode tries not to leave anyone out. And once again, that's one of the things I love about it.\\n\\n\r\n\"K-ON!\" is not for everyone, but if you like cute and silly characters with a cute and silly story, then I definitely recommend giving it a shot. Just don't expect any real seriousness, except for when they prepare for concerts. For me, it's a proper balance of a funny story, with funny characters and fun music. It's definitely not original, but as long as it's executed properly, it doesn't have to be, as long as it's fun. And yeah, like I said pretty much a million times... This anime sure is!",

            "content": "If K-ON! is the future of slice-of-life moe anime, then the genre is dying. Now, I myself am personally a great fan of the niche genre and have delighted in viewing many anime falling under it, no matter how silly or inane. That's because I don't mind having to turn off my brain to enjoy anime, but I expect to be compensated for doing so, be it by making me laugh, warming my heart, or leaving me with something to remember. K-ON! splendidly failed in all three ways multiple times throughout, and came off as a shoddy effort all around.\r\nBecause a slice-of-life moe series isoften devoid of any ongoing plot of significant importance, it must rely on the day-to-day circumstances of the characters, presenting them in new and inventive, yet somewhat familiar ways in order to keep attention. Surprisingly enough, K-ON! follows a linear, though loosely connected story, but does nothing of interest with the day-to-day circumstances. It's as if the staff decided that it was okay for the girls to be lazy and uneventful because it's slice-of-life, to which I must say \"NO NO NO\"... had to get that out of the way. I'll be serious now.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters need to be interesting enough to actively engage in following their exploits. Harsh as it may be to say, it was a waste of time to follow around a main character like Yui. I could rant for hours on end about Yui, but to sum her up, she's a mentally challenged nutcase. Now, I can excuse character stupidity as long as the main character has qualities that redeem said stupidity, be it fierce independence, reliability, or if it's made clear she's meant to be the butt of everyone's joke. Yui has none of these qualities. She is an idiot, and no one ever discourages her from being an idiot. Minor spoiler alert, but it must be said... I am absolutely furious at the gall the staff had to have Yui comment in Ep. 12 about how much she has changed. In the entire series, she does not grow even a little. What a crock.\\n\\n\r\nEnough about Yui though, there are other characters to focus on; all of who range from average to above-average. They're all likeable too, but far too simplistic. With no real inventiveness to the situations they end up in as previously stated, I had expected their personalities to be clever enough to make up for that lack. In this, the staff succeeds to a degree, but nothing comes from it. Everyone is essentially the same at the beginning as they are at the end and there is very little proof that any of them have grown as friends, regardless of what the series wants us to believe.\\n\\n\r\nIn the matter of technical aspects, K-ON!'s fluidity is remarkable but the style is such that it comes off incredibly choppy, and at some points downright ugly. It felt as though Kyoto Animation spent a ton on making it fluid and in doing so, took from the budget that allowed for the actual artwork itself, excusing the instruments which often look better than the girls themselves. While this tradeoff doesn't work entirely, it could be far worse. In addition, because this tradeoff comes from animation maestro Kyoto Animation, it is doubly worse.\\n\\n\r\nThough this is a show about a music club, the BGM is boring. Thankfully, a killer OP/ED combo and some fantastic inserts make up for that. On the acting front,the amateur seiyuu all sound like younger versions of already successful seiyuu, like how Mio's seiyuu Yoko Hirasa sounds not-too-surprisingly like a younger Aya Hirano. This isn't to criticize their talents, though. The fact that these newcomers are so lively and fits their character perfectly from the start is a compliment, one of the few I have given the series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all of the above, K-ON! to me came off as a cheap way for Kyoto Animation and Pony Canyon to make money. There is little effort, the characters are rather flat and unchanging, and everything in the news about it from merchandise tie-ins to Oricon charts leads me to believe it's one giant marketing ploy rather than an honest effort of a series. For this, I cannot say I enjoyed all of it, though it was good sporadically. However, as I said in the beginning, if these shoddy attempts at slice-of-life moe are what we as anime viewers choose to support and demand more of, we are killing the genre as we speak.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give K-ON! a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "This review is going to be broken down into the 5 parts that MAL focuses on with each section getting critiqued.\r\nStory:\r\nAs you know by the description on the anime's page, K-on is suppose to be about Yui Hirasawa and joining of saving of her high school's light music club, with the problem being that Yui has never read music or knows how to play a guitar. Slowly a few of these problems get cleared up but the main bulk of the plot goes no where whatsoever. You can come in at any episode and still get what's going. The anime is heavy on the theme\"light and fluffy.\" to which when watching it you don't have to know anything nor necessarily be there the entire episode to know what is going to happen and that's the main problem, like every other \"moe\" anime it's generic and predictable in the events category.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is probably the biggest problem with the show in my opinion, the art. Seriously I can guarantee you that the studio used a step by step handbook and stencil set to create yui, mio, ristu and mugi, it's what is seriously killing the industry today in my opinion...generic characters. There is nothing that makes any one character in K-on stand out. The backgrounds themselves are nothing to praise about either as they are the standard school, bustling street/shop and from time to time inside one of the girls home scenes. To sum it up the art lacks originality and there is no direction for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is probably the only place that K-on climbs up outta the rubbish category. The times that you hear music made by the club it's actually not that bad and can be catchy at times, and with it's suppose plot revolving around music you'd think to hear it a lot but it's quite the opposite, the girls spend more time sitting around being airheads then trying to do anything music related.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat can I say,all of the characters of K-on have traits that superficial. They all are generic and no one has anything that makes them unique or stand out. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAfter watching 13 episodes, I can say overall the enjoyment was just another thing including original art and characters that the show was missing...I mean it was boring and painful as well as predictable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nK-on is a light and fluffy fan service anime to which it hosts no original art and set of characters. If your looking for something to which you don't need to think or understand maybe you'd enjoy k-on but even then your going to have to endure lackluster scenes of boring pointless conversations to which watching windows screen saver can provide more enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "K-ON! is inconsequential fluff. One might compare it to popcorn or cotton candy: a tasty treat, but if you're looking for a meal, it will leave you looking for something more substantial after it's done.\r\nK-ON! follows the tried and true formula of cute girls doing cute things. Based on a 4-koma comic, the series is about several high school girls who form (technically join, but all the previous members graduated) a light music club and follows their activities. The music itself often takes a back seat to the antics of the girls, and audiophiles may find themselves somewhat disappointed if they go in expecting detailedattention to techniques or references to real life bands (there are a couple, but few and far between). There are two concerts in the thirteen episode series, but neither is as impressive as the one from the Live A Live episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (one of Kyoto Animation's earlier shows), but still very enjoyable. The most common scene in the series features the main girls sitting in the club room snacking on tea and cakes while discussing various mundane events, particularly with the more dedicated girls trying to get the rest to practice.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all have their own distinct personality. Yui, the main character, is the some clumsy and adorable airhead. She joined the club hoping to play an easy instrument like the castanets but ends up playing guitar because the club needed a guitarist. Ritsu is the energetic idiot of the show, drummer, and club president because she was the one who dragged everyone else into the club. Mio is Ritsu's long time friend, and the sensible, serious one of the group. She writes the groups songs, and plays the bass. She is also the most moe character, being the prettiest, easily embarrassed, and terrified of ghosts and yucky things. Mugi is the pianist. She comes from a wealthy family, and thus is a source of amusement by displaying the difference in wealth between rich people and normal people. She is also the provider of the tea and sweets that are regularly consumed at the club meetings. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few regular minor characters, too. Ui is Yui's younger, but more mature and reliable sister. Yui has a friend named Nodoka who joins the student council, which means her role is essentially to let everyone know that Ritsu has forgotten something regarding paperwork for the club. Sawako is a music teacher who is recruited as the club adviser in one of the more memorable scenes of the series. Also, a late addition to the cast is Azusa, an underclassman who is much like a miniature version of Mio.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are generally cute, with the kind of big round faces typical of most Kyoto Animation works. Background art is consistently good, as is the animation, which should come as no surprise. When characters are shown playing their instruments, there is generally more attention to detail than seen in anime to the point where the sound properly matches the characters actions. The singing at the concert features the same style animation as Live A Live, where you can just about lip read the lyrics (if you know Japanese, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the series can generally be described as light and fluffy, both the background music and the couple of songs the girls play at their concerts, with the exception of the closer, which rocks a little bit harder than rest. The voice acting fits well all around, with Yui being notable for regularly coming off as someone who isn't all there, fitting her character well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to close saying this show is like Azumanga Daioh with a music club, but that's about the easiest comparison I can make, and not too far off a description.",

            "content": ":::QUICKVIEW:::\r\nStory: 5 ( It almost feels like the show has a bad case of A.D.D. when it skips the important stuff. Trust me, they do it ALOT.) \r\nArt: 7 (I believe most of the time and effort and money went in to replicating the girls instruments with their real life counterparts.) \r\nSound: 9 - (If you hate j-pop/rock, feel free to deduct 3 points)\r\nCharacter: 8  (one phrase: Moe moe~ Kyu!, deduct 6 points if you hate moe)\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Its obvious as to why such a short and simple show is so appealing to the masses)\r\nOverall: 38/50 points = 7.6 ~ 8.0 (or 4.0 ifyou're expecting something unique)\\n\r\n...regardless its another pop culture hit in japan. Might as well ride the HYPE train and see WTF this show is all about. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n::FULL REVIEW::\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhat do you get when you add four cute girlfriends with the desire to form a music band, situational comedy, and every style of moe an otaku can think of? You get K-On! (or kei-on-bu). Just of a group of girls trying to follow their dreams... sounds very cliche' doesn't it? Well it is and this show oozes cliche'. The setting to the sitcom all the way down to the catch phrase onomatopoeia's  like kyuun and hyaan. It's very obvious from the start of episode 1, that the story isn't trying to mess with the success of current trends and tries its very best to run with whats popular with the anime crowd. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the set of stories set through each episode are not terrible by any stretch. Its just very \"same old same old.\" If you watch this you'll quickly recognize if you love it hate it after about two episodes. As for me, I love it but can't really feel attached to the storyline considering the amount of parts that are skipped. It almost feels like the show has a bad case of A.D.D. when it skips the important stuff. Trust me, they do it ALOT.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art direction has its high points and its low points, but overall the art can't go a little higher than mediocre. Just observe the op/ed theme songs for the show. Typically, the theme songs have higher production values than the actual show itself. They are indeed better artistically, but it still looks very low quality. Another areas that i could not help but notice in the artwork would be the disproportionate loli scenes and the spaces between their hands. You'll see what I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nI can't turn down the entire art direction down though, as the style does reflect the manga quite accurately most of the time. But I believe most of the time and effort (and probably money) went in to replicating the girls instruments with their real life counterparts. Mio's vintage lefty Fender-Japan JB62/3TS, Ritsu's Yamaha Hipgig JK6F46MK, Tsumugi's Korg TR76 (which is ~$1300), and Yui's VINTAGE Gibson Les Paul Standard Guitar, are all represented with great painstaking detail. The honey burst colors of the bass and standard guitars, the indentations on the Zildjan cymbals, even the correct amount of knobs and switches on the various Marshall amps (usually the JCM900 is shown the most). They even go far as to showcase even more instrument types throughout various locations like the Sonor Delite Stage 1 drum set in one of the girls summer home. Sadly, the instruments are just mere props that aren't shown in action very often as one would hope in a music-themed anime. But when they are in display, everything else, including the girls, pale in comparison to their details. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs usuall, sound is the toughest to score, since its either really good or really bad. But typically its really good, so my standards are set much higher than what most would probably do. The voice acting is above average considering today's standards. Any female seiyuu these days can pull off moe moe voices very easily. As like all the other music anime before it, its main selling point is the music and how its integrated into the series. Now if you cant stand J-Pop/Rock then I'm sure you will probably drop this series. Unless you're a moe otaku and in that case, you'll watch this show religiously. But for a 13 episode series, they play just the right amount of songs, and they manage not to keep playing the same song over and over to the point of insanity like Kirarin Revolution did with Bararaika. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are, of course, cute and lovable. Their actions and reactions are all spot on scenes of cute humor. And all the jokes about each other are always sure to bring out a chuckle or two. The chemistry is also a very good mix which proves that the standard 4 B's of personalities (brash, bashful, boorish, and benevolent) can never falter for great story telling.\\n\\n\r\nEverything they see, say, and do is just insanely cute. It might not be of that loli persuasion but its all moe that gradually increases its moe powers even more with every episode.  Be that as it may, they are great characters, but they are by no means very original in the character designs. Sadly, I too (as millions of other people have fallen under Mio Akiyama's spell and forced me to give it an 8 out of 10... \"Moe Moe ~Kyuun!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the time I spent watching this show. I never felt like this was a waste of time or anything of the sort. Maybe its because I love school comedies or Mio's ability to bring the whole country of Japan (and the world) to its knees. Regardless, its still fun to watch these girls try to get by and reach their goals together. Its obvious as to why such a simple show is appealing to the masses. It has all the right components and the constant bombardment of moe scenes will defintiely make any moe fan's heart flutter. It defintely has its flaws (in some important places) but since it is so short, you get just enough story progression to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Time and time again, Kyoto Animation has gained the hearts of the people and has quickly become a company that seems to turn whatever they animate into an instant cultural frenzy. For K-ON! this is no different. Based on a 4koma manga by Kakifly, K-ON! went from practically unknown to massive super hit in only a matter of days. However, putting aside its massive popularity, how does K-ON the anime fare? Read on and find out.\r\nBefore I start the review there are some important questions you should ask yourself:\r\n1. Do you hate animes with extreme amounts of moe?\r\n2. Do you hate slice of life animes?\r\n3.Are you looking for an anime with a memorable story?\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you might as well turn around and ignore K-ON!, and save yourself (and the fans of the anime) some rage.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n+ Even though the synopsis talks about girls trying to keep their light music club alive, allow me to say this now...K-ON'S MAIN FOCUS IS NOT ABOUT THE MUSIC. However, this anime is a laid back slice of life anime about the lives of the girls in the club.\\n\r\n+ Despite being ridden with cliche scenarios and episode themes, K-ON manages to achieve a certain level of entertainment which keeps the viewers coming back to it.\\n\\n\r\n- Like I said before, the episode themes are full of cliched scenarios which might bother some.\\n\r\n- Some episodes repeat the same themes, which can make the show look repetitive at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ The character designs are absolutely adorable\\n\r\n+ The animation style is easy to digest and simple on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\n- The animation quality however, can sometimes drop significantly and some times look downright bad.\\n\r\n- A lot of the actual music playing scenes are not show and instead we are given shots of still images. Definitely to save some budget on difficult hand movement animation.\\n\r\n- For the standards set by KyoAni in the past, the animation for K-ON! could be considered rather underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Even though music is not the main focus of the anime, the song gives you quite a bit of nice insert songs which are all very catchy and enjoyable.\\n\r\n+ The Opening and Ending songs are both IMO extremely good.\\n\r\n+ For such a relatively new voice cast, K-ON!'s voice acting is superbly done and is sure to put these seiyuu's on the fast line to popularity.\\n\\n\r\n- The actual BGM soundtrack is nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (don't mind my score...I just love moe and im a fanboy ;_;)\\n\r\n+ Despite being cliched, the characters are just absolutely adorable and loveable.\\n\r\n+ moe, moe, moe, and more moe....thats what these characters are 90% of the time. (and I dont complain)\\n\r\n+ The interactions between the characters provides some very enjoyable comedy and very light and fluffy times. (lol bad joke)\\n\r\n+ Even the supporting cast is extremely likeable and yes....very moe.\\n\\n\r\n- Every character follows a stereotype which has been already overplayed in countless animes.\\n\r\n- If you hate moe, you might DESPISE the characters (most likely lol)\\n\r\n- There is a small unbalance in the amount of screentime and attention given between the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot lie, K-ON! is an anime that one enjoys mostly as a guilty pleasure. This is defiinitely not my favourtie anime to have aired on the Spring 2009 season. But its definitely one of the most enjoyable ones i've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall K-ON! is an anime which is not meant to break any records or set any standards. The anime is not an epic tale, nor is it a comedy gold mine, this anime is just fun...If you want an anime which is just cute to the extreme and just plain fun to watch, then by all means watch K-ON! I am sure it will not disappoint you.",

            "content": "After reading a review of this series while comparing it to Lucky Star, I couldn't help but twitch in all of my facial muscles used for frowning and decided to write my own review.\r\nStory:\r\nK-ON! is, simply put about a group of four high-school girls who join the schools light music club for various reasons and with various degrees of enthusiasm. However, as members of the light music club, great responsibility is put on them. As of episode 4, nothing seriously mind-bending has happened, but the individual characters drives the story forward in their own fashion, rather than some evil villain who pulls all the strings.\r\nArt:\r\nRatherthan making overly complex drawings and animations for a light-hearted series like this, PONY CANYON made the right choice and keeps the drawing simple, filling out the expectations in regards to the theme and mood of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that an anime about music should have more than just the regular \"run off the mill\" music that other series uses. K-ON! does a great job at this, the opening and ending are addictive and stylized while the music they play themselves are rather crisp and somewhat matches what they do in the picture.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, the characters are pushed onto the stage, one by one and they entertain you with nothing more than their own personalities and imagination. It hold together pretty well, especially since the whole lot is a blob of moe.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters are archetypes and only moderately unique in terms of behavior and looks. However, the well-performed voice-acting gives the characters even more traits and distincts them from each other and other generic anime characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, K-ON! is a great series for anyone who enjoys a good laugh, is attracted to moe and doesn't mind the fact that the series is just about a bunch of girls who wants to play music for some reason or another.",

No, I'm not talking about my reality TV show--I mean K-On. \r\nYui, the resident retard-moe, has herself an unfabulous predicament: she needs to join a club. What a coincidence that Moe, the tsundere (i.e. mood swinging bitchy stick in the mud) bassist and her best friend Ritalin the genki drummer have a club that needs members. The light music club. By \"light music\", thinkof that elevator junk you hear in between waiting to get to your floor and wondering who cut the cheeze. So Mio, Ritsu, Yui and the big-brows rich girl Mugi all get together for moe band sessions. Sounds dumb, right? IT IS. But what makes this anime so good then!? \\n\\n\r\nIt does the fabpossible and makes the lives of teenage girls actually INTERESTING. Have you ever been around teenage girls? Gossipy bunch, none as innocent and fun-loving as the keion-bu. Which is why this anime is a work of genius: it's a fantasy! In this fantasy world, it's okay to take the short bus to school like Yui does. It's okay to be a totally frigid buzzkill like Mio because when you got a pair of knockers like those--who cares? This world is full of cake and sparkles...it's almost like the inside of my house.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a lot to be desired, especially Mio who is undeservedly the most popular girl. If anything, I'd rather chillax with my bro Ritsu or score some preemo you know what from Mugi. Chick's loaded. Only Cuba's finest, from her! Hell, I'd hang out with that Christmas cake teacher because death metal chicks are pretty wild anyway. Azunyan makes a good pet, because really...what else is she good for?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has got it all: blobby cute girls who do all kinds of kyun~. It probably is no better than other exploitative sacks of moe crap when you look at it on a surface level. But K-On does something that makes it commendable: it knocks the competition back by being as pandering as possible in a way that WORKS. For using and abusing the system like that, well, I'm mightily impressed. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets a solid nine fabulouses out of ten.",

            "content": "I picked up \"K-On!\" envisioning it as some kind of healing, mundane slice of life in the same vein as \"Aria the Animation\", something nice and gentle that would help soothe my severe withdraw symptoms brought on by finishing \"Hikaru no Go\". Even though on the surface I mostly got what I was looking for (it is mundane, and it is a slice of life), the end product was a huge disappointment. It's a bit like one of those twisted fairy tales in which some greedy guy makes wishes to the devil or a genie or something. Even though his wishes are all granted,fulfilling all the criteria that he specified, none of the result turns out to be what he wanted - there's always something very wrong with what he ends up with.\\n\\n\r\nIt took me a few episodes to figure out what's wrong with \"K-On!\". First of all, it starts off disappointingly dull. I'm one of the most patient of viewers, but even I found my attention wandering frequently, and I kept having to rewind to see what I'd missed - and usually the answer turned out to be \"not very much\". It's rare that I get really bored when watch anime, especially given my fondness for the more mundane slice of life shows, but \"K-On!\" managed to seriously test my patience (it took me half a year to finish).\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I realised something worse - \"K-On!\" is MOE. Not as blatant as \"Clannad\", but still, it's all about cute girls doing cute things for the sake of being cute. It also serves to explain why I found it to be dull, given that I have no interest in watching artificially cute girls doing mundanely cute things, and there isn't much else to be found in the show. I find it interesting to compare \"K-On!\" with \"Aria the Animation\", which is also about cute girls doing cute things. I don't know whether it's because I watched \"Aria the Animation\" before and \"K-On!\" after \"Clannad\", a show that is so moe that it's caused me to develop allergic reactions to anything vaguely resembling cute, but with \"Aria the Animation\", the cuteness seemed more innocent; the natural calming beauty of the settings also made \"Aria the Animation\" less one dimensional, and it just seems to have a charm about it that's severely lacking in \"K-On!\".\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I was unimpressed by \"K-On!\", I must admit that towards the mid-series, the slice of life settings began to work its magic, and I found the series growing on me ever so slightly, I even started finding it mildly amusing and enjoyable at times... and that's when the makers of the show decided the time is ripe to give its targeted audience more of what they want - that is to say, the more obnoxious cliches of anime. Unsatisfied with just having cute, clumsy girls procrastinating over homework and cutely drooling over sweets and \"cakies\", they started rolling out the dreaded maid outfit and the cat ears etc. The already limited quality of the series took a dip and sunk to a new low as the girls started spending a lot of time inflicting these the disturbing costumes and distasteful accessories on one another. Obviously, the shy characters would meow pitifully as they are victimised, but of course at the same time they also show signs that a part of them is secretly enjoying the experience. Yes, of course they like it deep down - they're moe blobs after all! Anyway I'm sure you get the picture, so lets move swiftly on...\\n\\n\r\nThough \"K-On!\" is about a music club, they do so little music-related activity that it's easy to mistake it for something else (like, a show about a cake eating club, for example). When it comes to the subject of music, the series is the antithesis of \"Nodame Cantabile\". The latter emphasises the importance of hard work even when the musician is already ridiculously talented. In \"K-On!\", however, we have Yui, someone who'd never played an instrument before, but who very quickly started reproducing face melting solos she hears with apparent ease, and is able to immediately master the techniques demonstrated to her. And she does all of this with just a small amount of casual and unmethodic practice. As I am also learning to play an instrument, this complete undermining of the effort required really doesn't sit well with me. I know it's not supposed to be very focused on the music, but come on, they could have at least made *some* attempt to make it seem less like a piece of cake!\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin actually came when \"K-On!\" tried to do some character development in an episode towards the end of the series. For the first half of that episode, I was bewildered because the characters were acting quite strangely. Then I realised what the episode was trying to achieve - it was going out of its way to create a rift between a couple of characters in order to set up a kiss-and-make-up scenario. Upon realising this, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the fact that they botched up the attempt so badly that it reached a painful level of transparency. Perhaps the makers were better off keeping things simple and sticking to pandering to the moe crowd as they're clearly incapable to doing anything more substantial\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, \"K-On!\" is an interesting specimen for being a slice of life without a soul. Compared to, say, \"Azumanga Daioh\", which is not a slice of life (yes I know it revolves around mundane things, but it's clearly very comedy inclined and not too concerned about being down to earth), but radiated that pleasant warmth associated with a good slice of life, I can barely feel anything in \"K-On!\", and I certainly don't have any fondness for any of the characters. Something feels fundamentally wrong with the series - the creepy elements dispels any sense of innocence and charm it might otherwise have had, and once you strip away those elements, what's left is disturbingly hollow. Perhaps I'm being overly harsh on an anime that I consider mediocre, and sure there are anime out there that are a lot worse (like \"Clannad\"), but I guess I'm feeling rather grumpy that \"K-On\" shattered my naively comforting delusion that slice of life shows can't be anything short of pleasant. \\n",

            "content": "Before I begin this review it must be noted that I am not a moe hater. Shows centralized on moe are fine so long as it succeeds at its task. What is not fine is a show that is completely false advertising.\r\nComing into K-ON! you would expect to see a show about girls getting into a band and watch them enjoy the experience of learning to play music. While we don't exactly expect for them to get all that dramatic or serious all the time, it's still nice to see the struggles of learning to play music, the effort it takes to get good, andto get the overall culture of it as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what I did see was none of this at all. Much like many other poorly made animes on hobbies and sports, K-ON! did an immense disservice in portraying what it means to be in a band. The dedication, hard work, the love for music, the love for the culture of music, and even the simple know-how of instrument playing was completely nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nAs a viewer, I find this very dissatisfying. Are we to sit here and really believe that characters like Yui can sit around slacking, eating cake, and hardly practicing at all with almost no knowledge can suddenly be this guitar genius on a concert stage playing these songs perfectly? Even as far as musical geniuses go, there was a lot of hard work and toil and passion put into their craft.\\n\\n\r\nBut fine. Clearly this anime never intended to be BECK with moe, so it's fine to adjust our perception of this anime begrudgingly so. However, even for an anime centralized around moe, or more specifically for this show \"cute girls doing cute things,\" the show was hardly entertaining. Ignoring the fact that the characters for me were just utterly dull or annoying, the activities and antics of the girls were not really amusing.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that is 1 cour does need two cliche \"beach\" episodes. Eating sweets the entire show was not \"cute,\" and really the characters hardly lended themselves to being likable due to their utter lack of depth. None of them seem to be anything but 2 dimensional the entire show's run.\\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a distinction between moe shows with depth and subtle complexities and shows like this, which is essentially moe blobs without soul or substance. This compounded with the fact that is false advertising created a horrible viewing experience for myself. If you were looking for a show that was in any way supposed to be about a nice group of girls truly learning the experience of a musical band, this is probably not for you. If however you are satisfied with looking at what you see is cute animated moving images of cute girls doing mundane tasks, then enjoy it as you would like.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say that this show neither succeeds at being a being an anime about music nor at being a moe show, which I would call a complete derailment of what this show is both advertised and presented as.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is a slice of life show and I really mean they just take a slice out of anything they find amusing (which I probably didn't) and put it in the show. A day in the life of a high school girl who happens to be in the light music club. Some of these \"slices\" though tend to lead to very boring and I mean boring episodes. I think I was asleep half of the season watching thiswhich is good because I had more energy then when I think about it. Then they throw in some moeness. How much of it. Constantly. Yup...I mean every episode is a freaking moe blob. I don't hate or love moe, but geezuz guys can you easy up on it for a bit. I'm not Takanashi from Working! here. So for story? A pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nHmmm. At first I thought it was decent, but when I further look at it was pretty mediocre. That fuzziness effect they try to do when moving around is, in my opinion, just lazy animation. It really takes away from what other wise could be some decent artwork. Not to mention the fact that we are constantly bombarded with chibi and moe images. After a while it just plains get you so pissed off you want to step on some ants.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThere were some catchy songs in this show, which is a nice touch for a band/slice of life type of show, but it just isn't good enough to save it from utter crapness of the rest of the show. I give it a decent 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nDreadful. None of them have character. They are so predictable and boring, no wonder no guys are in this show, none of them would like these idiots. Just think of them as Kim Kardashian clones without the hot body, that's what the characters of K-on are like. A give it a 2. At least a couple times I laughed...a couple...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nWhen I finished this show, I just kind of stood there and thought to myself. Is that it? Is this what people were raving about how \"cool it was. blah blah.\"  I think I need to bang my head against a wall a few times to see what these raving reviews see, because frankly, I don't see it. K-On to put it simply, is stupid. Hell it's even worse than the harem anime types or those old 15 fps animes that bombard you with violence...and to think I thought the 2nd season would be better. It was the same lame jokes, characters, etc. GOD almighty help us. K-On is crap. Let us pray there isn't a 3rd season.",

However, K-On misses the point entirely. In fact, as soon as the first episode begins, the \"moe\" (read: retardedness) seems almost FORCED onto you. By the time I was 10 minutes in, I was drowning in a see of concentrated lame attempts at cuteness.\r\nSeriously, this anime will only please girls very fond of \"OMG SO CUTE :3\".

Does anyone even know the story of this show, anyone?! No, well thats awkward. K-on, the show that has cute ass girl who drink tea, eat and have fun.....and play music. Not really but you could put that in a sense. What is this show about and the point of it? Absolutely nothing, but not in a bad way. This is that type of moe-show thats there in case you wanna sit down and relax, it isn't a show that keeps you on yourfeet, you could close your eyes and still at least enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nThe story as I said, there's none, so these 4 girls have formed a group known as the 'Light Music Club' , their goal is to just have fun and play music I guess. And thats it, we get introduced to a childhood friend, a music teacher with marriage issues and no male character like any where. Only in like one scene, well thats sexist for men. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole point here is that K-on dosen't need a story, its cast should keep you going for 13 episodes, the story is just there to tell you whats going on. Its just a show where girls wanna have fun, nothing more than that. And if you don't like that, there's millions of other moe-anime waiting for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is nice, it suits the show really well, its filled with vibrant and calm colours to let you explore, it shows k-on's world is like a world that has world-peace.....only in an anime world kids!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty damn catchy same with the ED, they really make you hope you get more music like that through the show, but nope, just some tea, well hey at least we have some music here and there....oh wait we get like 2 songs. One generic japanese moe-song and a good attempt at a girly song that does well. Thats all for the music, for a show mainly on the aspect of music, its dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe chracters are pretty cliche here, you have a light headed girl who's rich (Mugi), the shy-ass girl (Mio), the strong-independent girl (Ritsu), the 'kawaii' girl thats there just to be cute (Azusa) and a retard (Yui). \\n\\n\r\nEach have their own traits but not too much special, its the characters you'd expect in a moe-anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nNow this is the reason I actually continued this show, the show is so damn cute, and there's downright moments that kill make you either go AWW! or just nosebleed, literally.  This is really the point of this show, its fluffy and cute. There's some jokes here and there but they don't make you really laugh, they miight make you chuckle but thats really it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nK-on is a cute and relaxing show in case you need a break after watching something long as hell and terrible, if you're bored or depressed, this show should make you feel all better. Girls just wanna have fun, that is k-on in a nutshell.",

            "content": "Having spent most of my summer engulfed in the world of engineering, I figured a series based on music would be a great distraction. Tack on some hyper-energetic high school girls and a slice-of-life setting, and K-On\u2019s light-hearted charm naturally piqued my interest.\r\nThis premise is undoubtedly what makes K-On so captivating. As a whole, the show never attempts to step beyond its means; it sets itself out to be simple fun and undoubtedly succeeds. Despite operating off a number of base gags and jokes that find themselves revisited from episode to episode, the series never seems to drag. Ultimately, the musical aspect of the show,while central, pales in comparison to the harmonious play of the characters, and serves primarily as a catalyst to move the story along \u2013 the music does not shape the girls, but rather the girls shape the music. I admit this might disappoint some viewers, but it provides K-On with more universal appeal; though it refrains from excelling in any one genre, it dabbles in several quite well, and manages to juggle humor, drama, and music without any sign of awkwardness.\\n\r\nFrom air-headed Yui to feisty Ritsu to feminine Mio to whimsical Tsumugi, the cast certainly can\u2019t make any claims to originality. In fact, the series sticks so hard to the tried-and-true formula of slice-of-life comedy that its sole claim to uniqueness stems from its inclusion of music as a focal point. While the characters feel like largely recycled archetypes, great lengths are taken to flesh them out to be as endearing as possible. In this way, the series seems \u2013 in a strange manner \u2013 both fresh and vivacious, and manages to fill its thirteen episode span without much tedium. Just as the antics begin to slip into monotony, the anime comes to a close, wrapping up its finale with an expected, but very fitting, encor\\n\r\nK-On certainly branches out from Kyoto Animation\u2019s standard fare, as although the animation works well for a \u201ccutesy\u201d feel, the level of detail is noticeably poorer. A number of menially important scenes feel washed over in quality, and make the visual production seem rushed. Still, as a whole, the animation generally works well in that it aptly captures the girls\u2019 cheery enthusiasm. Motion and framerates are as crisp as ever, so where the show lacks detail, it makes up for it with raw energy.\\n\r\nJapanese bands should really stop writing English lyrics into their songs. Sure \u201clazy\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d might rhyme, but rhyming does not a coherent sentence make. Anyway, aside from that little quip, I can\u2019t think of anything much to say about the music other than that it\u2019s catchy. All the band\u2019s insert songs make you bob your head along with the beat, and the opening theme delivers the free-spirited feel that pervades the entire series. With solid voice acting to boot, the audible aspects of the show play out in much the same way as the visuals: they don\u2019t break any new ground, but they do their job well.    \\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the story section, K-On\u2019s cast is remarkably unremarkable. Though they all do a fantastic job at connecting with the viewer, they fit the archetypal mold too snugly for my liking.  While I found their interplay fun and amusing to watch, I could never shake the sensation that I\u2019d seen this material before but with different faces. Unlike the truly successful comedies such as Fumoffu! and Minami-ke their characters flaunt no memorable twists, which leaves them simply as good. Still, the musical premise gives the series enough edge to allow much of this to be overlooked, as the band environment adds sufficient flavor story-wise to draw the viewer into their experience. In the end, the characters are little more than a bunch of ordinary high school girls getting together to do what they enjoy, and perhaps their largely generic feel is what gives them such overarching charm.\\n\r\nThough K-On is certainly not Kyoto Animation\u2019s best work, it passes the acceptability test by a wide margin. While lacking the originality and flair that have defined the studio\u2019s previous works, the series manages to be entertaining regardless and avoids making any glaring faults. At thirteen episodes in length, K-On makes a point not to overstay its welcome; it\u2019s fun, amusing, and enjoyable for its span, and can easily find its way onto the shelves of fans of many different genres.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nK-ON! is a slice of life anime with no real story. Its about the day to day lives of cliche moe characters that form a band and do everything BUT actually play music.......for the most part.\r\nThe majority of the time is wasted with the characters eating cake and talking about a bunch of random nonsense that isn't delivered as good as in anime like Lucky Star, neither is it as funny, and it gets old pretty fast. The final episode (12 or 13 doesn't really matter what you consider the final) is pretty anti-climatic (like most slice of life series) and just leaves muchto be desired. What a proper ending for a moe, high school girl, slice-of-life anime be like.....I dunno. A graduation?\\n\\n\r\nSince its KyoAni after the OVA you wont see any more K-ON! for a long time so you know this will never get any real closure. Not that these kinds of animes are about that .....but still...\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nAs usual KyoAni does a solid job. The backgrounds looks nice, the food (which gets tons of airtime =P) looks delicious, and all the little things are detailed with extra characters all looking different with actual faces. :O\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is either love or hate is those damn blank eyed gooey faces. I cant really explain but when ever they do or say something stupid there's an equally stupid or ugly face to go along with it. Ive seen it before obviously but they spam them in the anime and it gets a bit disgusting instead of cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nWhat I found the most disappointing about K-ON! was that this anime, which is about music,has such a weak soundtrack. This is short and simple. The OP was terrible and cringe worthy. The ED was surprisingly decent I'll admit. But none of the insert songs are memorable. They also come off as korny and cringe worthy. Yes I know moe moe kyun anime or whatever but Haruhi and her God Knows performance was epic and a really good song on its own. The same can't be said for any of the music in K-ON!\\n\r\nThe Seiyu were pretty solid throughout but some annoying voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nThe cast is all cliche female moe characters. Rather than explain em all all I'll just say none of them are interesting. You have definitely seen them in tons of different anime already. Im not against moe or anything like that I do enjoy it. But this is just overload and rather than be cute its annoying. Yui and her stupidity and clumsiness isn't cute its stupid and annoying. Mio and her scaredy cat attitude isn't cute its annoying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nK-ON! is certainly enjoyable but in small doses. I pretty much rushed through the series to get it over with and move on to something new since I originally planned on watching it during its airing schedule. Its not a good anime but its not a terrible anime. Its just there and if you're hungry for moe this is good to satisfy you as long as you take small bites. (Watch 1, 2 eps a week) Running through it will definitely bore you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6  (Fair!)\\n\r\nPretty much explained in Enjoyment. Not good not terrible.",

            "content": "A lot of criticism surrounds K-ON! It is usually based on that it supposedly doesn't deliver what it should. Well I'm going to say that's all rubbish. What makes K-ON! stand out is simple: It's refreshing. (A word I will be using a lot in this review)\r\nThe story is great for providing that breath of fresh air not found in similar programs. The moe aspects are what makes this a really nice watch, and the humour on top is even better. You shouldn't be disappointed because it's going to put a smile to your face. Unless... Unless you were hoping K-ON! was going to bemore music based. Sadly it isn't and I'll be honest I was looking for more of the band playing. There are only 2 real performances in the series comprising of 13 episodes. There should have been more of a focus on the music aspect, but what you get is good enough to keep you happy. The refreshing nature of the story keeps you from wondering if it would have been better if it was more music orientated.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching K-ON! I was worried that the instruments used would be unliscensed rubbish. How wrong I was. There is so much attention to detail in the guitars, the amps etc. that they make everything look basic. That isn't the case though, character design is fantastic, they all look unique, and the setting used (the school) is refreshing. It really made me happy that Kyoto Animation took the time to make the focal point of K-ON! really eye catching. It is worth watching if you are a music fan to embrace the detail used. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used in K-ON! is outstanding. The opening theme is refreshing, the ending theme fun. They are described as the \"Light Cusic Club\" but this isn't the most accurate western reflection of the term \"light.\" The songs featured in K-ON! is out and out rock and I could not help headbanging a little. It doesn't seem refreshing but when it's all said and done I was very happy at the end of them playing. The voices of the characters suit so well I can't think of anything that matches. The shy but strong Mio who is the most moe of the characters has a voice that really befits how she acts in situations. The bombastic Ritsu has a match made in heaven voice. If it weren't for the voice acting, the relationship between Ritsu and Mio wouldn't seem right. As for the rest of the characters, they have been acted very well on most parts. Some of the minor characters are satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are great. I love the contrast between them all. Yui, Mugi, Ritsu, Mio and Asuza all have a uniqueness which is refreshing when they sit around the table while drinking tea and stuffing cake. It enables for varying discussion, which is again, refreshing. (I told I would use it a lot) It's great they paid so much attention to detail to make sure that what each character does reflects not only their personality, but their design. I mean, it would be weird for Mugi to be the dumb one, because she doesn't look dumb, there are other characters for that job. This is something I'm glad of. It makes critics look like they were watching something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I'm going to correct the critics. K-ON! DOES deliver what it should! It delivers the refreshing day to day activities of a group of girls, which puts a smile on your face. It is thoroughly enjoyable for it offers unique story, design, and sound which you can enjoy. However I have to look at both sides and agree that a lot will be disappointed by the lack of focus on the music, as some would perceive K-ON! as something that sets out to be purely something dedicated to music. Even so, you'll still enjoy the music that is offered, even if it might not be as much as a lot would want. K-ON! is unique in the slice-of-life/moe genre, and that is what makes it: Refreshing! 9/10",

            "content": "There are anime that build a huge hype around them and turn out below average. Then, there are anime that do the same but they still manage to meet expectations of their fans. Which group does K-On! belong to? In a way, both. While it completely manages to please fans of slice-of-life and comedy manga, even some people that love K-On! admit that nothing actually happens in it. That\u2019s where people that like their anime with plot facewall to oblivion. \r\nStory:  1/10\r\nWhy such low rating? Because there is nothing to rate. The only signs of story were at the very beginning and even thenit was way below average. Basically, the story is that a new girl, Yui, joins Light music club but can\u2019t do music. Of course, that she is wholeheartly accepted into the club. Why not after all? What would be musicians doing in a music club? Another plot happens, about in the middle, when another girl, Azusa, but this time she can play guitar, joins. That\u2019s it, say bye bye to plot. All they do is drink tea\u2026 when they actually do something.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nArt, the only good thing about K-On! yet it\u2019s probably where people divide into fans and haters. Simple reason, you either love it or hate it. Art, just like everything else, is played for laughs. Deformed characters are in every episode and design is something between a moe loli and Voldemort.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1/10\\n\r\nDO NOT go into this expecting an anime based on music. Even though it wants you to believe it is, it isn\u2019t. Practice is very rare to see here and even if it happens most of it is just pointless jamming. Concerts are even rarer (2 in the whole season) and, again, they\u2019re played for laughs so they\u2019re about stage fright (driven into dumb extremes), songs a 5 year old would write (no kidding), the \u201cgroup\u201d being anything but in-tune, etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nI hate it when people rage over a show and ignore its good points because they dislike it. Characters were the strongest point of K-On! after art. There aren\u2019t many and while some are similar they still manage to keep their diversity both in nature and looks. However, don\u2019t expect any character development or any characters that would serve other purpose than comic relief. The cast is full of stupid, hypocritical, useless and annoying characters that would be hated until the end of time if they were in a different kind of anime. However, they still have a charm to them and a very strong moe factor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\r\nEven though I have sort of mainstream sense of humour (most of the mainsream anime make me laugh easily), I couldn\u2019t even smile at any of jokes here. Humour is mostly based on a stupidity or awkwardness of a character. Like inteligent jokes? Keep away from this as far as possible. The only reaction I had to these \u201cjokes\u201d was staring at it with my jaw dropped wondering whether it was supposed to be funny or show the characters\u2019 idiocy. I watched this because of boredom and I believed it would get better eventually. It didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nTo me, enjoyment, plot and characters make most of the rating, in that order, so art could be perfect and it still would get low rating. (I found the art stupid so it wouldn\u2019t help much anyway) I didn\u2019t enjoy the series but you might. The only thing you should ask yourself if you have a lot of time on your hands and if you enjoy watching moe characters drinking tea. If so, by all means watch this. If not, maybe you should try something else.",

            "content": "Based on the 2 episodes so far...this show can be summed up in 10 words :\r\nLucky Star without the otaku reference and with music instruments.\r\nFor a more in-depth look, read on.\r\nStory\r\nWell...its about 4 girls joining the light music club hoping to start a band of their own and perform in front of a sold out audience (presumably). There is a plot here (somewhat) unlike Lucky Star, but that plot is loose and gets diverted at certain times. In a nutshell, the plot will be followed loosely so if you want a powerful story, you ain't getting one.\r\nArt\r\nThe art is appropriate for this kind of show.Its not mind-blowing nor is it mind-numbing. Simply put, it fits the show and thats all it needs to do.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMOST. AWESOME. ENDING. SONG. EVER. The opening is good as well, but man, the ending is just addictive. Based on the 2 themes itself, the sound is damn good. It'll be promising should other songs be as good as these two in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nStandard Lucky Star character archetypes are used here. The four girls in K-on are basically the four girls from Lucky Star in a different paint. \\n\\n\r\nTechnically :\\n\r\nRitsu ----> Konata\\n\r\nMio  -----> Kagami (with a slightly diminished tsundere attitude)\\n\r\nTsumugi ----> Miyuki (without the megane)\\n\r\nYui ----> Tsukasa\\n\\n\r\nIts obvious after the first episode...so listing it down doesn't really spoil anything. (If you have never watched Lucky Star, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about anyway)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhat made me enjoy K-On more than Lucky Star is this :\\n\r\nIt doesn't have a crap pilot episode.\\n\\n\r\nK-On doesn't open with a 10 minute long discussion of food so it doesn't bore in the first scene itself.  As its just 2 episodes, its pretty darn amusing to see the girls try to form their band\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you like Lucky Star, you'll sorta like this. If you hated Lucky Star, you should give it a shot anyway, since its better than Lucky Star (yeah,flame me later). I have hopes on this show, and hopefully...it doesn't disappoint.",

            "content": "Another blockbuster from Kyoto Animation studio. Forming a music band that is a pretext to eat cakes and drink tea in nice atmosphere. Enjoyable and positive comedy with big accumulation of moe. \r\nKyoto Animation has at least two recognizable anime series. After Lucky Star and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya we have K-on. This time we don\u2019t have loli student who talks about food or girl who search for aliens. This time the pretext is\u2026 a music band. Yes, Kyoto Animation knows how to attract millions of otaku. For K-on has so much fans as adventures of Haruhi or Konata and the amount of bayedguitars during emission has increased markedly. We have another phenomenon.\\n\\n\r\nYui Hirasawa is a very lazy and irresolute person. She would like to join same club but she doesn\u2019t have any interests or talents. She arrived to the light music club by accident. The activities of this club fits Yui , who don\u2019t like to overwork herself. She meets tree other girls, who also arrived to the club by coincident. Four of them tries to improve their play on the instruments, but after a moment of practice they sit by the table with cakes and tea. Even when a new member appears it don\u2019t change anything. \\n\\n\r\nThere are five members in the music band. First guitar is owned by Yui, a sweet and drowsy but cheerful girl. On second guitar plays Azusa, band\u2019s mascot with large avidness and graceful appearance. The bassist is Mio, a quiet a and shy girl, who get scared vary easily.  Percussionist Ritsu is a person with thousand ideas and energetic personality. The last member Mugi, who plays the keyboard is the sponsor of all cookies and tea. We also have four tangential heroines. There are non male characters. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character movement or sentence fits the fans exceptions. Girls have very cute lifestyle and  are very adorable. Yui sleeps in weird places, eating lots of sweets and acting lazy. Azusa as the youngest member have role of bands mascot, obviously with cats ears. Mio blasts everyone with her shyness and scariness. Ritsu capers around all the time. Mugi is a motherly type from rich family.  \\n\\n\r\nPersons who want to watch K-on because of music will be disappointed. The club activities are constricted to eating cakes and drinking tea, rather than practicing on instruments. They won\u2019t write many songs or perform concerts every evening. Don\u2019t expect any masterpiece lyrics either. The band plays very light music with  trivial contents, singing about rice for example. It can be classified as sweet pop-rock. \\n\\n\r\nAll music theme is contained in short conversations about this subject. Problem with hurting fingertips, controlling instrument or catching the right rhythm are one of those enjoyable additions. That can encourage many people to try some instrument practicing. Besides the portrayal of instruments is incredible. The guitars looks so much genuinely that we can recognize their analogue in real life. The character movement while playing and the instruments images from different angles are also fantastic. Though the concert scenes are limited because of time accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can attract to K-on besides tons of moe? Namely positive energy which bright up this title. Smile don\u2019t disappear even for a moment. Carefree life of our heroines and the atmosphere will build up everyone\u2019s mood. Days in the club are passing slowly, which is very relaxing.  K-on don\u2019t kill with laugh. You can find more funny titles. The humor is light and accommodate in characters of club members. We don\u2019t have stupid gags or punching in the head. \\n\\n\r\nGraphics are done very well, as like as the instruments that I previously mentioned. Colors are lively and apparently sloppy drawn outlines are adding some dynamism in the animation. The facial expressions of characters are also very positive. Even though the club members are in high school they look very young, but it can\u2019t be sead that is a typical loli look.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is very positive and don\u2019t disturb on with any frustrating themes. The opening song is characterized by excessive cuteness and portraits perfectly what K-on is. Quick guitar sounds and squeaky voices can get your mind mixed up. Songs that girls are playing in the anime can be counted on one hand. If sweet pop-rock songs happens to fit someone\u2019s taste there are many albums that contains band\u2019s music not featured in anime. \\n\\n\r\nSomeone that don\u2019t want to watch anything with moe will doubtlessly avoid this anime. If it doesn\u2019t bother, many spectators will fall in love with the characters and bias positively with this mellowed title. Regardless, I wouldn\u2019t categorize K-on as a music title this much. The designation that fits it more is \u201cAbout girls who spend their free time in a funny and enjoyable way\u201d.\\n\\n",

I know it\u2019s really moe to see little girls eat but I mean\u2026 when the show is about creating a band, wouldn\u2019t you have more music in it like BECK? \r\nThe characters are really stereotyped and remind me a lot of how Lucky Star works out. Yui Hirasawa is the main character and unfortunately, not the brightest bulb in the bunch. She\u2019s the main idea of moe, clumsy, bad at sports andschool, very childish. Even her younger sister acts more like an older sister to her. Even threw all these faults, she is determined to be a good guitarist and singer. Mio is a shy girl who really doesn\u2019t stand out to me at all, Tsumugi is pretty sweet and wealthy but somewhat dumb to the point of not even knowing that a shop was owned by her parents, and Ritsu is pretty much like Yui but forgets a lot of stuff. None of the characters stand out and made the show pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is alright, though nothing really special. It just doesn\u2019t call out to me. The opening and ending were the best part and not by much. All in all, it just doesn\u2019t stand out as being the best.\\n\\n\r\nAlright\u2026 so there is a little bit of music but seriously not enough to call this a music anime. The music is alright if you like really high voiced j-pop but its nothing I would listen to over and over again. The voices are way too cutesy for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: So, I actually found the Official English dub of K-On and its actually a bit more interesting then the Japanese version. The English Voices are a little easier to listen to for me. Now when I say little, I mean a little. Yui has a really high voice still and it bothers me a bit, she is so spacey and cutesy that it\u2019s hard to feel for all the characters. They didn\u2019t change anything to the point of adding more music.",

            "content": "Story: 1/10\r\nWhat story? There is no significant plot. K-ON only follows the mundane and trivial lives of 4 cute little girls and their friends/family. I don't think anyone really watches this expecting a juicy plot full of unexpected twists or anything like that. If you are looking for a good plot, don't waste your time with this series or reading about this series.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe animations are crisp, clean and the character designs are exactly what they are supposed to be: moe, shiny, sparkly, etc. I watched the entire series on 1280x720 so the art was definitely one of the best aspects of this series.\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nTheBGM did its job perfectly, subtle but sets the mood and atmosphere to accommodate the show. The light and fluffy intro and insert songs fits the series perfectly. The ending is a nice music video of the girls' band, what more can you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of the 4 girls of the K-ON band takes on a typical role of a moe series, exactly what you would be expecting from such a series. No character development, no inter or intra-character conflicts. Again, exactly what you would expect from such a series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI guess this is the part of the review that actually matters. Before I say anything else, if you are not into Japanese \"moe\" culture, don't waste your time with this series. \\n\r\nI am not a huge fan of \"light and fluffy\" but I sometimes find it irresistible in mood swings, especially if I am under great stress or depression and need something to lighten the mood. I guess that's why it took me nearly two months to finish 14 episodes that I already had on my hard drive. So if you are looking for something light and cheerful, this series will do the trick with its extremely cute and childish characters, extremely cute and childish band related episodes, and extremely cute and childish comedy.",

            "content": "I'll tell you this; I didn't watch this anime for the music or because its cute I simply watched it because 2 of my friends told me too. And I thought, \"ok\", not really appealed to it very much because I'm not really into Slice of Life anime like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh, I watch it. And you know what happened I fell in love with it. I thought after watching it, that it is a Charming little anime to relax to. It amused me and made me smile. Usually when I watch Slice of Life anime I get bored and space out, especiallywhen I'm watching the first episode. But this anime was different it moved with a pace that kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe first episode was fun to watch because it actually had a plot where a girl who has done nothing with her life decides she wants to do something involving a club. Mean while The light music club is going to be cut due to the fact they are one member short. And so the main girl, Yui, joins the club thinking it will be simple finds out its more work than that. She is going to actually have to do something and learn a instrument. and the Story unfolds from there with the member's many adventures.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI for one like the art, its nice and cute. It's appropriate for the style of anime. I'm not quite sure why but I like how it shows the characters teeth with they smile and talk. And that the hair colors are more believable than other Slice Of Life I've seen. I don't see so much cotton candy anywhere.  \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI like the sound like the background music and the voices are appropriate for the characters. Plus I like how the Opening is catching and the Ending is as well. It's pretty rare for me to like both when watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty simple but effective. So lets see, what do we have here?\\n\r\nYui- The stupid, clueless Girl\\n\r\nRitsu- The cool, mischievous, joyful girl \\n\r\nMio- The shy, short-tempered girl that scared of everything\\n\r\nMugi- The rich yet kind girl who makes good cake",

            "content": "The title of this delightful little comedy comes from the Japanese for \u201clight music\u201d (\u8efd\u97f3\u697d keionga) and that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s about \u2013 the members of an all-girls\u2019 school\u2019s light music club. Yes, it might sound a bit trite, but I was sold the minute Detroit Metal City\u2019s Krauser II made an unscheduled guest appearance \u2013 that\u2019s when I had a feeling there was something special lurking here.\r\nI call it delightful for two reasons, firstly it is seriously funny and secondly, it\u2019s as cute as hell (and I\u2019m such a sucker for cute). Don\u2019t let yourself be put off by the moe though, as acomedy, K-On stands head and shoulders above anything else  in the genre this season. It\u2019s not all laugh-a-minute stuff, but there\u2019s been plenty of punchlines that have had me laughing out loud \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t happen often. Being the product of a 4koma seinen manga means that the underlying comedy isn\u2019t wildly silly, nor does it rely on cheap fanservice for laughs. Ok\u2026 the one exception might be Ritsu and Yui\u2019s reaction to Mio\u2019s *ahem* somewhat better development in the chest area, shown during the obligatory beach episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat K-On also does well, besides immediately introducing us to a cast of immensely likeable characters, is break with the usual plot device. It\u2019s not about somebody lacking talent trying to break into the music club, but rather the members of the music club wanting to keep the talentless one around, in order to keep the club going. This is done with copious amounts of tea and cake\u2026 something the club spends more time eating than actual practising. Hence the band\u2019s name \u2013 \u201cAfter School Teatime.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nObviously, the story revolves around the initial four band members. Heading up the pack is Yui Hirasawa. Our introduction to Yui involves her slipping and landing on her backside and the viewer pretty much gets the picture that she\u2019s spent most of her young life falling, or sitting, on said backside. She\u2019s sort of drifted through life, with no direction and only ends up joining the club, because her level-headed friend, Nodaka, half-jokingly suggests that people who don\u2019t join clubs become NEETs later in life. Luckily, it turns out she\u2019s a bit of an idiot savant (as a friend described her) when it comes to the guitar, which although a very convenient plot device, is played for laughs, as she tends to forget things the minute she\u2019s learnt something new. She\u2019s also oblivious to things like tuning the guitar or playing vibrato\u2026 these things just happen naturally to her. As Mio describes her, \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person who plays games without reading the manual.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe other band members comprise Ritsu Tainaka, the drummer, club leader and impetuous hothead, and Mio Akiyama, her long time friend, who plays the bass and generally tries to be the cool, calm and collected one amongst the general mayhem. The only problem is, she\u2019s as flaky as the rest of them \u2013 she\u2019s terribly shy (and goes to pieces at the mere thought of having to sing lead vocals, but manages to overcome this and step up to the plate\u2026 er\u2026 mike when required), cowers in terror at the mere hint of scary stuff (especially barnacles for some reason) and worries that she isn\u2019t \u201ccute.\u201d The interplay between these two, with Ritsu often sporting an impressive array of head lumps, as she tests Mio\u2019s patience once too often, provides the comic links between scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMaking up the quartet is the keyboard player, Tsumugi Kotobuki (she of the incredible eyebrows). Sadly, her character doesn\u2019t quite get the same treatment it does in the manga, and more often than not, she sort of fades into the background. You see, young Mugi-chan is a rich little princess, who seems to have lived a sheltered life (although she has had piano lessons since age 4, which makes her a natural for the club). Little things like trying to earn some spare cash to buy Yui\u2019s guitar (the fact that her family owns the music store in question greatly simplifies matters) and eating at McDonald\u2019s are all wonderful new adventures for her. However, whilst the anime portrays her as being uncomfortable about her wealth around her friends, the manga portrays her in a slightly different light. Here, she knows she\u2019s the boss\u2019 daughter and isn\u2019t afraid to use that knowledge on cowering staff. After all, nobody said \u201ccute\u201d has to be \u201cnice,\u201d right? The manga also hints that Mugi-chan is slightly confused when it comes to relationships.\\n\\n\r\nK-On also does something odd in adding a new central character two-thirds of the way through. This is the intense little junior, Azusa, who signs up in their second year. Unlike Yui, Azusa knows her way around a guitar, but joins up thinking Yui is a genius, based on her performance at the opening ceremony. Despite soon learning the truth, and being horrified at the club\u2019s \u201ctea-and-cake\u201d method of practising, she becomes the fifth member, deferring the role of lead guitar to Yui, to whom she still looks up, despite being a musical klutz. Although the story probably could have carried on without her, her addition does make the double-edged point that there\u2019s more to club life than just practising, whilst reminding the others that there is a time and place for everything.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounding them is a small, but equally likeable, cast of side characters, headed up by Yui\u2019s younger sister, Ui, who deserves a paragraph of her own. Now anime generally makes younger sisters adorable \u2013 just think of Clannad\u2019s Mei-chan and Hidamari\u2019s Chika-chan \u2013 but Ui-chan takes it to a whole new level. She plays the unwitting straight man to her flaky onee-chan, to great comic effect. It basically boils down to the fact that she hero-worships her older sister, can see only good in all Yui\u2019s quirks (which hasn\u2019t exactly motivated Yui to change) and will do anything for her (to the point of impersonating her at one stage)\u2026 something Yui takes full advantage of, probably without realising she is taking advantage. Strangely, given her lovely nature, the kanji for her name \u2013 \u6182 \u2013 translates as \u201csorrow\u201d or \u201cunhappy\u201d (then again, Yui\u2019s \u2013 \u552f \u2013 translates as \u201conly\u201d or \u201csolely\u201d, so maybe her parents weren\u2019t too thrilled when child number two popped out. Of course, given her lot in life and constant slaving after Yui, it\u2019s quite possible Ui kicks little anime puppies around the garden when not on camera).\\n\\n\r\nThe club\u2019s advisor, Sawako-sensei\u2019s presence is a little jarring at times, what with her cosplay fetish and somewhat dodgy interest in the girls\u2019 breasts. I know all anime teachers are supposed to be insane, but she\u2019s just a little too over the top for my liking, given the general tone of the comedy. That said, her exposure, as the demon metal queen of a past keion, was fun. Nodaka-chan, Yui\u2019s childhood friend and student council rep, pops up now and again, normally to play another straight man, or to provide some background on Yui, or to terrorise Ritsu, because of some or other form she hasn\u2019t filled in.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one real jarring note to the whole series, it comes in the penultimate episode, when \u2013 for reasons known only to the writers \u2013 they try to inject some drama into the storyline. The problem is, as with most comedies, the characters aren\u2019t developed enough for this to work and you\u2019re left thinking, \u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d It\u2019s even more out of place when you consider that K-On pokes deliberate fun at the \u201cevil student council trying to close down the club\u201d dramatic plot device early on.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this aberration soon passes and we end not only on a comedic high note, but also with the knowledge that flighty, air-headed Yui is probably going to be ok. As she says to herself, \u201cTo the me back then, you don\u2019t need to worry. You\u2019ll soon find something you can do, something you can set your heart on\u2026\u201d Actually, her development is illustrated nicely towards the end, when we see her about to slip again, in almost identical circumstances to the opening scenes, but this time she stays on her feet.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done, with surprising attention to little things. We see the scrape marks on wooden floors where doors open; the girls sweat (or should that be \u201cglow\u201d?) when performing; Yui struggles to climb on stage with a guitar bag swinging on her back.  Probably most importantly, they aren\u2019t static while playing \u2013 fingers move on fretboards, cymbals to the cymbal thing, Mugi plays chords on her keyboard, etc, etc.; so it\u2019s heartening to see that the animators didn\u2019t try and cut costs there. They didn\u2019t skimp on product placement either. Mugi has a Korg synthesiser, Ritsu plays a Yamaha drum kit and Yui\u2019s axe is a Gibson Les Paul\u2026 which she bought, not because it\u2019s a Les Paul, but because it was \u201ccute\u201d (yes, that\u2019s how Yui\u2019s mind works).\\n\\n\r\nEven musically, the show isn\u2019t bad\u2026 which is a good thing, seeing as music forms the backdrop of the whole story. Made-for-anime music can sometimes be dreadful, but K-On\u2019s actually isn\u2019t bad and that goes for the OP and ED (both of which were Top 5 hits on the Japanese charts, according to ANN) as well as the insert songs. It also helps that, as with most seiyuu, Aki Toyosaki and Youko Hikasa (who voice Yui and Mio respectively) can sing\u2026 although Aki does sound a little like a chipmunk on helium. You might need to ignore the lyrics which are decidedly cheesy (courtesy of Mio, who comes up with song titles such as \u201cCurry after rice,\u201d \u201cMy love is a stapler\u201d and \u201cFluffy fluffy time\u201d) but musically they\u2019re not bad. Be warned \u2013 the OP, like a lot of anime music, is insanely addictive.\\n\\n\r\nK-On would appear to be one the surprise hits of the current season, but given its characters, humour and music (not to mention the most prodigious use of giant sweat drops and head lumps I\u2019ve seen in ages!), it\u2019s hardly surprising. I somehow doubt this is going to be licensed, because of the musical content and royalty fees (God forbid they dub the songs!), so try and track it own online. Oh, and track down the manga too \u2013 you won\u2019t be sorry.",

            "content": "K-On review\r\nAnd I'm back at this again drum roll please! I'm going to put my 2 sense in it so bare with me my guppies. Anyways take a seat and watch the show or in this case review, I have a nifty goal to accomplish I'll share at the end of this though. Anyways review time, yay!!!\r\nSo what do you get when you put super moe character and put them in a band? Come guys it's easy right? Obviously you get K-On of course I'm guessing the K stands for kawaii maybe, maybe not but let me dream so \"Kawaii-On\" got a nice ring toit, no? So what exactly is the band? Moe girls in a rock band? Guessing they're pulling some mean strings of twinkle twinkle little stars. And if that's what you thought, than you are totally wrong, but it's ok we all thought that at first anyways so you're not alone friend.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nAh yes the story, a story of a freshman highschool girl name Yui, who's so clumsy and fumbles through life, you'd be like \"awwwh kawaiiiii\" but be like \"i worry about that girl\" at the sametime. What does she want to do with her highschool life? So far no idea but her procastination paid off, and good things comes to those who wait, and after waiting for a months she finally decides to join the light music club, and save it from the bring of being disbanded, you go hero! Yui along with Mio, Tsumugi, and club president Ritsu form the new the new light music club band (who's name will be decided a little bit into the future). But yes these girls who couldn't be so odd have managed to pull one killer band, how do they do it with lack of practice, care-free members, and lack of band knowledge? We don't know but they sure got one serious hat trick, talk about pulling off awesome performances on a whim. But the story isn't anything to work up with since it's usually mashed-up with super kawaii moments, so in a way there is a lack of story but you'll be so distracted you wouldn't even notice it until you look back at it, but it is enough of a story to overlook it and feel like nothing is wrong. It's more like a give or take sort of speak. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nAhh yes the KyoAni animation art style always showing-off it's cute style, and it pays off. Compare to other KyoAni titles these characters are not drawn with their face completely uplifted, their face is pretty well but together, their mouth atleast isn't all the way up to where their nose is suppose to be. It's not the best animation ever however but like I said Kyoto Animation focuses more on getting the cuteness rather than getting the \"realism\" and that's not such a bad thing, plus that being as a music anime, of course you'll see distortion in art style for quick paced shredding of the quitar and rolling of the drums, so it makes sense to draw it that way so it won't look like it lost quality, plus chibi-ish characters is always a plus. To some up the art style it's like if Lucky Star and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (the 2009 season of course) had a baby together so it has that bit of a weird look to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sounds was great, being a rock 'n' roll fan, I can say without a doubt, they nail some key notes. However for such heavy metal type of symbolism, and seeing that previous band were also metal band, this generation of \"light music\" gives off a bit more of a pop rock type of feel. I'm not talking about that Bon Jovi feel, more like Fall out boys sort of. Still regardless rock is rock regardless of the sub-genre and they showed it with this anime. Ahh the Jimi Hendrix, what love, what love so great haha. However the songs were beautiful very catchy, and fits the characters well. They're voices in English dub wasn't all that bad, but in Jap dub they were so kawaii and so soothing to hear. Just great work on sound. Great, great, great!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nSuch a high score, well bare with me and you'll see why. These character having their unique characteristic bouncing off of each like a pinpall machine gone crazy spewing out more pinpalls and smaking around that it gives off such a fresh feeling to it. Now of course these characters act more like elementary students instead of highschoolers, but when you look at previous KyoAni animes you will see that this pattern is alot more common, plus we become suckers and get reeled in anyways, moe characters gets our attention, of course there are people who don't feel this way, but that's ok that's their opinion and they got the right to it. Anyways let me list the charcaters for you real quick:\\n\\n\r\nYui Hirasawa: The main chika of this series, she is the lead quitarist and vocalist of the band, sounds like she's pretty top notch right? Ohh boy you are wrong, but right at the sametime. Sometimes forgetful of the things she learned while learning new things, she always finds a way to pull through, she has a die hard determination that comes second to none, despite all of her child-ish flaws, care-free and easily distracted, but yet has work ethic. How does she do it? It's on crazy on-and-off switch.\\n\\n\r\nMio Akiyama: The cutest, and voice of reason of the group, she is the bassist and secondary vocalist. When I say she is the voice reason, is because she is the only one with the most serious attitude towards the band, she does get convince to slack-off so she's not as tough as she seems out to be. She is super shy which gives off the cuteness meter everytime, also a major scary cat (so please refrain from bringing her into any scary movies) but she is very caring, and lovable and knows how to go against her weaknesses only to slap her right back in the face though.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi Kotobuki: Super rich air-head, who is just way too nice and absent-minded. She is the keyboarder of the band. Not much about her besides being super rich, and has the power to get everyone into a calm state with her never-ending supple of cakes and tea. Some power she got there.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu Tainaka: The one who basically reformed the club, the President, and the drummer. Super wild style and extremely energetic. She is the power-house of the band, but she is also as care-free as Yui. She usually scares Mio that's like her favorite hobby, she is somewhat of a voice of reason, but those moments get killed off be Mio's reselience. That's pretty much about her.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Nakano: The newest member of the band, and second quitarist. She is basically a workaholic all she cares about is practice, practice, practice, and wonders why she joined a club with such laidback members, eventually she pulls through out of this state just enough to accept that the band is the way how it is and there is no changing that, however she still wish they practiced more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 6.5\\n\r\nIt was a very entertaining watch, it had funny moments, cute moments, a surprising serious moment, and clutch-moments. It keeps a steady tempo (ha, see what I did there?) however the anime does feel a bit rushed especially the first half, actually the whole season, so pacing wise could've been worked so it would be more enjoyable, but it still has a good feel to it. Will you laugh your butt off? Well yeah maybe if you find the comedy humorous. Will you sing along? Only like 4 song is played and not for a long time, but hey if the music takes you away, then sing your little heart out, even if you're bad. But that aside just ask yourself this question, \"can i relate myself to this anime in one way or another?\" And I garuanteed you'll find enjoyement watching this; It doesn't have to be music wise, it can be struggle to accomplish something, or relate to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  6\\n\r\nThe anime was well put together, however it needed some improvement, you can get away with kawaii moments all you want but at the end without a base you just have a story that its all over the place. They should've added more drama to it, everything was taken too lightly without the feel of consequences and that just can't happen, there's not enough struggle to make an impact. Its a fun watch but its not something that can be memorable, You can say \"awwwwh this is sooo cute\" till pigs can fly, but it won't change the fact that the series was missing out on alot of things, but it tried to fill the gap and that I give them credit for the effort. But try to focus on the story more give it more depth instead of filtering it with easily distracting moments.\\n\\n\r\nWhew so to go back to my earlier statement of my \"goal\", is basically to give you guys a push to watch this anime as to me I believe it was very good, but I'm curious to see how many people look at it from my stand of view. Hope this was helpful to determine whether or not you'll watch it, thanks again for taking the time to read this, and happy watching.",

            "content": "Earlier in the week I dabbled in the manga; eh it's okay, kinda simplistic in the panels, and the arrangement of then confused me at first: instead of reading across the page you read in like columns. odd. \r\nSo already knowing the story for the first couple episodes, watching this episode was kinda meh because I already knew pretty much what was going to happen. But I must say, this is one series that I'll keep watching this season :)\r\nThe series follows four high school girls, juniors, who join the light music club. All the previous members were seniors and left the school, leaving theclub to be demolished. Tainaka Ritsu (drums) and Akiyama Moi (bass) decide they want to save the club! (Then Ritsu can become club president bwahaha) Soon after Kotobuki Tsumugi (keys) joins but their music teacher tells them they need at least four members for the club to stay afloat. Hirasawa Yui (guitar) joins for the sake of it, thinking it'll be something similar to grade-school music class. She then decides to leave but the rest of them wont have it! They persuade her with sweets and tea and eventually she gives in and joins. (isn't in this episode, but Tsumugi-chan comes from a wealthy family so she's forever bringing sweets and what-not to the club room). Now all Yui-chan needs to figure out is where to get a guitar...for 5000 yen...then learn to play it. (don't wanna spoil anything else XD)\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing that caught my eye when looking through upcoming anime was the character designs. (its usually what draws me to most anime to begin with) and the character designs in K-ON! are awesome :D very...Haruhi Suzumiya. Just overall goodness. Also while on the topic of Suzumiya, Ritsu-chan's character reminds me of her, her and a little bit of Hyakko (although Hyakko reminds me of Suzumiya as well...) very energetic with \"leadership\" qualities.\\n\\n\r\nStory, so far is good, although I'm a little biased cus I've read the manga, so I might not be as excited for it as others. It was one of the other things that enticed me into the series in the first place. Cus I'm a huge fan of Beck (I play guitar also) :). The background music during the show was a little...odd? to say the least, I didn't mind it, but at the same time it's not what i expected. Voice actors so far all seem to being doing an awesome job, nothings like \"wow wtf is up with their voice lawwl\" ... yet. \\n\\n\r\nOP! Is good in regards to animation, the song itself \"Cagayake! GIRLS\" sung by the seiyuu of the main four characters..I'm not sure who's voice is it but theres one thats kind of annoying, it's kinda high pitched and squeaky...The ED on the other hand: awesome. In both animation and audio. Again it's sung by the seiyuu but this ones just...better lol. And the animation is really good, just makes you excited for later in the series when they're an actual band :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an awesome series. A must watch this season for sure! :D",

            "content": "Yes, I believe this show is not worth watching. Is everything bad about it? No. I am absolutely impressed by the art in the opener. Never did I think an animator would accurately draw what it would actually look like for someone to play those instruments at that exact point in the music (check out the covers people do for the op). \r\nAnyway putting that aside, three main problems occurred for me when watching this show.\r\n1. Concept. It is a show about a music group getting together to play music, but a good portion, and I mean every scene except for a few, have verylittle to do with playing music.\\n\r\n2.Origin of Entertainment. From what I could get, enjoyment came from either looking at cute girls doing cute things, slice of life comedy, or both. \\n\r\n3. Characters. Look at the characters at the beginning of the show. Now look at them in the end, have they changed? No. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest concern was the concept behind the show. Answer these statements with only agree or disagree. These girls are making a band. They get together to play music. The best \"concert\" scene of the show is the opening. Now stop. Let's think for a moment. This show is about a group of girls forming a band and playing music, but the only time they are actually performing seems to be the opening of the show. I think my point is fairly clear, though I may be mistaking it and it is really just a slice of life anime centered around music. I guess it would make sense as it would avoid making it another Lucky Star (I also did not enjoy this either since it reminded me too heavily of the fact that I could be doing the same exact things the characters were doing rather than watching it). But even as a slice of life, the entertainment, comedy, was too heavily focused on the moe factor, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I want to watch cutesy anime girls talk about starting a band but never actually play music? The kind of entertainment you can get from this show is what I can get from looking up moe pictures online. It is probably different for everyone else, but that is what I assumed was the entertainment. There were some points where the slice of life did come into play, but I felt the slice of life was never truly entertaining nor funny. Sorry, I don't like watching the same gags slice of life tends to offer.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the characters. Most storytelling in any shape or form always has some kind of character development which changes the character's personality, ESPECIALLY in slice of life. The reason is that CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS A KEY ELEMENT OF MOST ENTERTAINMENT MEDIUMS USING STORYTELLING. Even if the characters supposedly got better at playing together as a band and learned their instruments, it was completely irrelevant to personalities of  the characters as they never really changed. This alone would not be a problem of there was something to be had from the  interactions between the characters, but I came to realize that the interactions were a little too realistic for me, as in, I was constantly asking myself, \"Hey, you could be doing this too, right? Why are you watching this then? Why are their interactions completely on the level of being plausible in reality minus a few things?\" \\n\\n\r\nThese interactions may have been to convey a sense of realism, but to me, they conveyed reality, which if you use anime as a form of entertainment to take your mind off of reality for a little. There were some moments that are clearly near impossible to find in your daily life, but the overall feel of the show, the entertainment, and the goal chasing are so easy to replicate with friends in real life that you might as well do it yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThus, as much as I would like to rave about the animation, the meat of the show is just too little for me to actually enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nTo break it down:\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+amazing opener animation\\n\r\n+a good representation of putting plan to action(minus some spots)\\n\r\n+enjoyable music\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-music was very limited\\n\r\n-little to no character development\\n\r\n-no need to watch the show for the same entertainment\\n\r\n-depended on moe for entertainment\\n\\n\r\nI know there are some people with opposing opinions, so if wish to refute me, feel free. I might give this show another chance if there is enough opposition, but for now, this is an accurate representation of my thoughts for the K-On",

            "content": "I've found K-On to be a fantastic light-hearted story with a refreshing lack of drama.  I think the reason it's stood out so much for me this season is that the carefree aesthetic of the show is really quite refreshing.  With other hard-hitting drama shows like Eden of the East are building tension and suspense through the whole episode, K-On gives an opposite approach, and really doesn't push any sort of seriousness on the viewer.  \r\nIgnoring the parameter of anime, even in American television shows these days, it seems like everything is over-dramatized and so many inconsequential scenarios are built up tobe a big deal.  In K-On, nothing is a big deal - it's seriously just a half-hour spot of relaxing, fun enjoyment.  This is the charm of K-On for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for excitement on a Gurren-Laggan-esque plane, K-On is not going to give it to you.  If you're looking for a panty-shot every other frame and an outlet to swoon over scantily clad girls, then K-On isn't going to give it to you (despite the entire cast being female, all of whom are absolutely adorable).  \\n\\n\r\nK-On is by no means a jaw-dropper, but there is a certain calm aesthetic about that I've never really seen in a show before.  It feels good to watch a group of best friends getting along and playing music (or more often, eating pastries and drinking tea), so if you're looking for an easy-to-watch show with no hidden, analyzable motifs that simply exists to put a smile on your face, I couldn't recommend anything more highly than K-On.",

            "content": "Okay, firstly to start off, I was persuaded by a friend to watch this and downloaded in batch so I sort of felt responsible to sit through the entire thing.\r\nTo start off. I'm not much of a writer. Its my second attempt at a review (first being completely shot down and its kind of an embarrassment now that I think about it...) So I'm going to try to follow a template of sorts with \r\nthe help of that rating bar at the top.\r\nTo open. K-On! was a drag. The fact I even mention that bit at the top pretty much makes it seem like Iforced myself through it. And I did. Its supposed to be a slice of life anime, usually slice of life anime starts off with a slow pace and work on getting you to like the character. And then quickly go into a deeper plot that keeps you wanting to know more. But it \\n\\n\r\nStory : K-On! has no story. Okay maybe that is exaggeration but it is close enough. The general plot is about 4 girls who join a school's music club to save it. Thats pretty much solved in the first few episodes and after that plot is thrown off a cliff. Then there is the theme! Music. Which seems to have been more of an excuse to start the series off rather than and the actual point of the story, there are a few points in the story where music is implemented but it feels forced and they are pretty forgettable. Most of the time is spent in their music room eating cake and listening to them talk about mundane things like in Lucky Star. The only difference being that its not funny. A plot is supposed to be about problems and solving them, but everything in this anime seems to be just work out. Yui can't play any instruments, she also can't read notes. So somebody tell me how this fits the realism part of \"slice of life\" anymore...\\n\\n\r\nArt : This part of K-On! is what people love or hate. The art can be seen by some as simplistic to add to the light-hearted feel of the anime. Other can say it is poorly drawn with little attention to detail and makes it feel unprofessional. I go with the second view. The manga's cover illustrations were pretty good though. Although that is off topic.\\n\\n\r\nSound : Pretty much the only song that I found mildly appealing was the first OP Cagayake Girls!, the ED Don't Say Lazy seemed to have generated quite some interest from the fanbase but I wasn't my taste. The insert songs slotted in here and there in episodes were dry and made me feel like an idiot listening to them. They really should know when to limit the entire moe moe kyun thing here. It seems to be their only selling point. I already compared it to one show with Aya Hirano so might as well again. Even the God Knows bit from Haruhi alone is more enjoyable than any of the songs here. And it wasn't even a music anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : At the start there is a little bit of development with the four girls. But after that it pretty much centers on Yui being a complete retard. I would normally say this would be cliched but most idiot anime characters actually have good points at times that redeem them. Yui fails to do so.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : It seemed interesting at first. But it quickly went into the gutter with the originality and actual story. I'm guessing if you are that kind of person you would like this anime, but for myself I found it to be a drag and uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Another Robert's Too Late Reviews is here to blast into your eyes! Today we're going to be talking about the well-known series K-On! First few details to note is we're working the dub, and we'll be including both season 1 and 2 and Live House, basically everything but the movie as they all have a similar theme, tone, appearance, and style. The short of it is that I found some points a little lacking with this series, yet the overall upbeat and fun presentation really made up for its missteps and made it an anime to remember! Even though this anime doesn't give me roomfor my philosophical musings, still read on for the more mundane details, and to see if HTT makes the RTLR wall of musical madness! (You might be surprised!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is your usual slice-of-life fare, whether it be school festivals, studying for exams, trips to the beach, what have you, nothing we've not seen done a billion times before. In the first season there's an opening arc concerning saving the Light Music Club but those quickly dissipate, and the only other overriding theme becomes hijinks based on the girls' various personalities. In the second season there is hints about the concern for the future of the Club, but they never really go anywhere, and are hand waved away by the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe weakness in the story starts early, with our main, Yui, joining the Light Music Club rather by mistake than anything else. She has no apparent musical experience, yet is able to pick up the guitar and basically rock out on it from nearly day one. She is at first the only guitarist, and is able to play lead well enough to impress a crowd. As I've mentioned in other reviews such as Hibike Euphonium (another great musical anime) I'm a veteran musician, and not to brag, but one blessed with a good bit of natural talent. I tried to learn the guitar after knowing how to read music, and being proficient with several wind instruments and playing in general, and let me tell ya, it takes more than just a few weeks of practice to play a guitar at a level that doesn't just make all the alleycats yowl, let alone impress a crowd. Yui's sudden skill on an axe is wildly inaccurate from my experience. \\n\\n\r\nThis is compounded by the fact that Yui is a total airhead, who seems to be doing good to remember her own name, let alone chords, scales, or even rudimentary musical theory. In fact later in season 1 and throughout the rest of the show, when the second guitarist Azusa joins, who in fact is a practiced guitarist, she regularly comments on how clueless Yui is regarding playing, yet seems to always jam out when the time comes. I wish getting on stage was enough to turn me from fumbling Bob to Jimi Hendrix. Guess I'm not Yui though. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting point is that this anime is about the band formed in the Light Music Club, and how they play several functions here and there, yet is mainly NOT about the music. If you were expecting Love Live or Idolmaster where the music is actually performed, you're going to be a bit disappointed. They occasionally play a hook or a bit more, but we're never privy to any full blown playing outside of the theme songs. In fact, second guitarist Azusa's biggest personality feature throughout the series is that she is a serious musician and the band NEVER practices. She grumbles about that all the way to basically the end, constantly amazed at how the band comes together at crunch time. I am too, honestly. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that complaining, how can I rate this as a 9 overall? Because in spite of these flaws, the show is an absolute blast, with fairly rapid fire comedy sequences, playing on the personalities of the various girls and their relations to each other. The stereotypical personalities appear, but they work well, and put together in the manner that K-On arranges them just works so much better than one might expect. The day to day hijinks might be a bit predictable, but they are pulled with aplomb and often brought me to literally laugh out loud. \\n\\n\r\nIn the slice-of-life genre, you need characters to be memorable to remain viable. Without characters that stick with us, there's little point in watching as the events are always the same, with only slight variations. We know there's going to be a school event or festival of some kind, there's going to be a winter/Christmas episode, we know there's going to be an exam show, etc. If you don't have characters that handle these in unique ways, you're going to have the show get lost in the shuffle. I think of shows such as Maria-sama ga Miteru and their serious interpersonal relationships in this genre, or perhaps the lusty and silly Yamada from Yamada's First Time. Thing is, you have to have characterizations that we want to remember to work.\\n\\n\r\nK-On does this, with rapid fire Ritsu, or worrying Azusa, or scaredy cat Mio, or rich and naive Mugi, and so forth. These girls, interacting together, equal more than the sum of their parts. They end up being more than silly girls doing silly things, and rise up and leave their marks on us as an audience. Their takes on each other are also interesting, as they learn and grow in their friendships. A few of them have been friends for a long time, but not all, the main Yui, and the second guitarist Azusa are new recruits when they join, and they are a blast to watch as they interact and discover things about their new friends. \\n\\n\r\nRounded out with some interesting side characters, such as the teacher with a heavy metal past, a student council president that seems to secretly want to rock, and a little sister who inherited her own brains and Yui's as well, and you have a cast that carries infectious energy and makes the whole retread of slice-of-life milestones a new and fun experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe only thing that saved this from being just 'fair' is the instruments. The instruments look very good, are well drawn. I love K-On greatly, but beautifully animated, it is not. There are lots of spots with very awkward animations and odd looking elements. Hands especially seem to be a difficult thing for the artists, as there are several instances I saw where hands looked kind of deformed or out of shape. The girls are all unique enough looking, but rather plain looking. They get the job done, no doubt, but they are just not all that pleasing to the eye, the instruments being the exception. Again, this is a section that becomes less relevant as the characters and comedy bits come into play and draw our focus away from how it all looks to how fun the girls are. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nWhat playing we do hear the girls do in the series is well enough done, and a lot of fun to jam to, but it could use to have more of it. They mention several song titles throughout the series, and I always wanted to hear them, but never did. I kept thinking, cmon throw me a bone and actually play 'Rice is a Side Dish'! Alas it was not to be. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of playing, the themes are an absolute blast. The first theme opens with this really heavy sounding guitar riff and then splashes into Yui's high pitched singing which you do NOT expect. I was thinking Judas Priest, and I got Japanese teen. It is so funny it's cool. The first opener for season 2, Go Go Maniac, is even better, as we get a nearly rapping Yui throwing down. The final opener is good as well. \\n\\n\r\nEven better than the opener is all three closers. They are sang by Mio, who by far has the superior vocals and the songs are not silly, at least in presentation, if not in lyrics, and are presented as legitimate rocking songs. They work well. I really liked 'Listen' the first closer on the second season. They were all enjoyable, however. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work in the dub was pretty well done. Ritsu sounded really bright, Mio's deeper voice is fitting for her leadership-like role, and Mugi sounds as sweet as she acts. Yui's voice is very close to the annoying level, but she never quite steps over the line. Gets real close at times, however.  Other characters are appropriately done, Student Council member Nodaka stands out as being well played to me. The teacher/advisor for the band is played well also, old enough to be believable and humorous when she does her bits, but young enough not to be totally unacceptable when she speaks of her past as a rocker. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nHere's where we get into the fun. The characters are what sets this apart from any number of forgettable slice-of-life anime. Yui, our main, is completely airheaded and scattered-brained. She is a lot like Kotori of Love Live if you are familiar. Yui is forever forgetting things, sometimes even her guitar (which she's named Gita) when it comes time to go to practice or to play a gig. An aside, the girl just starts guitar and grabs up a badass Les Paul? Damn girl! She relies on everyone else, and her own carefree attitude to carry her through, and for the most part, this approach works. She does seem to be serious about playing well enough with the band as to not embarrass herself or her friends. She puts her heart into things, but unfortunately her mind tends to wander. She's the butt of a lot of jokes, especially from Ritsu. She can be a bit hard to watch sometimes, as her antics ride the line of getting old, but she balances it out mostly. \\n\\n\r\nRitsu the drummer is bright, cheery mostly, and is the quick witted one of the group, always handy with a joke or snide comment. She's also the one burning with determination, and once she decides on a course of action, she pushes through until her goals are achieved, whether it be playing a new song, or going to the beach to play in the sun. She tends to fall more towards Yui in the fact that she's pretty carefree, and is loathe to do any paperwork, but isn't quite so forgetful and turned around as Yui. \\n\\n\r\nMio is the bassist who is the unofficial leader, the responsible one, and the one most likely to freak out. She has stage fright, she gets scared over the littlest thing (much to Ritsu's delight) and is the one that advocates the responsible course of action. She often is on the same side of issues as Azusa, even though the responsible pair is outnumbered by the others. Mio sees to the others enough to get everything done that needs to, and kind of holds the ship together as Yui and Ritsu steer it off into the great blue yonder. \\n\\n\r\nMugi is the keyboardist who comes from a super rich family, and is the typical naive and sweet girl. She brings tea and dishes that royal families across the world use, putting them out nonchalantly as if she was using Spongebob paper cups. She also has little 'real' world experience, being awed by fast food and shopping in a 'regular' store and such. She's kind to a fault but always tends to fall with the airheads of the group in any situation requiring input, much to Mio's exasperation. \\n\\n\r\nLater in season 1 the band adds Azusa, a girl a year younger than the rest of the band who is the straight man for Yui and Ritsu's comedy and bits. Azusa is that band member that's always yelling about practicing, going on and on about technique and skill, and being a general pain. If you've ever played in a band, whether it be a rock band, or even a wind and brass band, you should know at least one, if not more, people who fit this very role. Azusa is thwarted as always by Yui and Ritsu and their irresponsible ways. Azusa even comes to points where she considers quitting the band, but finds that her friendships are too important, and the fact the girls can perform when crunch time comes convinces her to stay. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting character Ui, Yui's sister (no typo) is the real support behind Yui, making sure she is well taken care of at all times. Ui is younger than her guitar jamming sister, but acts much more like a big sister or even mother for the errant high schooler. She supports the band in general, and is good friends with Azusa, being the same age. In fact it is slightly hinted that she might well follow Yui's footsteps in the band as well, after Yui graduates. \\n\\n\r\nThe final character to mention is the funny faculty advisor, Ms. Sawako Yamanaka, or as the girls call her, Sawa-chan. She has history with the Club, as a band member herself back when she was in school, though this is something she's desperate to hide. She also gets very wrapped up in their doings, making them costumes and being a bit of a comedy player, often acting as a foil for Ritsu, and vice versa. She's a lot of fun and has a few really great episodes as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis is where my overall comes from, if it's not apparent, I just adore K-On, because it is more than just a slice-of-life, and more than just a music anime. It's both neither those things, and both stereotypically so at times. Its not all that great animated but yet is fun and easy enough on the eyes. The music isn't played as much as it should, but is present enough to give a good feel for who the band is, and is upbeat and fun when you hear it. This anime is somehow its parts, and yet more at the same time. It's a blast to watch. I can't explain it really in words. After coming off heavy fare like some of my latest watches, and prior to another 'heavier' series I have coming soon, it's a big break to see something light and fluffy. This is exactly what it seems, fluffy show for fluffy viewing.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll get back to the seriousness real soon, I promise. This review feels light to me but then again, K-On is a light show, about the Light Music Club, so it works I guess. If you like musical type shows like Love Live or Idolmaster you might be at home here. If you like cute girls doing cute things like Girls und Panzer, you might like what you see. If you just want to watch something without having to think too hard, just laugh and kick back, check this one out! As for the RTLR wall, no one from the show made the wall at all! Not a single one! In fact then ENTIRE band scored 7 inch figures on the shelves of anime goodness, a much higher honor! Two thumbs up!",

            "content": "Looking at the score, you might think I belong to the 'Anti K-ON' fraction. I am not necessarily a hater, since in terms of slice-of-life genre, K-ON is better than most anime out there. \r\nIf you want to look at this series on the positive light, think of it as a filler. Think of it as a plotless story with cute girls gathering and playing around. Think not of it as a story about the birth of a band.\r\nThere is almost no character development nor conclusion. K-ON simply offers light and fluffy heart-warming skits for your pleasure. Yet, the characters of K-ON sufficiently meet theexpectation, especially for the male audiences. I mean, who will not be enthralled by seeing a girl as cute and seductive as Mio? Will there be any lolicon (sorry) out there be not thrilled with Asuza?\\n\\n\r\nHow unrealistic and forgettable K-ON is, it is still an adequate entertainment to spend your free time. It is nothing sort of Beck, which is indeed a true music anime. It wants to achieve the excellence of the likes of Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh, yet it is still missing an emotional element that all otakus out there need: the interaction with the audience. K-ON never attempts to break the fourth wall and make fun of popular culture. Its music is okay for the standard of J-pop but not that impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is 'easy come, easy go' for the five girls of the Light Music Group. Nothing more, nothing less.",

            "content": "K-ON! First caught my attention by it's adorable artwork and it's big fanbase. Though it didn't turn out as good as thought it might.\r\nStory: I gave the story of K-ON! a 5. Mediocre. The story revolves around a girl who decides to make a band with a few new friends she has made after joining the music club-but she can't even play anything yet. The story follows her as she learns to play guitar and has fun with her friends. And there's not that much else to it. The story can get boring at times and tends to repeat itself after a while. So overallthe story isn't the best factor to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As I said before the artwork was what originally got my attention. The artwork is cute but they all tend to have the same face and there's nothing very unique for each character. So I gave the art an 8. It's very good and cute but if you don't like moe sort of art than I suggest you don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I gave the sound a 9. The sound is probably the best thing about this anime. The backround music isn't too distracting and it fits the anime's mood. Since this anime is all about a girl who joins a band, there is a lot of music that they perform. It's fun and cute to listen to so if you are looking for some girly japanese pop singing, you might want to listen to these songs they perform on your own time instead of going through with watching this anime. As for the voice acting-it is very moe and they all tend to sound the same. None of the characters voices are too high-pitched which can sometimes end up happening when you watch an anime that has cute or moe characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character category got a 4 from me. The character design on this anime was horrible. Although the artwork is cute, they all have the exact same faces and characteristics. There isn't much individuality in this anime. As for the characters' personalities, they each have their thing but nothing spectacular. There's the rich girl, the loud girl, the shy, big-boobed girl, and the confused, innocent protagonist. Nothing new here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime is a boring slice-of-life. I found none of the jokes or experiences in K-ON! very funny. The most enjoyment I got out of it was listening to the music they performed and maybe the few jokes here and there. But over-all the enjoyment section gets a 5 from me.\\n\\n\r\nSo over-all I would give it a 5. It's really no the best anime out there. Though it has a large fanbase, I wouldn't recommend watching this anime. It bored me to death and I don't think it's worth wasting time on.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! I hope you found it helpful! ^^",

            "content": "\"FUWA FUWA TIME!\"\r\nWhat compels us, as a human race, to create music? What gives us the motivation and encouragement to create audible works of art?\r\nAny one of us (musically-inclined, anyway) would say the joy comes from the instrument itself - that creating unique sound different from the human voice gives us power and creativity in a form never known before. Plus playing music can be fun and enjoyable, a way to relax and keep the day young.\r\nIn K-ON!, this is just the opposite. The characters typically tried NOT to play, except for a few select times. And when they did, it was never serious norenjoyable. In fact, the story seemed to revolve around that there was no story. Interesting paradox. Throughout the story (actually, it's more like pieces of a story - random side-notes and whatnot that leave you sort of hanging at the end), Mio, Yui, Ritsu, and Mugi tend not to do much besides eat and procrastinate. There, I said it. This is the perfect show if you like to procrastinate (and don't you be saying you don't. Everyone enjoys avoiding work from time to time). \\n\\n\r\nIt does become serious at certain points, and the characters do develop (more or less) slightly. And what's not to like about their rock-n-roll style that incorporates girly lyrics? I'm a guy, and I enjoyed the songs, finding myself at least humming or tapping my foot to their surprisingly catchy tunes. The OP and ED are quite good - the songs have made their way onto my Ipod, and I thoroughly enjoy humming the tune whenever I'm thinking hard. The light-hearted style of the songs keep me coming back for more.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those slice-of-life anime, with many references to moe and whatnot. I'm not saying that's bad, but if you're not really into no story and pointless segments of video that don't really seem to tie into the main plot all that much, this isn't the anime for you. I did enjoy it, however, despite my disappointment of the overall story. At the end of every episode, you get this kind of happy-giddy feeling, like doing something crazy for the first time. You simply become addicted, and you want some more K-ON! to fill your hungry soul.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the strong suit of this anime is the sound - I cannot stress that enough. The songs are good overall and the OP and ED are great - check them out, at least. I know how it feels to pick up an instrument for the first time, and it's a one-of-a-kind sort of feeling, one that leaves you standing there with infinite possibilites of what to do. K-ON! does seem to nail this feeling, and leave you with a happy go lucky attitude at the end. However, viewer discretion is advised: watch for the moe!",

            "content": "If someone were to ask the typical anime fan what do they think of K-On? The typical response what would be phrases such as, \u201cohh that moeshit\u201d or \u201cthat kyoani bullshit that began the cancerous product known as moe\u201d. To a certain extent they are right. While K-On itself is not an atrocious anime to watch,(although it might be depending on how much you can tolerate cute girls) it is no lie that K-On is the title that really brought the moe trend into the forefront and is the trend that has shaped the identity of modern anime. And it\u2019s not that this trend wasn\u2019tpopular before K-On\u2019s domination of sales charts. Kyoto Animation has an infamous track record for taking advantage of this trend's popularity to fill their pockets. The success of anime such as Air, Kanon, Clannad and The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya have proved the formula\u2019s success before K-On and it convinced Kyoto Animation that this was certainly the next big thing in the industry and they have every right to take advantage of it. Despite what many people believe about Kyoto Animation shows from a critical standpoint nobody can deny their financial success. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd K-On fits exactly into that category. It was made for more for the purpose of making money rather than receiving numerous amounts of awards and basked in critical acclaim. There is nothing wrong with that. After all, anime is a business and making money is just the normal procedure that defines every business. K-On doesn\u2019t do much to separate itself from the typical moeblob though. Throughout the course of the show it barely takes itself seriously. The majority of the run time the characters are just participating in goofy events or drinking tea making fun of each other. The tone of the show is consistently goofy throughout and whatever potential is there for some character drama and conflict comes out as a joke more than anything else. It would be a ridiculous to even say this show has a plot,  it COULD have had one if it decided to take whatever little plot elements it focused on them in a much more serious manner by placing more significance on them and using them as a wat to initiate conflict to give the characters some ACTUAL challenges\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to really say about the characters in a general sense, since they are only defined by a couple of gimmicks and don\u2019t offer any real substance. I can\u2019t really say much when it comes to the tropes of moe since I have little to no prior experience with it before watching K-On. But the endearing and extremely likable cast helped redeem K-On from it\u2019s lack of character depth. Their cast chemistry is cute and their personalities complement each other well and as a result create some funny and sweet moments throughout the series. It is hard to pinpoint which characters the show tries to focus on as there is not really much to say in terms of characterization or development and the whole cast is usually on screen at once and no one really has the individual spotlight for a whole episode.  Since the cast is small I will personally describe each characters personality and traits:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Yui is very carefree, easy going and is often the biggest comedic relief out of the cast. She is often being clumsy and making a fool out of herself in front of the other characters. Another thing that adds to her humorous character is her knack for often not reading instructions before trying out things and instead prefers to rely on her hunch or intuition. She is easily distracted and tends to try and find any excuse possible to not practice and only feels motivated to play her instrument if she eats a fill of cake.\\n\\n\r\n-Ritsu is the character who is always looking to make fun of  everyone around her through sarcastic puns and humour. She is the biggest entertainer of the group and my favourite for her very comical personality and wittiness. Similarly to Yui she is easy going and upbeat but doesn\u2019t share Yui\u2019s clumsiness and is more composed than she is.\\n\\n\r\nMio- Mio always tries to keep the group grounded to reality when they continue to be senselessly stupid and reminding them more often than not of their obligation to practice. She is the most serious and mature member of the group and doesn\u2019t participate in her friends\u2019 witty banter\u2019 or routine of \u2018milk and cookies\u2019 as much as they do. Most of Ristu\u2019s continual teasing of Mio is how prone she is to getting embarrassed when she is put into the spotlight as highlighted when pressure is put on her to sing the lyrics during performances.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi- Tsumugi is a lot more passive and quiet in comparison to the other members of the group and doesn\u2019t really talk much. Similarly to Mio she is a little more level headed and mature than Yui and Ritsu. It feels as if she does not get as much screen time or focus compared to the other characters and as a result she is a lot duller. She is the most cheerful character in the show and often thinks about other people before herself. Because of her dullness her character doesn\u2019t have any flair compared to the other characters. Ritsu has sarcasm which makes her witty. Yui is extremely clumsy which makes her cute and Mio is a lot more responsible compared to the rest. Tsumugi feels as if she is just there to give them free holiday resorts and supply the daily dose of tea for me.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the show are 1-D that can be described with a few words and nothing more.  The show attempts to freshen things by adding a new character to the main and it certainly worked. The new addition to the squad served as a counter to the ridiculous theatrics the main cast engage in and is someone who takes their music a whole lot more seriously in the same vein as Mio. This made for some nice short lived conflict but it just wasn\u2019t taken seriously enough for me to care and it ultimately proved to be pointless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t an easy task to try and describe what the story of K-On is in multiple paragraphs because there really isn\u2019t one. Apart from a squad of cute girls drinking tea and occasionally playing music no other story elements such as romance or drama are present. And despite what many people say about K-On being a musical and that it\u2019s all about practicing to achieve your dreams, K-On lacks any sort of focus on these elements to even take them seriously as they all feel like backdrops rather than the spotlight. There was also potential for K-On to be a story about fitting in and making new friends. Both of these themes have been done countless times in anime with a high school setting but it would have been a good addition to spice things up and give the show some kind of plot. But K-On decided to just frolic around and not take any of its potential story elements seriously. If the show itself doesn\u2019t take these elements seriously, why should I? It would have given the show an extra layer and more substance if it spent some time taking the music aspect of the show seriously or adding some high school romance. Having some form of conflict would have made the characters feel a little more authentic and not just being \u2018moeblobs\u2019 that can be described by a few overused tropes and enjoyed on a superficial level.\\n\\n\\n\r\nK-On certainly is enjoyable when looked at only on the surface. The character designs are fairly generic but are still attractive to look at thanks to the excessive cuteness that Kyoani put into them and their good artwork in general. The backgrounds are plain and do not offer anything in the grand scheme of things but still are some nice eye candy. The visuals are colorful and fit well with the goofy tone of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow the only aspect of K-On where I could REALLY give the show any credit for is its music. The fast paced j-pop songs are quite catchy and I even re-listened to them a few times. The sound directing all round is very good and I found both the opening and ending to be nice to listen to. But those catchy songs were far and few between. For a show that is meant to be a musical they certainly didn\u2019t have enough of them to warrant it being called that. But nonetheless the songs were enjoyable even if they were far and few between. The OST for K-On was simultaneously upbeat and goofy, which fit the mood of what was happening on screen and helped put an even bigger smile on my face than I already had when watching comedic scenes. Other than that it was forgettable and didn\u2019t have any other impact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I may think of K-On critically, I cannot deny that I enjoyed it for what it was and it helped open my mind a little to the over saturated genre of \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019. When I scroll through seasonal charts and look at all the countless \u2018CGDCT\u2019 titles made, one of the first things that strikes me is how low budget and lifeless they look. It\u2019s as if they were made for the soul purpose of barely breaking even. But I can appreciate the fact that Kyoani give their generic moe shows life and look as if they are putting effort into it. They don\u2019t want it to just break even, they want it to demolish the sales charts and they have succeeded on more than one occasion. K-On has a good sense of fun, an endearing cast and some nice music, but that\u2019s all I can really say about it. It is extremely shallow and offers nothing but shits and giggles. If you are looking for an anime to wind down to you after a long day of work, or something that will make you forget about your shit life than I suggest giving K-On a try. Despite all the things I heard about moe being cancerous, for what K-On as, it wasn\u2019t all that bad. Watching \u2018cute girls doing cute things won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s thing and it isn\u2019t my favorite thing to watch either, but this one is worth a shot for the fun of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:5.5/10  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a great guilty pleasure. Really.\r\nIf you've seen scanlations of the manga, this is essentially an expanded version of the 8 panel strip with real music and less raunchiness. (sorry, no Mio cameltoe or sensei boob grabs iin this one).\r\nThe plot is simple. Four girls start a keion (popular music) club. \r\nThe characters equally simple: Yui: klutz, goofy, lazy. Mio: shy, tsundere, moe. Ritsu: token tomboy. Mugi: token rich girl lesbo. Throw in bipolar sensei and painfully cute nee-chan and you have most of the cast. \r\nWith that said,. the characters are lovable, the animation style is very lively with evocative gestures (i.e. thecharacters don't just stand there and talk at each other, motionless), and everyone is so cute it'll either captivate you, give you cavities, or make you into a murderous psychopath.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story. Does there have to be? It's a pure slice of life anime with humorous characters and scenarios. Nothing too original here. But it's funny to see the Japanese mention Jeff Beck or Hendrix, or that the girls' sensei is some death metal punk rocker.\\n\\n\r\nThere are original music pieces in the anime, and they actually make an effort to make it look and sound like they did their homework with the music, which sounds like typical bubblegum J-Pop. Thankfully it's not overdone, and comes across as endearing and neither bland or Kajiura-ish. No flourishing violins set to the backdrop of explosions and flying robots, thank god.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a simple anime, but it does all things well and comes across as very fun, harmless, and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's really hard not to love the characters.",

This is the kind of show where you don't have to watch it in high-brain-power mode. You can just chill, turn off your brain almost completely and still get the concept. There are moments in this show that will make you laugh and some that will nearly make you cry. \r\nIif you are looking for in-depth character development in a series, K-On! will not exactly offer that to you. Ritsu, Mio, Mugi, Yui, and Azusa did have some character development butnot to the point where it will satisfy your need (most likely). Also, each character have their own interesting personalities that make the show even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show is named K-On! (keion for light music), you will not really get the hardcore music scenes and songs that you'd want. If you look at this show as a music club with 5 girls, you will be pretty much disappointed if you take it from that point of view. If you look it at the other way, 5 girls who come together because of music, you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIn brief, I recommend K-On! if you're looking for a moe anime that will give you the lulz, but don't expect it to be really deep because its based after a 4-koma manga after all.",

That is horrible animation. It's not always that bad, everything looks fine while the show keeps being a comedy, but as soon as it tries to portray fine movements, it fails. Which is surprising, because the instrument handling looks good to me, they are not looking like they play, they actually play. But an awkward character design (they try WAY too hard to make the characters look cute) and cringeworthy movement animation make this anime unpleasant to watch.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music the girls play is pretty good. It's random J-pop, but it's done very well. The ending song is actually really, really good. The opening is your standard cutesy happy song, but it works for K-On. So, what's the problem? THEY NEVER FUCKING PLAY! In 9 episodes they played like, 2 or 3 times. This should be the average of an episode if the anime is about a band.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nPeople have talked about no character development in K-On, which I don't think is a big problem in slice of life shows. The problem are the characters themselves. They are so incredibly bland that some of them don't even qualify as characters. For example, take Mugi out of the anime. Now, what is different? If they aren't non-existant, they are annoying. Yui and Ritsu are people I would never want to get involved with in real life, yet they are supposed to be likeable. The only character that I kinda liked was Mio.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI knew that K-On could be considered boring, even people who liked it told me. But boy, was I in for a snore fest. I found myself constantly looking at the leftover playtime and groaning after realizing that I was only 5 minutes in, not 15. It wouldn't even be that bad if I could say K-On was terrible, because it wasn't. It was just...nothing. If you want an anime about music, stay away from K-On. If you wanna watch cute girls being cutesy, try it, though there are better alternatives. All you do is watching people waste time, eventually wasting YOUR time.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n2.4/10",

            "content": "K-on started out as a short comic strip manga. It became absurdly popular and has since been adapted into two TV anime, two OVAs, a film and a PSP game. Is it popular for a reason or does its popularity have nothing to do with quality? Let's take a look at the first anime and find out.\r\nThe story of K-on begins with a pair of girls named Mio and Ritsu who decide to join the soon to be abolished light music club. They soon find a third member, Mugi, but they need one more to keep the club alive. Enter Yui, a girl with noidea what light music is or even how to read music. To save their club, the group convinces her to join and learn how to play the guitar. The series follows a linear structure, but most of it just focuses on the everyday lives of the girls as they learn together and have fun. Overall the series does a good job of setting up interesting situations for the characters and executing them in a way that's fun to watch. Humour is used as a major element and it's almost always used to great effect. One issue I do have is that the girls overcome all their problems really easily. Especially Yui who quickly learns how to play the guitar with only minor problems. But it's not a huge issue since it does fit the show's lighthearted aesthetic well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a little under-developed. Most of them follow tropes without ever really deviating from those tropes. The characters do interact well with each other and with the situations they get into. They also get some development, but they never get fully fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. It's pretty distinctive and the backgrounds are really vivid and well done. They occasionally do strange things with it, but they don't go overboard and it generally works for the scene. One problem I do have with it is that they can't seem to draw noses but that is a pretty small complaint. My biggest complaint is that the art can be lazy at times but overall it does suit the series well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done. It's not the best I've heard, but Toyoskai Ai, Kotobuki Minako, Satou Satomi and the rest of the main cast all do well with their roles. The music is one of the strong points of the series. They manage to make the girls sound like a skilled but still inexperienced band which strengthens the series' premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 6/10. All of the main five girls share some really homoerotic moments, especially Yui with anyone. I especially like the way Mugi responds to several of these moments by getting really excited and generally being a yuri fan girl. Although there are a lot of these moments, they never move into the realm of canon with them.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for K-on is an 8/10. It has some issues, but they're generally pretty insubstantial and shouldn't affect anyone's enjoyment too much. Overall it's a lot of fun to watch and uses humour well. If you're a fan of Azumanga Daioh or Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight you'll probably enjoy K-on as well.",

            "content": "This is a review of both of K-on's seasons, spoilers and stuff warning here. \r\nK-on was one of the first slice of life/school club/girls doing things shows I watched. It was one of the first because I got told by a lot of people on several websites, anime \"experts\" and lists it was one of the best anime shows ever and I saw it talked about and memed just enough to give it a try. Upon my initial viewing of it, my opinion was that it wasn't the best anime show ever, but that it was the slightest bit above average. I had some reservationswith it then, but I could generally understand what people liked about it or at least I did until I started watching a lot of shows like this. I really like to try and see what people like about something like this so I even went through the trouble of watching the second excruciatingly long season and listen to some of the songs independently. My enthusiasm of this rather than grow just keeps getting lower and lower the more I tried to understand it's appeal. How do I put this... I find it hard to bluntly state what I find wrong about this show in clear terms on it's own, so let me illustrate the broader issue with it, by pitching my own anime here: \\n\\n\r\nI have this really great idea for an anime show, it will be about a school club. It will start with one girl but over the span of a season or possibly just the first episode we will introduce each new girl in the show. We will have about four to ten of them. We don't want to have too little because we want to cover all the obvious types and flavors possible in terms of desirability.  We also don't want to have too many because we don't want to dilute the character pool or run into redundant archetypes. Each one will have different hair and eye colors and possibly if we have time after doing everything else regarding their looks we might write them a differing personality to distinguish them a little bit. We wont actually make them interesting, we will just give them one defining character trait like they're the seven dwarves. Angry, Mopey, shy, arrogant, submissive, smart-erish kinda and of course the \"motherly\" one that works from behind the scenes and convinces one of the angry ones that they really want to be a part of the school clubs fun times as well. \\n\r\nAside from this their faces and basic body structure will be so similar it's almost as if we just palette swapped some features onto a generic body and head, because we did. Some of the girls will be reluctant to join the club at first and maybe even two of them will seemingly be obstinately against the clubs existence at the start, but through the power of friendship and smiling as we utter each others first names and without honorifics as we all agreed \"tee hee,\" we will come to realize the necessity of being part of this awesome school club experience. Also with the aforementioned \"motherly\" types help. There will be some hardships along the way and some of the girl's might regret even trying to accomplish what they're attempting with this school club, but our plucky main character will keep things going with her nonstop \"can-do\" attitude. Will make the clubs existence a necessity beyond this because... The school is being shut down because no one enrolls there or something that isn't good like that is going to happen if:\\n\\n\r\n-the school astronaut club doesn't complete it's first successful manned mission to Mars by the end of first term. \\n\r\n-the school plumbing club cant clean out all of the cities disgusting sewers by the end of the fourth week of school. \\n\r\n-the school astro-physics club cant prove the existence of dark matter after a week of light studying. \\n\r\n-the school hentai club cant accurately depict inaccurate body proportions and graceful sensuous movement by this afternoon. \\n\r\n-the school music club cant put on a professional level musical event with immaculate singing and dancing after three months of work. \\n\r\n-the school ninja club cant eliminate all of the targeted foreign leaders by next Wednesday.\\n\r\n-the school general practitioners club cant pap smear all the students in a ninety day period. \\n\r\n-the school art club has to help the hentai club in the prequel sequel where we have to save the school in three different time lines that converge into Picard playing Poker with the crew. \\n\\n\r\nYeah will do something like that to slightly raise the dramatic tension. We will have an episode where the girls go to the beach, at least one scene at the hot springs and we will have one where they go to a mall and/or that one shopping district in Tokyo. If they live in the city we will have them visit the country and if they live in the country we will have them visit the city. If they live in Tokyo or Kyoto we will have to by law mention how much different Osaka is at least once if not multiple times. If they live in Osaka, this is impossible because they only exist in the same way that \"Thebes\" exists in Athenian tragedies as a place that is referenced and used as a setting to reference \"others\" but doesn't really exist as is. Will definitely have an episode where they all sleep under the same roof and pillow fight, but to be \"funny\" one of the girls will be grumpy and not having a good time, but in the end she too will join in the fun. <HILARIOUS HIJINKS HERE>. After all these heartwarming moments, the girls will accomplish the thing we want them to accomplish in the end and we will have at least one scene of them all smiling about it and possibly a musical number about how great the experience was even if the show doesn't have anything to do with music. \\n\\n\r\nWill try to keep the uniquely Japanese things the girls do at an absolute minimum as to not scare or confuse dumb western audiences too much. I don't know maybe will say the word \"senpai\" once or twice so they can meme about it, but aside from that will go full western to the extent that we believably can. The whole idea of a school club is \"patronizing\" to American's whose schools cant even get funding for the basics let alone extra curricular clubs, because rich politicians and the people they represent need an excuse to lower their taxes and poor kids enjoying themselves on the riches dime is just too much to ask for and they cant vote yet anyway, so fuck'em. In spite of this we think they can mix the idea of school and clubs together enough to understand the concept. \\n\r\nThe girls will have zero romantic interests despite being hormone crazy teenagers and they will live their lives according to such a prudish moral standard and work ethic that it would it would make even the Cleaver family and Archie comic characters wince. We will even have lines where the girls recite the value of doing homework and chores with a smile and we will expect the audience to not laugh at this but to take it seriously. I don't think audiences will be ready for an experience quite this unique and ground breaking. No show has been made like this EVER. This show will inspire people and change lives with it's sheer positivity. \\n\\n\r\nSo in all seriousness I can be talking about a lot of shows with the above and while K-on doesn't fit every single one of these cliches or this general crappy school club formula it does hit quite a few of them. I find this to be the most formulaic and lazy genre in anime currently, which is unfortunate because I really like the idea of \"slice of life\" stuff generally and I go into each one of these shows wanting to like them. Even school club shows with a seemingly outlandish premise like Girls Und Panzer end up following the same general arc and use the same filler episodes and archetypes. I find that even shows that aren't necessarily about a school club like Senran Kagura almost have this same cliche structure at their heart, but they don't quite put enough effort in or admit to the fact that it's just another \"school club\" show in an attempt to seem more unique than they are. \\n\r\nBefore we go on and I explain in more detail why I don't like this. I want to make clear just in case it wasn't that I'm not one of those people that only likes \"manly man\" anime, that seems to have become it's own cliche in anime culture, my problem with these shows and K-on in particular isn't that it's about girls doing supposedly girly things. I can imagine a show about much more traditionally feminine things like a school nail salon club or the school cosmetology club and I can imagine it working for me if the art, characters, general story etc are good. I don't give a damn what a show is about as long as it is interesting to me in some way and I think almost any subject can be made interesting. I can imagine a good show like this in my head. The problem is I just haven't found a good show in this genre yet and the more of them I see the more I start to resent all of them as a whole. Which brings me back to K-on.\\n\\n\r\nSo K-on doesn't buck any of the previously mentioned cliches or subvert them, in fact the most charitable thing I can say about the show is that it was slightly more sparing with it's cliches than some of these shows, \"Love Live\" being what I see as the purest platonic cliche form of them all. Love Live is going to be a show of comparison for a lot of this so brace yourself for that.  Unlike Love Live though, K-on is argued to be a great work of art and a pinnacle of it's genre. When I hear something is those things I expect a lot out of it and I expect it to be either reasonably different from the rest of the works in it's genre or I expect it to be the origin point of these said cliches, as in it's so ground breaking other shows have felt the need to copy it. K-on isn't fundamentally different from these other shows and it wasn't the origin of these trends, it was another surfer on the trend wave. \\n\r\nA cliched piece of media can still be enjoyable in a simple way. It can also be argued that not every piece of art needs to aim to be groundbreaking and \"unique.\" Some things can be good just as a particularly well crafted or more polished take on a previously established formula. Sometimes you just might want more of the same thing, because the same thing is good enough. It can also be said, that some things might be cliche on the surface but have depth in between the lines or in the subtext of it's particularities in the general formula. I'm also not above enjoying some cliches and predictable things myself, I really like horror films for instance and slashers in particular, I've come to enjoy their cliches and predictability and on a day where I just want to unwind instead of think deeply about something this is what I'll turn to for that. Closer to home, I can say I really love Dragon Ball Z, but I recognize that a lot of my love for that show is nostalgia and it having a special place in my life. There is nothing inherently special about the shows story aside from a few standout moments and it is very typical or cliche for it's genre. I really like Akira Toriyama's designs in Dragon Ball, Dr. Slump, Chrono Trigger and Dragon Quest, but the art and more specifically the art style is about the only thing I would say has stood the test of time from DBZ and even with that I'm not sure how impressive successive generations will find it. I gave these two things Slasher Films and DBZ as examples to say not everything I like is an immaculate piece of unique art or even just great works of art. The difference being I wouldn't make arguments or excuses about why other people should enjoy them either, which is unfortunately what people do with K-on. But if you don't, for the sake of fairness I'll say I'm cool with people liking something if they acknowledge it's derivative or cliche nature. I can understand a guilty pleasure and I can imagine someone just really enjoying these school club cliches even though I personally don't. \\n\r\nSo to recite the obvious with K-on, I don't think it's a notable or polished take on the formula, I don't want more of this same thing, because I dislike this genre now and I don't see any depth beyond it's surface level school club narrative. In fact one of the main arguments for this shows greatness I've heard a lot is how \"simple\" it is, in comparison to... Ummm, I don't know, the defenders of this show tend to leave this defense as context-less as I just did. I think they mean in comparison to anime in general, but most school club shows have the same plot at the same pace, so I don't really see anymore inherent \"simplicity\" against the rest or that would make it special by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people like to say that one of the main appeals of this show is how the characters truly feel like a group of friends. The immediate problem I have with this is these girls don't feel real ever, they feel like most of the archetypal girls in this genre, from the happy go lucky nonsense to the cliche \"moral\" dimension of these characters. Even though school club shows are always about secondary/high school kids, I could understand people liking these simple characters with their simple archaic morality if they were made for a much younger audience and I wouldn't berate kids for liking this. Again the problem is that so called \"experts\" in the highly important field of anime criticism constantly tout this as one of the greatest shows ever made and these people aren't children, they're my age and even scarier sometimes older. \\n\r\nThe impression I get of high schoolers from Japan in these shows is that all of them are compliant robots whose main want in life is to be the best student in school. I would call these shows an implicit dystopia where all resistance and teenage rebellion has been made futile. I'm more than certain this is probably not reality. As most real life Japanese films depict more conflict and tension in teenagers. I might have a personal bias as I just never cared about school, I wouldn't ever have joined a club and I certainly wouldn't have looked at another student dead in the face and say some nonsense about how home work is the best part of my day. Where are the losers, outcasts and scumfucks in these shows? Do all Japanese kids want to be goody goodies or do some want to wear black Timbs and black hoodies? The best hypothetical moment in one of these shows for me will be when these lame girls go up all happy to another girl to ask her to join their club and she bluntly tells them to go suck a dick. She has better things to do after school, like shitpost on the net, try Fentanyl and listen to trap rap loud enough to piss off mom and dad. Fuck a light music club. \\n\r\nReviewing things negatively like this has this weird way of making me optimistic about real life. I think kids in these grades are smarter and more complex than this and I think their lives could give us a more interesting story than what is given in these school club shows and I think that about kids all over the world. The kids are alright, the show is just bad. \\n\r\nThis show reminds me of things like High School Musical, Glee and Saved by the bell, where the characters are \"high schoolers,\" but the target audience and the mindset needed to enjoy it is much younger. You know what I wouldn't call any of those? The height of their artistic medium. In fact I would call them calculated commercial properties aimed at the lowest common denominator viewer that doesn't have a whole lot of point's of comparison. These shows and K-on are the television equivalent of a Katy Perry song, lifeless uninspired art trying to be inspirational and fun. \\n\\n\r\nYou know as a kid I lived through one cliche in this show, I had a sleepover with an older cousin and a few friends. I tried doing that thing where as the younger person I keep talking before we sleep. Well my cousin adorably said at the age of twelve \"STFU and go to sleep already\" and that was the end of that heart warming memory. Well I guess reality isn't like my Japanese animez's.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't mind a slow relaxing story, meant to be more calm than action or drama focused in fact my defense of Ghibli film's in my Totoro review was defending slow painstaking realism to an extreme beyond what K-on musters. This could be a twelve episode anime version of My Dinner With Andre and I could imagine it being interesting to me. K-on has two major problems that I think negate this common defense of the show for me. One, the world of K-on and it's characters don't feel real enough to be a true \"slice of life.\" There is almost no struggle or real setbacks these characters ever have to face, their life is a line from one easy fluffy event to the next. Even in real life we feel relaxation by contrast with things that aren't relaxing, so it stands to reason that even if a show wanted to aim for \"relaxation\" being it's general appeal we would need some of the opposite to contextualize these feelings the problem is we never really get that with k-on. Secondly, the format of K-on is all wrong for this kind of story. In a show aiming for relaxation, I would expect a lot less of the school club formula I described above and more of a slow contemplative free form show, with possibly a slower more relaxing take on the musical aspects. I would also expect a different kind of music to be employed here, more of a singer/songwriter type of feel and less slightly abrasive pop-rock. Instead of the singer songwriter route they can also go the slow jamz route to relax to. Didn't the makers of this show listen to the brilliant anime expert Jamie Foxx? We want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita and we can get this anime started alright! \\n\\n\r\nThere is one cliche I left out in my pitch above about these shows and it relates to how they end. Almost every School Club anime goes through an excruciating three episode arc where they cry about the fact that they wont see each other anymore when school is over. This cliche is at least as old as the school club anime Grease (1978). Frenchy is best girl and you know it. So it comes as quite a shock to me when people say this here lame, hackneyed, overused and predictable bit of plot is what makes this show good. The fact that the girls are thinking about their future... I'm thinking about my future right now, there isn't a whole lot to think about as it looks pretty bleak at the moment. Does that make me deep? It doesn't give something existential depth, to have the characters slightly ponder about and feel emotions over obvious crossroads in life. The worst thing about this in K-on was they didn't have the kindness to limit this to the last three episodes, they basically have a whole seasons length of episodes about them being sad school is ending. None of these episodes are interesting or do anything you wouldn't expect out of a more abbreviated version of the same general sad emotional thrust you get out of the ending episodes of these shows. \\n\r\nThis is also one of those ways in which I simply cant relate to this show, by the end of high school I was ecstatic at the prospect that I wasn't going to see any of the people I knew there ever again. Teachers and students alike, I felt trapped in the group of \"friends\" I had and I was glad to see them slowly trickle out of my life. I don't miss any of them and I don't reminisce fondly about the times we had. They changed, I changed and life moves on. Now maybe if I had joined a school club... Nah I would still be the same asshole in a different setting. \\n\r\nI also don't think of high school as a relaxing time. You're constantly being told if you don't get into college, your life will be ruined and you will forever be relegated to working the most menial of tasks, my guidance counselor told me I was destined to be a ditch digger or worse a moderator on 4chan. Then in a Zizekian fashion you are implicitly being commanded to enjoy high school as one of the \"greatest times of your life.\" Well it wasn't, it was \"a\" time in my life, nothing more or less. Frankie Avalon was wrong Frenchy, keep the dream of beauty school alive, perk up that beautiful angel face and never fucking go back to high school. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't know where to put what I'm about to talk about right now, but since it concerns the ending I thought I would dump it here. Alright, so let me take a breather for a second while I brace myself.... So the absolute worst episode of this show is episode twenty of season two. What makes this episode bad you say with anticipation, curiosity and trepidation? Well dear readers, the short answer is \"everything\" but I'm sure you're reading this already long review waiting for the long answer to be given and I will nicely oblige. Remember that this is a show about music, even though it's kind of easy to forget that since the characters seem to forget it all the time themselves. So like a lot of shows with a subject like this there is an \"end goal\" in mind and that is a school festival they're all going to perform at. Episode twenty just so happens to be the episode where that festival happens. Now in any other show like this the creators even if they consciously know they're creating a cliched piece of filth know that this episode has to be one of the great ones. It has to be that episode we remember and that pops out because everything is building up to this. I feel like this is a slightly functioning vestigial organ school club shows have taken from the previous era of spammed anime shows Shonens, where everything always built up towards competitions or a set (of) obstacle(s). The thing about this episode is all that build up is wasted on the girls playing two extremely boring songs and Yui doing an awkward unfunny stage performance that just goes on forever. I mean really bad performance, like not in the \"it's funny shes a little nervous\" like if she came up to me after my response would be \"Well at least it looked like you had fun up there I guess.\"  You know that passive aggressive way of saying \"it fucking sucked,\" that still makes it clear it was the worst performance you have ever seen in your life. If I went to this concert I would ask for my yen back even if I didn't pay to get in. This should have been one of the shows best moments, but like with everything else in the show it is just terrible. Lets go back to Love Live again, when this show had the same cliche structure and buildup, it basically delivered and gave you what you expected out of a show like this concerning the Idol performance we knew this was all building up to. A big live performance with an exciting song that tied into what was going on in the show. It wasn't the best thing I ever heard, but it was basically what I expected out of a premise like this and it met my small expectations. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the truly terrible things about this show, is how little it uses it's underlying premise about music. People often note that it is has very little actual music in it attached to what the characters are doing, if you discount supplementary materials and merchandise, but it also doesn't really do enough with training and leaning about music. A lot of these shows about school like to jack themselves off about how educational they are, but I don't really learn anything about music or light music clubs from this show that I didn't know before. Compare this to a show like Dagashi Kashi, which isn't even about school or learning in the slightest and I still learned quite a bit more from it about Japanese candy then I ever learned from K-on about anything music related. I would think at least some musical activities and exposition scenes pertaining to how you go about learning musical stuff would happen even if just by accident given the premise, but a truly amazing thing about K-on is it manages to not do anything with this premise aside from use it as a way to advertise the shows supplementary CD's. \\n\r\nNow let's bring up Love Live! School Idol Suicide Project again. Love Live is almost as much as a cliched flat line as this show, but with Love Live I can say it taught me at least a slight smidgen about being an Idol and they did sing and practice for singing quite a few times in the show, at least once an episode. So as bad as it was it at least lived up to it's limited premise more than K-on did, which was not something I was expecting considering the shows differing reputations. I can also say despite the girls fitting each cliche I noted above in terms of emotional disposition almost each one had something to bring to the group initially concerning the idol premise. Like Nico's knowledge of school idol persona's, the red haired girls song writing, that one blonde girl's dancing abilities etc. So if you take anything away from this, Nico was why Love Live needed to be made, her demon like appearance, elitism, arrogance and narcissistic personality was just enough to get me to care in a special way. She wasn't my muse from heaven Chiyo Sakura level's of inspiring but I mean who is? To get back to the real point, each one of the characters in Love Live had at least some small level of importance in the story. The problem with K-on was almost none of the girls mattered in a musical sense and more broadly they aren't defined enough to matter as individual people aside From Ritsu whose an annoying asshole and if I was her \"friend,\" I would commence to ass whoopin real quick if I had to endure her presence for longer than five minutes. Now in a better show the characters not being cliche archetypes might come off more realistic, if the girls were amateurs just jamming in a garage and they sounded that way it could have it's own kind of charm about it. Maybe they could even get Merzbow as a feature. The problem is they don't come off amateurish, they come off professional and despite being a light rock band with instruments, they play quite a bit of pop with some mild guitar sounds in it. Everything about this is wrong and I don't like it.  Again Love Live was a bad show and I didn't care for the music, but at least they were idols singing pop idol music, so it fit the premise of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, well I basically outlined it above with my \"perfect\" pitch, little music joke there Yui, maybe your writers can take notes.  Aside from that long series of cliches it doesn't add anything new to the formula or warrant any close observation and analysis. If the characters didn't have different colored hair and slightly different outfits, I would forget who they are really quick. They try to go slightly different with Yui's take on the happy go lucky can-do front lady, but there are two problems with the way they try to go against type. One, they make her clumsy and stupid, these are terrible traits for a main character, unless this is a pivotal part of the story and it isn't it's used for fluff \"humor\" and as a substitute for giving her a real personality. One of my favorite shows growing up was Futurama and a problem with that show was Fry started out as an average guy who reacted realistically to the crazy situations he was in, but a problem with this show over time was that Fry became an extremely stupid character to supplement the fact that other characters became more interesting around him. This was the exact wrong approach to go with his character he was fine as he is being the average fish out of water guy who was the foil to the strange world of the year 3000 and more interesting characters around him. The dumber Fry got the less I cared about him and his relations to other people and subsequently the rest of the show. K-on suffers a similar disconnect. I wanna like the main character of a show, but when they're constantly shown to be useless and they react to situations in a way I wouldn't and there is nothing to be gained by this otherwise, it just serves to further and further disconnect me with what is supposed to be this shows anchor. I want to state that by contrast I don't want the show to go in the opposite direction, where Yui is a perfect person who makes nonstop rational decisions, but what I want is for there to be a balance and for me to feel like she at least sometimes isn't just a worthless annoyance in the world she inhabits. People can be understandably ignorant or inept given their characterization and lack of experience with something. The problem with Yui is that she doesn't have enough of a personality otherwise to understand why she has these faults. Someone that act's this dumb all the time if they need to exist at all which I would argue they don't, they should be relegated to being the \"comic\" relief and nothing else. They definitely shouldn't be the main character. Yui is just awful, when you imagined in your mind what a terrible character from these shows would be like before watching any of them you basically imagined Yui Hirasawa without knowing it. \\n\r\nAnother problem with this is like everything else in the show they don't even fully commit to her being dumb and inconsiderate enough. Almost every episode ends with them attempting some hamfisted \"heart warming\" moment where Yui realizes being a useless dumb ass is ok because they had \"fun\" or she is going to buy that guitar herself. Some of which in turn back fires because it undervalues the whole episode we just watched like with that aforementioned guitar buying episode. There is an episode in the second season where Yui and the younger twin tailed girl decide to play music for this old lady that lives next door at a talent show. The whole episode is setup like a classic I love Lucy episode where Lucy commits to doing something that is well meaning but is above her skill level and ability and she humorously fails trying to do something good for someone else. This also seems to be the case for Yui as she is trying to juggle training for this show and doing her finals. I kept expecting moments like this to happen for Yui where her faults and her supposed good aspects meet by her trying to do something good for others and her failing in humorous ways, like with this episode and  despite all the comedic potential of her bombing hard on stage this never really happens. Her failures and their attempts at heartwarming moments never meet to make a fully realized character named \"Yui Hirasawa.\" Instead she always manages by some miracle to push her worthless self through seemingly impossible odds given the setting. I would hesitate to call her a mary sue, despite her being that, but the bigger problem is that she is that in a world where every character is that. They all do everything with little effort and some slight positivity, it's like a self-help mary-su-niverse. So her dumb traits are just a mild annoyance until she faces a challenge and then despite doing nothing of value or putting in any effort she is given every consolation and win this show can throw at her. K-on you got some splainin' to do! I feel a pain in my heart, I think this show is trying to pull on it, but it's writing is too weak to play tug-o-war with my cholesterol filled veins. \\n\r\nI would like to say these problems with characterization were limited to Yui con corn queso senpai, but all the other \"characters\" have a similar problem. Mio is supposed to be like the sweet, smart and quirky one, I think, to the point that she has an on campus fanclub but she only does this a lot in one or two episodes which are explicitly about pointing this out. The blonde one is supposed to be... Umm the other smart one? The imaginative one? I'm not sure what her characterization is supposed to be, she is so muddled and undefined that I find it hard to parcel out what their intentions were with this character. Ritsu probably has the most defined character in the show and that is that she is an arrogant asshole, I should probably relate but I don't. Twin Tail gets the most episodes from her perspective that aren't from Yui's, most likely because she had the hottest selling figurine or something and I think the episodes from her perspective in particular illustrate why K-on is poorly written. In season two episodes thirteen and sixteen she is the POV character for most of these episodes we see her interact alone with other members of the light music club. In a better show these interactions would be used to define both characters more either through opposition or similarity. In episode sixteen  Azusa even commentates on this possibility which makes it all the more laughably bad when it doesn't happen in any of these scenes. We don't learn anything more about the girls when they have moments away from the group than when they do. This is similar to the problem I outline in my Kantei review about how new situations the characters are put in don't give us any new information about them or reveal new aspects to their personalities. After every interaction that should make them more personable and/or interesting instead we get more nothing. In Love Live I thought the characters were boring and one note in their execution, but at least I could say I understood what their one note was supposed to be. They also were able to play off each other as foils because their personalities were defined enough to show how the girls were different in the first place. Three out of five of K-ons main characters don't have a personality I can understand on a basic level or apply a common archetype to and they aren't relatable in a more complex sense either. Yui's personality is garbage and Ritsu is an extremely simplistic take on the arrogant trope. Love Live wins again. \\n\\n\r\nSomeone might see all that and then say \"Well yeah but does any of that matter?\" I would immediately retort with \"It depends.\" To get my reason for doing this entire review out of the way again, remember that I was repeatedly told two things about this show. One, that it is the bestest thing ever by a lot of people and two, that the characters feel like a real life group of friends. So these criticisms matter to me, because they tear away at both of those ideas. When I hear characters feel real in a story I assume that means a lot of things about them, but for your sake dear reader I'll condense them down to two possible options and you can imagine a mix of them in between. I can imagine that someone means by that these characters are good by the standards we usually judge characters by in a story, they are well defined, are relatable to their target audience, they have believable motives and reasons for doing things, they have believable pros & cons given their situation, they can be easily discerned from one another in ways more than looks, every character has at least one purpose for being in the story if not many for each character and they have arcs and development that make the journey we see them go on mean something. You know the things a creative writing teacher would look for aside from grammar and spelling errors. Secondly, it can mean they feel real more in a raw documentary style, personal or some experimental sense where an author or script writer is attempting to reach a new semblance of realism by either trying something new or just taking things directly from real life and trying to transcribe them in a way that makes them interesting as a story. I'm being a little bit purposefully vague with the second option because creativity should leave a gray area for people to try something new. I have already touched upon one type of example of the second option in my Totoro review. That aside, the main point of all this is K-on doesn't live up to either one. In fact it is painfully in the red in some areas as described ad nausea above. \\n\\n\r\nSo was the story all terrible? Ok, I'll be nice end the story analysis on a semi-good note here. There were a few episodes in this show where the teachers back story and the history of the light music club was shown. Every time they showed a flashback to what her life was like and what the light music club was like back then I kept thinking \"I wish I was watching that show instead.\" Her life and iterations of the club seemed far more interesting than the one I had to sit through and watch. I think you know a shows characters are bad when you find yourself exploring the potential possibilities of the side characters to distract yourself from whats going on with what the show actually gives you. Also they played metal, so for a second I felt my pulse again and the teachers singing wasn't bad. Maybe it was \"vicarious quality\" and I've just convinced myself it's good because it's sandwiched by blandness back to back, but this was probably the height of this show for me all around. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in K-on is below average. It isn't the worst I have ever seen but it is the worst art I have seen on a show considered the best of it's genre. It is also the worst art out of any of the shows I have reviewed. Even with Kill Me Baby I can argue that it had a \"style\" to it so some of it's awful artistic choices at least had an excuse. K-on is bad even just amongst school club shows and all the ones I have seen have had passable to bad art. \\n\r\nI noticed that the girls bodies and faces have this odd tendency to get scrunched up and not properly center their facial features when they have a lot of movement. Their eyes, mouth and nose recede into the center of their face in a bizarre way. Which is weird, because the problem with a lot of anime shows is the opposite where the eyes and mouth have a hard time keeping within the structure of a characters face. So you'll sometimes see these moving parts \"clip\" with the border of their face and sometimes just end up outside. I think this has to do with the fact that movement is sometimes grafted onto a 3D like model, but the face is still on a 2D plane so the features don't always match up or at least that would be my amateurish guess knowing zero about animation. I'm not sure at all what would cause K-on's problems, maybe it was a precursor to the \"little face\" memes. \\n\r\nThis show is often labelled amongst those as being about \"cute girls doing cute things.\" Well the girls need to be cute first, which I'm about to argue they aren't and they need to do \"things\" which I have argued in the rest of the review they have done poorly. I hate to so blatantly quote another reviewer but when it came to K-on's art I had to keep asking a very important question \"What is wrong with your FACEEEEEEEEE?\" Yui and the gang must like potatoes because they look pretty mashed here. Her sister and Ritsu might have encephalitis. That blonde girl's face and hair... Don't look into her eyes, you'll get lost in her eyebrows dead lights. How can someone look at that and say \"Yeah this is an acceptable bit of art for a show we want to be a hit.\" They all have baby Grinch syndrome too. Alright I'll stop hating on their faces but my god they were awful. \\n\r\nAside from their faces, there is also the problem that they all look way too young to be in the grade they're in. Every single one of the main characters looks like a toddler. Now granted I can sympathize with them a little bit here in that I too look like a gigantic toddler, but their characterization or lack thereof and their odd toddlerish looks just made this show even more excruciatingly childish. It does make me believe though that this show is intended for a much younger audience and for some reason out of touch, infantile older westerners have convinced themselves it is somehow appealing anyway.\\n\r\nI will give the show some credit here, not for what they did, but for what they didn't do. Given the above and how the characters look extremely young even for shows like this it would be especially appalling if this show tried to do fanservice and general sexual pandering. Luckily for the sake of my mind and the good of all humanity they don't really do this, the girls wear outfits that are realistic to their situation and the furthest they ever push anything is with bathing suits and they are almost always worn in appropriate contexts. I don't know if my face has enough muscles in it to handle the cringe that would have ensued had they tried to do that with this anime and this \"art style.\"\\n\r\nGeneral movement is just bad in this. When it isn't one of the few times they play music their limbs and body motion just looks off and during speedy sequences it looks disjointed. The backgrounds looked horrendous a lot of the time when they weren't in a confined space. I remember the mandatory beach episode looking particularly bad in this. \\n\r\nI will say there was a scene in episode eight of the second season where Yui is a child in what I assume is a playground and this scene had a lot more detail and generally looked better than most of the episodes of this show. This scene was about half a minute long and it was the highlight of the show's art out of a little less than forty episodes.\\n\r\nI want to mention something I noticed about this show and Love Live and that I started to see in a few other shows subsequently. In scenes where a lot of the girls are just lined up talking to each other or otherwise in a full group, I would find myself laughing at the way their faces looked when they were just standing there not talking, there was something humorous about it, but I couldn't quite pinpoint what at first. Then I realized that the characters faces never move when they aren't talking and their eyes don't blink. So it just makes them look like a derpy anime mannequin. This little bit of artificiality got me to notice that the girls almost never speak over each other by accident despite being a relatively large group of friends. As in conversations don't feel organic and real but rather like a cause and effect domino series of exposition. The animation on top of being bad is stiff and the characters look even more unnatural than is usual for animation. \\n\r\nThere is a huge continuity error near the end. An unbelievably important plot point where Yui stupidly cuts too much of her hair and makes her bangs look terrible and this was so important we had to spend almost five minutes of a twenty four minute episode dwelling on it. Anyway in the next episode her hair is back to the way it was before cutting it, again even though in the timeline of the show only a few days should have passed  at most. Maybe some people consider this \"nitpicking\" at this point and I probably wouldn't have brought this up if things ended here, but what makes this mistake even worse is in the next episode they change it again and she is back to having her botched hair job. Guess what happens in the episode after that? Her hair goes back to normal. How do you make this many mistakes concerning a stupid plot point around a characters appearance you previously thought was so important it needed damn near a whole episode dedicated to it?\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows where people fawn over the voice actors, even more so than they do the actual characters. Which if that is the appeal is hearing these women and their singing voices, well than why not just like them as a musical act? Why does a lackluster show need to be made around this? Time and effort was wasted animating this show. I'm wasting time reviewing it, time I could have spent doing more important things... Like finding content for my porn Tumblr, trying Fentanyl, taking the tide pod challenge and racking up more hours on Steam. You know I jested there for a second, but I really wonder, why does a show like this need to be animated? What does a show about not so cute girls doing regular things gain by being animated especially when it is badly animated and it brings nothing interesting to the table? I think this is a fundamental question to ask about something that is animated, does it do anything or gain any value added from being animated in the first place? As bad as some of the other shows have been that I reviewed, I would argue that every single one of them before this, had a good claim for needing to be animated for one reason or another. To go back to a show I already mentioned in this review Girls Und Panzer, I can at least say it's subject matter about tankery made it's animation a necessity, despite it having the same school club structure as k-on. I can say that idol shows are already an over saturated thing in Japan, so Love Live gained something by being animated, by helping it stand out amongst a crowd and trying to pull in an anime viewing audience that might not necessarily care about idols. Nothing about k-on warranted it needing to be an animated show in fact I think it makes it harder to fawn over the voice actors when the ugly art serves to be a barrier to entry. I would rather the real life Japanese VA's just have a show about being in a light music club.  \\n\r\nI didn't really like the music, but I didn't really hate it either, it was just kind of a thing that existed. Aside from their music, I noticed one of the shows bedding tracks sounds nearly identical to the Pop Corn Song, enough to be plagiarism. What a bunch of hacks, I mean can you imagine stealing someones work in the same field as you? Anyway, I would give the track a light to decent six, TRANSI-TIONNN. As I said earlier I think the music was the wrong fit for a relaxing premise and I can tell especially in the second season, they realized how limiting the concept of a \"light\" music club was with the school club formula they wanted to milk with this. They really wanted more members, because more female leads equals more merchandise, but the existing cast was already useless and bland, so adding even more people would just clutter the band and the music they were pretending to make. If this had been a show about the school band, this would have given them the excuse they wanted to add more members, but nah we gotta do this light music club stuff. \\n\\n\r\nI waited until the end to call this show boring, because I expect people who like this show to see that as most peoples central criticism of this, but as I've shown all throughout this review, it's not just that it's \"boring,\" it's boring because of a series of a failures emanating from it's core. The show is a paint by numbers take on the school club formula and it tries it's hardest to hit every single cliche possible within this sub genre. Even with this lazy structure laid out for them, the show still manages to underutilize it's core premise and be obstinately against doing something interesting with music. The characters don't feel real and are at best mildly less annoying than usual and at worst terrible, unfunny cliches.  The main character is just moronic and unrelatable. It has a child like mindset but without the endearment and a whole lot of sappy overly sentimental attempted recreations of school life. Only with all the struggle and hardship filed away, leaving us with no strong character arcs, development or contrast for the so called relaxing moments. It's art is below average and looks horrendous on occasion, but it's biggest sin is that it doesn't make up for the lack of interesting things in every other aspect of the show. In fact it's animation is so poor it leaves me wondering why this show needed to be animated in the first place. The music is bland for it's genre and doesn't really add to my enjoyment in any way. This show is boring, but not for the reasons usually stated because \"nothing happens\" or \"because it's too lighweight\" a lot of cliche things happen and it's has plenty of girth in the whole lot of low quality writing department. I had to force myself to get through the second season, it was painful. I kept wanting to watch anything else and I found I had to slap my own hand away from going to my browser and my audio player to try to escape this. I was hoping at the end of this shit rainbow I would run into a pot of gold that justified all the terrible things I saw and all the praise this show gets. Alas there was nothing to be had, it was as bad from the first episode as it was from the last. This show is just every other school club show, but blander and with worse writing. Yui-son goku deku sensei I'm sorry, but Nico Yazawa is the better animated pop star. Say it with me \"NICO NICO NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!\"\\n",

            "content": "I suppose not all anime about music has to be like BECK or Macross, but when it comes to the focus, there must be heavy emphasis on the music and how to sell it extremely well. Okay, so Kyoto Animation and Kadokawa are masters at selling extremely well, but when it comes to the actual show, the substance comes off disappointing as there is almost never a point where perfection of a show can be reached even by a high-tiered animation company.\r\nIf I were to make an anime about a band of high school girls, I would produce an entire 12-track ALBUM in the spanof 13 episodes and use at least 5 songs as lead singles and inserts. 25% or more of the show would be just the girls practicing or doing live performances while the rest of the show shows their slice-of-life and moe comedy to increase their cuteness and selling their personalities. NEVER would I use only TWO songs to sell, even to a target audience of little kids, music over a 50+ episode period (I'm looking at you, Full Moon). If live performance animation is boring and tedious to draw, maybe shove a couple more music videos (than just one) in there to make it more interesting. The show would be an absolute pinnacle in production values and the hype would have been worth it; hell, it could even stand the tests of time.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON! does only the minimal requirements of the above and still eats the Japanese otaku's money (not necessarily North American...). There were only 3 singles (+1 more later, only two were \"written by the band\" songs) released during its airing time with character songs to come: it is the perfect strategy to make money, but in the long run the appreciation of the show drops drastically as we can only hold enough suspension of disbelief that the girls are really a band and can play their own instruments. Speaking of that, I know they showed Yui to be some sort of retarded genius, but it can only go so far for someone with musical knowledge that she mastered the intermediate riffs the REAL musician plays on the songs. Most of the show ponders around the girls doing cute stuff and getting you to like them, and that's exactly what you would expect out of a slice-of-life moe comedy targeted at the otaku generation of mid-2000's. The second half of the show introduces Azusa as a new character, but like all other half-way introduction pitfalls, she does not grow on the audience enough that justifies her taking up space in the OP and taking out the awesome shot of the other four girls jumping off stairs. With so much slice-of-life and harem anime being produced with the same scenarios over and over again, K-ON! seems like a generic knock-off, only with the music gimmick. It is a shame the excuse-for-a-4koma-manga has not ended yet so this 13-episode 2-year coverage has you longing for a second season that won't come until Full Metal Panic! is complete. This runaway success will eventually die down and become forgotten as something new and more moe takes over the cause of your heart attacks.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think the reader understands half of what I'm saying unless they look at my other reviews, but I am not trying to say I did not enjoy K-ON!. Sure it is a cash cow like Lucky Star was, but as a Kyoto Animation fanboy and critic I cannot help but be drawn in to the hype. Once again, I finish a show disappointed that it ended so early and I must break my ties with imaginary characters who are even hotter if they let their hair down. You can only become a true fanboy if the last episode does not enrage the fact you wasted 25 minutes of your life watching nothing happening. I wish in the future KyoAni does something worthy of another 10/10 on my scale, but for now, it's another money-raker to fund my next seasons of Haruhi and Full Metal Panic!.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Other reviews on animenfo and anidb, where I usually post.",

            "content": "You want to know what led me to watching this?\r\nWell, I saw a friend of mine watched it a while ago. But the main reason is I got into reading the LPs for Dangan Ronpa, and when the character Ibuki Mioda came up, I wanted to know more about light music clubs. I have to say Ibuki's character of being silly, not very smart (or maybe that's an act?) and hyper does personify this anime. \r\nHowever... I'm not quite sure why this anime is so popular? Sure, it's cute... but that's about it. Please read below for a more detailed explanation! \r\nStory: \r\nA classic highschool setting involving after school activities of four (eventually five) girls. They learn how to play music together, sound great, and it shows them becoming closer. \\n\r\nAnd... that's about it. Pretty poor story telling. Lots a cuteness, lots of fluff, lots of... god it really made me annoyed that were so flipping lazy and they hardly played music. And drank tea all the time. Before this turns into a rant: The bottom line is to not watch this thinking it has an interesting plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is easily one of the best things about this anime. I think it is ADORABLE. I really like the odd flow of it, especially when they are singing/playing. This anime will provide you with an overload of cuteness. It's clean and shiny! \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm a fan of the opening, the ending... and the few songs they sing in the show. Other than that, the background music was forgettable. You would think that an anime focusing on playing music would have more... music. NOPE. Don't get your hopes up too much if you are looking for something focused on the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI liked the characters and their antics, but I wanted to see more character development. Even though Yui is an adorable air head, I didn't feel she should have been the lead character. I feel like it would have been more story driven if it wasn't focused on her so much. There isn't much appealing about her, and I found I liked her sister much better. \\n\\n\r\nThe other club members were much more interesting. Mio and is a shy girl that often made you laugh about how ridiculously frightened she would get over mundane things. But she wanted to play bass more. She was easily my favorite. \\n\r\nAzusa was my second favorite, and the main reason was she almost quit because the band hardly practiced. I was hoping this would lead to more music oriented story, but it didn't go very far. She was cat girl fan service. Cute, but I feel tricked yet again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it to a certain extent. I liked to watch for the art, and it was something you could stew and think little about. This is good if you want something to put on to relax too. \\n\r\nI had a lot of ups and downs with this anime, making this an average experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt was okay. Nothing impressive, but nothing incredibly bad if you get over the fact that they don't play much music as you would have hoped. I have little use for re-watching or buying this. It was \"just there.\" I'm hoping the second season will prove better, but I have to day I am hesitant to get back into this show. But if I prepare myself with a series with mostly fillers, maybe I won't be as disappointed I was the first time through?",

            "content": "K-ON! is about a group of girls who try, and succeed, to save their high school's musical club from suspension. The story starts with two of them, Ritsu Tainaka (a drummer) and Mio Akiyama (a bassist), joining the empty, member-less light music club; later on the first episode, Tsumugi Kotobuki, a wealthy girl, joins as a tecladist, and Yui Hirasawa joins as a guitarist who has never touched a guitar, doesn't even owns one, and can't even read music.\r\nStory: 7\r\nEven though the plot is nothing unusual, the general ongoing of the show is very enjoyable. The story line, though simple, looks promising (and by \"promising\"I mean capable of being developed a lot and taken to more complex settings, like, for example, a huge concert, or the club disbanding).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nBoth the drawing style of the characters and the animation style of the OP and ED are very well done, as expected of Kyoto Animation (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu) and Pony Canyon (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, CLANNAD).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nGiven the fact that the story revolves around a music club, it can be expected of K-ON! to have above average music. And it does. Both the OP and the ED (and of course the musical pieces in between the show) are not only brilliant and very, very catchy, but also excel at building up the mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe main character (Yui) scores high on the moe level due to her general clumsiness, a bit of shyness, and general kyewtness. Except for her, the other three main charcters (Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi) are fairly average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the first episode of K-ON! very much. Even though almost the only laughing source of the show is Yui, I still laughed many times while watching it. Also, I should give a special mention to the soundtrack - as I said before, it makes the show a lot more catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = (7+9+10+7+10)/5 = 8.6 \u2248 8 (or 9, if you wish; I think it sticks more to an 8.)\\n\r\nIf you like comedy anime, K-ON! is definitely a must watch this season. ^-^",

            "content": "The denial of objective truth is a core component of deconstructionism, which in turn spawned postmodernism which is the centerpiece of contemporary culture.  Like the other tenets of cultural Marxism, the denial of objective truth is a weapon by which to gain influence and power.  A society must have some way of making decisions about what is real and true.  When society abandons objective truth as its standard, it is left only with 'the consensus' to determine what is true.  Consensus is something that can be formed and shaped by experts controlling the narrative.  Reality is replaced by wikiality, andthose who control the wiki (the narrative, the consensus), control the truth.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, deconstructionism is based on Saussurean linguistics, which purports to establish the meaning of words according to their relationship with other words, therefore establishing reality as a closed system where things always refer to other things and can never be true in an objective sense, only as interpretation.  This inaugurated the era of critical theory, feminism, civil rights, etc.\\n\\n\r\nK-On represents the closing of this era.  When Yui delivers the famous line fun things are fun, she is saying that objective, non-referential truth exists, that fun things are factually fun because they are fun, and when you watch K-On, you see that she speaks the truth -- that truly, fun things are fun. At this very moment, the entire pillar of cultural Marxism, the entire work of the frankfurt school, collapses like a house of cards.\ufeff",

            "content": "The following review is entitled \"Dr. Moeblob or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Slice of Life\"\r\nThis is a plea to every anime fan out there. I do not care what genres you watch. I do not care if you are male or female. I do not care if you hate moe with a passion. GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE! Hopefully throughout the course of this you will feel compelled to watch at least one episode of K-ON! if you have not already. With that out of the way, onto the actual review. This will be a review for both seasons of K-ON!I only have the first season rated a 9 instead of a 10 because my favorite character does not show up until the latter half. Anybody who knows me will know that I love K-ON! All of my anime loving friends look at me in disgust when I say it's one of my favorite shows of all time. (2nd favorite to be exact) What could some \"moeblob\" show do to warrant a 10/10 rating? Well, it is tough to explain, but I would like to try. One might look at the 10 rating I have given this show and say that rating should be reserved for deep, thought-provoking shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion. While I agree this is true, (EoE is and forever will be my favorite movie of all time) I would also contend that sometimes less is more. K-ON! is virtually plotless, it is simply snippets of the main character's everyday lives, like many other Slice of Life shows. Some might say that not having a plot is a bad thing, but I would say the opposite. K-ON! is a true masterpiece because it does what few other shows can do: it thrives on strongly written characters and their interactions. While K-ON! is a show most would watch with their brain turned off, it still has spectacular writing. The characters bounce off each other, and have a great chemistry that makes the show a joy to watch. K-ON! makes boring everyday activities extremely fun to watch because of good writing alone. I believe that makes this show worthy of being called a masterpiece. On top of that, the soundtrack is outstanding. I still find myself listening to songs from the show almost daily. The animation is also top notch. Initially, I did not like the animation. However, as I kept watching, I noticed the remarkable attention to detail Kyoani weaved throughout the show. From how the hair flows to how fluid the characters movements were, I found myself more and more impressed by the animation as the show went on. Last but not least, K-ON! is a show with an extremely high enjoyment factor. I have never watched a series that was as fun as K-ON! was. The humor in the show is amazing, and there are tons of memorable moments. All in all, K-ON! is not a show you should write off for being moe. K-ON! is truly a masterpiece; it is an embodiment of the human spirit. It shows that sometimes, less can truly be more.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I do not care who you are. Whether you normally watch action shows or are a veteran of the SoL genre, K-ON! is a show that is worthy of your time. Even if you hate \"moeblob\" shows, give it a try, it just might be your new favorite guilty pleasure.",

            "content": "A compilation review of the HTWA! Hope you find it handy!\r\n\"1) MOE! without ecchi. Cute comedy slice-of-life with music\r\n2) Like them all, but especially Mugi\r\n3) It should be fine for beginners. I wouldn't say it's as essential as others but it is pretty unique.\" - aoikishu\r\n\"1) It's really MOE and cute, and with no ecchi, so it's a great accomplishment.\r\n2) it's really funny, so no episode bores you.\r\n3) It's unique, a different concept in anime\r\n4) The music & songs are specially good. I love K-ON! Songs\r\n5) I like characters because each one is different and it's fun to see those unique and different personalities betogether and see each one getting along with each other.\" - roymustang24\\n\\n\r\n\"Same as the previous posters: Awesome moe with no ecchi. I like all the characters, especially Yui and Mio, and I like how all of them are unique in their own way. It's a good anime that I feel is aimed at the current anime fanbase but also works for anime beginners.\" - Redfoxoffire\\n\\n\r\n\"I guess I should check out why it's so popular. I heard its just Lucky Star with music. I'm really getting tired of all the moe blob anime shows but I guess I'll see what this one is about. It has a pretty high rating for MAL and lots of fans I see so I'll give it a shot (in a distant future).\" - shoxk\\n\\n\r\n\"I thought K-on was fairly average. The storyline is quite simple - four girls establish a light music club with their goal of performing at budokan. Over two years we see how they handle the club.\\n\r\nI don't hate moe moe shows and characters, nor do i like them.\\n\r\nThe music ain't bad (cept for the lyrics... oh god the lyrics don't make any sense at all) and in general, if i had to pick between putting songs from this on my ipod as opposed to most other generic jpop songs, id pick songs from this anime (good thing i cant make sense of the lyrics).\\n\r\nThe characters i thought were portrayed quite well. Their attributes and personalities were very well established. The main character seemed somewhat typical - it wasn't completely following an archetype of \"4 girls, 1 overly energetic, 1 overly antisocial, 1 ball of moe, 1 rich and talented\" but it still had many many traces of such in there.\\n\r\nFor beginners, there's generally better anime to give them. To be honest, i don't think beginners will get interested in anime after watching this. I would imagine they would feel bored after a few episodes and thus harbour the thought \"is this going anywhere\".\\n\r\nThis anime is by no means essential... It is popular, sure, but it doesn't really have any real charm other than being cute and its mildly enjoyable music.\" - dxthegreat\\n\\n\r\n\"Well K-ON is basically the typical example of what a moe-blob show is. By mushing some really moe characters together and a half-decent storyline, we have ourselves an anime. Although, like dxthegreat, I'm not that opposed to moe-blobs which is probably why I enjoyed it like I did. The greatest thing really, is that I KNEW that there wasn't going to be some deep and complex storyline with a million messages to pick up. It's a simple, straightforward and overall fun show and so I went into the show with this mind-set and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I would have.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that I found it unbelievable that they managed to pass almost 2 years in the 13 episodes they had which already suggests that there won't be a season 2. It was another chance for Kyo-Ani to make some quick money but hey; a company has to make money to survive.\\n\\n\r\nLastly it's unique in the way that it's, like others have said, \"moe with no ecchi\". Slight fanservice things like beach trips and hot spring pops up about twice if I remember correctly and some cosplaying action, slight yuri themes and the ever irresistable antics of Mio are the extent of K-ON. On a final note (really) it is a beginner anime but it's only for those who want a good start to anime and some fun. Not an essential anime but yeah, something to think about.\" - Lystle\\n\\n\r\n\"Pretty much this. I probably gave it a 6 or something--can't remember--and I thought it was, say, below average. It may be good for some but I can't find what I look for in anime in it. Not a fan of slice of life, and I don't like moe either, but I'm bias towards Ritsu. Prolly because she's got this boyish attitude contrary to her overly cute companions. Too much cuteness is a letdown for me.\" - Wetpantsu\\n\\n\r\n\"It's a decent watch but it's nothing special. To be honest, KyoAni is freefalling but I guess when you have huge hits like FMP2, Clannad, Kanon, Air, and melancholy it is only natural that the only place to go is down. Doesn't really cutt it as a music anime and there are better slice of life comedies like Minami-ke so what you're left with is a half-assed attempt at bringing two winning concepts together in an effort to make an even better anime but they ended up overextending themselves and failing to achieve mastery of either domain.\" - tigerz\\n\\n\r\n\"I watched K-ON! quite some time ago, but I found to be thoroughly enjoyable. I'm not opposed to moeblobs as well. The music is truely fantastic, and it's stuff i could get into. I actually downloaded the entire lot of it, because I found it to be in such good taste. While it isn't a neccessary watch, or anything near, it truely is an amusing and cute little anime to the end. The lack of complex plot makes watching easy-going, and non-confusing. I do admit, that I especially enjoyed Mio due to her scaredy-cat/mature behavior and just some of the plain kawaii~ things she does.\" - Soviet_Haruhi\\n\\n\r\n\"Coming from the powerhouse emotional Clannad AS, K-on! was a different change of pace. K-on was not terrible. However, it was nothing special either. It was a typical, standard high school moeblob show no better than Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch or Minami-ke. I do not understand why it is so popular. Maybe it's the fact that Haruhi Season 2 flopped and KyoAni fans needed something to flock to, or maybe it was the fact that it was made by KyoAni in the first place that instantly made it one of the highest selling TV series. I question if K-on's popularity would have been the same if it was made by a different, not so known studio.\\n\\n\r\nAs it was a slice of life, plot is not a big factor so I tend not to rate these kind of animes based on plots. However, the characters were all typical and very average. We have Yui, who is your typical moeblob airhead, Mio, a scardey-cat tsundere, Ritsu, your standard energetic type, and Mugi, your typical rich-girl, \"oblivious to commoner culture\" type with random yuri-ism thrown in her character for lols. I am already sick of cliche tsunderes, and Mio in particular really annoyed the hell out of me. It also doesn't help that she is probably the most popular character in 2009. Thank-god for good hybrid tsunderes such as Horo and Senjougahara (also has kuudere and yandere elements) who still try to keep the character archtype interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, although good of what it consisted was very insufficient. I have said this many times but animes such as Beck, NANA and Nodame Cantabile are vastly superior slice of lifes that also expand on the music element much more. I will however, give credit to K-on!'s animation with was pretty top notch and is something KyoAni is good at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the maximum score I can give K-on is a 6/10. I actually gave it a 5/10 as I have seen too many \"moeblob\" shows lately and are saturated of them. Perhaps if K-on was earlier in this decade, that I may have enjoyed it more.\" - acejem\\n\\n\r\n\"Well I think this anime is great because of its action and suprisment.\\n\r\nI like it because mostly it entertains me very well and its characters are very expressful\" - Oyashiro-chan\\n\\n\r\nWe hope you have found this review helpful! ^^",

            "content": "K-ON! (keion), very simple story with simple character. \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story is very simple, four high school girls come together (indeliberately and deliberately) and form a light music club, aiming to protect the club and perform on stage. That's really all about this anime. Light and simple with no plot twist at all.\r\n    Some Experiment:\r\nThey met--> Starts playing together---> Practice ---> Pass hardship--->...The story is simple so after this it is easy to guess what will happen.\r\n This serie will surely never get a 10 nor a 9, the best they can get is a 8 (no plot twist, deep plot orany secret)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n When talking about K-ON! we're talking about Kyo-ani here. As expected from them they can draw an art that can attract people very easily. K-ON!'s art is consider good, but not great like their other projects. (You know it...) I gave them an 8 but it should be the maximun they can get too since their art won't be better than this current one already.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n Can't really give them an 8 since THIS IS A MUSIC ANIME! Their opening \"Cagayake Girls\" and their ending \"Don't say Lazy\" are really addictive from my perspective. They have the music sounds (for sure), their moving sounds, simple sounds but that's all. They don't have anything that goes very deep into reality at all. At least they earned a 9 for their good OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n One Word! SIMPLE! It's very simple, but still classic. What do we have?\\n\r\nHirasawa Yui- \"A clumsy girl who turns out to be good at guitar\"\\n\r\nAkiyama Mio-\" A cool and beuatiful girl who turns out to be (ahem) Moe and very shy\"\\n\r\nTainaka Ritsu-\" A super active girl who always do something mad\"\\n\r\nKotobuki Tsugumi-\" A kind, organized, honest girl who came from a rich family.\\n\r\nSee any similarities? (Those who already see Lucky Star)\\n\r\nHirasawa Yui  Hiiragi Tsukasa\\n\r\nAkiyama Mio  Hiiragi Kagami\\n\r\nTainaka Ritsu  Isumi Konata\\n\r\nKotobuki Tsugumi  Takara Miyuki\\n\r\nConclusion: It's just like Lucky Star Characters but put Tsukasa as the Main herione instead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\n I'm not particullary a \"MOE\" addict guy, but K-ON! does turn on my alarm to shout \"MOE!\" a lot. The serie does show very simple jokes, but some are too much (going like \"huh\"?) and we can't understand. Since this is a Music School Life kind of anime the only thing we can enjoy it is their school life + their music. This serie does only give Simple enjoyment and gives nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n From what I told through out my review this anime is really SIMPLE! They don't give anything stress nor anything boring but just simple. This anime is really good for people who want to sit back and relax or when they have nothing to do. In my perspective, the only reason I still watch this show is to see if they can really make an awesome music or not and that's all.",

Whatever your taste, we have the moe flavor you're looking for!  The pure moe power of the main characters is scary in the inevitable character shipping wars that will plague all K-ON! discussions from now until forever.\r\nInevitably, if you're notin the mood for Moe Ice Cream, it's best to not come into the shop since all other fields are secondary to the characters in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, it is mostly there so that we can see new reactions of our favorite girl rather than to captivate your heart or intrigue your mind.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly with the music, while the opening, and especially the ending, themes might fool you into thinking this series is a moe version of Beck, a few episodes will quickly expose the lack of motivation (and sheer tea loving laziness) in the characters to perform continuous \"Parallel Days\" concerts for the viewer's musical pleasure.  That said, the few songs done in the series are alright, but the main musical pleasure found in this series is the series ED, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you find your waifu flavor in K-ON!, then you'll enjoy the series; otherwise, try going out for some pizza instead.",

            "content": "After reading about the hype and suggestions I decided to give K-on a try. I thought I'd be doing myself a favor by watching it. Coming into the series with that in mind I didn't realize I was watching an anime with 1 episode, by that I mean every damn episode is the same as the last, there is little to no character development, there is really nothing to see in K-on. Save your time and just don't even think about watching this grass grow.\r\nStory:\r\nIt's hard to talk about because it's not even there. There is no story worth following in this anime. Sure, it'sa slice-of-life anime but the story consist of a girls life with boring scenarios. At the start there are some problems that the girl faces, then slowly once that's over you'd expect something more, something exciting and dramatic, but no, nothing happens and I'm sitting here wondering if my Media Player is broken, why does the same episode keep playing?\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhile the artwork is not exactly dreadful, it's nothing to show off. You may come into this show thinking that the artwork is wonderful, it's not. It seems like every character in the anime is a copy and paste of the last with the hair/hair color adjusted.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBeing a music based show I'd expect Kyoto to include a lot more songs and performances into K-on. The OP and ED are by no means bad, but going into the show if you were expecting to be blown away by any songs, you won't be. The singing in the song is just flat out boring, I'm not calling it bad, but there is nothing that makes you go \"Wow, I would love to DL this.\". There are no voices that stand out, and while there are groups that don't have a voice that stand out and they just simply harmonize, K-on fails to do that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI don't know why I even finished K-on, maybe I expected it to get better, maybe I wanted to listen to good music, maybe I was trying to find a story, but in the end what I found was that I downloaded the same episode 13 times, and watched the same one, 13 times.\\n",

            "content": "To get an idea of just how much work KyoAni put into K-On!, take a gander at the manga. Yup, aside from a few pages of more detailed stuff, it's a comic strip. Comic strips in general have to have the set-up and punch line of a joke within each strip (unless you're Matt Groening), so the comedy tends to be either slapstick or very, very fast (see also: Lucky Star), and very few strips even attempt a long-form story-- those that do typically aren't comedies, the ones that I can remember are Dick Tracy and Spider-Man. Whereas Lucky Star, KyoAni's previous moe comic stripadaptation, simply let fly with the gags machine gun-style, K-On! has a more iyashi/mattari vibe to it. Preserving that feel means that the production staff had to come up with content, probably with Kakifly's cooperation, to keep the pace of the comedy from running away from the show. That's not easy, in fact, I bet they took at least six months just planning the scenarios for the entire run.\\n\\n\r\nThe result is a \"just right\" paced comedy about a girl who joins a rock band club because she thought it would be easy. But that's not all to the story-- we also have a bassist with stage fright, a troublemaker drummer, a super strong keyboard player from a rich family, and a rhythm guitarist with mad skillz. The character dynamics were probably layered one on top of another in the manga because LOL, but fleshed out in the anime they are complex, hilarious, and heartwarming; for example, Mio resists performing in front of a crowd, but is assertive enough to regularly deliver a patented Fist of Justice (TM) to Ritsu's head.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, all that effort would've been wasted had they cut corners in casting. They needed at least two capable singers in addition to the roles above. Aki Toyosaki not only can voice an iyashi airhead dojikko, she's also a member of the idol group Sphere (so is Mugi's voice actress, Minako Kotobuki). Yoko Hikasa delivers a spot-on performance as Mio, and as for her singing voice, well, she sings a fantastic end credits theme. I'm pretty sure every actress in the show is a talented singer except for Satomi Sato (the poor gal has the hardest time holding a tune) -- but at least she got some really good training by season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't about the music (in fact the girls spend more time having afternoon tea), but when there's a live performance, it's something special. The first live performance is re-styled as a music video, and you could only get this version of Fuwa Fuwa Time featuring Husky Yui as part of a promotional event (damn you Japan and your exclusives). Taking just part of the verse in the manga and expanding it to a full song is no small feat, but this show featured 3 songs (plus one more in the CDs for season 1) in the performances. The concert in the finale is, fittingly, the climax of the show. The opening and ending are fantastic, and when Azusa is introduced midway in the show, the opening animation is updated to include her (the edits don't flow as nicely as the first version, though, and a lot of the shots don't include Azusa-- but a full re-draw would've been costly) and both songs use the 5-member version with Azusa's mad shredding solos. I think it's cool that they updated the songs and animation for the fifth member.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I wish the (initial?) North American DVD release didn't do is change part of the soundtrack-- the first \"quick jam\" performed for Yui in episode 1 replaced the original edit's Tsubasa wo Kudasai with a so-so performance of Aura Lea. Understandable, maybe they couldn't get a license, and not nearly as bad as replacing the entire audio track like Nelvana's Cardcaptors, but disappointing because the cover song in the OST no longer has any connection to the show other than the girls having a fun jam session together. Not a huge deal, just wanted to get that off my chest.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are, as usual for a KyoAni production, amazing, but there's a special story in the setting chosen for the girls' high school (maybe someone's already covered this, oh well). The school is modeled after an elementary school in a little town called Toyosato that was almost demolished in 2002 over the objections of residents, but was halted when violence against protesters became national news. Today the old school building still stands, and there's even a cafe in, I believe, the old library, and it's a destination of anime fans to this day. It's the character of the old school building (for example, the tortoise and hare decorations on the stair railings) adds a great deal of depth to the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe strengths of series 1 are in the chemistry among the band members, the neatly-packaged drama, and side-splitting comedy. In terms of substance there's little else there (which is typical of comedies), but this is one \"cute girls doing cute things\" show that strikes a great chord.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a great gag from the bonus strips in the inside cover of the manga used in the finale and season 2, though the anime series didn't get to use the whole series of jokes.",

All I cared about is to be turned into a euphoric blob and I have to say, it's nice to not be a human every once in a while...\r\nYep. So somehow, blob me is typing this right now. Don't mind the change though. I was fully prepared after becoming too affectionate with the show. After all, sweet besties are always a treat to watch. Whether that's having silly fun, eating yummy desserts together, or playing music. Theylaughed, I laughed. They smiled, I smiled. They lazed around, I lazed around. They're happy? I'm happy! Life doesn't always need dramatic events. I mean, have you had those rare moments when there were no panic and only relief? Like waking up thinking you're late for school or work but it was actually the holiday. Nice feeling isn't it, being able to relax? That same floaty sensation wrapped itself around this pure slice of life. Really, nothing much went on in the story. But that was exactly why the enjoyment worked. Nothing much happened, so the girls' different but equally childlike personalities can glow against what should've been a dull setting. They were such a likable bunch with great bonds and similar love for music. It's no wonder why I can't count how many times my jaw tires out from laughing because of their interactions. No wonder why my heart tires out after getting bombarded with tons of cuteness. Huh, no wonder why I turned into a blob. Life works in mysterious ways sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! I can't fully talk about cuteness without expressing the art. Yes, it was simple but blobby me liked it. Blobby me also thought the simplicity helped in defining the cuteness even further as too much details can be masking. Let's see here, the ingredients. Chubby face, big eyes, innocent expressions, adorable clothes. Ah, that's eyebleach right there! So sorry for any puppies and kittens and other cute animals out there. You guys are still great but this is a major competitor. My human self melted from all the warmth in the atmosphere. Even more with the animation. Dynamic and fluidity communicated with delightful consistency. Their reactive body mannerisms spoke emotions when words were not needed. Oh, and hello deformations! Other than the fact they looked like blob me, intended or not, I found that it emphasized the comedic nature of the characters really well so smiles turned into giggles. And when they spoke or chatter actually, you can describe the voice acting as endearing. Blissful pretty much every time. Not many background soundtracks but they didn't bogged down the fluffiness. Being characters from their own music club, the couple of songs they played on their concerts were nice to listen to. Seeing them enjoying themselves up on the stage always brought a smile to my blobby face.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, watching a few episodes of K-On! at night in a soft bed with a fluffy blanket, I always slept feeling really happy. Blob or not, goofing around with an anime like this to distract you once in a while is really not a bad thing to conclude your day on a relaxing note.",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\nThe whole story really with K-ON is forming the Light Music Club as well as getting Yui to start practicing with her Guitar. The problem I have is the unexpected jumps from each Episode. In the first half, It has only been 1 year since forming the club with 4 Members and after that, towards the end of the series, another member joins, which in turn adds another year. When Azusa joins the band as another guitarist, Yui herself doesn't know much about Guitars, especially when she asked Azusa about tuning and all the other stuff. By 1 year, Yui should have at leastsome knowledge on using the Guitar not just working on the notes. Which brings up to another problem. It seems too quick for Yui to perfect all those notes for a beginner. As much as I agree with \"They are good when they play together!\" I still don't understand how you can perform that great on stage as a beginner. I probably guess they wanted to fit all the plot in 12 Episodes, but at the same time, It really makes the entire story confusing. It could have been interesting to see Yui working step by step on the Guitar and then have a concert later on. I honestly think they have shown too much \"Tea time\" Fillers instead of rehearsing together as a band. But of course, we don't always want to watch them constantly practice and instead, just balance both of them out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAt first, the characters looked pretty weird because I was completely used to the style that other Animes follow. As I kept watching It, I've gotten used to It. It might be weird for some people, but It will eventually grow on you as you keep watching. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\r\nThis rating may vary by other people's taste in music. If you really aren't a big fan of Japanese music, then I guess you probably won't enjoy K-ON as much. But If you a fan of Japanese Music (any genre really), K-ON might be a good choice. The OP and Outro is fantastic. As I kept watching It, I've always listened to It and not skip It unlike other animes I watch where I sometimes skip some OP and Outro. The Concert Music is pretty awesome as well. Like I said, It just comes down to your taste in Japanese music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7/10)\\n\r\nEvery character seems to be just fine. Nothing to really complain about. Just your typical 4 (later on, 5) girls doing their part on having fun as a band.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite the confusing story, I really enjoyed this Anime. And one of the first Anime that I completed in a week since I tend to procrastinate when I watch. I guess the Music kept me entertained the whole time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow that I finished Season 1, I'm looking forward to see what Season 2 has to offer. At least now they have 24 Episodes rather than 12 Episodes like this. Season 1 could have at least 24 Episodes to prevent bad first impressions of the show, but hopefully Season 2 will fix that.",

And also, this is mostly to convince the people who haven't watched the anime yet.\r\n[10] Story\r\n[10] Art\r\n[10] Sound\r\n[10] Character\r\n[10] Enjoyment\r\n[10] Overall\r\nThe story is not as cliche as many animes I've watched, and this storyline is actually quite amazing. At first thought, it looks boring and all, but it really grows on you after an episode or two. I really loved every episode so far, especially after episode 7. My advice, even if starts off a bit boring to you, keep watching. You will definitely be hooked.I started off having a moderate amount of anticipation for this anime, but now, I definitely can say it's my favorite so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and characters can go together. Like all animes, the characters have to look good to you, and they have to be able to grow on you. Well, you might think \"It's only 13 episodes. There would be very little character development!\" but if you keep watching and enjoy yourself, you would be used to every one of them by the end of episode 2 at latest. Yui, Mio, and Ritsu would be my favorite out of the cast, and to top it off, they can make you laugh. Did I mention that they actually look decent, as compard to some other anime characters nowadays?  They really grow on you, they really do. Also, be sure to keep your eyes open on episode 6, 7, and 8. I think those were my personal favorites so far. Hm, the new member Azusa seems interesting too though. \\n\\n\r\nSound... You're asking for a review on sound in an anime based on Music, Comedy, and Friendship? Well, the music may have some weird lyrics (cheers to Mio for that), but actually, they sound really good. The Op song sounded a bit weird to me at first, but I eventually started to muse myself into it. The Ed song was great for me at first hearing. They also make different kinds of music during the anime, recently \"My Love is a Stapler.\" as found in Ep8. It sounded good, and the duo of Mio and Yui sounds great as well. Also, the voice acting during this anime was pretty top-notch. The voices match the character personnels extremely well. The \"kawaii and open\" voice used for Yui fits her perfectly. If you don't understand what I mean, watch episode 6-8. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Oh come on. Ask anyone else who watched the anime and loved it. This show is like a 10x improved comedy compared to any others. Many people prefer to compare it to Lucky Star, which of course, K-On always has the upper lead. The show has its ups and downs, just like any other anime, but I guarantee that this anime WILL make you fall out of your chair, fist the ground in tears and laughter, and beg for the next episode. Of course, it depends on what your preferences are, but then again, these are mine. Yui will always be my favorite character ever. Also, there's alot of parodies in this anime, similar to Lucky Star. Each episode will leave you wanting the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a brilliant adaption. Story is a bit more original as compared to many others, the characters are some of the best I've ever seen, the music is actually part of the anime, not just some BGM, and the main factor is the comedy. There's so much funny stuff in this anime. I think I laughed more in this than I did in any other anime. But then again, I love to laugh. This is my second review for an anime, so please don't be too harsh, okay?",

I first heard about K-ON! while looking at comments on a \"Super Driver\" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu theme song) video, and one of the comments mentioned K-ON!. I became interested and decided to watch K-ON! and I loved it!\r\nStory: Originally, it begins with the girls trying to prevent their light music club from being abolished. After they complete that, it just becomes another one of those slice of life comedies, but somehow, K-ON! becomes highly interesting and pulls you in. Kind of like Azumanga Daioh. \r\nArt: I highly enjoyed the art and animation in thisanime. The instruments especially, looked so realistic, I remember staring at them in awe whenever they were on screen. I thought the K-ON! girls were adorable; I especially liked their eyes!\\n\\n\r\nSound: K-ON! has some of the best anime music I have ever heard. I LOVE \"Cagayake! GIRLS\" it's my favorite song from this anime. I also love \"Don't say 'lazy'\" one of my favorite anime endings. The rest of K-ON!'s music is just as outstanding as its opening and ending themes. I love an anime with good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Although all the girls' personalities are typical in an anime like this (Or any anime for that matter), something about the K-ON! girls makes them differ from other anime girls. I can't seem to find what it is however, but these girls are so likeable! Like the girls from Ichigo Mashimaro, or the aforementioned Azumanga Daioh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed K-ON!, I truly did. I'm one of those people that loves slice of life comedies, so I could be a bit biased on this review. The girls are adorable, the art is great, and the music is amazing. If you love slice of life comedies, then you'll love this.",

            "content": "\"Once upon a time, there was a boy who couldn't do anything. He's been blessed by the gods and now he can do everything perfectly. The End.\"\r\nGreat story right? No? It's too short?! It took me 2 hours to write the story so I thought it would take you guys 2 hours to read my story. My story above is somewhat related to the story of this anime. I said somewhat.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story is focused on Yui, a girl who is entering high school. She saw an advertisement poster of a \"Light Music Club\" and decided to join the club even though she doesn't knowhow to play any instruments. \\n\r\nThe story is basically simple. She joins a club, the girls in the club decided to teach her and she learns how to play a guitar. When I said simple, I meant it. There's really nothing much going on every episode. It's just cute girls doing cute things and drinking tea. There's also not much story development which didn't bother me. The reason why my story rating is high because the story is very simple and doesn't require much thinking into it. That's a negative when it comes to other anime but not on this one.  I'm also a fan of \"slice of life\" anime so that's another reason why the story didn't bother me.\\n\r\nThe story pacing is obviously fast considering that the show only had 12 episodes which is acceptable to me. (13 if you count the Extra Episode and 14 if you count the OVA) One episode, they were in Year 1 and another episode, they're celebrating New Years day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is very good.. Not the greatest but I wasn't expecting a perfect animation so it's fine by me. Since the show is all about cute things, the animation used here matched. Although, the use of cliche facial expressions bothered me a bit in the first few episodes but I got used to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nAs you know, the show is focused on music. Which means the anime needs to have great music and that's what they exactly did. Most of the music including the opening is great and catchy. Especially that song... What was it called? Ahh, it was Fwafwa Time. The cutest song I've ever heard and Yui singing it makes it even more cuter. One song I didn't like is the ending song. I prefer Mio not singing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nI did say the characters are cute right? Yes, they are cute and they have different personalities that makes them likable and unique to each other. \\n\r\nWe got Yui, a 15 year old teenage girl and the main protagonist of the show. Yui is the most laziest and weirdest kid you'll ever see. She cannot do anything and her younger sister does the work for her. At first, I thought Yui was the younger sister and Ui was the oldest but it's actually the opposite. Yui plays the guitar despite not knowing how to play it. She later learns how to play it though.  Then we have Mio, a 16 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show. She is a very shy girl and gets easily scared. She plays the bass guitar and does not want to play the lead guitar for reasons that are very obvious . Then we have Ritsu, a 15 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show.  She is a very energetic girl and is friends with Mio for a very long time. She likes to bother Mio most of the time by scaring her. She plays the drums because of her energetic personality. Finally, we have Tsumugi, a 16 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show. She is a calm girl with sweet personality. She is a rich girl which the anime shows a bunch of times and she plays the keyboard. Some might refer to it as the electronic piano but they're both the same. There will be one character who will be introduced later in the show but I don't want to spoil you guys who this character is. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much. It's a fun and relaxing anime to watch and it's very cute. There are hilarious moments in the show and there are a lot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8.6/10) (I am not rounding my rating to 9)\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is fun to watch. It's cute girls doing cute things and the story is very simple. I'm also a bit surprised that there's not a lot of fanservice considering that the cast is all-girls. There is some but not as much and it's not too excessive. My advice to you is don't take this anime seriously. Watch it with an open mind and you'll definitely love this anime. There are some people who are not a fan of slice of life genre. If you're not a fan of slice of life then don't bother watching the show because you're just wasting your time and I'm 99.9% sure you'll just hate it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Simple and cute story\\n\r\n-Animation is very well done\\n\r\n-Great soundtrack\\n\r\n-Great characters\\n\r\n-Does not take itself seriously\\n\r\n-A lot of hilarious moments\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Yui can be a bit annoying sometimes\\n\r\n-English Dub uses Japanese honorifics\\n",

            "content": "K-On! is a brilliant, yet simple telling of lovable, incredibly real characters and their exploits. What K-On! excels in is not its storytelling or any deep philosophical themes, but rather in how unbelievably real and relatable the characters are written and animated. The environments are also extremely detailed and accurate; I\u2019d suggest looking at videos comparing the anime to the city it\u2019s based on.\r\nThe characters in K-On! all stand by themselves as concrete and likable. I wouldn\u2019t doubt anyone would kill so see an entire series dedicated to their favorite character. Personally, this is the first series I\u2019ve seen where I can\u2019t pinpoint a \u2018favorite\u2019character. I can think of multiple reasons as to why four of the five characters would be my favorite (I was not too fond of the Azusa). However, what makes K-On! transcend other similar anime is not how awesome the characters are, but the way they interact with one another.  All of the girls in K-On! grow individually, as well written characters should, but they very visually also grow as a group. They naturally influence each other and the people around them in a manner that is almost never accurately depicted in fiction. This type of character development is sometimes pointed out by Azusa, which is probably why I didn\u2019t like her.  And, even though there is an entire arc dedicated to this idea, I believe it\u2019s more effectively done throughout the series as a whole. \u201cThe power of friendship,\u201d is usually brought up upon in reviews with negative connotation, but in this case, and perhaps solely this case, it\u2019s an amazing thing. The way in which the girls change each other truly does show the power of friendship. All of the girls overcome some part of themselves, brilliantly, subtly so, through the influence of the other girls. I would argue that the main theme of the anime is exactly that, though the \u2018coming of age\u2019 part of it is also done really well. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to give a rating solely on how much I loved this anime and its characters, I would give it a 10; however, I simply can\u2019t say it\u2019s as \u201cgood\u201d as the animes I would consider to be 9s or 10s. I would still give it my highest recommendation for anyone that wants to witness what character animation and subtle character development should ideally be, as well as to anyone that wants to see a fun, lighthearted anime.",

            "content": "I can't help wonder why I can only write negative reviews, and K-ON is one of them ofc. And I'll begin ranting about it step by step :\r\nStory-2-\r\nFirst of all I can't even begin to understand why people even like K-ON, its just so freakin' dull, it revolves around nothing. Every ep is completely pointless and boring. And I know slice of life is pointless most of the time, but this one was just empty all the way. As a matter of fact the plot ends in the first ep. I'll use an example to express my views more clearly : Lucky Star, another pointlessanime, but it was so totally funny it kept me hooked on till the last ep, and even as it ended I wanted more eps for it. But K-ON had nothing special about it, I practically died of boredom. Whenever I watched it my mind was totally blank as if I was asleep. And let me tell you it was hard keeping awake. Reading the Synopsis or Description on K-ON's page gives you the entire summary of the 13 eps.\\n\\n\r\nArt-1-\\n\\n\r\nK-ON is the artwork of an elementary kid trying to pass off as a mangaka. I know its suppose to be moe, but still. No shading. No detail. No skill. K-ON is made of only one colour shade and the drawings of the characters imply that they had no bones in their body. As crappy as my art style is, I have to admitt I can draw better than this. If I can I would have given it a zero, but there are two reasons that I didn't, 1st is the fact that its not possible to give it a zero, 2nd is that the intruments the characters are well drawn and is as realistic as they can be in an anime. Another problem that I have concerning the art is that it has no style or originality of its own. Lucky Star art also stinks but atleast its original and creative.\\n\\n\r\nSound-2-\\n\\n\r\nWhy 2 ? Lets start with the songs of the light music club. At first they seem to be catchy and fun, but after a while you realize that they all have they same pattern and genre. In short if you listened to one of their songs is listening to all of them. As for the voices of the characters I have no comments on it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-2-\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters and all their personalities in one word: moe. Thats it there is nothing else in to their personalities beyond that. When they get angry they get moe angry, when they get sad they get moe sad, when they get happy they get moe happy. Everything thing about them is moe, can this anime get anymore pathetic? Again I'll use lucky star as a reference. In LS the characters have their own peronas. Kona- otaku, Kaga- bossy, Tsuka- airhead, Miyu- classy. In  K-On Yui- moe, Mio- moe, Ritsu- moe, Mugi- moe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 1-\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before i fell asleep throughout the anime. So yea, it was pretty hard to enjoy it. I will never watch this anime again, even if someone pays me to do it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-2-\\n\\n\r\nThe actual overall is 1 but I decided to pity this anime and give it a 2 instead. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First review, don't like it? deal w/ it. Anyway, lets get to it shall we?\r\nStory: There really isn't all that much to say about K-on's plot because, like Azumanga Daioh and lucky Star before it, the plot is nonexistent, seeing that it's a comedy/slice of life anime of course. The entire show is episodic with no arcs at all; each episode has the characters doing things like band practice, shopping, training camp, and stuff like that. Also there's one thing one should keep it mind when expecting something from a slice of life anime: EXPECT NOTHING. Why? Because just about every slice of life animealways have the same tired and true episodic story formula meaning that they contain: no plot development, no twist, and nothing to spoil about. no matter how great the anime truly is, the slice of life genre won't bring anything special to the table (if it already did then f*ck me -_-).\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation: equally, their both really good, that's what you would expect from Kyoto Animation. The character designs, not only were they done by the same person who worked on lucky Star, but importantly, they also capture the moe-ness of the show quite well. while the animation is good, most of the time when the characters are moving or running, it seems to have a rather crude, sluggish look to it, but it was still alright nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: both op/en themes songs are great, but I kinda like the opening a lot more and the songs the girls play are about as fun and catchy as the songs from Nerima Daikon Brothers ^^. I heard that some of the seiyuus are newcomers to show , well regardless, their performances were rather good if I say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: some of them are kinda likable depending on the person I guess, but to me, they all range from decent and interesting to stupid and annoying as hell. The only character i liked out of everyone else is Mio; unlike the cast (excluding Azusa), Mio is someone I could take seriously and also laugh with instead of at her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: it various. Actually when I got to the middle of the show, I was really annoyed with how stupid the characters were acting, and not just that, but I found the moe-ness too much for me. By the end, however, I started to find it more enjoyable and satisfying. For a comedy anime, there actually is a bit of substance and SOME serious content, but then again this is a comedy so it really doesn't go all that deep at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the end, K-on is a fun and cute-if not slightly irritating-piece of light fluffy entertainment. Even if you don't like moe, or better yet hate it, at least give K-on a try, it is definitely a show that should be seen more than once.",

I also find Mio's shy personality  quite adorable and contributes a lot on the moe factor.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say I enjoyed this anime very much, even after 2 years after I finished watching and till now that I thought I submit a review, it's still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is pretty good and has an awesome soundtrack to go with it. Definitely a must-watch show if you love watching cute girls doing cute things, if not, then I suggest you find another anime as you would most certainly would not enjoy this show.",

I read things like 'why do they make it with guys, it sucks now!\" and \"it's just K-On!, but with guys. Why do stupid girls always want what we have?!\"\r\nApart from the irony of saying \"stupid girls\" and wanting more anime about girls, one thing stood out for me: \"K-On! is like Free!\".\r\nSeeing how I love Free!, what better thing to check out next than K-On?\r\nI was not disappointed: it has the same kind of funny, essentially good-natured type of characters that Free!has. It is filled with humor, friendship, the drive to succeed (well, sometimes). Though I like sports/club anime, I don't mind when the characters spend episodes doing other stuff. Therefore, I was not bothered with all the cake-eating and chatting they all do. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as so often with this type of anime, I learned things about something I knew next to nothing about musical instruments and light music. \\n\\n\r\nK-On has the type of wacky humor that relies on characterization, which lifts it far above anime that rely purely on fanservice humor. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame that all the negativity dumped on Free! has kept girls away from this anime, since it is really good.",

            "content": "\"I love K-On!\"-Hirasawa, Yui\r\nK-On, what to say about it.  Well, first of all this has probably been on my on-hold list since the time I joined MAL, back in April.  I tried several times to start it again and watch it, but time and time again, it didn't really hold my interest.  A few days ago, I decided that I should just get it over with and finish it, so I sat down at my computer, went to my favorite streaming site, yes I don't download anime onto my computer, and began to watch, and I have to say, this has tobe one of the best comedies I've ever watched in my short anime lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story.  If you are looking for a compelling story that follows it's events then this is not for you because time often changes in large stretches of time, although for me I didn't really notice it.  Also, if you think this will be like NANA (does it really look like NANA, people?) or Nodame Cantabile (again does this even look like Nodame Cantabile), this series isn't for you either.  However, if you are looking for something fun, interesting, and cute to watch this series [i]is[/i] for you.  K-on basically follows 4, eventually 5, girls around as they establish the Light Music Club and the friendship that follows.  Whether it's going to training camps at Mugi's \"small\" summer villas, hanging out in the music room eating Mugi's sweets, or actually practicing these girls are always having fun.  There really isn't any drama in this series and it is throughout it's 13 episodes, a fun and fluffy show with really now plot.\\n\\n\r\nYay, the music.  The music in here really depends on your personal preferences.  This music isn't classical, or punk rock, but a bouncy, kind of peppy, upbeat music that I found myself thoroughly enjoying.  I, personally LOVED the OP and ED themes.  I liked the upbeat tone to them and just thought that they were awesome.  The songs performed by the girls are great too, and I found myself tapping my fingers to the beat and wishing it would go on.  The background music and such isn't very memorable, but it's good all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, was something that I liked and thought was very eye appealing.  K-on is from KyoAni, which we all know for Clannad, Air, and Kanon 2006, at for me, at least, I thought that they did a very good job with the art. Yes, the art was choppy in some places, but for the most part it was very nice and I thought if was nice.  The characters' eyes, I especially liked.  The backgrounds were very nice, eye catching, although probably not as much as Clannad for instance.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters.  We have clumsy, forgetful, but overall very lovable Yui, shy, mature, scaredy-cat Mio, provider of sweets and all around good person Mugi, the club's headstrong and confident \"leader\" Ritsu, and the newest addition Azusa.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore I got into K-on I noticed that Mio had a huge fan-base, and I had always wondered what was so great about this character.  Well, I have to say that I have found myself apart of that very fan base as the series went on and we got to know Mio better.  She is Ritsu's best friend, an extremely shy person and a major scardy-cat, which Ritsu plays on constantly.  Mio was sucked into joining the Light Music Club by Ritsu, originally intending to join the Literature Club.  She is the one of the most mature people in the band, unsuccessfully trying to get the members to play more often and more seriously.  She serves as the song writer, occasional vocalist, and bass player on the band.\\n\\n\r\nYui is probably my favorite character in the whole show.  Now this show does not have much character growth at all.  Yui is probably one, if not the only character to go through some sort of growth.  At the beginning, Yui is lazy, and doesn't really know what she is going to do with herself in high school.  She is clumsy and doesn't understand many things.  She also has a tendency to forget something she's learned when she's learned something new, causing some grief for the other members of the Light Music club.  Yui enters high school and goes in determined to join a club, the one problem being that she has no idea what club she should join.  She eventually happens upon a flier for the Light Music Club and decides to join thinking that Light meant castanets.  Described by Ritsu as clumsy and a girl with no rhythm, Yui has it had the first few weeks having to learn how to play the guitar from scratch and actually having to buy a guitar, although Mugi's sweets and tea were a constant gift to her and something she looked forward to everyday.  Eventually she progresses greatly for someone who was just leaning and the Light Music Club has it's guitarist, and eventually a main vocalist.  Yui's sister and her friend Nodoka notice the changes that Yui goes through and are amazed at her transformation after joining the Light Music Club.  Yui becomes confident and mentions herself that she was unsure of what she was going to do with herself at the beginning of high school, but now knows that she can do it whatever it may be.  I love Yui because she was sweet and was clumsy in a cute sort of way.  She went about her merry ways and tried to make everyone as happy as she possibly could.  I thought she was a great character and really added to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMugi, the sweet and all around good person, that you can't help but like.  Although she comes from a rich family, she is very modest and doesn't flaunt her wealth around.  Her family owns multiple villas, which the club members visit twice for their summer training camps.  Mugi, was another member who didn't intend to join the Light Music Club.  Originally intending to join the choir, she mistook the Music Room for the Choir Room and was convinced to join by Ritsu's \"tragic story\" of the band that she and Mio had promised to make.  Mugi is the provider of sweets for the band members, bringing tea sets, cakes, cookies, and other sweets that the band members, especially Yui enjoy.  She plays the keyboard in the band.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu, the one that started it all.  Ritsu serves as the club leader and often forgets to fill out important papers, leading to the wrath of Mio.  She and Mio were the first members for the Light Music Club.  Probably one of the funniest characters in the series, Ritsu is loud and outgoing, often playing tricks on her best friend Mio.  She gets along extremely well with Yui and when I first started the series I had a hard time telling them apart sometimes.  I love Ritsu because she is a funny person, and radiates confidence.  She plays the drums in the band.  \\n\\n\r\nLast, but not least, the newest member Azusa.  Azusa entered high school with Yui's younger sister and is in the same class.  She joined the Light Music Club after seeing them perform and was shocked at the way that they spent their afternoons in the clubroom.  She often pushes for more practice and a more serious attitude towards their music.  However, she eventually lets it go as she becomes more adjusted.  There isn't a lot mentioned about Azusa, other than she plays the guitar (pretty well too) and that her parents are jazz players.  \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters in K-on were very nice and added a lot to the story.  From Yui's responsible and loving sister, to the eccentric club adviser \"Sawa-chan\" who loves to dress the girls up, they all had an important role and K-on wouldn't have been K-on without them.  Now,\\n\r\nI will not deny that I am a complete and utter amateur when it comes to telling a good voice acting from a bad one, but to me all the voices were nice and I thought that the people behind them did a good job.  Overall the characters were great and played their roles wonderfully in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,  I enjoyed this show a lot.  From the characters to the music, I thought it was all great and that KyoAni did another good job with an anime.  When I started this show again, I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and how much I enjoyed it.  I think that this was a fantastic show and that if you like cute characters, a comedy that doesn't have much of a plot, or you're simply just looking for something fun to watch, then K-on is definitely an anime that you should watch.\\n\r\n~By the way, this is my first review, so constructive criticism and comments are much appreciated. ^^ ~\\n",

            "content": "K-On! (the two seasons I found to be very much the same, and as such will not distinguish between the two) is a CGDCT, moe SoL anime about Yui Hirasawa. Yui is a ditzy, airheaded girl just trying to get by in school, who joins the Keionbu (Light Music Club), despite having no proficiency at all with playing instruments, only doing so because she thought it would be easy from the fact it's \"Light\" music. Though Yui may be officially the \"main\" character, the whole anime is really from the perspective of all five members of the club, who name themselves Hokago Tea Time (HTT).Yui does eventually learn how to play the guitar (her instrument of choice), and the story of HTT begins. Other band members include:\\n\r\nRitsu Tainaka - Club president, who does the bare minimum to actually keep the club afloat, often having to be reminded of things she must do by other members. A tomboyish character, who plays the drums.\\n\r\nTsumugi Kotobuki - Usually referred to as just Mugi, she is HTT's keyboarder. She has a very gentle attitude and prefers to take things easily, and due to her extreme wealth, is most notable for the fact that she brings copious amounts of tea, cakes and biscuits into the club room. Due to her wealth, she often finds herself fascinated by \"middle class\" things such as eating at McDonalds or working a part time job.\\n\r\nMio Akiyama - Shy, reserved, and easily scared, Mio is the voice of reason, often having to play the straight man to Yui or Ritsu, and is much more concerned with trying to make sure the band performs well than the others. She plays the bass, but also writes the lyrics, and sometimes acts as a secondary vocalist.\\n\r\nYui Hirasawa - Extremely unintelligent and almost unable to comprehend what's going on around her, it's a wonder how Yui can dress herself in the mornings. In any case, she is the aloof guitarist for HTT, as well as vocalist.\\n\r\nAzusa Nakano - Azusa is kohai to the rest of HTT, and joins slightly later than the rest of them. She is much more serious than any of the other characters, frustrated that they spend their time joking around and drinking tea, as she joined to play music, but does find herself accepting this more laid-back nature, and is often subject to excessive affection from Yui, who calls her Azunyan. Azusa is a guitarist.\\n\\n\r\nNow, K-On is at the end of the day, a CGDCT. It features a group of 5 teenage girls doing what they do, and not much conflict arises or anything of the sort, as you should know if you are familiar with it. However, upon viewing, I found myself very perplexed by what came about. On one hand, it was just a CGDCT like any other, but, I did find it to, though not exactly groundbreaking or philosophical in its portrayal, seem like some sort of coming of age story as well, almost. It is a difficult concept for me to convey, but I did observe how there was something more to it all. It wasn't just tea parties and band practice (albeit that's what it mostly was), there were several instances of HTT accepting their future of having to go to college, and maybe being separated, of sadness from having to graduate, etc. I suppose perhaps this is just a case of having to watch it yourself to find out, and ultimately, these sort of concepts do take some time to develop, unlike some other shows out there, wherein the emotional and dramatic conflict is nearly instantly created.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to finally stop digressing, K-On is about 5 members of a high school band playing music, and having tea parties together, in a very archetypal form of moe, and one I do not doubt influenced future anime, for better or for worse, depending on where you stand in regards to moe. Now, the characters are musicians, so it is not surprise that the music in K-On is quite splendid as a natural byproduct. Though HTT's music isn't intellectually groundbreaking by any means, it meets its purpose of being enjoyable to listen to, as is the OST that plays throughout the show, with many comfortably recurring themes. One criticism on this front I must make is that I believed all but the first OP and first 2 EDs were very poor, but this is an extremely minor complaint. The music produced by HTT is quite enjoyable to listen to, and I find that the intermission between performances via drinking tea and going down to the arcade is quite a well-placed one, as, in an actual band, it's a whole lot of playing the same few songs over and over, which isn't particularly fun to listen to, and I commend that the times in which we heard the songs was kept to a rather low count, so as to prevent the viewer from growing tired of them, and, as one can rather predictably expect (predictability isn't a bad thing per se), the show ends with a climax via a final performance by HTT.\\n\\n\r\nThe later film release for K-On (titled simply K-On the Movie) is somewhat different from its earlier TV release counterpart, but not majorly so. Rather than taking place in Japan (and generic Japanese highschool #fiftyfuckingmillion), the film has them on a graduation trip to London, wherein I live, and can assuredly say that the director definitely did his research, since London is pretty much spot on, one pleasant surprise being the fact that the people there spoke English with believable London accents, and in the film, the cast visit many major London locations, and thrive in the delightful atmosphere of London. Perhaps I was in a good mood the day I saw the film, but it did seem considerably better than the TV release. The animation looked crisper, the comedy was much better (a commonplace setup for a joke was HTT not understanding things properly due to not speaking English very fluently, and this was executed very well, it did not ever get tired or used in a time when it shouldn't have been), and overall, the structure of it all was far superior, perhaps due to the fact that it is demanded by a 90 minute film, as opposed to 26 episodes 30 minutes each.\\n\\n\r\nI have jabbered on quite a bit here, and perhaps somewhat inarticulately as well, but I shall wrap things up here. K-On is a superb anime, combined with an even better film. The comedy, music, characters, writing and flow all is orchestrated in a way quite unlike any of the many previous CGDCTs I've seen. It is something I can strongly to recommend to anyone but the most staunch critics of moe. I can only hope for a season 3 some time this decade.",

            "content": "Here's my take on the 12 + episodes of K-On Season 1 by Kyoto Animation Studios.\r\nLet me say first that this anime is surprisingly fresh and bubbly all through out episode 1 up to the last episode of this light music anime.\r\nI do not normally like watching slice of life anime nor anime that are music or arts based, but I still tried it with K-On and it was not a waste of my limited free time.\r\nThe story is about a Ritsu and Mio's desire to be a part of a light music band in their school. When they noticed that they didn't have enoughmembers even after they got the heart of Tsumugi. They set their eyes on Yui a freshmen who stumbled on their club room thinking that it would be fun to play the castanet, but unbeknownst to her that she would run into the path of becoming their lead guitarist/vocalist. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a breath of fresh air for me which I really needed to unwind. The story was sugar, spice and everything nice all mashed together into every episode. I love how the overall theme of the musical band/high school life were represented.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good and not too flashy which it needed. Sound and music is one of the best part of K-On as they are all quirky and fun watch and listen to. \\n\\n\r\nYui and the gang all stand out in their own zany way and I just love Mio's reaction Ritsu's pranks, Yui's clumsy moments and Nodoka!! Just gotta love a bespectacled character in every anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, K-On is an easy binge watch, and you would not regret every bit of their antics per episode.\\n\\n\r\nI would give K-On 9 Gitaa out of 10. <3",

            "content": "Yui Hirasawa is just an ordinary, albeit lazy, teenage girl with no real ambition or direction in life. While she initially has no interest in doing any extracurricular activities in her new high school, her fear of becoming a neet inspires her to check out the Light Music club, which she\u2019d heard about in passing, and which she thinks would be an easy, low-maintenance club where she\u2019d be able to hang out and play light music, like the castanets or something. She couldn\u2019t be more wrong, though, as the band turns out to be led by Ritsu Tainaka and Mio Akiyama, two girls with actualambition of forming a band and performing, and the gentle Tsumugi Kotobuki, who was drawn in previously by the prospective band\u2019s friendly atmosphere. Now on the spot, Yui discovers that if she wants to have a chance of joining this club, and hanging out with her new friends on a regular basis, she\u2019ll have to buy and learn the guitar! Thankfully, she does wind up being something of a savant with the instrument, but will that be enough to make her a worthy band member, or will all of their efforts lead to a flop?\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019ve watched a lot of anime from Kyoto Animation, you may have noticed that in the late 2000s, the animation quality of their work was a bit inconsistent. I touched on this in my Clannad Afterstory review, but K-On! seems to get the brunt of the attention from this issue, even though I\u2019d still argue that Afterstory had it way worse. For most of Kyo-Ani\u2019s existence, they were known to produce only the highest quality animation, full of consistent character models, fluid, gorgeous animation and highly expensive art techniques, but there was a gap around this particular time period, and K-On! is firmly a product of that time. I\u2019d like to call it K-On!\u2019s ugly phase, but the truth is, it\u2019s inconsistent nature meant that it also looked fine, or even downright good, at least some of the time. To be sure, there are moments in K-On! that proudly carry the flag of what Kyo-Ani\u2019s capable of, but they\u2019re unfortunately few and far between, and their usage isn\u2019t even consistent, as similar scenes will be animated differently.\\n\\n\r\nto give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about, there are two scenes where the cast sings on stage at their school... Once at their first culture fest, and again at their second one a year later(yes, time passes awkwardly fast at first). For the first one, the animators pulled out all the stops, providing fluid animation that was almost on par with the Live Alive scene from Haruhi, and pairing it up with a beautiful fantasy music video of the girls getting in trouble with the law while cruising the desert in a convertible. It\u2019s a very inspired and well executed scene, and it had a fucking tank in it. At the second scene, a year later, the visuals are heavily downplayed, and shows a lean towards what many have dubbed the \u2018runny eggs\u2019 style of animation, a technique that somehow showcases frantic movement on the cheap using broken and ugly character models, and if I\u2019m being honest, even the singing itself looks terrible in this scene, with the animators doing god knows what with Yui and Mio\u2019s over-animated but under-budget lips.\\n\\n\r\nActually, now that I think of it, that whole episode looks pretty bad. Culture festival episodes are normally one of the occasions when a production team should work their hardest, since they\u2019re expected to animate an environment where there are a lot of people walking around and a lot of events going on, and they nailed it with the first year, but this one feels stiff and static all the way through, with lifeless frozen crowds and stills of the freeze-framed audience intersperced throughout the concert, like they were trying desperately to save money. This says to me one of two things: Either they blew their budget early and had to work on fumes from there on, which suggests poor budget management, or the whole show was just plagued with poor budget management in general. Seeing how the very first scene of the very first episode was in fact done in the runny eggs style, I\u2019m tempted to believe the latter. Rather than hiding their shoestring budget smartly, they tried to make the series look lavish on as little funds as possible, and it often feels like the most try-hardy thing ever as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork itself, it\u2019s a lot better. The backgrounds are very well detailed, right down to the seemingly pointless and random elements of wear and tear on building interiors, scuff marks on school floors, and merchandise in stores and shops. There are a few scenes that take place in a music shop, and while I don\u2019t personally know enough about guitars to verify if all the models shown on the pegs are taken from real life, they\u2019re convincing enough that I wouldn\u2019t argue if someone said they were. The character designs are also really well done, but it\u2019s kind of to a fault, because I can\u2019t look at them without seeing the work that went primarily into their marketability, as they were very clearly designed to look attractive to a certain sort of viewer, who\u2019d be likely to divide into waifu-worship camps and buy figures and body-pillows of their chosen best girl. It\u2019s true that this sort of thing happens with a lot of anime, but K-On! is one of a very special few where it feels like their proportions, moe elements and appearance varieties were specifically geared towards gaining such a reaction. Color coding wasn\u2019t really a thing yet, I don\u2019t think, but the intention is still right there just the same.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you would think a series that\u2019s about music would have great music, am I right? Well, yeah, in some respects. Being that it\u2019s a series about a band, it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019d be insert sings, aka the songs that are actually written and performed by the band, which is probably the biggest advantage this type of story has over it\u2019s manga counterparts. Yeah, it\u2019s possible for a book series to have fully realized canonical music, but since Mercedes Lackey doesn\u2019t make anime, we\u2019ll have to settle for adaptations. The in-universe music is one of the biggest highlights of K-On!, as it not only feels perfectly in-character and believable given the sensibilities of the character writing the songs and the experience level of the band, but it\u2019s also fun to listen to on it\u2019s own, just as ordinary singles. Granted, it\u2019s no Beck, but it can still sound pretty awesome. The song titles are genuinely funny, with titles as ridiculous as (I\u2019m not making this up) \u2018My Love is a Stapler,\u2019 which might just overtake Chobits\u2019 \u2018I Beg your Pudding\u2019 as the weirdest song title in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf the songs the characters perform are too amateurish for you, there\u2019s always the closing theme, Don\u2019t Say Lazy, which acts as a sort of alternate universe representation of the kind of music video the club might make if they ever went pro(and I say alternate universe because that\u2019s not really the direction the series was ever gonna go), and it is legitimately awesome. On a somewhat sour note however is the opening, because I\u2019m being honest, the endings were always better than the openings for this series. The song \u201cCagayake! GIRLS\u201d is okay, but the singing is a bit too nasally for my taste, and the visuals are way too frenetic and hastily edited, which makes the whole video feel like one giant headache to me. The actual soundtrack is a bit more tolerable, but it\u2019s still very generic and loopy, and if you remember any of it, it\u2019ll probably be for the wrong reasons, as the tracks sometimes play way too loudly, becoming annoying during a lot of the show\u2019s less eventful moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe insert songs are still awesome, and while they didn\u2019t get dubbed for the show\u2019s English release, the dub is still really solid. for the main cast, Bang! Zoom grabbed the legendary Stephanie Sheh for the lead role, where she was able to add a mischievous and cheerful edge to her light-voice, soft-spoken type-casting, playing a character that was firmly within her comfort zone but still different enough to stand out. I should hardly have to state that she loses herself in the role, because this is Sheh we\u2019re talking bout, and this is what she does. They then surrounded her with newcomers to the business and a few under-appreciated journeymen actors, with other voice acting veterans like Karen Strassman, Laura Bailey and Xanthe Huynh appearing in side and supporting roles as the class adviser, a helpful student council member, and Yui\u2019s little sister, who does sound convincingly like she might be related to her. There\u2019s a definite resemblance in her voice. Strassmen also deserves high praise for playing such a nuanced and mood-swing afflicted teacher.\\n\\n\r\nFor the journeyman, Cristina Vee and Cassandra Lee Morris, who play the dynamic duo of Mio and Ritsu respectively, have been working their asses off since 2005, and they\u2019re two of the most reliable character actors in the business. They\u2019ve worked on a lot of projects together in the past, which no doubt helped them pull off the chemistry needed to portray two best friends who\u2019ve been stuck with each other since childhood. I often see Vee brought up, more recently than in the past, as a voice actor to keep your eyes out for, but there aren\u2019t enough people talking about Morris, who seems to have the ability to deeply understand the inner workings of whatever character she\u2019s given, and can play them with such natural ease that she kind of gets overlooked. The perfect example of this is her performance as Kyuubey in Madoka Magika. Of course, Vee also knocked it out of the park in that show, which actually has a few other connections to K-On! now that I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the newcomers, we have Christine Marie Cabanos and Shelby Lindley, both of whom were also in Madoka Magika, which is a sure sign that around the turn of the decade, Bang Zoom was really trying to push these four girls as the next big thing. Lindley and Cabanos both got their start in the 2010\u2019s, but while Lindley played a very lovable Tsumugi, she didn\u2019t do much else in the field. She had a few other roles, but her main source of employment seems to have been Hyperdimension Neptunia, which she played the character Ram in both the series and the games. Cabanos has stuck around, which is a good thing, because it sort of took her a while to find her feet. I honestly don\u2019t like her as Azusa, because just like her role as Madoka, she feels kind of awkward and out of place, like she\u2019s trying to sound smaller and quieter than she really is. If you\u2019ve read my reviews of Kill La Kill and Toradora, you\u2019ll know that I\u2019m much, much more fond of her nowadays, as she\u2019s really proven herself to be a star. Anyway, the dub is great, it\u2019s fairly accurate to the sub, give it a listen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if I may confess something, I\u2019m not the hugest fan of the slice of life genre. That\u2019s not to say I hate it or anything... I don\u2019t really hate any genre, really. There are quite a few slice of life anime I like, quite a few that I hate, a ton that I\u2019m more or less ambivalent to, and a very small number of them that I love. There\u2019s nothing specific that they have to do to please me, but I do ask that whatever they\u2019re doing, they do it well, and put forth a genuine effort. I love Azumanga Daioh because it had a unique identity, it knew exactly what it was and what it wanted to be, and almost everything it did was effective. I love Beck because it\u2019s slice of life elements were overshadowed by it\u2019s coming of age elements, and I love shows like Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid and The Devil is a Part timer because they had really bizarre premises that they explored to the fullest. None of these shows were really plot-heavy, but they all had something about them that I could enjoy either all of or most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, slice of life has earned a bad reputation for itself over the last decade or so, and I\u2019m sad to say that K-On! is kind of a milestone in that evolution. I don\u2019t know how accurate this observation is, but from what I\u2019ve seen, Haruhi Suzumiya popularized the use of school clubs in an anime, and Lucky Star established how successful a show about high school girls doing nothing could be as long as it was aimed at the right audience. K-On!, which was suspiciously produced by the same company as those two titles, was the show that combined those two ideas, and it became such a monster hit that streaming sites have been littered with shows about high school kids... Normally either all-girl, or with just enough boys to establish a harem... Forming a club and then fucking around with no purpose other than to create shipping fantasies, fuel the fetishy fantasies of a bunch of basement dwellers, and sell tons of licensed merchandise. This may not have started with K-On!, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to convince me that it wasn\u2019t a major inspiration for this particular trend.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving it\u2019s cultural impact aside, how is K-On! on it\u2019s own merits? Well, if you\u2019ve been reading my reviews for a while, you may remember my main complaint about Lucky Star being that some characters had stronger comedic chemistry than other characters, and they became more and more boring the farthest you got from the main cast, with several side characters seemingly only existing for the sake of supporting the bigger draws. K-On! doesn\u2019t have this problem. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s strongest element is the synergy of it\u2019s cast. Rather than there being only two characters with a spark between them, and a bunch of extra characters added in at the eleventh hour, K-On! keeps it\u2019s cast small, and they all have strong chemistry with each other. You could take any two characters, put them in any situation, and there\u2019s a chance... Granted, not a guarantee... That something entertaining will happen between them, as they all have strengths and weaknesses that either clash or click with each other.\\n\\n\r\nPart of this is the fact that these characters are all very well written and developed. That\u2019s not to say any of them are unique or anything, because trust me, you\u2019ve seen these characters both before and since, but there\u2019s just enough nuance to their identities that none of them ever feel like one-note jokes. They\u2019re all flawed, but they contribute both to the band and to their friendship, forming some surprisingly complex connections with each other. They make sense together, and on a lot of different levels. This can unfortunately lead to some less than healthy relationships, a few of which are distinctly codependent... Mio\u2019s dynamic with Ritsu, or the far more worrisome one that Yui shares with her younger sister... But they feel natural rather than contrived. Yui is shameless and has a natural charisma, but is also spoiled and lazy. Mio is mature and responsible, but also shy and delicate. Ritsu is passionate and energetic, but also greedy and careless. Tsumugi is generous and agreeable, but also socially awkward and a bit sheltered. They bring out the best and worst in each other, which makes for great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, as funny as the show can be, it\u2019s miserable at drama, and oh boy does it try it\u2019s hand at drama. That\u2019s not to say it never works... At one point, Mio and Ritsu have a fight that feels pretty raw and poignant, for what it is... But if you\u2019re going to have an inspirational drama where your characters have to overcome the odds in order to create some feel good moments, then you have to have stakes, and there are absolutely none here. Yeah, you kinda want to see the band get better and achieve their dreams of performing at the Budokan, but it\u2019s also pretty solidly established that they\u2019re largely fine with goofing off and sitting around a table eating sweets together. The absolute worst case scenario would be if the club got disbanded due to someone\u2019s failing grades, but if that happened, they could easily just hang out and do the same exact thing at someone\u2019s house. Even if you want to see them succeed, there\u2019s absolutely nothing lost if they don\u2019t, which would be fine if they didn\u2019t try so damn hard to make you care.\\n\\n\r\nThe most frustrating thing about this is that they had the perfect solution to this problem, in the form of the fifth band member, Azusa Nakano. an underclassmen who joins in the band\u2019s second year, who is a serious guitarist, and who is actually way better at said instrument than her senpai Yui. You\u2019d kind of think her experience would add some perspective to the group, and she\u2019d inspire them to get off their asses and practice more, and that does kind of happen, but it doesn\u2019t have much of a lasting impact, as she quickly gets drawn into their lackadaisical nature, and I know I\u2019ve been praising the show for the nuance of it\u2019s characters, but this is one instance where there shouldn\u2019t have been as much of a compromise. I\u2019d like to say that her presence is felt more in the second season, but it\u2019s really not, as that season has even less plot and story than this season does, and yeah, it didn\u2019t really have a lot of plot or story to lose in the first place. I know I prefer shows that put forth effort, but the higher you aim, the more you have to commit to it, and K-On! really doesn\u2019t have what it takes to shoot for the moon.\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is available from Sentai filmworks. The second season is twice as long, and while it gets boring more often than not, the movie is pretty damn good. It\u2019s not a retelling of the series... I really hate those, for the record... But it\u2019s not really a sequel either, as it follows events that take place during the second season, which were smartly kept off-screen. The manga is available from Yen Press, which is slightly dirtier than the series, but still mostly PG. There are also two sequel manga, one featuring the girls in college, and one featuring Azusa as a senior forming her own Light Music Club, but that second one\u2019s honestly pretty weak. There are a few OVA episodes that are included in the series DVD releases, and there\u2019s a current manga that started this year called K-On! shuffle, which I know nothing about.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it\u2019s flaws, and it has a few, K-On! is still a fun show to watch, and I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s aged that badly. It actually feels more at home in today\u2019s market, which has been flooded with the dredge that it inspired, than it did back in 2009. Part of this is because of it\u2019s strong cast of relatable characters(seriously, I see bits of myself in every single one of them), but it\u2019s also due to the banging in-universe soundtrack and it\u2019s keen sense of comedy. It\u2019s never going to achieve any sort of legendary status, but I don\u2019t think it really has to, as it succeeds at being a fun little diversion, a decent waste of time, and arguably one of the better school club slice of life anime, even if that\u2019s not saying a whole lot. If you\u2019re looking for a fulfilling story, you could do a lot better, but if you\u2019re looking for some light-hearted fun, you could do a lot worse. I give K-On! a 7/10.",

            "content": "Changing ourselves is never easy. Usually it would take one dramatic or traumatic experience to finally give one a slap at the face that they need to change themselves. Let's take one bad habit - drinking for example. It's easy to drown ourselves in cheap beers and vodka and forget our problems for one night but the next day, when soberness kicks in along with the painful hangover, reality kicks you twice as hard. Your problems didn't disappear. You do it again that night and the night after that and again the next day until your kidney throws in the towel. Your problems still haven'tbeen solved and now you gotta think about that kidney operation. Only then will you start to think rationally and face your original problems instead of running away and stop drinking for once. It's when we hit our lowest points, we are the most susceptible to change. \\n\\n\r\nK-On! is a story about change but it doesn't involve any traumatic experience at all. K-On! is a light, fluffy and heart-warming story of five high school girls and their daily lives in the light music club, more specifically - the story of Hirasawa Yui wanting to finally do something meaningful in her life and stray away from her incompetent, lazy, oblivious and irresponsible self. With help from her childhood friend Nodoka, she finds her way to the light music club and they needed a guitarist. Yui then decides to pick one up even with zero knowledge of playing one. Towards the resolution, Yui is a different Yui from the first episode. She becomes more responsible and reliable. Although it took her quite a while but it proves that with the right guidance, change is possible.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that it was based on a 4 panel manga of the same name, the punchline is always spot on. The jokes - albeit more cuter rather than funny, works well for me. While the plot moves very quickly each episode, it manages to highlight each and every one of the individual characters including the side characters, Nodoka, Ui and Sawaka. The animation and art drastically changed in season 2, making the first season look like a lazy excuse to not deliver the same quality though it's not unforgivable because it may be due to limited budget or whatnot. Giving the audio a solid 10 is a no-brainer. I mean, have you heard their songs and BGM? (Fun fact: the voice actors also held concerts where in some of their songs, they play the instruments themselves). Toyosaki Aki, the voice of Hirasawa Yui was a friggin revelation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The weakest part of the series is actually the story since it was based on a 4 panel manga and there's only 13 episodes.",

            "content": "This was actually my first \"slice of life\" Anime that I have seen. At first, I was a bit skeptical. I was told that it was a show about \"cute girls doing cute things.\" I was told that it was episodic and had no romance so it sounded a bit weird to me, so I decided not to watch it.\r\nA few months later, someone linked me to a YouTube clip (http://youtu.be/DOta_f_9uoU) and I found it really funny (and sort of adorable).\r\nI've played guitar and sang in local rock bands the past 4 years of my life so I figured I should at least give thisshow a chance since I found that one clip funny and I recognized many of the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nI expected this to be a show centered mostly on music but I found that that was not the center of the  story! \\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite my assumptions of it being weird and something I wouldn't like, I ended up thoroughly enjoying this show and I think it is my second favorite show of all times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing too deep. It is all very light. It's a nice show to watch if you have been watching some really heavy and emotionally draining anime and you need a breath of fresh air. Don't worry about these girls getting tentacle raped or anything. It's all very overly happy and the conflicts in the show are not life-threatening. To put it simply: its story revolves around high school girls that become friends after joining a light music club together. Emphasis on the friendship over the actual club. Though they do make some references to classic rock bands here and there which is cool if you're a fan of them.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art style of this show. I typically watch shows with a lot of violence and tend to judge the artwork based off of the fight scenes but this show had none of that. The whole show looked really nice to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good too. These girls do write songs but don't expect the deepest of lyrics. The song lyrics are so bad in some of the songs that it's just funny. I think that was the intent. Keeping it \"simple and cute.\" If you can't stand lyrics like that, the songs may bother you a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThis show leads you to believe that men are going extinct or something. The only male characters I can think of that appeared in the show are the school principal and Ritsu's brother. It was very strange for me to see a show with no romance since I am a huge fan of those type of shows but for some reason it didn't bother me. The closest thing to romance in this show was the constant poking fun at the single teacher's failed love life.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't a big \"moe\" fan then I would not recommend this show. If you are looking for a very \"fan-service-y\" show with girls being constantly sexualized, I would not recommend this show (they only make a few sexual-ish jokes in the show). It's a very light and funny show. This first season is not too emotionally deep.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely re-watch this show again after watching other Anime that emotionally drain me.",

            "content": "For my First Ever Review, I found it suitable to pick an anime that I found amazing.\r\nMy first impression of K-On! was originally not impressed or interested. I figured it would be a anime completely about music. I myself am not that into music, only knowing a few songs I have heard around. \r\nWhen I finally figured that this would be interesting was when a friend recommended and I ended up watching it a few days after told so.\r\n\"What was so amazing about K-On! That I would give such a near perfect score, you may ask?\"\r\nStory:\r\nWell for starters,\r\nthough there is not much of a plotline, usually focusing on fun and lighthearted episodes, I found every episode satisfying. The genre \"slice of life\" is my favourite type of anime to watch; being that it provides a \"flutter of the heart\" and I become completely touched by the lightheartedness of the show. K-On! can be classified into slice of life being centering on the growth of the characters and their relationships with each other. I figure for story the best I can say is that they do, to a degree, improve in their music and their relationship as friends becomes as tight as a lid from a pickle jar(you know the saying when people cannot open pickle jars)  As far as the disadvantages of the story is the lack of story and places where I was asking questions such as,\"Will we see a Fulfillment of their dreams?\" \\n\r\nA question nagging at me from the start since one of the characters(many who have seen the show already may know as Ritsu) makes an outright goal for the Club.\\n\r\nThis dream(goal) does not seem possible atoll, and if you have read the manga as well, you may know for certain that it makes it even more impossible considering there is a lack of \"spirit\" for achieving it.\\n\r\nThough the Club does provide everyday notions in their fun activities. I was always enticed and envious of their daily activities, wishing that such a life was possible for myself (sighz right~)\\n\r\nOverall, the story of 4(+1 and others) friends is very appealing and could provide a shock for some viewers if they are thinking this may be an uninteresting show (indicate me*). With great energy and new and fun stories each time.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMoving to the art of the anime K-On!\\n\r\nThe art is very very beautifully done, considering I am an artist myself, I always find shows that provide great artwork no matter the story I will usually watch it. (yep a bit shallow lol)\\n\r\nNot much to say when you love the art, just that they do an excellent job of facial expressions and though some may consider there to be not as much animation as you would see in an Action, all \"slice of life\" animes probably do have a lower number of scenes to animate.\\n\r\nBut they do this superbly, though this may also depend overall on the quality of the video you are watching. ;)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSo on to the next,\\n\r\nWell for one by sound it's probably video sound quality and what not but I want to point out something about the Seiyuus(voice actors).\\n\r\nAs for one the Seiyuus do an outstanding job with their characters. Characters provide us with extremely creative and cute onomatepias(sound effects) and are get into their lines smoothly.\\n\r\nConsidering having to watch it in English Sub I found it very easy to follow the speed in which they talk. For video sound quality I am not an expert but yeah  I should just say it was good, to the point :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThough I have already briefly noted this topic, I guess I should expand.\\n\r\nFor one, all characters are instantly lovable and each has their own individualality.\\n\r\nAll traits come together perfectly and the characters are superb on relationships.\\n\r\nOne thing to note is the uniqueness and creativity one of the characters has. \\n\r\nThough singling out the other characters a bit, I consider this characters naming sense excellent, and though not my favorite character in the show she(referring to Yui) gives the best nickname ever(hint my username :P)\\n\r\nThough I cannot say much about problems with the characters, one would probably be the lack of a deeper character development. Consider, a character that improves mentally and physically. In K-On! characters improve on the surface and not really character improvement more like social, academical, ect. One character, Yui you could consider the only one to literally improve in the story, but I cannot expand on that. (Spoilers an all)\\n\r\nCharacters in K-On are defiantly new and unique. Usually and most consistently you come across repetitive characters in different animes but I consider this different and defiently worthwhile.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, obviously, it was outta this world. I enjoyed every episode wholeheartedly and could not wait for the next episode. I could not stop watching the anime and probably finished in less than 24 hrs, common for very good animes or any considering if you have free time lol.\\n\r\nI do realize that usually you would consider you enjoy most of the animes you watch, but sometimes there are those few that you just have to struggle through the last few episodes so that you proved you watched this shit, or some decency and respect towards the creators.\\n\r\nK-On for me definitely does not fall into that category, far beyond it. I consider it superb even if my original impression of it was bad well you can't judge a book by its cover as they say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThough this may seem like a little shallow on my behalf considering if I made other reviews such as on the show Air(some may know) I would say the story is better in Air but overall I am all for watching mainly animes with great art. I always pose reluctance to watch anime with art I do not consider good and that is shallow. :/\\n\r\nSo yes K-On! definitely deserves a perfect score for me but giving it a 9 would be more appropriate from my angle. In a position of doing my first review K-On met the standards or should I say exceeded and was fun to review. \\n\\n\r\nHope this went well for people out there as it did for me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nPart of what makes educational life so fun is not the classes or the after-school activities. Instead, it's the friends that one makes along the way. Friends give one an outlet to talk about similar interests, stories from life, or to just hang out. Sometimes, a group of friends becomes so tight-knit that people wonder how they ever managed without each other in the first place. As far as K-On! Season One is concerned, this is exactly the sort of mentality that is generated.\r\nSTORY\r\nK-On! begins rather simply. Yui is a new high school girl who, upon entering, decidesto enter a club to give herself a chance at something refreshing. Within the Light Music Club, she encounters Mio, Ritsu, and Mugi, her newfound club members and friends.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into K-On!, it is often tagged as, \"cute girls playing music, minus the music.\" And to a certain extent, these people are correct. The story is in no way about the music or its effect on the Light Music Club as a whole. It's prevalent, with each member taking up a different instrument, or the lot practicing for an upcoming session, but beyond that, the music isn't important. No, instead, what K-On! does right is using the music as the setting. It's best to think of the music as a helping hand, pushing the characters along. Need more bonding time? Let's \"practice\" at Mugi's seaside mansion. Need a club supervisor? Let's rummage through past groups' memories for some ideas. In this way, the music is there and serves its purpose of pushing the story along in an overall positive direction.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what is the story, or rather, what does it explore if it's just \"cute girls playing music, minus the music?\" There are two viewpoints, the more obvious and the more complex. Starting with the former, K-On! Season One is a look at what it means to find your place. Many people have a difficult time coming to terms with not only how they want to be perceived but also in what they want to do. One's hobbies, beliefs, or talents may be hard to express coherently or accepted by others. The struggle is never easy, but the resolution, finally understanding, finally knowing where you belong is a special thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter, more intricate theme the show explores is the importance of the group dynamic (credit to /u/CelestialRice, a reddit user, for this idea). Maybe that sounds too simple; \"the more the merrier\" is a common saying, so it should be fruitless to even talk about. However, K-On! does it better than any other show. It pretty much looks at it in three \"arcs\": the group coming together as one unit, the group acquiring and acclimating a new member, and the group not being a group.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part is rather mainstream, in that most shows besides K-On! employ this tactic. Meaning, it is nothing too original besides in its execution. Where it starts to deviate slightly is the second part. By introducing a new member into the already established group, the show provides us with two perspectives simultaneously, the new member looking in and the old members looking out. The natural feel to it all, due in part to the characterization, was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nLast, and by far one of the most original that I've seen, is the group not being a group. The wording here just means that, for a single episode, we see how they all act on an individual basis. The presentation of the idea, what goes on, and the ultimate message -- that while by oneself you can accomplish great things, \"your group is where your home is at\" -- was done expertly. This episode was quite easily the least funny the season had to offer, but at the same time was the most powerful, pushing the story from well done to quite excellent.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nK-On! Season One is quite the sneaky little show when it comes to animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style here is important because we are talking about KyoAni. It is with this show that the well-loved anime studio began to deviate from its huge, spaced eyes on its characters towards more \"relevant\" looking human beings. KyoAni has perfected their craft over the years, but it was fun to see them transitioning from one style to another in order to pretty much make it more appealing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the show appears great, with well done character movements, actions, and facial expressions (detailed, minimalist, cute, etc.). The show also keeps the quality up (within reason) when doing very far away shots.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, I said it was \"sneaky.\" And here's why: K-On! really does not like to show the girls playing. This ties back in with the tag it has, but the fact is animating a full group of characters playing instruments (and correctly) is a very difficult thing to do. Nana, a romance-drama anime \"also\" about music, utilized a similar trick, avoiding showing the cast playing as much as it could. As such, one feels almost cheated that such a course was taken.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is also famous for something it has rather than for something it has not: its main cast. We'll stick to the big four -- Mugi, Yui, Mio, and Ritsu -- and I'll tackle them in the order that I found them most enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nYui is by all means the main character of the show. Extremely care-free, klutzy beyond all-recognition, and oddly a super-genius, nothing ever gets her down. Eating cakes by day and dressing up \"Giita\" by night, she doesn't appear to do much within the group besides just being there. And that's the truth. She acts as the strongest link in the chain, not in ability, or riches, or looks, but in terms of keeping the group one cohesive unit. Without her, there is no \"After School Tea Party,\" much less the Light Music Club.\\n\\n\r\nSeemingly on the sidelines, Mugi is the group's guardian angel. Cakes, tea, vacation homes, discounts; it may look like she doesn't do much of anything besides play the keyboard, but in reality her (mostly financial) influence gives everyone a good step-up. Beyond this, she has quite the wild imagination and is always the one most looking forward to another fun time with her friends. However, her most important aspect is in her ability to balance work and play. She knows that there is a time and a place for everything, understanding that sometimes it's best to unwind rather than focus.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu is the tomboy. Wild is her soul and drums are her passion. Lifelong friends with Mio, she actually syncs with everyone in the group. In other words, she \"gets\" everybody. She knows how to get underneath Mio's skin, she follows Yui's silly jokes, and is able to connect with Mugi. Ritsu is quick to have as much fun as possible, and it's her energy that propels the group forward. Technically speaking, it was her idea to form the club and aim for the big stage of \"Budokan.\" And while not a cheerleader, her motivational support and skill at handling her emotions makes her the captain the band needs.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite of the four is Mio by miles. Beautiful, intelligent, and very shy, she is so cute that it should be considered a crime. Afraid of even the slightest movement or horror story, she is often left incapacitated, making her even more adorable, if that were even possible. A great body and cuteness aside, Mio is the army sergeant. She makes it her mission to keep the group on track as best as she can. But when she can't, she puts it upon herself to take up the reigns where the others have dropped them, in order to make sure everything goes smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nAs is evident, every member has their individual weaknesses, but as a group, their strengths cover for one another. While I don't love the characters other than Mio, watching them interact made it clear that, as friends, their bonds couldn't be tighter.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is easy to listen to. The \"no, no, no\" is freakin' adorable, the lyrics rhyme and skip in a fantastic manner, and the varying vocals in conjunction with the fast-paced beat are a great way to start every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is one of my favorites from anime. The seven-synonym lyrics coupled with the non-singing guitar portions create an awesome jam on top of the already punk/rock-n-roll fell it gives off. Adding in the visuals, where the cast are given alternate costumes, and Mio is taking the lead vocals? It's just too perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI want to compare the soundtrack to Monogatari, in that both are capable of playing the right pieces at the right moments to make the scenes that much more enticing to watch. From Sawa's heavy metal guitar to the \"bippidy-boppidy\" fun tune when things are becoming silly really just increases the overall experience. And for the icing on the cake, the songs played during the season are just as good.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting wise, I found each of the girls to give an above average performance. Special shout out to Aki Toyosaki for her work as Yui.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving the show a lot of praise, but let's look at something that I hated: Yui and Ui's (Yui's sister) relationship. Having a few siblings myself, I actually could not stand how lovey-dovey and overly-friendly the two were to one another. It's supposed to be cute, and I get that, but in context it just never felt real. Siblings at any age, young or old, are nice to one another, sure, but they act in a way towards each other that is just not possible with other people. In this way, seeing the two act the same towards one another as they do towards everyone else wasn't cute, but rather cringe-y.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt cute, all of them. Yui's dumbness, Mugi's innocence, Ritsu's antics, and Mio's blushing, everyone gets time in the spotlight, making the anime not a \"one girl show.\" Going off this, the characters are also quite funny. This is both when interacting with one another or by themselves. Somehow, whatever they say or do will most likely bring one more laugh or smile into the world.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, K-On! Season One, at least on the outside, appears to be about a bunch of cute girls playing instruments. But when you load up that first episode and start binge-watching the rest, one finds out that the inside is more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, finding your place and what it means to be a group\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, KyoAni starts their new style\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Yui, Mugi, and Ritsu are nice, but Mio is fantastic\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, great ED, good soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, drop Ui then the show will be golden\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

A really nice and enjoyable watch.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nYui is a carefree happy-go-lucky girl who has started high school and wants to do something. She signs up for the Light Music (japanese: Keion) Club without knowing how to play an instrument. The club is in a dire crisis and needs one member so they accept Yui. Now her daily plain life is filled with having tea, snacks, making music and hanging out with her new friends of the club. Of course, there are slight problems along the way, like passing exams, recruitingmembers for the club, teaching Yui to play an instrument and other regular stuff. There is not much of a storyline. It just shows the daily fun and music filled lives of the club members with a lot of moe along the way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\r\nThere are 4 main characters which start off the club. Friends, siblings, teachers are also part of the show and make it fun.\\n\r\n-Yui: Happy go lucky high school girl who joins the Light Music Club without knowledge of playing any instrument. \\n\r\n-Ritsu: The president of the club. Like Yui, she takes it easy. She's on the drums. My second favorite character in the series.\\n\r\n-Mio: The serious, beautiful, intelligent member of the club. She is the bassist of the band and tries to make everyone practice but when it comes to fun, she is ahead of everyone. A responsible, shy and scaredy cat girl.\\n\r\n-Tsumugi: The rich lady type of girl. Every anime needs to have one. She is incharge of the snacks and her family is quite rich which amamzes the other members when they go for vacation or to the music shop.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters that are mostly shown are Yui's sister, Ui. Her friend, Nadako and her teacher Sawa-chan sensei.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nKyoto Animation. Enough said. The art isn't as good as in the latest releases e.g. Amagi Brilliant Park, but it still succeeds in giving the anime it's light hearted and warm feel. I love the animation and character designs. Really nice work.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThis is the first anime that has made me listen to every single opening. It has got to be the best combination of audio and video. And the songs performed in the series are quite well. Really enjoyable soundtracks.\\n\r\nThe opening is Cagayake Girls. Love it. The ending is also really good but not as good as the opening.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nThis series is meant for those who want something light and warm with lots of cute stuff and nice songs. A relaxing anime to enjoy while having a snack. Not much of a storyline, just day to day comedy and music. A really fun watch for anyone looking to pass the time with a laugh and a dose of moe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I picked it up with the idea it would be a fun anime with some music. It gave me what I was looking for. A good change of pace from the serious anime I've been watching. I would recommend this to anyone who wants something light, cute to watch with some good laughs.",

The best thing about the anime is that it is quite funny and there are some shoujo-ai moments which I won't mention you will just have to watch.\r\nStory:9\r\nQuite boring at the start but when you finish the 3rd episode you really get the hang of it, but the thing is the story is basically about relationships that evolve such as the friendships to unbreakable bonds are quite sweet and there are darktimes when someone gets mad at someone but they always get together at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nI love chibis and I really like the art style. There really is nothing more to say though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nLol I would definitely give this one a ten out of ten not only that the light music club gives off good music its that I like the openings and endings.

The plot and art are superb I have to say but we can't always be perfect on these parts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 because it is really enjoyable but there are downsides also which again I wont mention because we all have different points of view. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice:\\n\r\nWatch this anime its a really great for those who have free time.",

            "content": "I personally love this series.   I'm going to go in order of story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, and the overall aspect of K-on on why I think it's a fun adorable series.\r\nStory:  It starts introducing Hirasawa Yui, however instead of introducing the characters, they first introduce their personality and how they are.  ie: Yui, thought she was late for class, then trip and fell.  She is a major part in the anime, as she becomes the center of the comedy in this anime.  The story develops greatly once you watch a few episodes.  \r\nArt:  I'm never onethat judges on art alone, as long the story , characters and its plot is in sync.  With that said, I personally like the art.  Such as how they portray, when Yui is sad or scared...you'll get what I mean when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  This is a music related anime.  The music is amazing and it's concept with muisc + the lives of these girls show how they live separate lives but come together with music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All Girl School, Sakurakou Highschool has a few other characters that become more introduced in the 2nd episode.  There's Mio, Ritsu, and Mugi.  Mio, the mature yet easily embarrassed, scaredy cat.  The obnoxious yet never afraid to say what's on her mind, Ritsu.  The rich and elegant yet sheltered young lady, Mugi. Yui for a while is the main pin point for comedy because of her relax, yet air headed personality.  However, deep down she's somewhat of a genius.Finally you'll meet Azusa, who is a year younger than the rest of the members, but tries to maintain a mature personality, even though she's pure inside.  There's also the teacher that oversees the club, she has a teacher like appearance, but inside she's just one of them.  Loves to drink tea, slack off, and do nothing :P.  She is very cautious what people say about her, as she wants to be perfect.  However, she also has a fetish for cosplay, which ends up scaring Mio.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I have to say I was surprise at first.  I just kind of watched it on a whim.  However, now I'm a big K-On fan.  Mostly because each character holds a special part in the series.  For instance, Yui has her air-headed yet serious times when she carelessly forgets stuff or stays up all night to study.  Ritsu has her obnoxious attitude which always ends up being ended by Mio.  Mio, although the most mature out of all of them, still has a childish personality.  Mugi, even though rich, she still doesn't know much about the world.   I love the combination.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I give it a 10 because, I love everything about this anime.  There's not much drama, and even when there is.  The characters make up for it, and shrug it off as its nothing.  Whenever you're watching, you'll see yourself saying \"Already over?!\"  The characters make the story fun and interesting.  The story helps, but overall its the characters.",

            "content": "So, this kind of typical anime which I like more instead of other anime that I've ever watched. Every time, I always look for anime with a typical story like this, doesn't really need the main plot, just a bunch of cute girls doing some cute things. This is the first slice of life anime I've ever watched and was an anime that made me love the genre. I mean, not everyone wants to watch anime with stories like this, no male characters at all, and need a process to get someone to get into this anime. K-On! is an anime that discusses a groupof girls who love music with their daily activities at their music clubs.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to find something that has a confidence from beginning to the end, you're wrong. I don't really understand why people who didn't understand aba out slice of life thing that has no plot or plotless. Just like Lucky\u2606Star, everyone assumes the same as these two anime. The story is nothing special, just a bunch of girls who are enjoying their school days by being in the \"light music club\" and doing all sorts of ordinary things. It's a typical slice of life which mixed with comedy as well as something related to moe or kinda like that. This is a big step considering that many people didn't like the manga, KyoAni adapted the manga and made the anime version better. It's about music if you just want to read the manga which I think manga with music genre is so weird because you can't hear \"the music.\" For me, this is the show that always makes me laugh every second, every minute of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is cute and has its own characteristic of KyoAni. This studio always presents a heroine character that contains their actuating. The moe's part it's memorable from every depiction of the character and the background. Supported with all aspects from all of the famous seiyuu as well, I think the art is more like to be some sweetheart that you want to hug all of them and forget anything about life.\\n\\n\r\nAll soundtracks are so catchy to hear. I think almost all the songs that I downloaded over the internet, especially with the opening and ending song. Sakurakou Keion-bu, whose members are Aki Toyosaki, Yoko Hisaka, Satomi Satou, and Minako Kotobuki all participate in their cute voice. However, I like the opening but not so memorable than the ending. I don't have anything about Aki Toyosaki and Yui Hirasawa for being detached which I also like her personality and her character. For the ending song, this is the best which I love Yoko Hikasa who's more seen as the lead singer than Aki. Both have their own uniqueness of their voices and there must be one that some make us annoying. It's enjoyable because it's more instruments to light rock and make it all different from the others. Ayana Taketatsu, Minako Kotobuki, and Satomi Sato are also great at filling their characters.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the 5 main characters and heroines, the characters have different characteristics and have their own uniqueness. For the whole story, we will focus more on Yui Hirasawa, a lazy and always carefree. Her behavior is always doing weird things that make herself have her own cute side. Mio Akiyama, the opposite character of Yui, who is shy and easily scared but she is just like any other character that makes her have an attractive side. Ritsu Tainaka, energetic and always prank her childhood friend, Mio. Tsugumi Kotobuki, her seemingly ordinary but innocent in every way because of her luxurious life but her character doesn't really reflect a rich people in general. Although like that, she also has the other side of uniqueness. Azusa Nakano, her serious nature but easily distracted by everything including from Yui who always approached her.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to get into this anime because this is suggested by one of my friends who has been watching anime like this for a long time. However, the comedy itself never made me dropped so I always feel it at every episode. It's pretty good for some people because people are definitely still hard to accept anime like this considering all the characters in here are just women without any men. At last, men only become a cameo for every tiny role. There is a separate process and a willingness to be able to watch anime cute girls doing cute things besides K-On! but this is the right step if you want to know anything about typical anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is an anime with their cute characters and does cute stuff. This anime doesn't really need the core of the story, there is no seriousness to be able to enjoy it because you can turn off your brain and stop enjoying some anime with a complex story that you always into it. With waifuable characters, I think I'm also not surprised at the community and the internet love this. It's a lot of fun since you just wanna enjoy some plotless thing like this but it's worth it.",

            "content": "K-ON! being a slice of life anime AND a music anime, it has a lot of factors up against it that should make it fall flat on its face and yet this anime manages to be very different from what I expected.\r\nK-ON! follows the story of Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Mugi and their struggles as musicians... that are incredibly lazy.\r\nThe anime's story is very relaxed and doesn't involve anything that would cause you or your brain to completely fry, but it also tries to be interesting enough that you are not falling asleep at the wheel. Overall I found it quite basic for a sliceof life, it isn't trying hard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, this is a Kyoto Animation product and it shows. The level of detail in colours and overall movement is what we have come to expect from them and I have very little to say about it that is negative. The instrument playing is well timed and does not come off as wonky to watch. That being such a massive point of K-ON! it is good to see it isn't botched.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The most IMPORTANT part of a music anime and what this anime ABSOLUTELY needed to get right.. so does it? Well that's up to your preference. If you like J-Pop/J-Rock, you'll likely enjoy this portion of the anime. The voice actors of the characters also do all the playing and singing in the songs which is not only good attention to detail but also helps keep the anime from sounding jarring. As for ambient music I have no complaints here, it's about as cutesy as you could expect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. I love the characters in K-ON!, they have a certain uniqueness to them that can't really be matched by other anime, and there is a reason that these girls have stuck around so long in people's heads.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Music lovers need to see this anime, because it has so many \"Oh man, I can totally relate to that problem\" moments that it almost seems like this anime was aimed squarely at people who enjoy or especially play music.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime mostly on that merit, if you are a musician, you cannot pass this anime up.",

            "content": "For starters, I'll make it short : \"K-On!\" is not an ambitious anime, BUT it reaches its goal, which is to entertain the spectator. This makes it far better than all those anime which try to be smart or serious when they're not.\r\nThere is not much of a story, it's just about the everyday life of high-school girls. There is few development as well. BUT chara-development does exist, which makes the main characters enjoyable : they aren't just stereotypes with no story, they are consistent enough to be pleasant.\r\nBut \"K-ON!\" is definitely not for people who are looking for deep stories and chara-development. They arefor those who just want to be distracted for a while.\\n\r\nThis show succeeds in entertaining the viewer thanks to wonderful graphics and sounds, funny characters, awesome staging and hilarious situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, here is the long version :\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n\"K-On!\" is about the life of high-school girls forming a music club, and... that's all. The episodes just show those girls living their high-school years, studying for their exams, taking vacation breaks, and hanging around while sometimes working for their club activities.\\n\r\nI'll be blunt : if you're looking for a deep, complex, developed story, you definitely won't enjoy this anime. But if you can understand that story is not everything in an anime, you will see all the good points that make this show really enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe one major flaw I see in this anime's story is the rythm. \"K-On!\" is composed of a 14 episodes season, and a 27 episodes season (along with a movie, which takes place before the last episodes), covering three years of those girls lives.\\n\r\nBUT the first 2 years are actually covered by the 1st season, and the last year is covered by the 2nd one.\\n\r\nAs a result, the first two years are way too short! This is really stupid! It just feels like nothing happens in those two years, which makes me feel that the first season is way too short for what it's telling.\\n\\n\r\nART :\\n\r\nFor a 2010-ish anime, \"K-On!\" is absolutely gorgeous. The chara-design is fairly simple, but the backgrounds are great (although classic : most of the anime is staged in an average japanese high-school), the light effects are beautiful and the animation is quite flawless... except in the first season, where it is sometimes disgusting. But the second season and the movie have an awesome animation, at least for an 8-year old anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : \\n\r\nVisually it is well done, but the sound is also great. The OST is simple but very well used (it plays a major role in comedic scenes). The songs (whether that be the openings, the endings, or the insert songs) are absolutely awesome : \"K-On!\" offers a lot of purely orchestral, rock'n'roll songs.\\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that the quality of the insert songs is generally lowered in the episodes. This is actually a great idea : remember, the characters are average high-schoolers, not music genius!\\n\r\nBecause of that, and because they are supposed to play in live during their concerts, the girls don't play their songs perfectly. Of course, in the real OST, the songs are much better than what can be heard during the episodes!\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY :\\n\r\nHumor in \"K-On!\" is terrific. Of course it is subjective, but we can't say they didn't pull a lot of comedic strings :\\n\r\n- Yui's clumsy behaviour : it's not only cute, it's also fun because whatever happens, you just know that Yui will fail at something xD.\\n\r\n- Overdramatic scenes : many scenes are played as dramatic stuff when it really is nothing serious.\\n\r\nThat offset is often used in popular comedic stuff (I'll just cite One Punch Man, where many scenes are taken seriously by the characters whereas it's just plain stupid situations... and that's why this show is so funny!).\\n\r\n- Characters interactions : there is so much to say on that : the fact that Ui (Yui's little sister) is actually mature (when it should be her big sister who takes this role), the fact that Ritsu keeps teasing Mio, the fact that Mugi is impressed by anything normal (as a rich girl, she didn't live a normal life, thus she loves having the opportunity to do \"normal stuff\" like going to a cheap store or eating at a fast-food), the fact that Azusa, which takes music seriously, winds up in a lazy club like this, and so on.\\n\r\n- Ordinarity : yes, seing something ordinary can be funny. It can be funny to see a character struggle with problems that we had before. It can be funny to see a character in a situation that we have been in before.\\n\r\nIt is just appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS :\\n\r\nOverall, there is few development on the characters, as there is no story to make them evolve. That doesn't mean there is nothing though : Yui learns to get over her clumsiness (although just a bit), Mio learns to get over her shyness, Mugi learns to \"live normally\", Azusa learns to be less strict, and the best of all, Sawako learns that her past is not that shameful...\\n\r\nNo, we definitely can't say that there is no development at all. But that's simply not the point of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI think I talked about everything. Sure, \"K-On!\" is simple and clich\u00e9, and there is almost no story in it. But it compensates for it with almost everything else : enjoyable characters, great visuals and songs, and hilarious situations. This is more than enough to make it memorable and fairly enjoyable.",

            "content": "K-On is my favorite anime series of all time, and there\u2019s no quick answer as to why. I like to tell people it\u2019s because the show is \u201cdense,\u201d which is another way of saying that I\u2019ll be talking for two hours before I can get to the heart of the matter; but considering I\u2019ve dedicated that much time to breaking down my least favorite anime ever, it\u2019s probably good for my health that I do the same for my most favorite as well.\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to simply explain the appeal of K-On, because so much of that appeal has to do with the personal relationship whichthe viewer forms with the show along its run. K-On is a show that progressively gets better the more of it you watch, not only in the sense that season two is a lot better than season one, but in that season one is more enjoyable if you\u2019ve already seen the show in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nThe most popular misconception about K-On is that it lacks a narrative, and that could not be further from the truth. On a moment to moment basis, K-On is mostly a comedy show about five girls and their friends having fun and cracking jokes, but there\u2019s a very clear narrative arc across the entire series and tons of growth on the part of every character\u2013which is all stuff that you can only appreciate by watching the series all the way through. While it may seem like one at first, K-On is NOT an episodic series\u2013it is a sequence of events with a logical progression which reaches an eventual conclusion, and as such should be considered a cohesive work in the same way that one might consider a film or book. Following this logic, I think the best way to explain what makes the series great is to start from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about the first episode of K-On is that you cannot possibly understand the full appeal of K-On by watching the first episode. You do, however, get a taste of the basics: it\u2019s a cute little show full of cute little marshmallowy girls, with a light color pallet, light music (which is the name of the show), and a relaxed sense of pacing. Even the voice acting (by a cast whom, at the time, was comprised of totally new actresses), is pretty on point right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOften overlooked about this episode and the series on the whole, is the incredible attention to detail. Yui\u2019s room looks like a real room that Yui really lives in. It tells a story all on its own about what kind of person she is and what kind of life she has. Most of the locations in K-On were directly based on real places, such as the school\u2013the real world equivalent of which has become a tourist location thanks to the show. Because of all these details, the world feels real, alive, and storied.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to buy into the keyfabe of K-On. When I\u2019m watching it, I don\u2019t think of it as a story which someone wrote, or a cartoon which a team of people made\u2013it feels like it\u2019s actually unfolding before my eyes. That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but my point is that seeing characters who wear outfits that I could see real girls wearing, or seeing a room that looks like the character was the one who made it look that way, creates a deep sense of immersion, which is what allows me to buy into the idea that these characters really exist inside of this world.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, returning to what I said before, while there\u2019s a lot to like about K-On right from the beginning, it is nonetheless impossible to understand the full appeal of the series at this point\u2013and that is completely intentional. As viewers, our experience of this episode is equivalent to what Yui experiences in signing up for the light music club. We\u2019re not really sure if we want to get involved with something like this, or if it fits our self-image. We don\u2019t know any of these characters or have much of a reason to care, so we\u2019re just kind of shy around them. Remember, by the end of the first episode, Yui still has no idea what the light music club is really like, and is kind of ready to bail on the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nEven if we do enjoy this episode right off the bat, it\u2019s important that we share Yui\u2019s lack of understanding of how this situation is going to play out or who these characters are, because the narrative of season one is dependent on Yui learning about these people and finding a place within this group. That\u2019s not to say that Yui is necessarily an audience stand-in, or even necessarily the main character, as I think it\u2019s equally important that we discover her true nature as the season goes along; but the experience of getting to know these characters and how they interact with one-another is itself the narrative of K-On. That\u2019s why I said before that the appeal is dependent on the relationship which the viewer develops with the show; it\u2019s only through experiencing first-hand how all of these character form their relationships with one-another that we can completely understand those relationships\u2013and it\u2019s because of that experience that the later episodes feel so emotional and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t learn very much about any of the main characters in episode one, and next to nothing about how they interact with one-another. At most, we can tell that Mio and Ritsu are long-time friends, and that Ritsu is more headstrong and energetic but also a bit of a troublemaker, whom Mio has to reign in, even as she gets dragged along in Ritsu\u2019s plans. We vaguely understand that Tsumugi comes from a very different background and perspective, through her mannerisms, the fact that she\u2019s never eaten fast food before, and her suggestion that they bribe a student by buying them a car or a summer home. Yui, meanwhile, is clumsy, dense, and empty of thought. She\u2019s never had anything to do with herself, so she spends her off-time laying around; but now that she\u2019s in high school, she feels guilty and wants to do something.\\n\\n\r\nEach of these characters has a unique reason for joining the light music club. Ritsu wants to form a rock band because she was inspired by a concert she saw on TV; Mio gets dragged along because of Ritsu\u2019s persistence, and the fact that she promised she\u2019d form a band years ago; Mugi joins because she admires Ritsu and Mio\u2019s relationship; and Yui joins because she expects the club activity to be easy. What\u2019s important to realize about all of this, is that none of these motivations are what keep this club going in the long run. Not only will each of these characters change in personality as the series goes along, but form a much stronger attachment to their places in this club, to the point that their original intentions have nothing to do with why any of them are there anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThis whole sense of not knowing who these people are, how they interact, or what the light music club really is, all comes through in their first performance. None of their parts synch up very well, with Ritsu rushing on drums, and Mugi and Mio being slightly out-of-time with one-another. It\u2019s clear that they each have some talent at their instruments, but they don\u2019t sound like they\u2019ve learned how one-another plays or developed any chemistry; plus, obviously, they don\u2019t even have all of their members yet. This song represents the current state of the both the club and the show itself\u2013a state in which each disparate element shows potential, but nothing is yet cohesive or noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode two is where the true appeal of K-On begins to bleed through, and the series starts to make its intentions clear. It opens with Yui sharing her observations of each of the other club members so far. We learn that Mio is extremely shy and sensitive, Ritsu is kind of shallow, and Tsumugi is wealthy to the point of abnormality. In this opening scene, Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi kind of walk on eggshells around Yui because they want to keep her placated. They offer her sweets any time they come close to offending her, and are desperate to appease her whims to keep her going. In the following scenes, we also learn more of just how airheaded Yui is, and how she relies on others such as her sister to get by.\\n\\n\r\nAs we jump into the episode\u2019s midsection, the dynamic of these characters slowly begins to shift. It starts when the girls are on their way to the music store, but Yui gets distracted and they end up messing around in various stores along the way. This is the first time the girls get to hang out with no pretenses regarding club activity, and we get our first hints of how each of them would react and interact when put into various situations.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s during the scene in which the girls work as traffic surveyors, that the show really starts putting effort into both distinguishing and unifying them as characters. When Yui and Mugi are paired up, we see how Mugi is capable of hyper-concentration, while Yui is easily bored. Ritsu gets lost in the rhythm of her car counter, and Mio starts thinking about the time signatures of the beat Ritsu is playing before she tells Ritsu to do her job correctly. When Mugi and Mio are together, both of them are working hard, while Ritsu and Yui are slacking off. At the end, all of them are afflicted with some level of occupational illness.\\n\\n\r\nSomething K-On does better than any other show I\u2019ve ever seen, is making all of the characters feel at once distinct from one-another, yet never making me question the idea that all of them are friends. Each two-by-two pairing of the characters works on its own, and they also work as one group. They experience things similarly enough that they all feel the same way, even though they interact with things in such different capacities. By the end of this episode, we start to develop a sense of what a Ritsu and Yui scene or a Mugi and Yui scene might feel like, and how they compare with one-another.\\n\\n\r\nWe also first begin to sense the passions of these characters. Mugi we learn has been playing piano since she was four years old, and is sort of naturally talented at it. As the show goes on, we\u2019ll see how Mugi is perhaps the character who most uses music as a means to the ends of hanging out with the other girls, as opposed to a real passion. On the other hand, we see how Mio spent a long period of deliberation deciding which bass guitar she wanted, and how Ritsu fought to be able to afford her used drum kit. We get the sense that these two really care about music, whereas Yui doesn\u2019t even seem to understand how a guitar and the concept of music are correlated. Her first reaction to buying one of the nicest and most famous guitars in existence, is to pose in the mirror, practice signing autographs, and take it to bed with her.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other take-aways from this episode as well, like how between Ritsu\u2019s bargaining scene and the fact that she not only knows how to job hunt, but at one point is filling out contest forms to try and win a guitar, gives us the sense that she probably comes from a low-income household; putting her in the opposite position of Tsumugi, whose father turns out to own the music store.\\n\\n\r\nMost important to this episode however, is the way the dynamic changes between Yui and the rest of the group towards the end. As Yui realizes how much work everyone is putting in on her behalf, she recognizes how selfish she\u2019s been and decides to buy a cheaper guitar so that she can start practicing as soon as possible. Ultimately, Yui doesn\u2019t have to make that sacrifice since Mugi gets her a discount on the guitar she wants, but the lesson sticks. The last scene utilizes a clever reincorporation, in which Ritsu offends Yui, and then Mugi offers her a snack to placate her; but Yui then expresses her newfound drive to be a real member of the club, thus unifying them at last.\\n\\n\r\nHaving heard that, you might be thinking, \u201cwow, K-On had meaningful character development and clever writing tricks such as unforeseen reincorporation as early as episode two. So why do so many people say there\u2019s no plot in K-On?\u201d Well, that\u2019s the funny thing about it\u2013K-On is really subtle about its progression. Yui doesn\u2019t directly explain that she\u2019s been selfish, nor does anyone point out at the end the change in Yui\u2019s reaction to being offered sweets. It\u2019s something you have to pick up on yourself, and most of the people who wrote off K-On as being a show about nothing wouldn\u2019t notice those kinds of subtleties.\\n\\n\r\nK-On is a show that a lot of people judged by its cover at the time that it came out. Most expected it to be Lucky Star 2.0, because it was once again based on a 4-panel comic about high school girls, and once again was being animated by Kyoto Animation. This was also at a time when shows about groups of high school girls sitting around doing nothing were becoming more and more frequent, and a lot of anime fans didn\u2019t like that. K-On was lumped in with every other show that had similar elements, and the things which set it apart weren\u2019t readily apparent from the beginning. The kinds of people who were ready to write off K-On as a moeblob show weren\u2019t going to notice the subtleties\u2013and in fairness, I didn\u2019t notice them at the time either. I\u2019d wager that even a lot of fans of K-On just liked it on the basis of it being a cute show, without noticing the subtleties themselves. Remember, K-On is a show that gets better the more of it you watch, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to anyone who expected it to get as good as it does in season two from as early a point as episode two.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode three is where the humor and characterization of the series finally begins to calcify. Yui is shown to be a lot more confident and friendly in her interactions, making lots of physical contact and cracking jokes, sometimes even at Ritsu\u2019s expense. Ritsu meanwhile seems out to prove herself as an A+ comedic character scene after scene.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, this episode seems like a one-off story, and might leave the impression that K-On really is an episodic series; but once again, it\u2019s a case in which you can appreciate the relevance of the episode more when you know where the series is going.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of this episode is to establish Yui as a sort of idiot savant. We see that she can learn guitar chords with impressive speed, but at the cost of losing out on her studies. With an upcoming midterm exam, her friends help her to focus on said studies, and in the end she earns a perfect score on the exam, only to forget all of the guitar chords.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this episode came out, some people considered it unrealistic that Yui scored 100% on the test\u2013but that was kind of the point. Yui is not a normal person. She has in incredible capacity for memorization, but is only capable of applying it to one subject at a time. This episode further develops Yui\u2019s younger sister Ui and her best friend Nodoka-chan, and we get the sense that Yui\u2019s been getting by in life through a combination of being surrounded by far more responsible people, and having this incredible talent for memorization. After all, there had to be a reason she was able to make it into the same high school as the other girls, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Yui has pulled scores like this out of her ass before with Nodoka\u2019s help.\\n\\n\r\nYui\u2019s talent for memorization isn\u2019t just a one-off joke, but an important part of her character going forward. By the time she learns to play notes on her guitar, we\u2019ll discover that Yui has perfect pitch, which in combination with her memorization skills makes her able to play pretty much anything she hears, which is going to be important later. Are Yui\u2019s incredible powers of memorization and perfect pitch normal attributes for people to have? Of course not. But they are real things that real people can do in rare cases, and Yui is portrayed perfectly as one such case. These aspects of her character aren\u2019t just being played up for a quick laugh, but are definitive parts of her nature, which we\u2019ll get to know as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nIn the interest of keeping this post from getting too repetitive, from here on out I\u2019m going to focus just on the broad strokes of what each episode brings to the table. You can pretty much take it for granted that every episode from here on out is going to deepen the relationships between the main characters, flesh out their chemistry and comedy as a group, and subtly teach us new things about their personalities. By now, I should have given you the tools to watch this series with a more open mind and detect what kind of subtleties it employs just by watching it and paying attention. Mostly what I want to do from here on out is to chronicle how the story progresses from episode to episode; not only in the interest of proving the narrative significance of each episode, but to eventually show how the ending is the most logical place at which the story could arrive, given all that came before.\\n\\n\r\nThe thematic purpose of episode four is to express Mio\u2019s frustration at the realization that the light music club isn\u2019t capable of performing at the level of the club that came before\u2013but then ultimately to come to the realization that spending time with the other girls is an enriching experience in itself. Once again, this is not expressed verbally, but instead through imagery and tone. All throughout the episode, Mio is trying to force the other girls to work with her, but is continually dragged into their insistent dicking around. Only after she sees Yui backlit by fireworks does she realize just how much she values the time spent with these friends, and ultimately decides to play for them the song which had inspired this trip in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is massively important, because it sets the tone for what this series is really about. K-On is the story of how each of these girls finds their place in the light music club, more so than it is about the actual performance of light music; and it\u2019s crucial that the one character who takes herself seriously and would stop to question what she\u2019s doing with her life is the first to completely understand this.\\n\\n\r\nK-On is incredibly slow-paced, but that\u2019s because the series is meant to reflect the pacing of actual human life. Anyone who\u2019s been in a band when they were in high school, knows that progress moves incredibly slowly, and for most people it ends up being more of a pretense to hang out with friends than anything else. I would know\u2013I spent the last two years of high school, and a year or two in college trying to establish a band with some of my musically talented friends, and nothing ever gelled out of it. We\u2019d set out with the intentions of practicing or songwriting, and end up watching movies or just singing along to other music.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not so much that K-On doesn\u2019t take its musical element seriously, as it is that the story K-On wants to tell is of how these band members come together on a human level, more so than on the level of what they may or may not accomplish musically. It\u2019s the story of Houkago Tea Time the people, not Houkago Tea Time the band\u2013a hyper-detailed \u201cbehind the music\u201d documentary as opposed to the story of how their album came together. Anyways, I\u2019ll get into all of this more later, but for now let\u2019s move on to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode five mostly serves to push the plot forward as we approach the club\u2019s first performance at the cultural festival. They find an advisor in Sawako-sensei, the image-obsessed and legitimately skilled guitarist of the light music club eight years prior. Most of Sawako\u2019s development doesn\u2019t come until season two, but for now she serves as the first person to take a critical eye to the group\u2019s performance as a band, as well as to start properly whipping them into shape. She takes Yui away for personal training and improves her skills massively, which brings our group up to a speed that may yet be ready for real performance.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode six, we get our first glimpse of where K-On is really going, and for the first time, all of the tiny moving parts cohere into something whole. Whereas the series up to this point has been characterized by punctuations of high-quality animation in-between bouts of decent to mediocre character art, this episode is more consistently on-point, with more on-model and high-detail shots, as well as much more background detail thanks to the cultural festival. I\u2019d also say that by this point, the show\u2019s masterful comedic timing is pretty much down pat, though really I could\u2019ve said the same about the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis also gives me the opportunity to comment on the voice acting, which is one of the most crucial elements of what puts this show on top of my favorites list, but also the hardest to talk about. Not only is it difficult to describe what makes a good voice performance, especially when a lot of it has to do with what sounds pleasant to the individual, but my Japanese comprehension is lackluster at best, so I feel awkward about commenting on Japanese performances. Nonetheless, I do believe that the voice work in K-On is top notch, and in particular, Toyosaki Aki\u2019s performance of Hirasawa Yui and Sato Satomi\u2019s performance of Tainaka Ritsu are my favorites in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes these performances stand out to me is the level of versatility which each actress bring to their role. In real life, people\u2019s voices tend not to sound exactly the same all of the time, especially people who like to crack jokes. People throw their voice, or morph it when they\u2019re around different people, or when saying certain things and conveying certain tones, and Sato and Toyosaki both nail that versatility in their acting perfectly. Consider that both of these actresses are not just performing a variety of voices, but doing so while maintaining their characters. When Ritsu does the sumo voice, it\u2019s not just Sato doing a sumo voice, but Sato doing Ritsu\u2019s voice doing a sumo voice. I chose this episode in particular to talk about the voice acting because throughout the entire episode, Yui\u2019s voice has been wrecked from her training with Sawa-chan-sensei, and Toyosaki nails it the whole way through, even when she\u2019s doing backup vocals during the live show.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the club\u2019s performance, we get a sense that these characters have already come a long way\u2013especially Mio, who is capable of singing on stage with these friends at her back, and Yui, who\u2019s progressed as a guitarist enough to perform at all. In lieu of actually watching the concert, we\u2019re given a cool little music video which uses hyper-saturated images and iconography to convey a certain 90s MTV look. This scene was most likely handled this way so that the last concert at the end of the season would have more impact, but luckily it gives me the opportunity to talk about the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nK-On\u2019s ending theme is absolutely legendary, and for good reason. I mean, look at it! It\u2019s a legit music video\u2013a high-quality one at that, with music that kicks enough ass to justify it. This wasn\u2019t necessarily the first ending theme in anime to go for a music video look, but it was far and away the best, and the costume designs alone were enough to make it hugely popular. My favorite part is the listless sighs of the characters, as they seem to deliberately avoid eye contact with the camera and look off into space. It\u2019s stylish, fashionable in the high fashion sense, and pumped up with enough pop appeal to make it a real classic in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the performance, Mio trips over an amp chord and accidentally exposes her panties to the audience. In any other show, this would probably have been played up for fanservice, but K-On deliberately subverts that expectation by turning it into a joke, and that leads us perfectly into a discussion of the fanservice in K-On\u2013or rather, the lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nWhen K-On was first released, a lot of the conversation surrounding the show painted it as a moeblob show aimed squarely at an otaku, most likely young-adult male audience\u2013and that assessment was totally fair at the time. The original manga was written by a man and published in a magazine aimed at young-adult males. Kyoto Animation had at this point most famously been responsible for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which had tons of fanservice, and Lucky Star which, while light on fanservice, was very clearly geared towards otaku audiences. They\u2019d also produced anime adaptations of Air and Kanon which, while not overtly fanservicey in the anime versions, were originally visual novels with sexual content in them. Given all of this evidence, there was no reason to think that K-On wouldn\u2019t be aimed at a young-adult male otaku audience, so it wasn\u2019t surprising when a lot of early writing about the series went out of its way to try and describe it as a moeblob fanservice show. However, I firmly believe that this is a case in which hindsight and context change everything.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, the minute you divorce yourself from the mode of thinking that K-On is aimed at otaku audiences, it becomes clear that K-On doesn\u2019t have any fanservice at all. It\u2019s a super-adorable show for sure, but there\u2019s nothing about it that seems geared towards men specifically, or any kind of sexualization whatsoever. You could say that it\u2019s trying to be moe with all of its cute moments, but I\u2019d wager that pretty much anyone who likes cute things would have an easy time getting into K-On. You could show this series to literally anyone, and I doubt they\u2019d find any of the content to be objectionable; except for maaaaybe Sawa-chan-sensei\u2019s actions, which are more or less supposed to be objectionable.\\n\\n\r\nThe proof of this is right there in the pudding: whether or not K-On was deliberately aimed at young-adult men, the series was a huge success outside of that demographic. I\u2019ve heard a friend who worked as middle-school teacher in Japan talk about how his female students recognized the characters from keychains that he carried around; and I\u2019ve seen dozens, if not hundreds of female K-On cosplayers at Otakon and in youtube videos over the years; and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that the girls in K-On are portrayed realistically.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking, \u201cbullshit, those do not look like real girls, their faces are weird and they\u2019re made of marshmallows, what are you talking about,\u201d but hear me out. For starters, the girls in K-On are a little bit thicker than what you might expect from anime characters, and they aren\u2019t all the same thickness either. Tsumugi and Nodoka are clearly portrayed as thicker than the other girls, whereas Mio is on all accounts described by characters within the show as abnormally beautiful. If you\u2019re like me, and you hate it when everyone in a show describes one character as beautiful even though all of the characters are clearly attractive, then you\u2019ll appreciate the fact that in this show, Mio is legitimately the only one who\u2019s classically pretty.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, let\u2019s look at the outfits. First off, in most shots, the skirts on the school uniforms actually appear to go past the characters\u2019 fingers, which is regulation length in Japanese schools and incredibly rare in anime. The outfits that the characters wear on stage or in the ending theme are very cute\u2013and I mean that in the way that a girl would describe an outfit she\u2019s about to buy as, \u201cvery cute;\u201d not in the way that an otaku is describing something he wants on a dakimakura cover. The outfits are legit cute in this show, from the street clothes to the pajamas; and what\u2019s more, the characters themselves find one-another and their outfits to be cute.\\n\\n\r\nYes, there are scenes at the beach in which the characters all wear two-piece swimsuits, and guess what? When real girls go to the beach, they also wear two-piece swimsuits\u2013preferably cute ones, like the ones these characters wear. What I\u2019m saying is that at no point do the characters wear any outfits which you wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine a real high school girl wearing, or which appear to exist for the gratification of a male audience.\\n\\n\r\nThere are moments in K-On which could be taken as fanservice, such as this one shot in which Mio\u2019s breasts are shown as well-defined, but the reason for this shot is that Yui and Ritsu are noticing Mio\u2019s impressive bust size, which is not an abnormal thing for a close friend to comment on. It is because of this scene that I\u2019d now like to go into full hipster journalist mode and make up a bunch of phrases in order to define the different kinds of fanservice as I see them.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice moments can be broken down into two large categories: diegetic and non-diegetic. Non-diegetic refers to fanservice that has nothing to do with the events that are actually going on in the story, and is solely experienced by the audience. For instance, when the camera randomly pans across Shinon\u2019s ass in Sword Art Online 2, those shots don\u2019t affect the narrative in any way\u2013they are simply the lens through which the narrative is being presented to the viewer. This is arguably the trashiest kind of fanservice, because it means that a scene which didn\u2019t necessarily need to contain any fanservice was given some solely in the name of appealing to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nDiegetic fanservice can then be broken down into two subcategories\u2013immersive and non-immersive. Immersive fanservice is when a situation contains fanservice simply by way of the nature of the scene. For instance, the scene of Yui and Ritsu pointing out Mio\u2019s boobs is completely in-line with their characterization and feels natural in the context of the scene, but could still be taken as fanservice simply by virtue of the fact that a lot of people are going to enjoy seeing Mio\u2019s boobs. Non-immersive fanservice then is when a show completely breaks away from what would seem to be natural in the context of the scene in order to deliver fanservice. This brand of fanservice is particularly obnoxious, because it cheapens the overall impact of the story when you can tell that a scene exists for no purpose other than for the author to gratify the audience. I would argue that the closest things K-On has to this are when Sawa-chan forces the girls into cute outfits, though again I don\u2019t think that any of the outfits she makes them wear are explicitly oriented towards male gratification.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what I\u2019m about to say could be taken the wrong way, so allow me to clarify up-front. I am well aware that a significant number of the raunchiest, most sexually-charged anime and manga around were created by women, and that some of the same staff who worked on K-On were also involved in shows like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Kyoto Animation is known to have an abnormally high female-to-male ratio of staff members, nor that the Director, Writer, Animation Directors, Character Designer, and a lot of the leading Key Animators who worked on K-On, were all women.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no coincidence either that from this series onwards, Kyoto Animation shows had a tendency towards minimal fanservice, with the exception of the manservice extravaganza Free. Even the currently-running Amagi Brilliant Park, which has a lot of fanservice moments written directly into the narrative, seems to be almost ashamed of itself, with shots that last only a split-second, or deliberately downplay the amount of service that the scene seems intended to convey. One of the KyoAni staff members has even been quoted as saying that the studio considers it important that they treat their characters with respect as real people and thus, they don\u2019t like to include a lot of fanservice in their shows.\\n\\n\r\nYes, K-On is a show that is enjoyed by a very large number of young-adult male otaku, but I think it\u2019s reductive to suggest that the show was made for that audience specifically, or to suggest that that audience only enjoys it as moeblob fanservice. K-On is a series with both a massive number of female staff members as well as a massive number of female fans, which are the cause and effect of the show\u2019s deliberate attempt to portray believable, well-rounded female characters with all of the respect that they would deserve as human beings.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, episode seven mostly serves as a rest period in-between arcs with a focus on character interactions, mostly between Ui and Yui. Noteworthy here is that the production values have jumped up once again to a much higher level of consistency.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode eight kicks off the second arc of the series, which is a lot more clearly defined than the first one. Not only does this arc serve as the introductory period for the new band member, Azusa, but it presents both the girls and the viewer with a question which will take a few episodes to fully answer. Early on, when the girls are trying to think of ways to appeal to the new freshmen, Tsumugi asks, \u201cwhat is the appeal of our club?,\u201d and no one comes up with anything. It\u2019s important to us as viewers that the name of the show and the name of the club are one and the same, since Tsumugi is literally asking, \u201cwhat is the appeal of keion?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLater in the episode, Ui asks Yui the same question, and Yui answers that, \u201cit\u2019s just fun.\u201d The fact that this answer comes first, and that it isn\u2019t the last answer we\u2019ll be given in the course of this arc, is imperative. On the most basic level, K-On is indeed fun. If you asked a lot of the show\u2019s fans what the appeal is, they\u2019ll probably give you the exact same answer, and that\u2019s fine. But the show is as interested in diving a little bit deeper into that as I am.\\n\\n\r\nWhat episode eight mostly serves to show us is how strange and insular the light music club has gotten to be over the first year of its existence. The personality quirks which the four girls and their teacher all take for granted end up alienating the new freshmen, who see them as a weird and incomprehensible little clique. And they\u2019re basically right to think that\u2013it would be incredibly hard to break into a group this tightly-knit. But when Azusa sees the group performing on stage, she can feel the raw energy that their togetherness lends to their performance, even if she doesn\u2019t understand yet what the cause of that energy is.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode nine is our proper introduction to the fifth band member, Nakano Azusa, and mostly takes place from her perspective. Unlike the other girls, Azusa is a serious guitarist who wants to be in a serious band, and most of the episode is about her trying to reconcile the awesome performance that the light music club put on at the freshman welcoming ceremony against the unmotivated idiots that they seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nThis episode is almost uncomfortable to watch, as it comically plays up all of the characters\u2019 worst attributes\u2013and once again, it\u2019s doing that on purpose. At this point, we\u2019ve gotten used to the rhythm of the main group\u2019s interactions; but this episode seeks to show us how off-putting and uncomfortable it would be as a newly inducted outsider. We feel Azusa\u2019s frustration and anger not only at the group for slacking off so much, but at herself for admiring them in spite of it all. Azusa makes us feel guilty for having gotten used to the way these characters act, by reminding us how dumb they can really be.\\n\\n\r\nYet along the way, Azusa can\u2019t seem to tear herself away from them. She can\u2019t even decide whether or not she likes them as people; they seem nice enough, but are ultimately a bunch of disappointments in terms of work ethic. However, she looks at other bands and just doesn\u2019t see in them what she saw in the club\u2019s performance, so she seeks answers from Mio as the only seemingly sane member of the group.\\n\\n\r\nRemember, back in episode four, Mio was the first one to get frustrated with the club\u2019s lack of ambition, and in the end she was able to realize the value of just having the other girls as friends. It fits perfectly, then, that Mio is the one who can best express what the REAL appeal of K-On is. Not necessarily that they\u2019re a great band, but that she loves being a part of a band with these members. This, ultimately, is the appeal of the show\u2013the experience of following the lives and interactions of these specific characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd once again, I think it\u2019s understandable if this appeal doesn\u2019t yet resonate with the audience on a very deep level. We\u2019ve come far enough to understand the appeal of K-On, but perhaps not far enough to legitimately feel it. K-On is a show that gets better the more of it you watch, and we\u2019re only about a fourth of the way through so far. Consider this like the difference between having read a Wikipedia article on something versus having read all of the sources: we get the basic gist of what makes K-On good now, but we don\u2019t have a full grasp of it yet.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode ten puts the girls into yet another training camp scenario, and mostly treads a lot of the same grounds as episodes four and nine. It culminates in Azusa essentially learning the same lesson that Mio did before, but more by gradually coming to accept the others as friends instead of being hit by a blunt revelation. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a common trend throughout this series of the characters growing closer in big ways whenever they\u2019re taken away from the school setting, and I\u2019ll talk about that a lot more once we get into season two. This episode also establishes the beginning of Yui and Azusa\u2019s relationship as guitarists who learn from and admire one-another, which will also be a bigger deal in season two.\\n\\n\r\nWith episode eleven, K-On is nearly operating at full capacity. Azusa has become a fully integrated member of the group, and we get our first big interpersonal conflict that isn\u2019t directly related to the club\u2019s activities. Ritsu\u2019s jealousy and anger towards Mio is portrayed in a unique and interesting fashion, with the nature of the conflict never being stated outright by any of the characters at any point, even when it\u2019s over. Everything is communicated by actions and expressions, which is pretty damn cool\u2013but even cooler is the complexity of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t any one direct cause of the conflict, but more of a boiling over from various tensions. Mio and Ritsu are both somewhat stressed over the upcoming concert, and Ritsu, as we learn later, is starting to come down with a fever. Mio gets angry with Ritsu first, because Ritsu fails to understand how important the lefty fair is to her, or why she might be upset with Ritsu for dragging her away, especially when Mio has to put up with Ritsu\u2019s indulgences all the time.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu seems to know that she\u2019s done something wrong, but is too stubborn to admit it. She blames Mio\u2019s growing relationship with Nodoka\u2013which is downright selfish considering that Mio just wants to be friends with the one person that she knows in her class. Mio is too angry and Ritsu is too stubborn for either of them to be straight with one-another, and since the other girls and their idiot teacher don\u2019t really understand the nature of the conflict, they don\u2019t know how to intervene. In the end though, when it gets to the point that Ritsu is in bed sick, both of them realize that they\u2019ve basically just been buckling under stress and stubbornness, and they remind one-another that in the end, they are still best friends. It\u2019s adorable.\\n\\n\r\nK-On might be the only show that could pull off this conflict without making it too melodramatic, and without having the reconciliation feel too hammy, while still communicating that these characters had a conflict and made up over it in the end. The situation is just complex enough, and the characters communicate in realistic enough ways, that all of it feels completely natural; and that feeling is one of K-On\u2019s biggest specialties.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode twelve is the climax of the first season, and I can\u2019t finish it without bursting into tears. Seriously, I watched it twice leading up to writing this post, and I lost my shit completely both times. It tells of the period leading up to the club\u2019s second big cultural festival performance, as well as showing the performance itself. If this series could be said to have been made with a mission statement in mind, then this episode spells out what that statement is.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict revolves around the possibility that Yui won\u2019t be able to perform on stage because of the cold she picked up from Ritsu at the end of the last episode. At first, this mostly leads to hijinks, as Ui tries to pose as a stand-in for Yui, and Yui tries to practice sick; but it becomes more dramatic as the group has to decide whether or not it would be worth it to perform without Yui. Azusa is the most concerned, and cries out that it\u2019s meaningless for them to go on-stage without her, which is particularly powerful when we think back on the arc she\u2019s had.\\n\\n\r\nRemember that Azusa was only able to understand the appeal of the light music club when Mio explained that she enjoyed being in this band because it has these members. Azusa has learned to attribute the group\u2019s amazing live performances to the fact that they work so well together, and had this idea reinforced in the previous episode when she was watching the last cultural festival performance on DVD. Azusa still hasn\u2019t gotten to perform with this group yet, and both her desire to be a part of the magic she saw on stage at the freshmen ceremony, as well as her own desire to perform with this group as a friend, is tearing away at her now.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Yui gets over her cold in time, but ends up having to miss the first song of the performance while she runs home to get her guitar. All throughout this episode, and really the entire season, Ui and Nodoka have been talking about how much Yui can get into something when she really sets her mind to it, and how only now that she\u2019s a member of this club has she really been able to put that single-minded tenacity to good use. As Yui leaves the house, the scene from episode one in which she tripped and busted her ass is reincorporated\u2013only this time, she doesn\u2019t fall down; plus she isn\u2019t distracted by anything while running down the street like she was before.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yui makes this run, to the soundtrack of her friends\u2019 performance, she remembers how scared she was back at the start of the season that she wouldn\u2019t find her place or figure out what to do with her life. She tells her past self not to be afraid, because at long last, she\u2019s found a sense of belonging in the light music club.\\n\\n\r\nIf Kyoto Animation has one big specialty, it\u2019s making emotional scenes through detailed animation and music. When K-On first came out, a lot of people joked that the series was one big expansion on the famous musical performance from the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. That scene had been famously emotional because of how the visually accurate musicianship, emotional facial expressions, and generally awesome music had culminated into something which felt raw and alive.\\n\\n\r\nAll throughout its run, whenever K-On shows a character playing their instrument, it\u2019s always presented with technical accuracy. However, up until this point we\u2019ve only seen it in bits and pieces. Performances usually feature frequent cutaways, or are replaced with music videos, or we see the face of the person hearing the music instead of seeing the performance. Only here at the end of the season do we get lots of uninterrupted shots of the characters performing accurately: growing passionate, breaking into a sweat, and generally exhibiting a whole range of emotions on stage.\\n\\n\r\nYui arrives on the scene in glorious fashion, and breaks into tears at the realization of the burden she\u2019s been\u2013not because she\u2019s ashamed of herself, so much as because she\u2019s only now truly realized the gravity of how much she cares about these friends, and how badly she wants to repay everything they\u2019ve given her. Yui tries emotionally to communicate these feelings to the audience; and despite her odd manner of speaking, she gets the emotions across. She even boldly states that this auditorium right here: THIS is their Budokan\u2013the pinnacle of what they wanted to reach. Remember, K-On isn\u2019t a show about Houkago Tea Time the band, but about Houkago Tea Time the people\u2013and for this group, coming together in this place to perform as a unit puts them at the height of interpersonal connection.\\n\\n\r\nThe second performance of Fuwa Fuwa Time is even more emotional than anything before, as we see not only the girls in full force, but images of all the places that brought them here. And when it\u2019s over, and everyone starts playing again, we get the incredibly powerful image of the five girls all facing one-another while they play. Even as they\u2019re sharing this feeling with the audience, they\u2019re more importantly experiencing it together, and\u2026 fuck I\u2019m actually crying just thinking about it, I need to go sit down.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode thirteen is somewhat confusing, because it\u2019s considered an \u201cextra\u201d episode, even though it aired along with the rest of the season. Once again the production quality makes a leap in consistency, putting it closer to what the show looks like for most of season two. Story-wise, this episode takes it slow by separating all of the girls and putting them in casual day-to-day scenarios. Towards the end, some of their days are doing downhill, but simply being able to spend time with the others quickly abates all of their worries, showing once again how this group operates best as a unit.\\n\\n\r\nThe K-On Live House OVA was released with the last disc of season one on blu-ray, and is definitely something special. By invitation of one of Ritsu\u2019s friends, the girls get the opportunity to open for a live show. Kyoto Animation definitely went out of their way to make sure that the location and the setup leading up to the performance was as accurate as possible, which I appreciated as someone who\u2019s been to a lot of live shows.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the bands performing with them is another all-girls group\u2013one in the high school age range, and the other more likely in college; but both with a much stronger sense of image and purpose. Meeting these bands and being in this situation is at once frightening and enlightening for the girls, as they get a look at what it means for a band to take themselves seriously and work ambitiously. At first they feel distant from all of this; like children getting a glimpse at what it means to be adult. However, they gradually develop a sense of kinship with the other bands, and, upon realizing how important this live show is to everyone, try tightening up their game.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important realization is had by Mio, as she observes that it is only because Yui was willing to talk to the other bands, and because Mugi was willing to offer them tea, that all of them were able to get to know one-another. I would add in that Ritsu was able to get them the gig to begin with, and that Mio and Azusa were able to hold this group together with their sense of responsibility all this time. What Mio realizes isn\u2019t just that each of the members of this group contributes something to the whole, but that all of them are turning into better people by way of being around one-another. Mio would never have spoken to the other bands on her own, but because of her friends, she gets to experience something valuable and inspirational to her own development as a person. Just by being together, these five girls are filling in the blanks in one-another\u2019s personalities to create more complete persons; all of them progressing handily towards adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that, my friends, brings us to the end of the first season of K-On. By now, you should have a pretty good grasp of what makes this show appealing, what it\u2019s trying to accomplish narratively, and where it might be going from here on out. Knowing all of this, it might not be so surprising to learn that K-On was an insanely massive success at the time that it came out. It beat the previous record-setting blu-ray sales of Bakemonogatari to become the best-selling TV anime of all time in Japan, and the amount of merchandise to come out of the show cannot possibly be overstated. There are few anime out there with more product tie-ins than K-On, and the impact was far-reaching. While K-On wasn\u2019t nearly as big of a hit nor as critically acclaimed among Western anime fans, it is nonetheless very popular and well-known, even if it\u2019s a lot more divisive here. The first season actually got an English dub by Animax Asia and was broadcast in other Asian countries before it made it to the US and UK and got another dub here.\\n\\n\r\nMy motivations for making this video have not only been to share my opinions on my favorite anime series of all time, but also to offer some perspective. K-On\u2019s reputation is so divisive in the Western anime scene, that I\u2019ve talked to some people who think everyone loves it, and some who think everyone hates it. I\u2019d gotten so used to seeing constant K-on love threads on 4chan\u2019s anime board over the years that I\u2019d honestly forgotten that K-On wasn\u2019t universally acclaimed, until I started talking about it in my videos and getting a lot of weird looks. I guess what I\u2019m saying is, you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. K-On is widely appreciated around the world; and if you bring it up in most anime communities, you\u2019ll see fans pouring out of the woodwork. Even if not all of those fans can easily put into words what makes the show special, I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ve helped to explain the appeal in as much detail as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, we\u2019re not done yet; not even halfway! There\u2019s a twenty-six episode second season, another OVA, AND a movie that I haven\u2019t even touched on yet, and as I\u2019ve been saying again and again, K-On is a series that gets better the more of it you watch. But we\u2019ll get to all of that next time, in Part Two.",

            "content": "This is stifling.\r\nThis is K-On!\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAverage premise. Girl and her friend want to start a club, they have a hard time recruiting until this peppy and so totally moe godsend shows up, and the rest of the series follows this club. This club in particular is called the, \"Light Music Club,\" which is essentially a rock band...who, in this anime, is barely seen practicing. Yet, everyone is just FANTASTIC at playing their respective instruments. We mostly see the perspective of the main character, Yui, who had only \"played the castanets in kindergarten\" so she thought that \"playing an instrument again would be so much fun!!:3\" ignoring the fact that she has had no experience prior, knows no one that can teach her, and doesn't even have the money to rent a guitar.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tune in at any point during the show and wouldn't tell the difference from the pilot. You'd miss nothing, nor would you know that you did. There's very little callback to previous events, and a new character comes in midway but is very quickly shoehorned in like she's been there the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nThe logic of the characters in this show is piss poor. But oh, OH how we're going to get to that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's very stenciled, with the characters looking like they came from a decent \"How to Draw Anime\" book you can find at the local craft store. There were some moments where the scenery was nice to look at, but one thing that REALLY bugged me was the animation. It's not bad. It's just not remotely as expressive as it should be, let alone the fact that it barely shows the girls playing their respective instruments, and when it does, it clearly repeats. If you're going to make an anime where playing a musical instrument is one of the main premises, then you should have it intertwined with the art style of your show, not sprinkle it in with, \"Wow, look at how fast Yui's fingers are moving across her guitar strings!!! :D\" only for her to cut her finger two seconds later so her eyes can sparkle with tears and we'll all feel sad for her. The designers and animators definitely took the cheapest ways out here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the only dazzling thing I have to say about K-On! is that the soundtrack is wonderful. The intro is great. The songs the girls play at \"concerts\" are great. The outro is FANTASTIC. If the music in the show was not as wonderful as noted, I highly doubt K-On! would have the popularity it would, let alone a 5 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, as I'm guessing this counts, the subbed version of this show is not bad. The voice actors try their best to be expressive with the cardboard-cutout body pillow covers they're forced to play, and I have to give a shout out to the girl who played Yui. Yui was annoying as all get-out, but the expressiveness the voice actress put into her character does show through.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub, though. Hell no. Everyone sounds the same, the English voice actresses are trying WAAAAAY too hard to be high and squeaky like their Japanese counterparts, (HEY BAD IDEA IT IS 2009 MAYBE SOMEONE WILL LEARN,) and it just reminds you of how awful and generically bad these characters truly are.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the worst part of the show. I didn't plan on making friends today.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to use Lucky Star as an example here of what K-On! tried to do with its characters. Both of these shows have the main character who can be annoying but endearing to everyone, a straight-edge, no nonsense girl, an irresponsible yet continuously positive girl that has a close relationship with the straight-edge (and they both by coincidence wear a yellow headband,) and a curvy rich girl who is very quiet and generous.\\n\\n\r\nOh gee. That's strange just how similar they are.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Lucky Star has the same general premise, following four girls in their high school shenanigans, and frankly, that show doesn't have much of a plot either. It's 90% fluff with cutaways and gags. What it does correctly, however, is the execution of their fluff.\\n\\n\r\nThere is always something happening in Lucky Star. The four girls always have jokes to tell that say things about their personalities and how they fit into certain situations. Most of the time, it's casual banter that leads to the best jokes, and Lucky Star, if anything, is VERY aware it's a slice-of-life moe fest, never missing an opportunity to poke fun at itself.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, in K-On!, we're treated to jokes with no hook. Slapstick with no punches. The jokes you've heard before, and you'll hear them again. We see the faceless girls go shopping, the beach, the park, and very scarcely to their instruments. One girl in the show states the band, \"has no passion\" for music, and that was the only character I liked; I couldn't tell if that was just her schtick, as she's literally the only one in the group with a musical background, or if the show had a moment of self-awareness. I'm guessing the former, even though I like to think the latter.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the girls. Are. SO DUMB. I know the guidelines mentioned no spoilers, but spoiler alert, THE PRESIDENT of the DAMN CLUB didn't know you needed to TURN IN AN APPLICATION to be REGISTERED AS A CLUB MONTHS AFTER IT WAS DUE. This whole \"whoopsies we forgot to turn into this super important form that was due today\" gag literally repeats about five times, and the girls being stupid and passionless are the only two conflicts they face, and, one more spoiler alert, they learn nothing after the fact. There is no development.\\n\\n\r\nEven the straight-edge is terrible. She has a fear of EVERYTHING, and that's what supposed to make you cry with laughter. Kagami from Lucky Star, in contrast, was the only one to match Konata's wit and bullshit, but here, NO ONE can stop Yui from being just...everyone's waifu, apparently. Definitely not a single dimensional being of an eight-year-old trapped in the body of a teenage girl.\\n\\n\r\nThere's literally a subplot where Yui, after being in the club for a very short amount of time, almost loses her membership for bombing a midterm. That's rubbing salt in the wound, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a decent show to watch while painting my nails. The only thing I truly stayed for was the music and the occasional piece of eye-candy. The arbitrary \"conflicts\" and incessant enthusiasm of the band members nearly made me stop watching multiple times, but I decided to see it out until the end. I shouted at the screen when a horrible decision was bound to be made, (\"Oh, I know! Let's set up a training camp out in the beach in a nice summer house where we won't practice but for twenty minutes out of the four days we'll be there! It will really sharpen our skills! But why does this talented musician who's actually taking this shit seriously want to leave our band??? I thought we were friends D:\"), which was a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWas it a waste of time? Probably. My nails dried, though, so that's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI was very thoroughly disappointed with this anime. I wasn't expecting FMA levels of good in terms of story, pacing, and development, but I also wasn't expecting to be infuriated at a show you're not supposed to feel anything from besides fuzzy. It was a mess, and it's a shame, too. The musical talent was put into the wrong story, played by four girls who wouldn't know music if the plot didn't call for it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime with great music and great everything else, just watch Detroit Metal Band or Your Lie In April. If you want a moe anime that won't make you want to pull your hair out, watch Lucky Star. If you want to listen to the music from this anime, look it up on YouTube.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that will near turn you off from an entire anime genre, this may be the show for you.",

I see many people scoring in a negative, positive way (not that I am offending anyone), and yes, there's nothing wrong with that.\r\nThe anime has music, and it is the center of everything. The music I find it very attractive because I love listening toJ-Pop/Rock. And maybe even the fact every character in the anime plays some kind of role in the center, everyone is emphasized very well in their characteristics and personalities. I find that very cool.\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that K-on is just beyond what it could be taken positive/negative, but should be taken as any other animes and such.

            "content": "Before reading this Review, please note, that humor is entirely subjective and as is it is such, it fully depends on the viewer, if he is enjoying the humorous parts, that the show has included. As this show is a show that heavily relies on humor and similarly objective things, please remember that this is MY opinion on how I liked these subjective topics! Thanks!\r\nThe moe genre has been widely spread within the last few years, slowly creeping more and more into the seasonal charts before actually taking them over, as there have been many shows of this kind in there lately. One production companyin particular has gotten their hands on many shows of that kind, being, as you may have guessed, Kyoto Animation. They were the ones that actually started the hype with Lucky Star and have ever since been able to receive more money just from releasing shows of this kind, such as Tamako Market in some ways Chuunibyou and most notably K-On!\\n\\n\r\nStory: K-On! is a 2009 Anime, done by Kyoto Animation and has been well known ever since. The story follows Yui a clumsy air headed girl that has just got into High school. As she never really was productive in any year earlier, she decides that this year she wants to join a club but doesn't know which one, since nothing that other clubs are doing really is to her liking. That is until she finds out about a club called the \"Light Music Club\". Thinking they are only playing easy songs and she won't have to do anything but play the castanets she joins them, but it isn't long until she sees, that underneath the big \"Light Music Club\" sign it says, that they want to form a band. Too late for Yui though as she already handed in her application sheet and she now has to at least tell the club that she wants to do so, since she can't play any instrument. She tries to do so, but the club members are begging her to stay, since otherwise the club would have to disband. They show her a song and Yui decides that she wants to learn the guitar and so they start...playing music? Well...not really!\\n\r\nThe story of K-On! for the most part actually is pretty non existent as this is a moe show and moe shows are dependent on things like cuteness and humor most of the time. It is rather rare that a moe show has an actual overarching plot instead of just having a motivation that makes them do whatever they are doing (in this situation being the band). However there are a few points that kind of show something like Drama, even though it is nothing really worth mentioning, but that is really all there is, as everything else is just cute girls doing cute things. The thing about that though, is that it doesn't make huge difference, since having a good plot obviously never was this show's goal.\\n\r\n5.3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters presented\u00a0 in K-On! are all rather generic, as everyone seems to represent a certain cliche that they fulfill.\\n\r\nWe have Yui, a clumsy, air headed girl that is playing the guitar. She originally joined the Light Music Club, thinking that she wouldn't have to do anything but playing the castanets and even now she'd rather be somewhere playing around than actually doing something productive. Nevertheless she gets quite good at playing the guitar pretty fast (which makes me kinda jealous...I always had to practice!)\\n\r\nThe second character is Ritsu, the Band's leader and drummer. She is an energetic girl, that is just as lazy is Yui is, when it comes to actually practicing or similar things and loves to make fun of others, Her dream is to form a band and go to Budokan (which is a huge concert hall in Tokyo) to hold a concert there. Thus she decides to form the Light Music Club and puts quite some efforts into it, even though she forgets things really easily which makes some situations really hard for the band.\\n\r\nThe next Club member is Mio. She is a really hard-working girl that plays the base in the band. She is really easy to embarrass though and gets easily scared, which often is used as the comedy relieve as it is quite funny to see for both Ritsu and the viewer.\\n\r\nThe last band member is Migu, a really kind and well mannered girl. She plays the keyboarder for the band and actually wanted to join the choir club at first, but ended up in the Light Music Club as they seemed to look a lot more fun to her. She is the daughter of a rich father, who seems to own several stores, often helping the group out quite a bit.\\n\r\nThe Supporting Cast in K-On! is just as the main cast nothing really special as they are for the most part just a bunch of moe cliches. We have the really crazy one, the caring one, the best friend and so on. Something that really stands out though, is that the supporting cast is really small, leading to them getting shown rather often and better understanding of the viewer, which really helps a lot to relate to them.\\n\r\nIn total the characters of K-On! really are nothing out of the ordinary. Every single of them is as I mentioned earlier just a Representative of a cliche and none of them is written really complex. On the other hand though, every single one of them is likeable and a could perfectly relate to everyone, not that this was really necessary, as there was no point where I actually felt bad for any of them, since this is a moe show and moe is really well known for actually no having any Drama in there. Nonetheless I really enjoyed watching them.\\n\r\nCharacter Development in this show is just as nonexistent, as the originality in the characters. Almost every single one stays the same for the whole show and while there are a few things that change, the change rarely gets significant and incredibly well visible.\\n\r\nThe thing about this section though is, that it doesn't really matter, whether they are cliche or not. It doesn't matter, whether the characters develop or not, since this is a show that neither wants any complicated plot nor any amazingly well written characters. K-On! totally works without anything that way. This show never even intended to be taken seriously which already gets obvious from the first episode on and doesn't really change throughout the course of the show. This is supposed to be a comedy Anime and as such we have to treat it that way. The thing that matters a lot more than the actual characters themselves, is the character interaction which in this Anime seems to be done really well. It is more than one time that I just had to laugh out loud, at just how cool the interactions between the band members were and that surely is nothing that you achieve by having great characters, but by making just letting them interact in a way that is cute and funny enough for the viewer to watch.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I don't think I actually have to say a lot about this, as this was done by the Animation Studio known as Kyoto Animation. For those unfamiliar with them, they have done amazingly well animated shows such as Chuunibyou or the recent free. To keep it short, the Animation looks just as amazing as in other shows by KyoAni. The character designs look really damn cute and I think it is worth mentioning, that they actually influenced every single following KyoAni-Anime, as those always seem to copy the style that K-On! Had.\\n\r\n9.4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: As K-On! is an Anime about music, you might figure that the music is really well done and that if the girls are playing the songs are done really well. The Soundtrack of K-On! though, only consist of way too few actual songs the band plays itself. The majority of the Soundtrack is the background music, which is rather boring and not really exciting to listen to. The songs that they actually play on concerts though, which happens rarely, are pretty well done and catchy. They are nothing that stands out due to it's complexity, but going into a moe show about music I actually was thinking it'd be a lot worse than it was. The ending and Opening though, both were amazing. Especially the ending, featuring a style that is really cool to look at and a really cool song.\\n\r\n8.1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn total K-On! has been something that I was kind of cautious to start, since I heard mixed opinions about this, ranging from absolute love to hate. I didn't know what to think of it until I actually watched it myself and I really have to be honest and say that I actually really enjoyed this. The humor was fantastic and I caught myself several times going \"awwww...this is cute!\", an exclamation that I wouldn't have thought I'd ever hear saying myself. And while this is all there is to it, with it being really funny and really cute, the show really doesn't need anything but this. It is enjoyable the way it is and I myself wouldn't have changed anything about it. It doesn't try to be something deep or anything that makes a lot of sense, but just wants to entertain the masses and that's what it does really well!\\n\\n\r\nNow as I calculated the scores I gave K-On! (being Story, Characters, Animation, Sound and my personal enjoyment), I came to a score of 7,66/10! It is really good for what it is supposed to be, but nothing beyond that!\\n\r\nAs it is now, K-On! has been licensed by Bandai Entertainment, but since Bandai actually has gone broke, this is out of print. You can quite easily get a new one though, as this show still is rather new and there are quite some left to sale. If you happen to live in Australia this show has been picked up by Madman and by Manga in UK and if you live in the same country as me (being Germany), you are able to get this by Kaz\u00e9 entertainment.\\n\r\nWith that I hope I could help you and see you next time!\\n",

Yep, that's the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the sound front, you'd expect good things given the premise of the show and it delivers well, with good, catchy j-pop all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty decent tropes given flesh until you get to Mio, who I have to give extra points.

I felt that too and I nearly dropped the series because of it.\r\nDo yourself a favor and see it through to the end.\r\nThis is not just an anime about girls in a band.\r\nThis is what feels like a very meticulously crafted story about a group of girls going throughtheir high school years, bonding through their common interests, and subtly growing as people.\\n\\n\r\nI went into this and the first episode I said the art looked ugly, but it grew on me when I realized how nicely animated everything is, everything flows and feels dynamic, which makes even boring scenes sipping tea and eating sweets look great. And you'll be seeing a lot of it. I fell in love with the art style halfway through the first season. When it was over I immediately started the second.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season takes its time telling the rest of the story and completely nails the lazy, long, drawn out school years of the protagonists. The ending was nothing short of heart string pulling and took me back to those final moments of high school where you're faced with the bittersweet reality that your youthful, carefree days are coming to an end.\\n\\n\r\nThe movie capitalizes on this very same concept and through a two hour experience you can witness the characters and the feeling of the show again, this time with much more music, and a beautiful recap that ties the series together nicely.\\n\\n",

I was genuinely interested in slice of life anime and this one appealed to me because it involved a band.\r\nIn slice of life animes I am mostly interested in characters and their interactions. K On does that perfectly. It has an interesting cast of characters which are fun to see. Since it is mostly Moe elements we get cute girls doing cute things which end up being fun\r\nThe premise of the anime is about Yui, a girl who is completely useless and carefree, sort of what you would call a dumb person. She has recently gotten into highschool andwants to enter a club but can't find any and finds a Light music club but doesn't know what instrument to play she starts to play the guitar and ... Well you will find out\\n\\n\r\nThe character interaction between most the characters is perfect . K On doesn't focus on Yui only it's a mulit dimensional character series featuring interaction between several characters which makes up for a pretty fun anime and what all Slice of Life anime should be.\\n\\n\r\nTho it isn't without it's flaws. Sometimes some plotlines seem epically dumb . The part of azukas introduction is so forced. She is a good character tho her introduction and joining of the gang is botched up and also the band formation is unrealistic. I only found the final concert songs the most entertaining. \\n\r\nPersonal rating: 8/10\\n\r\nWhy should you watch?\\n\r\nIf you want an anime which is full of fun and want to see character interaction and some cutesy stuff with some comedy this anime is for you",

            "content": "Review in brief:\r\nK-On!'s 1st season cemented much of what are now seen as the quintessential elements of the CGDCT subgenre.  Rather than bring anything new to the table, K-On! distilled what had already been done into something that's easy to relate to without sacrificing much in the way of characterization, comedy, and plain old fun.\r\nReview in full:\r\nK-On, like most of what is found in the CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) subgenre, isn't really about anything, especially in this 1st season.  Sure, there's themes that are lightly touched on, and sometimes they play music, but the story isn't the main point here.\r\nK-On isfar from the first CGDCT anime to come about either, and was hardly an innovator in its field.  That distinction is generally given to Azumanga Daioh, whose blend of loose (often to the point of being surreal) comedy and iyashikei (healing) undertones set a precedent that has largely remained followed since it started as a manga 20 years ago.  Aside from being much less surreal, K-On!'s style is fairly standard even for its time, much less these days when it's been done over multiple times per season for years.\\n\\n\r\nYet K-On! is a much beloved anime and a worthwhile entry point into its subgenre to this day.  This season may not stand out against many of its peers, but it certainly provides a lighthearted, friendly experience and it does this especially consistently.  K-On! not having much of a focal point actually plays to its benefit, as it allows the anime to take full advantage of its simplicity.  Sure it lacks the narrative depth you'd expect from something more focused on its plot, but K-On! isn't as shallow as it looks and goes as deep as it needs to for it to provide an all-around fun time.\\n\\n\r\nRather than try and compose anything poignant or grandiose, K-On! simply tries to bring about a smile through its calming normalcy and general goofiness. It does a splendid job of capturing the air of an after-school club with close friends, often subject to goofing off and enjoying each other's company rather than focus on just the club activity which, while a shared interest, is but a single facet in the relationships of its members.  Virtually anyone who has been part of a close group of friends can relate to it, and those who haven't can easily get an understanding of what would make such an arrangement a fun and worthwhile venture.\\n\\n\r\nSince we've established that the \"cute things\" being done aren't the important part, it's the \"cute girls\" that are the main appeal.  Of course they're visually cute, but this isn't an ecchi title and the resulting innocent nature of the anime is part of the charm.  No, it's the selection of cute personalities playing off each other that's important.  The quirky but rarely over-the-top bunch of goofballs in K-On! definitely get the job done.  Sure they're initially defined by a handful of personality traits, but most of the cast supplement each other's quirks over the course of the season, allowing them to flesh out quite nicely and even lightly develop.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Mio has stage fright and doesn't like costumes, but there's some costumes she dislikes more than others and the difference between performing for her friends versus the whole school is clear.  From there, K-On! builds on those traits by having her become accustomed to the outfits that she dislikes less and find reasons to slowly embrace her creative side and worry less about sharing it.  It's not a big development, and it's been done countless times, but the slight drama that brings it to light and the subtle shift in how the comedy plays off of these developed traits goes a long way in keeping the humor from getting stale and making the moeblobs the show starts with into a fairly convincing group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of moeblobs, they come up visually quite often in season 1.  K-On! wasn't the KyoAni goldmine it's known as today until after the anime was airing, and KyoAni clearly didn't give K-On! the same budget it did to more serious previous works like the Key adaptations.  That said, they gave it enough of an effort to do what it needed to do visually.  On those infrequent occasions the characters actually perform or otherwise take their club seriously, K-On! features some nice animation.  These moments are rather smooth, lively, and feature enough intricate detail for nice touches like the music being played and the animation for the girls playing instruments lining up just about perfectly.  On the other side of the coin, comedy moments often heavily simplify visual details and have much less animation, especially when it comes to the girls and their faces.  At least the framing and background art are always of a high quality to make up for those scenes when they occur.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the sound quality is more consistent than both the animation quality and the Keion-bu's focus on music.  Sure, the performed music is mostly J-pop, but it's noticeably spirited and sounds like the sort of thing a bunch of high-school girls would come up with (save for the ED, which appears much more professional as if to show the club's potential).  The background music is light, simple, and less poppy, but it fits the setting, contrasts the performances well, and is quite varied overall.  However, the voicework (Japanese dub) is where K-On's audio truly shines.  The girls all receive expressive, distinct, wide-ranging voices that fit them like gloves.  It makes them feel so much more alive that K-On simply would not be the same without its voices.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nLike most CGDCT anime, K-On!'s 1st season is simple and largely uneventful.  All it wants the viewer to do is have some fun, and enough of an effort is put into delivering relatable & organic fun for it to accomplish that consistently.  It's that consistency that makes this season a good entry point into CGDCT, because you'll definitely know what it is by the last episode and can easily make a judgment as to whether it's for you or not from there.  This season isn't particularly memorable, but for what it is there's little to fault it for, and consistent lighthearted fun has its value.",

Is there even a one?\r\nMain character Yui needs to join a club, so she decided to join Light Music Club (even tho, she can't really play guitar). The first episode was like ,,oh my god! what's happening? will the main character learn how to play well?'' and some of their concerts (like, there's not many of them) were like that but the rest of the ,,action'' was just sitting in their club room, eating sweets and doing stupid stuff.\r\nArt 4/10:\r\nThe art itself, is pretty nice to watch. Thecharacters have the right anatomy, everything is fine but if you will look at it often it will begin to be boring, and you will notice the same face syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nFor a music type of show, the songs were pretty catchy and great. There weren't that much of them sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nMio Akiyama - scared of frickin' seashells, she plays the bass and she's left handed. Moe or something.\\n\\n\r\nYui Hirasawa - main character. Annoying as hell, just joined the club and she doesn't do anything. She beats Sans in the level of laziness.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Nakano - i can't really say anything about this character because it's plain. She plays guitar\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi Kotobuki - she plays the keyboard and bring sweets. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu Tainaka - she plays the drums and tries to make everyone happy and energetic, she's the cog of the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10:\\n\\n\r\nReally hard to watch, sometimes you just want to quit. The concert episodes tho, were pretty decent to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nIf you like shows about being lazy, eating sweets, doing some music but ocasionally, then go ahead but if you would like it to be more energetic then i reccomend to watch Zombieland Saga, it's pretty similiar but the girls are energetic and there's a story. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "K-On! was an anime of it's time and it certainly hasn't aged well. If I had watched when if first came out, chances are I would've been all over, but that isn't the case now. \r\nNow it all seems it's just the same thing all over again, cute girls being cute. Oh, guess what, it's different because they play music! I don't really see it as something memorable or anything that would set standards (like other music SOL anime).\r\nBut, if you're into that, watch K-On! \r\nStory: 4/10 \r\nI forgive it for not having too clear of a plot as it's a slice of life, butI will say as an anime that I went in thinking I wouldn't have to pay too close attention to it, having others telling me that them growing up is the story, which is, quite frankly, boring. I can't say that's even easy for me to say for it's a reach to make in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing else to say other than I thought it was cute until I noticed a variety of other anime with the same exact style. Otherwise, there's some issues with the animation and how they shoot scenes.  But the fact this anime came out in 2009 needs to be taken in to account. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is bland and generic. It sounds as if they're trying too hard to be cute or to fit in with the \"anime music\". Even the BGM is generic. But... the voice actors are pretty good, even Yui's (despite the fact I honestly despise Yui's voice because of how high pitched and grating it is, her singing voice is even worse). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThey are all very, very stereotypical and fit into a sub type somehow. All of the characters can be seen as unbearable and obnoxious if someone can't stand moe girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I really appreciated was the subtle character development, my favorite being Mio as it appeared to be the most realistic and something I could relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it while I watched it and nothing more. I wouldn't want to rewatch it because then I would start nitpicking it more than I already have. It's something to turn off your mind to and that wasn't the easiest for me to do. K-On! isn't my cup of tea, but I can certainly see how it can be someone's favorite.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nMediocre. K-On! just isn't supposed to be seen as something deep or meaningful, it's something fun and cute other people can enjoy. If you're expecting something unique and different... Well...",

The dynamics and the attitudes of both the girls' interactions and the music that they play is truly a testament to the writers' abilities. The art style gives the characters life and perfectly display their emotions, while giving the background a depth that is often neglected.\r\nThis anime combines the slice of life genre so perfectly with a musical setting, that sometimes during the musical segments you forget that this is an anime about high school girls. The music is legitimately goodand will be stuck in your head for days if not weeks after watching.\\n\r\nThe dialogue is cute, as is typical of CGDCT anime but has a lot of interplay between characters. The yuri undertones are unsettling at times, as the age difference between some of the characters can be drastic, but it never ventures too far into fan service territory and is often used to enhance the plot of the episode or the series as a whole\\n\r\n I deeply enjoyed this anime and it is clearly a benchmark that all CGDCT anime aspires to meet.",

            "content": "I believe the only way to enjoy K-On! is to accept the essence of a \"slice of life\" anime at its fullest. Far from being the downfall of the genre, I believe that this anime truly reflects what SOL should be: a brief glimpse into the lives of a few individuals which gives us a chance to empathize with them and enjoy their daily shenanigans. The girls in this show are not the absurdly complex characters with dark pasts you expect to find in other anime, but that's what makes K-On! such a treat. Passing the time from episode to episode you find yourself growingto love the protagonists for what they are, just a couple of girls in high school trying to have some fun and play great music.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, this show is utterly hilarious. A majority of its content relies not on story arcs, but rather on moment-to-moment comedy and bits. Furthermore, the musical references K-On! makes are excellent and the songs the girls play are more than catchy. You'll find yourself becoming drawn in bit by bit, until you eventually realize that while not much has happened you still don't want it to end.\\n\\n\r\nI believe K-On! understands exactly what role it plays, and delivers adorably wonderful humor in what was one of my favorite anime.",

This is very first review by the way. But this show is so infuriatingly dumb I had to write a review about this show.\r\nNo Pros and ONLY cons.\r\nWhy?\r\nPROS:\r\n-None.\r\nCONS:\r\n-The four super generic girls are annoying as hell. Well, except for Mio, who is the most \"acceptable\" character in the bunch...\r\nFrom most to least annoying:\r\n1. Yui (I want to drown this retard in a toilet bowl.)\r\n2. Ritsu (Ugh..)\r\n3. Mugi (Thick-brows is somewhat ok -_-')\r\n4. Mio (Themost \"acceptable\" character in the anime, but that's all. Well, fortunately for her, she's NOT annoying like the rest.)\\n\\n\r\n-Slice of life is not a bad genre (for me) all in all, and this show is pretty much slice of life. But still it's very bad.\\n\r\n-Moe-visuals are not for me. Background scenery were just passable but its not enough redeem the moe character designs which, again are ugly for me. Art gets 4 out of 10. The art section is highest out of the rest of the other scores in other sections, FYI.\\n\r\n-The show tries to be extremely \"cute\" or moe (When its not.)\\n\r\n-The humor here is only for the most simple-minded people (Because its so bloody annoying and very not funny)\\n\r\n-I love music in general; I play the guitar in my freetime and this is a show about music, but in all honesty, this show is HUGE insult to music. Majority of the anime consist of  the girls just have their boring tea-time.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:  This anime is nothing more than a moe-infested trash heap that only caters to moe-tards. I'd rather rewatch Mars of Destruction than actually having to complete this. At least MoD was hilarious.",

            "content": "I'm not even going to bother with some kind of cheesy introduction. I loved K-On. It's without a doubt my favorite slice of life anime of all time. That said, I've been reading a lot of criticism, and I've thought to myself \"Okay, I can understand why you'd dislike it.\" So I've come to the conclusion that your enjoyment of this show depends on your expectations of it. If you're expecting anything like BECK, then you're going to be horribly disappointed. But if you expecting something brainless and fun with lots of moe, then you'll love this show.\r\nLike most slice of life anime, the plotof K-On is non-existent. It's basically about a group of girls that form a light music club in their school. Yet despite their goal to play in Budokan, they pretty much spend the whole time slacking off and drinking tea. K-On's plot is pretty much just an excuse for you to watch cute girls do cute things without going \"Wait, why are these girls even friends?\"\\n\\n\r\nFor me, what really makes this show (or any show, anime or not) is the characters. K-On has an extremely likable cast of characters. A lot of people criticize the fact that they lack \"depth.\" But do we watch Spongebob in hopes that Spongebob will learn valuable lessons about friendship? No! We watch it because we like to watch Spongebob and Patrick act like doofuses. And that's the same reason I watch K-On. Because I like to watch everyone interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about the characters is how they contrast, yet perfectly compliment each other. First there's the guitarist Yui, Who is my favorite mainly because of how hilarious she is. Her incredible clumsiness makes her the epitome of moe. Next is the bassist Mio, who looks cool and collected, but is actually extremely shy and a massive scaredy cat. Then there's the drummer Ritsu, the most tomboyish (although I wouldn't call her a total tomboy because this is a moe anime as you know) member who loves attention and bothering Mio. Finally we have the keyboardist Tsumugi, a sweet rich girl who loves to make tea and finds very trivial things incredibly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the show, the group of girls is joined by Azusa, who becomes the rhythm guitarist. Her musical experience and seriousness mixes well with the rather disconnected group. She helps straighten them out while they help her loosen up. There's also Ui, Yui's hardworking sister who takes care of her despite being younger, Nodoka, Yui's smart friend, and the club adviser Sawaka. I'm not really as big of a fan of Sawaka as I am of the rest of the cast. Mainly because of how much of a pervert she is. But fortunately, the second season tones her down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm done fanboying about the characters, it's time to talk about other things, because K-On does have other things going for it. First there's the art. Kyoto Animation has been well known for their quality animation, and they certainly don't disappoint. You'd think that because it's a slice of life, they wouldn't really put to much effort into the animation, but there is some really nice animation going on here. The artwork is very good. The school the girls go to is based off a real life school, and they really put a lot of details from the school into the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is fantastic. From the stunning OP and ED, to the catchy insert songs, these girls do a good job playing despite hardly ever practicing. The background music is also catchy. It's noticeable, but it doesn't overshadow the scene going on.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit I tend to throw out 10s a little bit, but I really don't have any major complaints about K-On. I mean, I guess I could argue that it doesn't portray being in a band or pretty much anything about music realistically, but it's not like I was expecting it to.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're not totally into moe, I'd still suggest this anime for having likable characters, great humor, excellent music, and just being a lot of fun to watch. The only people I can't suggest this to are people who absolutely despise moe and those who start up this show with the wrong impression.",

            "content": "This is my first time doing review but I though that I could give it a shot.\r\nWhat can I say... despite giving this series 10, I can't call it perect. Why? Series were planned as music based anime but sadly we don't really hear that much music as some people might have wanted. \r\nInstead of actual practise they are eating cakes and preformances are also rare BUT... it is also a plus!\r\nSeries are about 4 (later 5) girls who decided to create a group and their goal is to become famouse music stars. What is so original about that? \r\nWhat got me attached to theseries is the fact that instead of actually working hard to get to their goal like it is usually done in other stories, they are completly slacking off! Ritsu, the creator of the band is doing all in her power not to practise because she is way too lazy. Mio and Auzsa seem to be the only ones who are seriouse about the club and try to improve the situation as best as they can. But lazines is a powerful thing and even they are won over by it from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nHow many of you have the goal but are too lazy to reach it right now? I know I am, even though I hate that side of mine. These series and characters are someone to whom I can relate and who I can understand. Whenever they actually do something worthy, you start to get pumped up in order to follow the suit and try to get towards your goal as well. You simply don't want to look worse than them and they had reached a quiet high level of laziness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther pluses are that series are easy going, if you hate thinking or simply want to relax - this series are meant for you. You don't have to strain your brain, episodes always have humour and a bit of fanservice which can be named by one word aka \"Moe\".\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also all different, starting from lazy and airheads and ending up with seriouse and cute ones as well as some scary/cool characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even if the music is not heard as much as some might wish, it is worth the wait whenver you do. And series probably have one of the best anime ED that I have seen both visually and musically based... though the new ED for season 2 is better XD\\n\\n\r\nWell that's it, hope it was helpful and that you will enjoy it as much as I did^^\\n",

If you dismiss all the hype over \"Ohh its sooo cute and soo cool\" and how Otakus have gone mad over this series i just cannot see the appeal, The characters dont deserve any praise they just are ordinary to me. Combine that what a story that doesn't progress and no Character development what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up they join a music club and recruit one member and play a song! i feel cheated of all the hours wasted on this series my advise is just skip this story or watch the first few episodes to understand the characters \"Traits\" Example: Mio being scared, Yui is useless and clumsy, Mugi is mature etc... and go to season 2 or just drop it all together.\\n\\n\r\nTo me this is the most overhyped series ever!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt's Kyoto,  so you expect nothing else than amazing visuals and character style. and this series continues the trend.\\n\r\nAMAZING....................\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNot too bad but still Mugi,Ritsu,Yui voice really annoy me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nCute,but thats about all you will get from these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nI suppose it looks great but the enjoyment is ruined by the story (or lack of) and the Characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Until recently, I'd fallen out of love with anime. By the recommendation of a friend, I dug up the first few episodes of \"Keion!\", and was hooked immediately.\r\nIt may seem a little odd from an outsider perspective, but the first thing I said to the friend who recommended it to me was \"Finally, a decent anime that isn't all about sex!\" We both had a good laugh, but it was the truth. There seem to be far too many out there that grab the attention of male viewers purely through a generous helping of T&A and a mild smattering of girls in bunny-suits to sealthe deal. \"Keion!\" does it with well-timed humor and fantastic character and story development. I'm a sucker for both; so, on this level, \"Keion!\" truly earns its place. There are, of course, the blatantly silly moments in which slapstick is the driving force; but there are some truly moving moments as well. I'm not embarrassed to say that there were tears. The characters become so real and tangible that one cannot help but feel for them through both happy and emotionally moving moments. By the time I'd reached episode 24 of season two, 'Graduation Ceremony!', I was truly sad knowing that the end of the series was very close at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around four, and later five, main characters. All are members of the Light Music Club and a band named Hokago Teatime (Eng: After School Tea Time.) They are: Hirasawa Yui, the klutzy, forgetful, kawaii lead guitarist and vocalist of Hokago Teatime; Tainaka Ritsu (Ricchan), their somewhat masculine drummer; shy, studious, but talented bassist and sometimes lead + backup singer Akiyama Mio; Kotobuki Tsumugi (Mugi), their easily impressed, and seemingly very wealthy keyboardist; and second guitarist Nakano Azusa (Azu-nyan!), who joins the Light Music Club after being awestruck by a performance at the freshman welcoming. Secondary characters include Yui's sister Ui; their teacher and club supervisor, Yamanaka Sawako sensei (Sawa-chan!); and Manabe Nodoka, a close childhood friend of Yui as well as the student council president. As it happens, on numerous occasions; Nodoka serves as benefactor (or sometimes savior) of the Light Music Club in matters ranging from stage time to club registration, which otherwise would result in disaster. Sawako, a former member of the Light Music Club herself, plays several roles throughout the show's progression. Most of the time, she is simply their teacher and club supervisor. Other times, she is a personal tailor to the band, whether they want it or not; creating clothing of rather questionable style, or appropriateness. Still, other times, she serves as the band's ambassador to the music world; supporting their ambitions and even taking them to a summer musical festival. Not to be forgotten is Yui's younger sibling, Ui; the more responsible, sensible and down-to-earth of the Hirasawa sisters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is, as stated in the summary of this review, beautiful. I'm one of those people who will look at a show and, regardless of the depth of story, potentially discard it simply based on appearances. This holds true for animated, live action, and CG alike. To quantify this; I'm sure most will agree that Dreamworks will never measure up to Pixar in the CG department. I feel the same way about anime. From the obviously well crafted background painting to something as simple as transitions between expressions, Kyoto Studios seem to have outdone themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a big thing for me as well. This isn't limited to just music. I find that a lot of animated shows leave me wanting for depth, but it's notoriously hard to place. Sometimes all you need to make a dialogue feel a little more natural is to have some ambient background noise; whether it's the rustling of clothing or a busy city street. Again, \"Keion!\" hits that mark for me. The obvious entry for this segment, however, should be the rather extensive and somewhat intimidating soundtrack procured for the series. Spanning several released albums, including individual character releases and instrumental versions of some of the show's more popular tracks, \"Keion!'s\" music collection is something every fan of the show should listen to. Not only does it serve as background for certain scenes, but the performances of the After School Tea Time band really caught my attention. Notable tracks from the show would be Fuwafuwa Time, Fudepen - Ballpen, and my personal favorite Watashi no Koi ha Hocchikisu (Eng: My Love is a Stapler). Lesser acknowledged, of course, will be the supporting soundtrack which serves very well to accentuate the wide range of emotions in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSome critics and self-proclaimed 'anime-purists' may cite the series as being to slowly paced, predictable, and having little plot or purpose, but I think that's what gives the series its charm. It follows five girls through their career in high school as they make friends and memories they will take with them for the rest of their lives. There's something special to be said about a series that can grab your attention and hold it for 40 episodes, banking only on the viewer's attachment to 5 fictional girls' very realistic personalities and adventures.\\n\\n\r\nTo quote the friend who introduced me to this wonderful show; \"It's sometimes the shortest series that are the best.\" Shows like Dragonball (Z & GT), Bleach, Naruto, and Inuyasha are extremely lengthy and have MASSIVE fanbases; yet I feel no passion for them. They seem overdrawn, oversaturated, and overrated. The plot gets lost in the almost endless fighting scenes or massive (and sometimes painful) spaces between story arcs. The other extreme, I would say, are shows in the vein of Tenchi Muyo which make up for what they lack in length by retelling the exact same story whilst modifying the backdrop a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIt's said that it's the brightest star that shines only half as long; that's how I feel about \"Keion!\".",

            "content": "Review on 24th December 2015,\r\nFawa time! Fawa time! I swore I said that on another review...X'mas lost Memories? Oh well, back to the review. K-on! is an anime that is all about the music...and if you know me, I love music. but of course, with that music, you need a good plot and characters, and does K-on! offer this? Let's find out whilst we all eat our candy canes.\r\nPlot: 8/10\r\nI found the plot fairly cliche. But if you combine that with cuteness 5000, it sorta makes you wanna forgive the cliche. It's a fairly basic plot, from beginning to play music and having fun witha club. God knows how happy these girls always are....it's starting to get kinda creepy. No visible plot holes, which is good, and I love how they actually tell us the number of years pass...because then I could keep up on how old these girls are. Overall, even though it's a basic plot and the cliche is there, the cuteness of the girls just you to forgive K-on! for that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nVery cute, especially Azura, or should I call her, Asunan...nah stuff that! I enjoy the unique personality of each character as well, and how they interact. Character development is also fairly visible as well. Even though I can't find any flaws, it gets an 8, as the characters aren't at the extensive level of amazing. They are just...good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/sound: 10/10\\n\r\nOnce again, animation madness strikes again. Stunning animation, amazing sound. This was an easy 10\\n\\n\r\nOpening/ending/those in between: 10/10\\n\r\nOBVIOUSLY THIS POINT WOULD GET 10/10! LIKE SERIOUSLY! THIS IS A MUSIC ANIME! WHY WOULDN'T IT GET A 10! Sorry for that...sudden rage. But, because K-on is a music anime it excels in opening/ending, and all those musics in between. It fits extremely well into the genre as well. I said enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nCertainly enjoyable seeing the girls play. For a person like me who plays the piano, this is totally inspiration...kinda. I also enjoyed the ending as well, it was a shame to stop the series...BUT WAIT! Season 2 came out with 26 episodes, and as soon as I knew, I immediately watched it, and was amused. Definitely a great anime to relax and have fun that doesn't make you feel 50 emotions of grey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 45/50\\n\r\nFawa time! Fawa time! And that concludes the Christmas review! I hope you all have a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!",

            "content": "K-On! Who doesn't like cute girls having fun with their buds.\r\nThis review covers K-On!, and its sequel K-On!!\r\nOverall: 8\r\nK-On! is an anime I had thought everyone watched. I was ready to jump right into it and love it. I did love it. Although it took me a long time to watch through, it was always nice to sit back and watch. K-On! is very easygoing and carefree. There's not much, if any, drama throughout the series. That being said, plot is pretty much non-existent, which doesn't matter too much in this slice-of-life. The music is phenomenal. I would recommend that everyone watch K-On!, at leastseason 1, at some point in their weeb career.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is an anime without a real overarching plot, and that really works for it. So if you don't mind not having an end goal in an anime, it works for you as well. If you're looking for deep plot and story, this isn't the anime.\\n\\n\r\nK-On! basically covers the life of highschooler Yui Hirasawa, as well as her club/band mates. Very simple premise, girl joins a club and does things. The story is very basic, but it leaves a lot of room to be creative. At the same time, it's not anything that hasn't been seen before. It's just another slice of life story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely good. If you need a studio to draw cute girls, KyoAni is your studio. Only time I ever saw something I didn't like, was a performance in S1. Just looked weird, but I digress. K-On is still pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is about a band. A band makes music. Music is sound. Thankfully, Houkago Tea Time, the Keion club's band name, makes good music. All vocals are performed by the girls' voice actors, and most of the music are original songs written for the show. From Fuwa Fuwa Time to Ballpoint Pen to U&I, the songs are great.\\n\\n\r\nSticking with that, the OPs and EDs for the series are all songs by Houkago Tea Time. K-On!'s opening and ending are Cagayake! GIRLS and Don't Say Lazy, respectively. K-On!!'s first OP and ED are GO! GO! MANIAC and Listen!!, and the second OP and ED are Utauyo!! MIRACLE and NO, Thank You. All songs are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nK-On!'s characters are all sweet and young high school girls. The moe is strong in this anime. There are quite a few archetypal characters. The loud clumsy one, the loud tomboyish one, the quiet scared one, the quiet airhead, and the one that tries too hard to be taken seriously. That being said, the girls of K-On! are still wonderfully done. The problem being, with drama in the plot, there is nowhere for development to take place. Nothing changes within the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is a lot of fun to watch. It sticks to the cute-girls-doing-stuff format, and does it right. There's not a dull moment throughout the series. Only problem is that it gets a bit repetitive.",

            "content": "The Definitive Moe: A Must Watch\r\nIf I told you that KyoAni would become a powerhouse and revolutionize moe as we know it, you probably wouldn't have believed me. \r\nThe emphasis is, as many others mistake, not on the story. Although there is a underlying and somewhat episodic storyline, it is well advised to cast a further net - a character exploration and journey would be a contextual environment in which this masterpiece is rightly viewed.\r\nThe animation quality we have come to know KyoAni for - fluidity in hair, beautiful scenery, a sense of \"liveliness\" - was unseen in most conventional anime nearly a decade ago.Arguably, K-ON! is a forefather in pushing other studios to emulate the same quality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is simple. This is a strength that plays to it's favor, with little of the half-baked melodrama and teen angst that permeates the plethora of modern low quality anime so enjoyed by the masses. It would, perhaps, be a disservice to spoil the freshness of this portrayal in the sea of current mediocrity. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-ON! is the textbook of moe. It speaks to a time in which KyoAni had greater creative vigor and audacity than they do now. It was a time of Harhuism, when boundaries seemed to be broken again and again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Just finished K-On! less than a week ago, so I'm writing this with it still pretty fresh in my brain.\r\nSTORY: 5\r\nK-On! follows the light-music club of Sakura High as the four (later five) members form a band with dreams of national success. That's the overarching plot, and, due to the episodic nature of the series, isn't really much else. I was pretty disappointed with the series coming into it as I expected it to be a music oriented show, but I quickly came to realise that the cast spend the vast majority of their time messing around, drinking tea and eating cake rather than doinganything musical. However, after I accepted the fact that this show was truly about tea-and-cake, I began to ignore the simplicity and predictability of the story and just went with it. This allowed me to get into it a lot than I otherwise would have (I'm more used to a structured plot as I don't often watch slice-of-life anime).\\n\r\nEach episode is really simple with its story and you'll find no real surprises, plus there are no multi-episode arcs, instead every episode has its own story that starts and finishes within the 20 minute time-frame, so you won't out on a whole lot by skipping an episode (although you may miss out on the one or two new characters introduced). Overall, the story is nothing special, and it isn't really the focus of the show, so don't expect anything particularly gripping or solid.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6\\n\r\nK-On!'s art and animation is generally pretty decent. The backgrounds are alright and  the characters are distinguishable from one other (though their face look similarly moe). But, when the camera is sitting at a mid to wide angle, the character art seems to drop in quality, with characters' feet becoming little more than stumps at a certain distance, making the art seem kinda lazy. There are other times when character proportions, particularly hands, are poorly drawn and look very strange. Though, for mid to close range shots, characters are drawn fine. All the characters have the general moe characteristics, sporting big eyes and small...pretty much everything else, but generally the art quality is decent. Nothing to write home about, but you won't feel like ripping out your own eyes or anything.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty flat and (forgive the pun) one-dimensional. You've got:\\n\r\nYui- The main girl and guitarist who seems to have a case of ADD. Silly, lazy and forgetful with little to no attention span.\\n\\n\r\nMio-Intelligent and reliable bassist, but far too easily scared (and reduced to a catatonic state of shock). Frequently trolled by her friends who take pleasure messing with her anxiety, though by the end of the show, she's probably got the heart of an eighty year-old smoker.\\n\\n\r\nMugi-The wealthy and kind keyboardist who seems to have a never-ending supply of tea and snacks for the club to eat instead of actually practicing music. Air-headed and enjoys the simple lives of her commoner friends.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu-The drummer and probably the most normal one of the group. Mio's best friend, energetic and lazy at the same time. Hates work and loves stuffing around.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it with the characters. They're likable enough, but you'll see pretty much no development throughout the entire series. Sure another couple of characters are brought in, but they're also pretty shallow. Simple, and once you've met them, you already know them.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4\\n\r\nNow we get to the most important part of the show: sound. For a music show there's not a whole lot of music going on. The modern pop-style opening and closing themes are pretty decent, but the high-pitched singing of Yui's voice actress can get pretty irritating. Mio's VA also does some singing and her voice is a bit nicer to listen to. As for the songs featured in the actual show...well they were pretty disappointing. Featuring great hits such as \"Fluffy Time\", \"My love is a Stapler\" and \"Brush Pen, Ballpoint Pen\", the lyrics put out by the band are quite stupid ('my heart is fluffy like a marshmallow', are you kidding me?). Fluffy Time, the band's go-to anthem for performances starts out like an old-punk rock song (it really reminded me of the Ramones as soon as it started), but then it quickly becomes a stream of inane lyrics spurted out in Yui's high pitched voice. Seriously, she's not a good singer. \\n\r\nAt least the show seems pretty self-aware about the poor-quality of its songs, with a few characters thinking the lyrics stupid when first shown them (even Mio, the songwriter thought they were too embarrassingly bad to sing).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7?!\\n\r\nDespite my low rating for everything else about this show, I did have some fun watching it. Once I got past the non-existent story and simple characters, I began to enjoy some of the comedy presented. It made me laugh a few times and brought a couple of smiles to my face, and I'm pretty sure that's all K-On was really trying to do, just get a few laughs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want something to watch something after a long, tedious day that will help you chill out and relax a bit, you could do far worse than K-On. Its easy to get into, and you won't be left feeling sad or with a cliffhanger. Any comments/criticism/feedback of my review would be greatly appreciated, so feel free to message me.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto K-On season 2!! (Don't judge me, the cake and tea is pretty addictive).\\n",

But what I hoped for was that the implementation of music to the show would help it discern from every other one of these types of anime. Unfortunately, I had no such luck. Despite this show being about musicians, the soundtrack is mediocre and the characters rarely play their own instruments. The animation was very bright and pretty, there was no story, the sound was servicable, the characters wereKAWAII DESU, and I didn't really like it at all. I mean try it out by all means.",

Art and animation that's striking a memorable. I've never laughed harder at anything. K-on is the most fun I've ever had with an anime.\r\nK-on is simple, yes but complex. Each member of the cast was perfectly built to mold into each other's personality while standing out on their own. I could just watch them all talk about wet bread and still be entertained. \r\nEach girl has time to really grow as a person in small ways over the course of the series.Each one learns a little more about themselves in silence. Just with stares and quick glances we're put into the world of this character. This isn't mentioning Yamada's amazing direction.\\n\\n\r\nI have many scenes that are forever in my head. For emotional moments and the funny ones. So many little gags and leg movements are playing in my head right now, and that's great. It's a testament to how well Yamada can direct. She can make a scene stick with you. I will forever laugh at Yui playing the castanets and when Mio fell over.\\n\\n\r\nThat scene in particular is funny because we expect a panty shoot but get a rice bowl colored to Mio's paintes which is goofy and funny. And it's shoot in a way in which you'll remember it and giggle a little when it comes up in your mind. But it also still appeals to that crowd giving them the idea of Mio's panites. It's a win win situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe more you watch the show the more you laugh. You become friends with these girls and laugh with them. You can guess how they'd react to situations in real life because they feel like real people to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe feeling from K-on is one no other anime has ever recreated. Well many may try to be as great they all can't see how everything adds up to make K-on.\\n\\n\r\nK-on's great because of the stellar art and animation, and the lovable real characters. \\n\\n",

They didn't do anything interesting, they barely played in the group. Did they expect me to believe that Yui learned to play guitar after like 2 times of playing? They just drink tea and eat cookies for the majority of the time. And the 13th episode was very weird. It felt like they wanted to change it into a drama at the end of the first season, and then changed their mind in the last 5 minutes of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: OK, this was actually very good. It was cute, the style was nice and the animation was smooth.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I really liked the OP and the music that the Band performs. But the background music was very forgettable. And then we have the ED which was extremely out-of-place\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nLet's see what characters we had.\\n\\n\r\nYui: extremely one-sided and had no character development. She begins as a child in a 15-year-olds body and ends up as a child in a 15-year-olds body. She didn't show any other characteristics other than being happy and childish.\\n\\n\r\nMio: She was the only one that wasn't as one-sided as the other ones, but she was definitely the most predictable one. She was always scared of something that Ritsu showed and then she would punch Ritsu which was apparently supposed to be funny. It was never funny. But I have to say that she is a shy and introverted character that doesn't go over-the-top, which is good. \\n\\n\r\nTsumugi: She didn't really have a character. She was happy and was rich. She was basically there to be rich. I don't really have anything else to say\\n\\n\r\nAzusa: She was basically a combination of Tsumugi and Mio. \\n\\n\r\nRitsu: She was just annoying\\n\\n\r\nYamanaka: I liked her in the beginning. She was nice. And then they mention her also performing music back in the day and it was like it triggered something in her. After that, she becomes creepy, perverted, annoying and in general not nice. She had a line where she said that she could know the difference between Mio and Azusa by feeling their breast size. Think about that for a second. Their teacher just tried to sexually harass them. THEIR TEACHER TRIED TO GRAB THEIR BREAST!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3; The characters and the story made me furious. But it was extremely cute\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3",

Sad moments will have music that will also make you feel sad, and the funny moments will have funny music and so on.\r\nThe few downsides to this anime is the animation, despite it's cute art style, it's somewhat poorly animatedfor the first few episodes, and spotting  asymmetrical eyes is not a rarity, as it does happen somewhat often (However, they are not really noticeable unless you look at it closely).\\n\\n\r\nIt really makes me sad how there's never gonna be a 3rd Season.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON! is definitely worth watching, the story isn't really the most serious, but the comedy justifies it.  And the few moments it gets serious, it just somehow catches you in the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, for me, is perfect.",

As I finish this anime, it has really made me tremendously sad because of losing it. \r\nTo start off, I will comment on the story. The story was fantastic, it furnish the typical.high school life with music. Sounds plain? Exactly. But even plain commoners food can taste delicious if it is heartwarming. K-On does it perfectly.\r\nThe art blew my mind. I have always been.bias towards modern anime due to assumption of netter art. Tip #1 DO NOT I swear DO NOTjudge the anime based on the poster because turtles and tortoises, it was beautiful. There was no sign of poor quality and it destroys a few anime in 2015.\\n\r\nThe music was mind blowing. It is an anime about music and it shook my heart. I was never a big fan of music in any genre but laced with brilliant storytelling, the music came to life.\\n\r\nThe characters were unique in every way. There's no usage of cliche characters but common personality. they each have a stake in the anime, spoke a certain tale and were all.lovable. You know an anime is good when you look all.the characters including the sides\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the score that matters which is my enjoyment. It xontribues directly to the overall score of the anime which should be done across the board. I have words but j cannot speak it. It is sad, you will tear up but you will love the process. You lose something which is your love. I really liked this anime and it has just this brillant ambience to it that makes you feel.humane again. If you are looking for something to fill in the empty space in your heart, why not pick this up and give it a try?",

            "content": "Okay, let me get this out of the way first. I love the music of K-On. I listen to it non-stop after watching the anime. I just can't get enough of it. The lyrics are so damn cheesy that if you were to sing translate and sing them to someone else you'd sound like a little girl, but that's not a bad thing. The Openings and Endings are amazingly written and fun to listen to and try to hopelessly sing along to. The actual times when HTT perform, those are done beautifully, and the songs rival GirlDeMo for some of the best songs in animethat isn't from an OP or ED (and maybe Lelouch's theme from Code Geass).\\n\\n\r\nI will kinda be using this to review both seasons, so bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nStory... Let's see. A girl who knows nothing about music decides to join a school music program to avoid the fate of being a NEET. At the time I watched this I wasn't hugely into anime, so I had no clue what this meant, but now i just find the idea of Yui becoming a NEET both hilarious and a real possibility. She joins to find three people who can't make a full band who instantly accept her, only to find out later that she can't play. From their hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as a musician, it is painful to see how little amount of the time that the characters have is devoted to their practice, especially in their \"rehearsal sessions.\" However, the times you do see them practice, also as a musician, I can actually tell how hard they are working. And having someone close to me who don't grasp music as well as me (although not as bad as Yui), I understand Yui's slow grasp of the music world.\\n\\n\r\nOkay... what else can I say. While this anime is about music, it tries for a lot more comedy, which in no way does it fail at. The stupid situations that their supervisor puts them through are just awkward enough to make me laugh, but not so awkward that I feel awkward. (I'm looking at you WataMote). Overall, the story is a Slice of Life with music thrown in, and that's not a bad thing. Hibike! Euphonium or other music based animes may focus more on the side of music, and I appreciate those as well, but this still manages to have enough that it's not like Glee where they suddenly know a song they've never practiced.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, onto other aspects of the show... I may have spent too long vaguely describing the story. Okay, I think the art in K-On is cute. That is what it is trying to pull off, a cute and comedic anime. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. It's supposed to overload you with stupid situations that make you laugh. The art style really complements the overall anime in a way that just enhances it. My first introduction to a fair amount of anime stereotypes was this anime, and I honestly can't count that amount of times I said \"Kawaii\" in response to this...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. You have four characters (well, eventually five) whose personalities contrast each other greatly. The always bubbly one who has talent but often times doesn't work hard enough to prove it. The energetic one who would be perfect if you put her behind a drumset... Wait... The shy one who has amazing ideas but doesn't feel confident enough to share, and gets humiliated by the other members of the band (in a cute way, not a mean way). Finally, the rich girl who really doesn't get normal life (insert Hardware Store by Weird Al Yankovic), but actually does work hard at what she likes (which is music). They all work together with a great supporting cast to make hilarious moments and great music.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't know how hard I have worked to learn Azu-nyan's part in Fude Pen Boru Pen on guitar... I thought i might have to praise the music one more time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-On is a fun ride, and I honestly cried in the very last episode (I told you I was reviewing both seasons) which surprised me so much. I don't think I've loved many animes that much, even if it is a silly comedy with some damn good music. I think that, with all its flaws and such a silly execution, it is something I could just watch any time I'm really feeling down or just need something fun. I recommend it just as a fun anime to watch and nothing else.",

What makes K-on so special is its soundtrack and characters. It brings a whole new light to rock. The band (Houkage tea time) makes, no creates adorable/catchy music without breaking the rules of rock. The characters are crazy cuteand get along very well demonstrating the usual high school best friends. The art is good not great and the animations are average.I enjoyed this anime a lot but it's not for everyone.  \\n\\n\\n",

For the art i gave it a six because the people actually took there time and didn't use machines for most of the work like in lost animes. The sound quality was not all that great itwas in japanese to start off but also there was the problem with it skipping out every once in a while. The characters were outstanding it is amazing that japanese artists can make girls look so awsome. Enjoyment is different for everyone i didn't really like it. Overall i gave it a six if you like to see girls play guitar then this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "This review is for the anime K-on! first season.. please dont mistaken this with the 2nd season coz i haven't watched it yet. thank you! Now let's begin.\r\nStory: 10\r\n        A perfect score for the story because the concept is very interesting. The main character suddenly realizes that she should do something meaningful as she enters high school. Indeed, the story of this music-themed anime is simple yet, very great and inspiring! The development of the plot is very smooth as the girl tries to be someone and change herself for the better. In fact, the story of thisanime inspired me to persevere in life and to learn how to play the bass guitar.^_^\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\n       Though all of the characters are kawaii, I noticed in some scenes that they are drawn haphazardly meaning to say, not in the best quality for my taste. Compared to other animes that i saw, this has the most unique art. Being unique in a positive way is what I meant. The one who illustrated the characters made a really good job however, I didn't captivate me that much. But it still appeals to most people so I guess it is really worth the effort\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n       As expected from a music-themed anime, sounds ranging from the OST's, character songs and voice actresses are very superb. Viewers will enjoy the liveliness of the characters and the music that the group plays. For the OST's, the intro song sounds very cute while the ending song gives a very rocking feeling. Character songs are also very good. The voice actresses sounded really professional and so they executed their roles pretty well. A perfect score for this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\n        Obviously, each character has her own ability, but what is really interesting is their unique traits and their relationship with one another. The main character Yui Hirasawa for me, made the greatest character development because she came from a zero-knowledge girl, to a sensational guitarist of the Keiongaku. Other developments are very nicely done too but there is still more room for improvement. Maybe the 2nd season will match my expectations but as for now, the characters of this anime are very lovable and that is one of the reasons why K-on! has been a huge success for KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n        All of the 12 episodes of this series will keep you laughing all the time! Although this is under the comedy genre, it still has that 'inpirational' feel to it which i think is a very nice addition too. The gags in this series are not lame and everything is very enjoyable: from the animations to the voicing and etc. Everythng is good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\n        Music themed fans as well as average anime viewers will love this one. Personally, I am not a fan of music-themed anime. Today, I am still not a fan but one thing is for sure, I am a certified K-on fan! Aside from very minor graphic discrepancies, this show is very good on its own. Audience will enjoy music-packed comedy for twelve whole episodes PLUS the second season! Got nothing to watch? Try this one!\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helps you guys! Thanks!                     -rizZ06-",

            "content": "K-ON is something special to me.\r\nIt has quite a cute feel and is never sad (Most of the time)\r\nThe story itself is nothing new. Most slice of life animes are like that though. The way it is executed is rather great though. This show never tries to be anything more then what it is and that makes it so enjoyable to me. The characters to me make this story good. The story is pretty much about the highschool light music club. Yui, Mio, Ritsu and Mugi (Azuna comes in half way through the season) all work together to become great musicians. That is pretty muchthe plot. MOVING ON\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise this show is different to me. When i watch slice of life animes i find a character i can relate to. The problem here is all the characters in this show are female. Yet i love every single one of them. They all have their own charm and are all enjoyable on their right. Personal favourites are mio and azuna. Now i think this show does have one problem with its characters that could bother some people. (it personally doesn't bother me) The characters can be rather similar. Yui and Ritsu are pretty much the same and Azuna and Mio are really similar. Mugi is her own thing XD!\\n\\n\r\nI always watch anime that i personally believe have great art. This show is no exception. The art is rather good. It looks great in the performances as well (I never go into much detail on the visual section)\\n\\n\r\nSound or music. Well let me put it to you like this. THE MUSIC IS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!! Every  song in this show is great. They are all catchy and have a fantastic beat even though i don't understand much if any of the words in it XD\\n\\n\r\nI pride myself in enjoyment. I grade heavily on enjoyment because even if a show has a good plot, great characters and great music if i don't enjoy it i won't watch it. Needless to say i love this show. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall K-ON isn't a gem but it has enough great things in it for me to say this. If you enjoy slice of life animes and like music (J-Pop) watch this show\\n\r\nOverall its a 8.5/10 for me",

            "content": "K-On! is the simple story of a girl named Yui, who has no special talents and is a complete klutz. As she enters high school she\u2019s intent on finding a place where she belongs and may excel. What she comes across is the light music club, a tiny group who barely have enough members for the school to allow them to conduct business. She gets to be the guitarist for their band, and from there the series takes us through the lives of these four (later five) girls as they love life and enjoy friendship and occasionally get around to playing music.\r\nOf course, none ofthis is groundbreaking (Kyoto Animation also did the Haruhi Suzumiya series, which has pretty much the same basic plot behind it, though it is completely different in the character and execution department). In fact, the school club thing is a go-to for high school based anime and K-On! is not the first, nor the last to ever use this plot. But it is one of the best examples.\\n\\n\r\nWhat K-On! doesn\u2019t have is much of a story. It\u2019s a slice of life that goes through a year and a half of these girl\u2019s lives in twelve episodes. Of course there\u2019s not much cohesiveness. But each episode is fun as hell to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the series so entertaining is the cast. Very rarely do I commend the character department, but I found not a single bad character in K-On!. I enjoyed every character\u2019s company; some more than others of course, but that\u2019s beside the point.\\n\\n\r\nYui\u2019s journey to learn the guitar and discover herself is fairly compelling, though not what makes K-On! what it is. It\u2019s her interactions with the other members. Mio, the bassist, is a scaredy-cat though very mature and the voice of reason. Ritsu, the drummer, is a wild child and always messing with everyone. Tsumugi on keyboard is the rich and motherly character who also seems to be a fan of yuri. And Azusa, who joins the club as Yui and pals become second years, is the one who actually has ambitions and wants to practice. Put them together, and they are a fun cast of characters who play off of each other really well and never annoy.\\n\\n\r\nMy major problem with K-On! lies in the fact that there is very little music. It\u2019s why I loved Azusa so much, she came into the club and wondered where the hell the music was at and why the hell the girls only seemed to drink tea and eat cake (which, by the way, takes up about two thirds of the show). The very little music that is played is okay, though nothing really catchy. Which is weird considering the song from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which, by the way, was not a music anime) is a lot more memorable and catchy than anything from K-On! Not even the theme song is all that great. The best song in the entire show is the ending, which is fairly catchy. Even then, the lyrics for these songs are God-awful painful. Then again, these are fifteen year old girls, so I guess I can give it a pass.\\n\\n\r\nHigh production values show through in the animation. Vibrant and colorful, the show is a pleasure to look at. The characters are all adorable. The attention to details during the musical sections is amazing (it\u2019s like you\u2019re watching a real person play guitar or play the drums, it\u2019s quite remarkable). Aside from the characters, K-On! definitely has great animation going for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s recap: K-On! has fantastic characters, is surprisingly funny and occasionally heartfelt, has some decent music, and has great animation. It\u2019s truly a treat and a fantastic slice-of-life as long as you don\u2019t mind spending more time drinking tea then actually playing music.",

            "content": "This anime right here, K-ON!, was really good in what it tried to achieve. The first time watching it, I was a bit skeptical whether it would be enjoyable since it was recommended to me by someone,  it  being about girls playing music, I thought it would be a turn off, but  he liked so I went for it. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story is about a typical group of girls that need to join a school club for their curriculum, and when they do join, everything happens besides the intended way to use the club room. The comedy can be a hit-miss forsome people watching it since it depends on character quirks and interactions with a little bit of speech and physical comedy to add. The show can have scenes that can drag on longer than they have to that can bore the one watching it (unless you really like SoL, then no problem for you) but they are only few that should not devalue the whole anime based around that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nWhen I first saw a K-ON! poster, the art instantly caught my eye. This was the first time Kyoto Animation used that particular art style after Lucky Star and since then, it has been similarly used for their other shows. The art goes really well with the atmosphere it presents and with each character looking unique with a certain distinctive feature, it adds to it. The animation is also good and fluid, especially when the band plays their instruments in the show and OP/ED, plus the character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe character voices are always important for an anime, and K-ON! delivers also. All of their voices mirror the personalities of each character which makes them more lovable in my opinion. Ritsu, for example, always sounds cheery and Mio timid but also strong. The music is top tier, being a music SoL, this should be a priority. The OP/ED are really, really good and other songs included in the OST, and it stays consistent with S2 and the movie, Don't Say Lazy being the best (in my opinion) out of all of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nNow this is why I love K-ON!, the characters. We have Yui, the lovable and clueless girl who joins the music club with no experience. Ritsu, the playful and charming girl who loves her drumsticks. Mio, the strong yet timid girl who adores her bass and loves music history. Tsumugi, the ringleader of the cake and tea that has invaded their music activities on a daily basis who likes her keyboard and is apparently rich. And finally Azusa, the underclassman of the group who is most dedicated and serious yet has a soft side for music and snacks who plays the electric guitar. All these characters interacting is what makes this show worth it throughout the show and other season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nK-ON! left a lasting impression when I watched it when it aired and still did when I re-watched. It has funny moments, lighthearted ones and at the end of the journey if you liked it, you will be left wanting more until you realize there will not be a S3. Check it out and feel the magic touch that is K-ON!.\\n",

The story may not please everyone.\r\nArt~ Rated: 10\r\nThe art is definitely a major part in the anime, considering it is so great. All the characters were drawn perfectly and wonderfully.\r\nSound~ Rated: 9\r\nThis being a music anime, you'd think the sound would be good. The music the characters produce may be good, but their voice actors have really outdone themselves. The voices are what won me out inthis category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~ Rated: 10\\n\r\nAll the characters are loveable and adorable. They are awesomely drawn, awesomely thought out, and their personalities are extremely funny. They will win your heart within the first few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~ Rated: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is fun, and will grab your attention from the first few moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall~ Rated: 9\\n\r\nOverall this anime is for all viewers, young and old. The only downfall is that they limit all the characters to girls. If a few boys were added it would be a little better, but overall this is a great anime.",

The 1st couple episodes where the studio should really be putting a lot of time and money into making it look as pristine as possible felt rushed.\r\n     The sound track was a let down as well the Background noise and music wasn't bad. But for a Anime centered more or less around music(Despite what Yui thinks) I was quite disappointed. I would probably listen to almost any other anime's music track before i go to this one.\\n\r\n     The Characters did grow on me despite my best efforts to hate the seemingly endless Cliches. \\n\r\n     The biggest problem that i had with K-on was the pacing, Time skips are abound and you will have your head spinning from the 1st episode. I won't go into much detail, but be forewarned.",

            "content": "K-On! is a show that will not surprise you or make you cry but it is most certainly worth the watch if you are just looking for something casual!\r\nThe series has no distinct story elements that make it stand out, the entire show is essentially a generic Slice of Life / Musical anime with a fantastic premise and soundtrack.\r\nWe start off with our main character, who is quite the airhead, joining the \"Light Music club\" with no musical ability at all, the members of said club convince her to stay despite the lack of music skill and she decides to purchase a guitar and learnsit in a few episodes like some kind of god. From there, the anime introduces the teacher and a few other characters who add to the story overall but nothing special. The characters in this series all have there own traits that make them easy to seperate from one another and are very happy most of the time, but once again, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is crisp and playful at the same time. There is so much emphasis on bringing these characters, the music and there surroundings to life which I have to give Kyoto Animation credit where credit is due. They have shown time and time again with series such as \"Hyouka\" and \"Clannad\" that they can emerge you into an animated world with the great amount of effort that goes into producing each series.\\n\\n\r\nThe tracks \"Cagayake! GIRLS\" (OP) and \"Don't say 'lazy\" (ED), they are very catchy and give you a sense of what you want out of the music that the Light Music Club will play. Sadly, they only play like 2 songs throughout the entire series and they don't live up to the two tracks previously introduced.  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this show to be worth watching despite some of the disappointments it brings. K-On! is a very cute, lighthearted and adventurous series with colorful animation and a good OST. Even though the story and aspects of the characters don't deliver, everything else does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy your tea and cake everyone!",

And this detour from convention is what brings about the comedy and truly touching moments in K-on.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art follows that of a moe anime, especially during comedic scenes. However, the general animation is detailed and serene when it needs to be. This is specifically shown during the opening credits and the intricate details of the band's performances.\r\nSound:\r\nFor an anime focusing on a girl's high school band, the OPand OST of K-on is right up there with the best musical animes. Whether its Fuwa Fuwa Time, U&I or Tenshi ni Fureta, its performed and expresses perfectly the feelings of the characters. I love the fact that when Yui loses her voice in before one performance, you can here the croakiness when she sings backup vocals. Talk about attention to detail!! Furthermore, the voice actresses even learnt their respective characters instruments and performed a live concert which is totally awesome and shows how much work and dedication was put into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are well fleshed out and given a good balance of performance and screen time. Each character brings a different personality to the group and this brings about the conflicts and comedic moments in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI never though I'd get into slice of life or moe anime, but K-on changed that and to this day is still one of the best animes I have ever seen. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh or enjoy pop/punk rock music. Shame they didn't continue the series onto when the girls start university as depicted in the manga.\\n",

            "content": "Let's dive into an anime from a few years ago! K-on! I know many people have seen it but i felt like writing this even though it's from quite a long time ago, well... simply because i wanted to acknowledge this anime in its entirety. If you do happen to read this, i just wanted to let you know my feelings for this show is genuine and not at all biased. Basically my aim for writing this review after the show has aired for so long is simply because like me, there are some people who are only catching up to some old animes afew years after they air and i wanted to let them know how i felt about it.\\n\\n\r\nJust a heads up before we start, but i REALLY LOVE THIS SHOW. It's one of the (if not the only) casual comedic high school slice of life storyline that i've re-watched time and time again. It was also the first actual anime (that i knew of) that i watched before getting into anime. Even when i compared it to some of the other casual anime (especially the newer ones), it stands out as one of my top anime of all time. It's not even an exaggeration to say that if not for this show, i probably would not have bothered delving into the anime world. As usual, i'll try to keep my joy restraints in check and give an honest and unbiased opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLike i said, the show is nothing short of spectacular for me and the story itself is one of the reasons why. There are many reason as to why i gave the story an 8. It's interesting, funny and enjoyable. However, there is one thing that tops everything listed before and that is the portrayal of friendship. The friendship between all the characters in the story is astounding and heartwarming. Given that the roster of characters are small to begin with, the growth of their relationship as friends over the span of 2 seasons are something to be admired and warrant an involuntary smile to anybody who watches it. The best part of it is the friendship is not instantaneous, but instead nurtured ever since the beginning of the first episode until the very last episode which makes the ending episode even more heartbreaking. Of course, the story flow is important as well and boy does it not disappoint. During my viewing of the show, never once had i thought that the show was rushed nor were there any plot lines that were lacking. It was as if you were watching a show where the characters start from the literal beginning and slowly mature along with you, the viewer. Everything in the show is paced orderly and not skipped ahead, or left out to the viewers. Every musical skill and talent, character and personality growth, and overcoming obstacles are tackled in a proceeding fashion alongside the viewer. Not to mention, the comedic value in the show is great in itself, and every flashback story is entertaining and in some cases, touching. This is perhaps everything in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime of that time, the artwork is quite amazing. However, as with all casual anime, albeit amazing, it doesn't really stand out much. So why such a high score given (8) ? Well, here's the thing. The artwork is highly compatible with the music as both complement each other perfectly. With already amazing graphics for a casual anime of 5 to 7 years ago (not sure), the way it works together with the music is really a masterpiece. I would say that both these 2 work together so well, it always creates a very fitting atmosphere for the show. Rainy scenes with relaxing music, or the mischievous tune with playful cutscene. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\n10.... is the highest score i could give. I highly regret not being able to give a higher score for the music and soundtrack deserved way more than a measly score of 10. Let me summarize: Music, epic. Soundtrack, holy goddess of amazing. First impression? Never had a better one. The fine line that always separates perfection and great is the first impression and K-on did an impressive job of that. Every literal song in the show hits me so hard the first time i hear it. From the vocal music to the instrumental music, every one of them felt different and gives off a different kind of joy and pleasure to my ears. From a fast playful tune, to the rainy solemn peaceful music, from the light and jumpy music to the rock and fast paced jam, all of them were enjoyable. And the way it complements the artwork gives it even more of a bonus! Sure, most other shows have great music too, BUT the only difference is that K-on had a much higher impact on first impressions than the others do. A very fine example of this would be Love Live. Love Live is one of the most popular series ever made, and one of the most popular idol band to date. I love all the Love Live songs too but it took some getting used to before favoritism unlike K-on which became an instant like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the show, then you wouldn't even need to read this to know why it got a 10. All of the characters are extremely likeable and adorable. One thing i wanted to talk about though and that is the connection of friendship bond between the characters. The bonds of friendship between the five main characters are no joke as the developers made them and created the story such that every character has an interwoven interaction and bond between one another. It's not just 2 pairs of best friends or flimsy and simple friendships. Throughout the whole 2 seasons, there have been episodes that illustrated how every character feels about one another, even the characters who seem to have no relation to the other. There are even some episode that are dedicated to deepening the bonds between two seldom interacted characters, resulting in interweaving the bonds between all of them even tighter, making them more than just close friends, but portraying them as a family. Of course, the personality and development of each character is extremely well balanced, so that no one outshines the other. All in all, this show has an extremely good character balancing along with story character growth and development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, after all the things above said and done, i really enjoy watching this show as it fills me with waves of emotions every time. With great plot, art, and epic music and character, i highly recommend you to watch it if you are a fan of music, comedy genre. Even if you are not and just want a good anime to start off your otaku life. I still recommend this. Give it a try, i promise you won't regret it ;)",

            "content": "4 Girls in High School start a band...what's not to love???\r\nSo K-On! is our journey into Sakura High, where the \"Light Music Club\" is in need of a guitarist. Yui, who wasn't expecting any of this from the club, suddenly finds herself in a band and cranking out tunes on her lovely Gibson Les Paul. \r\nThe story arc is there, unlike some SoL comedies, so that was a big plus for this one. It does a great job of balancing out the main story with happenings and little side stories that add to character development. It's also a fairly good pace since everything being aboutband struggles would make the story go stale kind of quick (been there, done that). Some of the tropes used in all animes are there, but the show is masterful at how/why they find themselves in these locales. A rehearsal space that's at a beach house is much better than just \"Lets go to the beach because...reasons!!\" as an excuse to see the girls in bikinis. It has the common elements, but with enough of a twist to make them more believable. \\n\\n\r\nArt was pretty good, but seeing more of the girls playing along with the music would have been nice. It was cool when it did happen, but on a few scenes you felt kinda slided when they would skip the performance. It's not a super big gripe, but I felt it detracted enough from the show to mention it. The instruments all look great and the music videos are so cheesy that they are just freakin awesome....but I'll save that for another section. \\n\\n\r\nSound...the acting and of all things the FREAKIN MUSIC is AWESOME in this anime! Yeah, the OP is a little poppy, but a lot of the songs have a kick to them and are well-composed. I would argue that the ending theme \"Don't Say Lazy\" is perhaps one of the coolest songs from an anime I've ever heard (even better than \"Between You and Me\" from Kuragehime, my previous favorite). To get off that for a moment, the voice acting seemed pretty good in the sub (which I opted to watch instead of the dub). The girls personality and cadence shines through despite the language barrier for me, so it makes the sub pretty enjoyable to watch. I'd highly recommend skipping the dub on this one, not sure how they handled the songs they performed, but that may be interesting to watch (I'm guessing they just did them in Japanese). The song titles are hysterical as well (My Love is a Stapler!!), but I can't talk enough about how much I like \"Don't Say Lazy\", just do yourself a favor and jam out to it when you get a chance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were neat and enjoyable, though the mix on some of their personalities seemed to be strange choices (Mio is a scaredy cat?). I really thought the dynamic was fine from the get-go with all the girls, but later on Azusa seemed to be a pretty useless addition IMO. She's kind of mousy and quiet like Mio, but without as much focus on success or artistic brooding. They tried to take Mio and mix her with some Yui moe elements, but it feels like she gets in the way all the time. Why mess with something that already works? It's like making Pinky and the Brain and Larry...all you are adding is more characters for a couple of moe jokes that just felt useless. Every time I look for merchandise, I always want it with just the original 4 girls. Azusa aside, all the other side characters seemed to fit and felt natural. I'm a bassist so I think Mio is cool, but I really do like all the girls (except Azusa). \\n\\n\r\nThis show totally deserves a perfect score on enjoyment from me. The music is great, the stories and jokes are enjoyable too. The band elements and musical jokes/references make it all the more entertaining for me since I play bass and guitar as well. I'm sure the story arc has been done before, but it felt more unique than many of the SoL comedies I've seen before so it was a welcome change of pace. You get excited to watch the show and it makes me want to pick up my bass or guitar afterwards and jam!! Definitely puts me in a good mood. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a great show, definitely worth watching if you are into SoL comedies and a MUST see if you are a musician in any capacity. Get ready for the songs to be stuck in your head for days on end, but the thing is you enjoy having them in there! I'd say the only negatives are the performances they skip in the show and the addition to Azusa which I felt was the big blow to this anime. Without Azusa being in there, I would have given this show a 10 overall, which I don't give out lightly. She'd make a better side character or perhaps a fill-in or sub for Yui in an episode or two, but making her a main character just felt like dead weight. It's a shame, I really wanted to give this show a 10. Don't let that keep you from watching it though, I loved it so much that I bought a t-shirt!!",

            "content": "After reading different reviews about this anime, I prepared myself for the worst. Like no story, no interesting characters, no logic or morale, only fan-service moe and kawaii. It, of course, true in some ways, but completely untrue in others. \r\nI do not see much anime of this type (or any other) and do not truly understand what moe means, so I write about my fillings on this anime with regular words.\r\nFirst of all, this anime can cheer you up and calm you down after hard work, or even motivate you for doing what you want. And yes I am talking about K-On. Still, itis mostly kawaii and moe (whatever it means), so not everybody will notice anything else, except cuteness of anime.\\n\\n\r\n==Story==\\n\r\nAll anime is about four (five) schoolgirls who love to drink tea with cake after school studies. And it is all. Oh, no, they also play in school music band, but mostly it is tea. There is no story and the whole season, and mostly there is no story at one episode either. It just events which can happen in school. No hard conflicts to resolve, no unsolved mystery to find out, no high goal to reach. Is it bad? Not for this anime. Girls just flow with events around them and give us their happiness and love. The story is not needed here, so let's go on.\\n\\n\r\n==Characters==\\n\r\nThey are great! It is generic characters, but that is not bad either. Absolutely naive and cheerful Yui, serious and fragile Mio, vigorous Ritsu and so kindness Mugi. Part of all of them live inside everybody (and this is good parts), and in this anime, they just divided into different persons. It is fun to looking on their mutual study and entertainment. \\n\\n\r\n==Music and art==\\n\r\nI love OP and ED really much. (ED - is best motivation song of the last time). Also, there is decent music on their scene appearance. For me it's enough, but it is hard to notice that anime is about music club. \\n\\n\r\nArt - is good, I like this simple drawing. Simple but effective. \\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nWhy did I enjoy this show so much? Because it fit to the real world. It's an ideal world where is no problem, and lady luck is at your side, it is the world where you dream can become true, people around are kind and ready for help. It looks so different to the real one, but it not unconnected at all. This anime make you believe, that real world is not so bad, and it really is. You can have some dream to follow, as heroes of anime do, and you always can had some tea and sweets with friends. There is no need to bury you child ambition and beliefs, sometimes it help to become happy. And this anime dig out this childish out of you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to everybody, and my score is little overrated, but this is my filling for this anime.\\n",

It's a good anime, its funny, its colourful, it's well animated and even the English dub is decent. \r\n And its about music, its about girls playing different instruments and singing songs, so people who enjoy music would find appeal in this anime.\r\nBut character wise, each girl can easilybe described within the first few moments of meeting/seeing them and you can guess the stereotypes they represent, which I admit was a little disappointing, but with High School anime styled comedies I admit they used these types of characters very well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were moments where I found episodes somewhat pointless.

I felt great unease while watching the first episode and the only reason I continued watching was because I'd already downloaded all the rest as well. At first it just felt like I'm not meant to watch this thing - now that I'm done with it, I feel a bit like Azusa after she joined the light music club, thinking \"This isn't for me, what's with all the cuddling and being cute and childish\"...my opinion has changed as well as hers.\r\nThe animation quality didn't seem that great when I first got into theshow (compared to Haruhi for example), but later on I started thinking it was perfect. I don't know if that's also a matter of adjusting or if the animation quality really increased exponentially as the show progressed. As for the music and voicing, it's extraordinary. Every character has a lovely distinct voice and every single song has gotten into my daily playlist. There isn't much to the plot but I guess the creators of this anime were going for that \"light\" feel here as well; let's just say it certainly is original for the most part and enough to keep you glued to the screen till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON! may seem simple at first but trust me, it's an acquired taste. The more you watch it the more you like it. I'm not the type of guy to watch something like this and I was still smiling in an odd, benevolent way throughout the show, watching it was pure joy.",

            "content": "This show is all about girls in high school.  It is mildly humorous, in fact just enough so to keep me watching through both seasons 1 and 2 -- 41 episodes in all.  It is mostly light drama about relationships and funny anecdotes from high school days. The story is entirely about a group of girls and their friends; there are no male characters other than an incidental teacher or shop-keeper throughout the entire series.  There is no romance whatsoever either, and  it has no ecchi or fan service at all.\r\nI liked the characters, but the story was very weak, inthe sense that there were no serious dramatic moments at any point.  It was almost entirely slice-of-life.  If you want something very light to watch to fall asleep to, this one is not half-bad, but it won't be winning any dramatic achievement awards.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is an OVA movie, that movie takes place after the end of the second season.  Watch it last.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nWell as stated before, the story is basic and simple. When the show was still to air, all that they gave us was just 1 or 2 short sentences on the story and premise of what K-On was going to be. I thought that it was clever since it engages viewers to find out more about it. But actually, there was nothing more to it than that! The story wasn\u2019t really a strong point of K-On, since this was generally just a heartwarming, cute and entertaining show. The basic premise was good, but it wasn\u2019t something new and original.\r\nRating: 7/10\r\n\u201cNice story plot, but it couldhave been more original and better.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation:\\n\r\nI loved the art used in K-On! Definitely one of the highlights of the show. The character designs were also the ones who designed the characters of Kannagi, which I loved as well. The art is definitely unique and is something you don\u2019t see in your average anime, which was great. The backdrop was nothing special, but it definitely was nicely done and suited the show. My only concern was that the animations near the end of the show (at Episode 12 to be exact) were bad. What\u2019s more, it definitely screwed up when they were performing at Episode 12, but it was nothing major.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\r\n\u201cCute and lovable designs that are unique. The animation started to get rusty near the end which took resulted in it not getting a perfect 10.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nK-On was very entertaining and engaging. It definitely cracked me up and the lovely characters definitely was one of the reasons. Kudos to Yui\u2019s voice who is also new to the industry and excelled amazingly as Yui. I thoroughly enjoyed watching K-On and it isn\u2019t something to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\r\n\u201cNice and heartwarming and thoroughly enjoyable.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 25 / 30\\n\r\n\u201cK-On is definitely something not to be forgotten. Its quirky characters and lovely art was something to look forward to in every episode. A great show and is recommended to everyone, especially those looking for a laugh and moe characters!\u201d\\n",

How I found out about it is kinda funny I suppose, but that's a story for another time.\r\nK-On has some really funny moments in it that make up for the lack of a clear story. What got me hooked was the character Mio Akiyama. You might say that I have the most strange love for her, and it's true. The moe-ness of K-ON is almost unbeatable. I challenge anyone to find an anime that is funny, has great music, has lovable characters, and a kickass set of voice actors, both dub and origina Japanese. Icannot get enough of it!

            "content": "I loved this show. There's no other way to say it. From the characters, humor and its story line or should I put it more \"sequence of events that lead to a bang\". I remember seeing this show on ABC3 once and it was this totally random episode, not going to lie I didn't like it. Therefore I sort of told myself never to see this anime. I know I know, I never usually do that. I was being stupid, so I gave it a go. And I can't wait to see season 2 which I heard was much better than season 1. This animecould possibly become my favourite anime, just from the quality of season 1. The very first episode I thought was actually a brilliant introduction to this show. You might not get the appeal at first, but throughout the first few episodes you do. This show felt very real. The setting, the character designs and just scenes in the anime, felt so natural. This show is fun and comes with such enjoyment. One thing I like about this anime is high lack of fan service. Not to say I don't mind service (I don't like girls haha so I could care less) this is honestly one of the first anime slice of life/comedy that I've been able to take really seriously. The studio bought these characters to life, treating them is respectfully pleasing way. its just awesome enjoying the anime so much and not rolling my eyes at random unneeded fans service thrown in my face. If this anime does use fan service, it uses it very very rarely and often it is needed for the team members to react to. The only complaint I have about this anime, is that sometimes the main character could get really irritating, but with development she becomes more serious. I could go on and on about the depth of this anime, but I'm just going to end it with a.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

            "content": "Basically this show is like a cleaner version of beck with all girls and more comedy. It centers around our ditsy main female character Yui. She is trying to decide what club to join in her school. All of the others that she's looked at weren't really her thing. They either required to much work, or were complex things that she couldn't understand. \n\tAs you can tell Yui is a really lazy girl. The only thing she works hard at is eating really, and of course guitar later on. Being this kind of girl, I wassurprised to see her voiced by Stephanie Sheh (I watched the dubbed). Mainly because a lot of the roles she has been in (that I've seen) have been quiet, and shy girls. Like Hinata from Naruto, or Orohime from Bleach. So seeing her voice a more outgoing character was a new experience. However, she pulled it off better than I thought she would so I was happy.\\n\\n\n\tYui then decides to join the \u201cLight Music club\u201d thinking that their name meant that they played light music. Because apparently she play this...clicking type instrument, which it's name I'm spacing on, back when she was younger. However after joining she finds that not to be the case.\\n\\n\n\tDesperate for members, as well as a guitar player, the club is still one short after Tsumugi joins, they are ecstatic when Yui shows up. However Yui had planned to quit right away, so when the other three members all were showering her with gratitude and sweets. It made it really hard for Yui to quit. However, after confessing that that was her purpose in coming here. She does end up joining after the three tell her that they will help her learn guitar.\\n\\n\n\tThe whole show is basically about how the four grow as a band members and friends, along with gaining recognition at there school. There are hardships along the way, but they all manage to work there way through it. The comedy in this is also something that will have you rolling on the floor laughing at some points.\\n\\n\n\tPlus, if you have seen my anime list. I've seen almost every romantic comedy ever made. So watching this show, as it doesn't have romance, was a tough choice. However I did, and I was not disappointed. This show is definitely in my top 10 now.\\n\\n\n\tCons of the show: These are the problems I have with K-On! First of all, my biggest problem was how quickly Yui learned the guitar. In one of the episodes she played a solo out of nowhere, completely throwing me off. I have played guitar for almost three years now, but I still could never play that solo that she played. Not to mention how Ui was able to play it when Yui was sick, like she had been playing for a long time. All I'm saying is the guitar is harder to learn than this show makes it out to be. I know. If you want a show that show's it more accurately than watch Beck.\\n\\n\n\tMy only other con is one that bothers me every episode, and that is Tsumugi's eyebrows....yea okay not really a con, but they still freak me out.\\n\\n\n\tStory (9) Not to original, but It is played out really well none the less. About a band working together to make it big, along with everyone's problem's. I know I've mentioned Beck a lot in this, but that's because It's the only other show I've watched like this. It does follow Beck's storyline pretty close, except for the fact that Beck is looking for recognition in the world. K-On is looking for recognition in just there school pretty much, along with gaining more club members. If you like lighthearted comedy's that like to have fun with music, and not take it too seriously. Than K-On! Is better for you than Beck.\\n\\n\n\tCharacters (10) The characters in this is what make the show what it is. Each character is unique in their own way. Mio with her shyness, and her fear of just about everything. Ritsu with her crazy antics, and childish manner. Yui with her....ok Yui is a lot like Ritsu actually. Except for Yui is really lazy. Tsumugi with her awkward love for girl's interacting with another, and fascination with simple things. And Azusa (band member that comes later after seeing the club play live) with her desire to work the club harder at their music, along with her cute antics that are forced upon her by the other members, mainly Yui.\\n\\n\n\tThough some characters can be pretty cliche, but honestly who cares. If you like it than why does it matter if it's already been done. After all, you can't just eat one potato chip out of the bag can you?...Did that make sense?...I think it did.\\n\\n\n\tSound (10) I've never really know how to judge sound by. Is it for the music that plays in the background? The emotion that is felt throughout the show? Or the voice actors, and sounds of objects in the show? Whatever it is I don't know, but I'm going to make sound the music in this, as It's a show about music.\\n\\n\n\tEvery song in this show is really catchy. Though, many of them have some pretty bizarre lyrics. But, since the songs aren't in English themselves, I'm ok with that. My favorite song is definitely the ending song for the first season. I would watch it every episode, It never got old for me.\\n\\n\n\tAnimation/Art (8): The way I see it is there are four kind's of animation. There is simple and cute, simple and ugly, complex and beautiful, and complex and overdone. This show is of course the simple and cute one. It's not amazing animation, but it's a really cute one. Nothing unique about it, but I still really like it. Another similar animation that comes to mind when I think about it is \u201cLove, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions.\u201d Though Chunibyou is more closer to the complex and beautiful, they are very similar in style.\\n\\n\n\tEnjoyment (10): I freaking enjoy this anime more than eating Pocky while playing Soul Calibur. It's definitely something that I would recommend to anyone who likes the lighthearted show's with lots of comedy. Even if your not a music fan, I'm sure that you will still enjoy this show. I'm a music guy though, so that's why I love it so much.\\n\\n\n\tOverall (10) Technically it get's a 9.4/10 which rounds down to a 9, but I just think it deserves a 10. Judge me if you will, but that's what I say.",

The music that they played in the anime itself was great, these songs were likeeveryday normal songs some of them were funny and all plus the openings and endings were amazing as well they were well made for this particular type of anime so over all i would say that from what i thought in the beginning about this anime that it might be lame and all i have to take it all back its on my top 10 now one of my all times favorites!!!!  =P",

Later on she joined Keion (light music) club, and began her carefree life with her classmates, practicing guitar and eating puddings. \r\nAt this age, there are perhaps hundreds of animes about \"cute girls doing cute things\". Among them, K-ON! already seems old and rather mediocre. Still, it's done pretty decently. \r\nThe whole series feels laid-back, bother-free of reality. I should say I rather dislike this mood. (I would say Love Live is better in this term) But it does have two more realistic girls, and I like them. And, if you are seeking thisparticular mood in the first place, you probably won't find it disappointing. Indeed, those realistic elements add flavor to the interaction of 5 girls as well as whole enjoyment for audience. \\n\r\nI've heard that KyoAni was in lack of money when they made this, so no wonder its art quality, although good, is not as good as other KyoAni series. Yet its simplistic drawing style gives a particular feeling, blended with its general mood. (sort of like Lucky Star)\\n\r\nThe songs are pretty enjoyable to listen, especially the op and ed, really cool. \\n\r\nIf you like slice of life shows with a little reference to reality (by reality, I actually mean the harshness of life), you should definitely check this popular series.",

It's so fun and so very cute!\r\nI enjoyed the dubbed version, despite the criticism it receives- I think the voices matched the characters very well. This anime is outstanding mostly because of the relationships the girls were able to develop.  Not only that but you can't help but love them. \r\nRitsu and Mio are already friends in the beginning but you can see their bond grow as well as with the other girls. Yui is the cutest character ever, she gets distracted and she just finds ways to keep them all together even thoughshe messes up more often than not. \\n\\n\r\nThe only flaws in this anime was that their parents were always gone- for the entire anime. I mean, that happens in a lot of animes but, c'mon, do their parents really like travelling more than seeing their daughters grow up? (mainly referring to Ui and Yui).\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end I cried my eyes out- it was just so perfect. I really recommend this anime if you're into Hetalia or perhaps Lucky Star, because even though there is a plot, it moves very slow and some episodes are random- but you get used to it!!",

            "content": "\"Fun things are fun!\"\r\n--Yui Hirasawa\r\n((Reviewer's Note: This is a review that only discusses the first season of K-On! There are mild to moderate spoilers below the fold, you have been warned.))\r\nK-On! is a show that everyone, whether they have seen it or not, is very quick to form an opinion on. It was perhaps the culmination of the \"moe\" trend in anime, pioneered specifically by the creative minds at Kyoto Animation, into practically the formation of its own genre in 2009. KyoAni was riding high on the success of Haruhi Suzumiya's first season in the late 2000s, and specifically the most iconic scene in theseries, the epic rock concert at the end of episode 12. So why not adapt a four-panel manga series about a bunch of cute girls learning to play in a rock band? And thus, K-On! the anime was born, and the rest is history.\\n\\n\r\nWhere K-On really excels as a show is in the very close attention to detail that comes out in every frame. The characters are drawn cutely but with a dose of realism. Their body types are rather normal for a high-school girl. Their uniforms are regulation-length. The fanservice is kept to a minimum, and what is there makes sense within the events of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization can make or break slice-of-life shows. Characters you want to see on screen can overcome a lack of any driving plot structure. K-On manages to make its characters engaging, lovable, and always fun to watch. You could put these five girls in just about any situation and the results would be something worth your time. The characters also evolve and change, none more than the presumptive main heroine, Yui Hirasawa. \\n\\n\r\nYui starts off the show as someone who might be charitably called \"attention-deficient\" and might uncharitably be called \"an idiot\". Over time, as she joins the Light Music Club and gets closer to the rest of the girls passing their time in the small, somewhat cramped club room, a change begins to take place over her, and it happens so carefully and with such subtlety that by the time you notice it you'll be done with the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girls all complement each other in a variety of different ways, and scenes play out very differently depending on who is there. Tsumugi Kotobuki is a wealthy girl with a heart of absolute gold. Mio Akiyama is a big scaredy-cat and doesn't enjoy being in the limelight no matter how often the girls press her to embrace her role as the face of the band. Ritsu Tainaka is a troublemaker and riffs off the other girls effortlessly, and her comedic portions are perhaps tied with Yui's coming-of-age as the best part of this first season. Very late in the season we are introduced to Azusa Nakano, a kouhai to the other girls who joins the Light Music Club. Unfortunately, she doesn't get much characterization in the five short episodes she's in. She actually comes across as incredibly redundant since her attitude is a little too similar to Mio and her instrument of choice is the same as Yui's. \\n\\n\r\nThe flaws with Azusa's introduction didn't detract much from the characterization of the group as a whole. They all get closer. They all learn from each other. They're all great friends, and one of the big themes of K-On is that your friends can make you something better than you are by yourself. A lot of people like to rag on the show for being \"not about music\" but it was never about four girls playing music. It was always about four girls growing closer with music as the excuse for them to hang out after school. The music is the backdrop, not the main attraction.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the few songs that are in the show are a great treat. Light, poppy, fun little ditties that absolutely will get stuck in your head long after you've finished watching. The OP and ED are both fantastic visually and aurally, with \"Don't Say Lazy\" probably being one of the most iconic EDs of the past decade. The background music is solid, and the sound direction is on-point, with great use of silence to focus the viewer's attention during the serious parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nK-On is far from perfect, however, as the 7 atop this review will attest. The actual plot of the show, as much as there is one, is really stock and won't take anyone by surprise. There is the unfortunate fact that two out of the 13 episodes of the show take place at the beach, and the second one feels like a rehash of the first. As mentioned above, Azusa is introduced so late into the season that it's hard to grow attached to her as much as the original four, and her attitude comes across as needlessly tsundere in a show where it just feels out of place. The art is consistent and solid, but doesn't really go out of its way to strive for any real great effects outside of the great attention to detail. It's just not to the standard I've come to expect from KyoAni, even for its age. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-On's first season is a fun ride, a solid, strong introduction to some great characters becoming something greater than they were at the start through the power of music, snacks, and love. I enjoyed it, and little did I know that the best was very much yet to come.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is a story for another time. Until next time, may the cute things in your life always have cute girls to do them.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: K-on! Is often cited as the definitive \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d show, and on that end, it certainly delivers.\r\nThe show follows four high school girls who form an amateur rock band and learn to play.  The four main characters all have distinct personalities and quirks, and it can be a lot of fun watching them goof around.  Yui is an over-grown child, fun-loving, na\u00efve and easily distracted, but in the rare moments she manages to focus, her energy and passion is inspiring.  Mio is the brains of the group, keeping the less dedicated girls on task, but herauthoritarian attitude is at odds with her self-doubt and constant fits of panic.  Ritsu is the cavalier and irreverent tom-boy, perpetually teasing Mio.  Mugi, the rich girl, is the most soft-spoken member of the group, but she has an inquisitive nature and a desire for personal accomplishment that separates her from the clich\u00e9 of the rich, spoiled brat.  While the characters are exaggerated, they each have a certain emotional depth, and play off each other quite well.\\n\r\nWhile there is quite a bit of slapstick, some of the comedy is surprisingly subversive and original.  The series opens with our heroine running late for the first day of school.  I flat-out rolled my eyes as she dashed down the street, obligatory toast in mouth, facing numerous delays before bursting into school\u2026 and immediately realizing that she misread the clock, and wasn\u2019t late at all.  Realizing how badly my own cynicism and knowledge of clich\u00e9s had misled me, I had no choice but to laugh, both at the cleverness of the gag, and at myself.\\n\r\nThe central goal of the rock band the girls form gives the show more direction than some Slice of Life series have, though this also can make it a bit frustrating that more time isn\u2019t spent on the advancement of the band.  Appropriate to a series about a band, the music is very well done.  The opening theme has a peculiar blend of heavy metal and J-POP, with a driving, energetic beat that is sure to get stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: While the comedy is usually pretty solid, the show makes a running gag of Mio having constant emotional break-downs, and this is honestly more uncomfortable to watch than it is funny.  There are also a few rather Haruhi Suzumiya-esque molestation jokes, but these are kept comparatively mild and infrequent.  While the music is catchy, the lyrics are pretty vapid, and the soundtrack is rather limited.  None of these, however, are the biggest problem I have with the series.\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with this series?  No lesbian make-out sessions.\\n\r\n\u2026I\u2019m being serious.  Wait, don\u2019t close the review yet, I\u2019m going somewhere with this, I promise!\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something supremely unsatisfying about a show where everyone is obviously gay, and yet no-one is allowed to have an explicit gay relationship.  There\u2019s little excuse for this kind of timidity when Sailor Moon gave us an out-and-out lesbian relationship all the way back in the freakin\u2019 90\u2019s.  \\n\r\nIf the series\u2019 homoerotic overtones were played purely for comedy and fanservice, I think I\u2019d be able to forgive the lack of relationships, but K-on! tries to have it both ways, playing lesbian attractions for drama without actually admitting that said lesbian attractions exist.  Episode 11 centers around Mio spending time with Nadoka (a girl in her class) and Ritsu becoming jealous as a result.  Ritsu tries to hide her feelings, playing around and teasing Mio as usual, but her jibes are noticeably more mean-spirited and unnatural.  The other girls notice that something is wrong, and make anxious, desperate efforts to lighten the mood and continue their practice session.  Ultimately, these efforts fail, and Ritsu leaves in frustration and disgust, claiming she can\u2019t play today.  After getting to know the characters, this is a genuinely painful scene to watch.  It\u2019s obvious that Ritsu has feelings for Mio, and equally obvious that she needs to come out and express those feelings.  And at the end of the episode, she just, sort of\u2026 doesn\u2019t.  Her feelings of jealousy magically go away, and the show continues like nothing ever happened.  Mio spends some time with Ritsu caring for her while she\u2019s sick, which is sweet, but neither of them makes any kind of meaningful approach towards the other.\\n\r\nSo\u2026 why not?  Why, after the obvious emotional turmoil and build-up does the series fail to deliver any kind of meaningful emotional climax?  Are the writers simply afraid of screwing up the show\u2019s dynamic by introducing a romantic subplot?  It seems a bit odd that they would display that level of attachment to the status quo when they introduced a new major character half-way through the series.  It almost feels like the show is fetishizing homosexuality, portraying homosexuality as something too taboo and naughty to be portrayed openly. \\n\r\nWhile K-on! succeeds as a slice-of-life comedy, it squanders its own potential by refusing to admit the relationships it teases.  While I enjoyed the characters and came to care about their struggles, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that they emotionally fenced-in by their own writers.  While it\u2019s not a bad show, I don\u2019t recommend anyone rush it to the top of their \u201cTo-Watch\u201d list, either.  If you want a light-hearted comedy about cute, gay schoolgirls, go watch Sakura Trick instead.  The music isn\u2019t as great, but it also doesn\u2019t keep its lesbians suffocating in the closet for thirteen episodes.\\n",

            "content": "[Contains mild spoilers]\r\nAt first glance, K-On could easily come across as just another cute anime about cute girls doing cute things. But what makes K-On rise where lesser anime fall, is in the way it tells its story.\r\nA commonly used trope in modern comedy is to create a static world and fill it with dynamic characters. This means that the humor then has to come from individual situations, since the world as a whole never changes or develops. A perfect example of this is The Simpsons, where the crazy adventures always are forgotten by the next episode. The world resets.\r\nThis is where K-On differs inthe best way possible. It doesn't let story suffer because of situational comedy; instead it lets the comedy serve the story. Every skit always seem to have a purpose in driving the plot forward. A good example of this is when the girls band together (pun intended) to earn enough money to buy a guitar. Sure, a lot of situational sillyness occurs during that scene; but because the story calls for the girls to get money, it doesn't feel like a sketch or a throwaway gag. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, with that being said, K-On's story really is a silly and light hearted one; which means that if it focused too much on the plot it would come across as taking itself too seriously. So it's all about finding that sweetspot between comedy and plot; and boy did K-On find it!\\n\\n\r\nI would also say that the character development in K-On is extremely realistic. A common criticism aimed at shows such as this one is that \"nothing happens\". And granted, every episode just seems to be about the girls sitting around drinking tea all day. \"Where's the story?! Where's the plot progression?!\", I hear you say with your voice filled with critique and elitism. \\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing, the fact that nothing seems to progress IS what makes it so realistic. Real life progression sneaks up on you. If you were to compare yourself with you from two months ago, I bet you wouldn't find a whole lot of differences. Same goes for you from two months ago and you from four months ago, and so on. And yet, I'm convinced that if you were to compare yourself with you from a year ago, he or she would seem like a completely different person. \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for K-On. Just because you didn't notice the changes, doesn't mean they didn't happen. If you compare the first and final episode of the series, you'll notice that a lot of things has changed. Four charachters that started out as complete strangers would now die for each other, and a charachter that had never played guitar in her entire life now rocks it out on stage in front of a huge audience. Where's the story? where's the plot progression? Well, it's right in front of you, just open your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nK-On isn't The Simpsons. The world never resets and the humor is never pointless. The world is dynamic and the characters have memory. And most important of all, it ends on a completely different note than it started on; without ever failing to entertain. This is why K-On is a great experience. \\n",

            "content": "K-On! Tea-parties, light-music and the most hopeless bunch of high-school girls. K-On! had only one mission, live up to my expectations after hearing so much from the community. Somehow it did just as well, and established another classic from our decade of anime.\r\nWhether you are especially here for the moe ambiance, or some music fanatic the average anime viewer must have seen or heard about this series.\r\nLet's start point by point the critic, of course positive, of this delicate anime.\r\nStory (7) :\r\nFor the story part, it doesn't especially stand out. When it comes to aligning school and slice-of-life there is no much more to add,moreover most anime of those two genres are your cliched kind of road ; summer vacation, training camp, fireworks, clubtime, beach...\\n\r\nGetting to the point, if it scores that high it is thanks to the storyline, that actually semi-exists, and the almost stand-alone nature of each episode.\\n\r\nBonus is it actually has an end, after the second season, and some satisfying one.\\n\r\nOverall, the deed that we saw the progression of the music-light club is really settling nicely the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) :\\n\\n\r\nSolid artworks, there was nothing to say more. K-On! has many points that makes him do that high : its 1080p quality is the best quality I've yet to see in an anime (and most screen devices can't support higher), there was no CG or I don't recall every scenes, and I would approve if there are dancing scenes. In spite of all the scenes during the concert (or concerts?) are of good realization, especially the light kind of effects who are just fine.\\n\r\nSpecial mention for the moe character design !\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) :\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is of quality, because it made it through my playlist. Can we really congratulate this rating on a music genre anime, that I don't know, for it needs a certain quality. Overall I'm not peculiarly fan of the light-music genre, but maybe it's big in Japan.\\n\r\nSound effects must be fine, right? But I bet the soundtrack isn't all that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7) :\\n\\n\r\nEvery character of the band is nicely introduced during the course of the first episodes, they all have their personalities explained and the basis of the comedy gags. So why do I love more Tainaka Ritsu than any other character?\\n\r\nOther than that, there isn't peculiarly one character being '-dere' or else, so it's a big-up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) :\\n\\n\r\nIt had this special mission to kill my time, but it gave me some more, and stayed as one of my five favorite anime for quite some time. Of course, because it included kind of this shoujo-ai feel, being school-life and slice of life and as well an hilarious comedy.\\n\r\nAs it respected every genre it wanted to be, did not take himself seriously, was highly entertaining, it really deserves more than this rating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) :\\n\\n\r\nReally delicate and tender series to watch, hilarious and makes the time fly by. If one ever consider to recommend you this anime, then do so, at least for it being some really big classic.\\n\r\nFor those pleased with shoujo-ai, moe, school-life or simply comedy, this established series will wrap up your expectations and, as if it was a sandwich, slip himself down your throat (or here your eyes, and your ears, finally getting through your brain).\\n\r\nAfter this little anatomy lesson I feel like adding, that Tainaka Ritsu is some tomboy best girl of a kind.

            "content": "Ten years ago, on April 3rd 2009 an anime started to air in Japan that rocked your socks off with it's intro song (and ending song), while also tons of people have gotten moe diabetes. That's right, I'm talking about K-On! I remember very well that I took a long time distance from this anime just because back then I just didn't liked the Slice of Life genre in general because in my point of view back then the SoL genre was nothing but just plain boring. Back then I was 20 years old and I was in a huge crippling depression because of persoalreasons and felt the need to be an edgy internet troll just to feel a bit better about myself on a dating webstite that was well known among youngsters that served as purpose as a MySpace for people living in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, I do remember my very first time watching this anime when I finally gave this anime a chance because I was mainly bored out of my mind couple only about a year ago. After watching K-On! for the very frst time, it was set in stone; I've become a 'moe-blob'. Now I'm finally writing this review after a rewatch to celebrate it's 10th birthday. Incase you haven't heard of K-On! because you were living under a rock the past 10 years, no it's not a drug. Well, technically it could be classified a hard-drug that gives you the 'moe diabetes' but that's a differnt story. Anyway, happy birthday K-On!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nThe story begins with a young girl named Yui Hirasawa that's attenting high school for the very first time. Yui is a little adorable careless girl with her head into the clouds. She doesn't really have any goals in life, yet she somehow joins the light music club in her school. The story is not really about the music itself, but instead we get to see how Yui's new friends she made interact with each other while the light music club grows as a band, but also as a group of friends. The anime itself is very mundane to watch and is perfect for anyone that likes the idea of cute anime girls doing cute things, procrastinating, drinking tea, eating cake and sometimes music.\\n\\n\r\nArt-style: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nFor an anime that's already 10 years old the art-style is still wonderfull to this day and very pleasant for the eye. But then again, it's coming from Kyoto Animation. The faces and expressions are very well detailed so you have no problem in what kind of emotion your charather is having. Background art is pleasant for the eye, which also counts for the animation, which should come as no surprise. The quality is noticable, since we know that KyoAni pays their workers on salary, instead of by the drawing unlike many other studio's, so it's not really a suprise KyoAni does so well in the anime industry compaired with other studio's.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nIf you like rock-like music and/or J-pop, your heart and/or ears will go 'doki doki'. The voice acting is wonderfull done and the voice acting was done great. The opening song rocked my socks off the first time I heard it and the ending song 'Don't Say Lazy' made me burst into tears the first time I heard/read it. Oh, and the bockground music, well, some of them are very earwormy as well. Just to let you know. If you're wondering, my favorite background music would be \"Pinch Daisuki\" because it's so catchy, cute and earwormy and is in my opinion the most memorable background jingle out there. I admit I sometimes whistle some songs from this anime while doing my job in real life. They are that enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nI guess it's now time to introduce you a bit more about the charathers. First of all to start, we have Ritsu. Ritsu is the energetic tomboy of the show. Ritsu plays the drums and is also the club president. Then we have Mio. Mio is Ritsu's long time friend with a cute 'tsundere' vibe that's serves mainly as the song writer of the group and plays the bass guitar. Mio also gets easily embarrassed by gross things like ghosts and barnacles. Then we have Tsumugi aka. \"Mugi\" that plays the keyboard. She comes from a wealthy family. Lucky for us, she doesn't have a spoiled rich kid attitute unlike in real life, but she's also a very gentle young girl. Last but not least, we have Yui. Personally my favorite if I have to choose. But I already told about her previously in this review, so I'm not going to repeat myself. \\n\\n\r\nA later main addition to the cast is Azusa, an underclassman who is much like a more micro tsudere version of Mio. There are minor characters too in the show like Ui Hirasawa, what's Yui's younger (but more mature and reliable sister) and we also have Nodoka, which is Yui's friend from around kindergarden. Miss Sawako Yamanaka is a music teacher and is also very enjoyable to watch, especcially for the heavy metal fans under us.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Masterpiece)\\n\r\nOn the enjoyment department, well, I really have to admit I really feel warm and fuzzy for this anime. It's a shame I've distaced myself for so long from this anime, but I'm glad I could discover this anime. This anime brings me so much joy, but watching the whole K-On series gave me also tears of sadness and happieness combined. If you ask me to name a few anime that are my favorite; K-On! would be one of my picks for sure I would automatically would choose. There is nothing quite like a well-written feel-good anime, especially just after you're feeling depressed for some reason. K-On! is just what I needed to lift my spirit. You can probably classify K-On! as a hard-drug instead of a moe blob anime, because this anime sure did gave me the 'moe diabetes'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nIn overall, this anime I'd like to crown as one of my mayor favorites mainly because this anime gave me too much moe diabetes when I first saw this anime, so yeah, there's that. Sure, even as one of my favorite anime like K-On! even has it's own flaws and I'd love to discuss you this by mainly telling that perhaps maybe the charathers are a bit too perfect for my liking or the mundane interactions between charathers sometimes feel a bit repetitive at times, but in overall the anime is to me just great. Highly recommend if you like a Slice of Life anime in a school setting! I really can't complain about this anime. Fun things are indeed fun!",

            "content": "I've seen the K-On! name around for years now, and had never really been interested, but figured it was on my 'eventually gonna watch these list' and it was it's turn in the line up. So, I started this anime expecting very little, and as far as story art and characters, this anime delivered exactly what I had expected. What wasn't expected was how enjoyable the delivery was.\r\nAs a slice of life anime, stories tend to take a back seat to the characters and their interactions, what K-On! did was took extremely generic character types, relatively cheap looking artwork and somehow made something that meldedthese qualities together well.\\n\r\nThe background tracks never stood out, but that is maybe a good thing since you instead focus on the things that are happening and how the characters interact. To that same end, the BGM never hit a nerve for me in feeling out of pace or out of place with the show, so I would say their use of music to fit the scenes was done rather well. The music for the performances and bits where the girls are actually playing anything did seem to be well done and to the credit of the animation team, they did seem to take some note of hand positioning on the instruments while the girls are playing the instruments.\\n\\n\r\nWhile K-On! doesn't have any qualities that are revolutionary or groundbreaking, it delivers on just being very fun to watch. In a way, the show itself is a lot like the characters. No special parts individually, but when combined it somehow works well enough.",

The protagonists form a diverse group, but that goes perfectly, there are nearly touching moments, but then give way to smiles and laughters. I can not get attached to each of them, they are so cute! I believe they represent the desire of team spirit and friendship that everyone wants to have, with the hope of forming a group that last forever. The episodes fly away and we are located at the end of the series without notice it. The rating I give is very high I know,but for the overall quality I think is more than deserved.",

            "content": "K-On! is by no means an anime for everybody. One can not go into K-On! expecting an intricate story, or deep character development. It is a slice-of-life anime without a season or series long plot, in fact, almost every episode has a different plot (Although, some of them are very similar). \r\nK-On! is very cute. That is probably the first thing everyone will notice about it, and many will be put off by this fact, however after watching a few episodes, I couldn't help but laugh at the silly, childish, and cute humor this series is filled with.\r\nSome of the humor is recycled (Mostly inthis season), and after a while, it will lose its value, but they managed to keep me laughing at least once an episode all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nFor most of the series, there is no deep character development. By this, I mean that what you see in the first few episodes, is what you get. \\n\r\nYui is hyper, and childish, but cute in her own right.\\n\r\nTsumugi is generally quiet, and appears graceful, but often proves to be just as childish as Yui.\\n\r\nMio is the most mature of the initial four main characters, but her own shadow would scare her to the point of defecation (Which you'd better get used to, as it is probably the most recycled joke in the first season). \\n\r\nand finally, Ritsu, who is much like Yui, except much less memorable. She also plays the drums. Ritsu is generally the least liked of the main cast, because there's really nothing unique about her aside from her tomboy-ish style. \\n\\n\\n\r\nK-On! is well worth watching, and I would recommend everyone to continue to K-On!!(S2)  even if you didn't like the first season. K-On!! fixes many of the problems that existed in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, K-On! is one of my favorite series of all time (Anime or otherwise), and near the end of the series, it pulled my heartstrings in a way I never thought an animated show could. \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched K-On!, do it. Now. Why are you still reading this?",

The story is getting really boring, there's nothing to it. \r\nArt: 7\r\nI have to admit there's very good art in K-ON. The instrument's are very well detailed and drawn, with the characters very smooth around the edges. The school, everywhere they go is beautifully drawn.\r\nSound: 9\r\nOkay 1 thing to say about this, I thought all of the voices were adorable and allthe songs were just...perfect.

What's not to love about them?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nUh..well, in my opinion, I don't like anime like this, so I didn't really enjoy it very much..But it's just so clinging the anime drags you in with all the characters and all the stuff that happens around them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nAll I'm going to say is, if you like a band of loli's and them having fun.

            "content": "There are a lot of things I could say about K-On!, but to sum it up in one word, it's great.\r\nOne of the main selling points for me, and I'm sure a lot of others, is the art. The art and animation are absolutely outstanding, and it's one of the main reasons I began watching the show in the first place. The crisp, clear lines and fluid animation really bring the characters to life, especially during their musical performances. \r\nNow let's talk about the characters themselves. There main cast is composed of four main characters, at least in the beginning. There's Mio Akiyama, the bassistof the group, Tsumugi Kotobuki, the keyboardist and my personal favourite, Yui Hirasawa, the lead guitarist and lead vocalist, and finally Ritsu Tainaka, the drummer. Each character has a very clear and distinct personality, and displays this quite well throughout the show, despite reusing a lot of the same type of jokes to do so. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the story? The story is....less than stellar, compared to the rest of the show. A lot of the episodes end up having a lot of similar scenarios, like the group spending most of their time in the club room, drinking tea. Of course, this isn't to say the story is bad by any means. A good portion of the episodes try and keep a fresh topic, and generally accomplish that. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the music. The music in the show is really excellent. The songs they play are catchy, as well as the soundtrack throughout the show. The concert scenes are definitely among my favourite of the whole season, and these scenes are where the animation really comes to life, with the characters perfectly synching with the music they are playing. The music the band plays is really high quality, and it's worth replaying the scene just to hear the song again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is very good, with a ton of excellent qualities. If there were any complaints to be made, it would be that the jokes get a little dry, and the story line wasn't the greatest. I hope people find this review helpful, and thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The Story: 5/10\r\n \tIt\u2019s freshman year and Yui coming to the realization that she hasn\u2019t done a goddamn thing with her life, realizes it's time to shame up and join an after school activity. She becomes interested in the light music club thinking she could play the castanets, but boy was she wrong, but she still feels obligated to stay in the club, so after a bit of awkward peer pressure she decides to continue to be part of the Light Music Club and learn guitar so she can continue to eat the delicious dessert Tsumugi brings in every meeting. The pacing of the plotis pretty minimal and the actual story is pretty bare bones, with slice-of-life high school problems filling out the moments that aren\u2019t holidays or concert performances. I doubt anyone is really looking for a gripping plot when watching K-On! anyways they\u2019ll probably instead have a squuuuuuueeeeeegasm at how moe each member is,and over  just how darn quirky they are. With K-On! it isn\u2019t about the destination, but just how many adorable moments one can squeeze out of 13 short episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst of all you got the MC, Yui Hirasawa she\u2019s really naive and airheaded, but she can do great things if she puts her mind to it, oh she also loves sweets along with everyone else in the Light Music Club. Mio Akiyama is the bass player who is intelligent, shy, a bit of scaredy cat, and probably the most talented musician of the bunch, Tsumugi Kotobuki is the keyboardist, who\u2019s thoughtful, nice, rich, and also a bit of an airhead (I feel like she is the least well-developed character of the group, although none of the main cast is all that well rounded). Ritsu Tainaka is the drummer and the club president, she\u2019s a bit rough and is childhood friends with Mio, thought she acts really similar to Yui at times. Azusa Nakano is the final band member, and is the rhythm guitarist I assume. She\u2019s a year younger than the rest of the members, and she is definitely the most serious of the bunch. I love her coming in, and being put off by all the tea drinking and cosplaying the LMC does during most practices, and I despised how they showered her with attention by forcing her to try on outfits and making cat noises it was pretty uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe show looks well enough for being in the moe slice-of-life genre and a lot of shows that KyoAni does tends to look pretty gorgeous (like the first image result when you type in Sound! Euphonium Reina I mean, wow). Everything about the art design is either sufficient or god damn adorable. The animation on the other hand is average overall, even the band\u2019s performances don\u2019t look all that fluid or smooth. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\tK-On! doesn\u2019t disappoint in the quality of the songs in the show, but I just wish that there was way more actually songs in the series, since I don\u2019t remember very many. Both the opening and ending for season 1 are praiseworthy. The show is also pretty hard rock sounding during intro then blasts into a girly frilly rock song, that reflects that actual tone of subject matter of the show to a tee. It\u2019s timid and precious at times, and then crescendos into a chorus of youthful exuberance  and rainbows and The Ending is exhilarating and really gives off the vibe that they are an actual rock band, and not some tea drinking amateur high school band. Also the costume design and transitions showing each band member and their instruments are really sleek and eye-popping. I love both the opening and ending for season one, and are my favorite parts of the series for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the rarely seen plot, K-On! can actually be addicting in short bursts, It\u2019s like the sweets the girls devour every afternoon, it\u2019s best short and sweet, and if you too many in a single time it will leave you with a heartache. It\u2019s sort of the the anime equivalent of Animal Crossing, I mean it\u2019s nice to check in every once in awhile to see how your town and neighbors are doing, but there is only so much you can do in a single visit, and can get boring and drawn out pretty quickly. The best this for sure is the music, and if anything just check out the openings and the ending for season one, and if your interest in the characters then watch the show, but if it those don\u2019t do anything for you then don\u2019t bother with K-On!.",

            "content": "As you may have heard, K-On is a pretty cute show. If you hadn't heard...it is. As many others have said, don't watch it if you don't like cutesy kinds of shows. \r\nK-On is the first full season of anime I've ever completed. I'd seen pictures from it around and I finally decided to watch it to see what it was about. I was pleasantly surprised. \r\nK-On a feel-good kind of show. It'll make you smile. There's nothing too serious going on. There's nothing perverted. It's good clean fun. It would be hard to get offended watching this show, no matter who you are. It'ssilly high school girls being silly. That's an aspect I really love about the show. It lets girls be girls. It's not trying to turn them into something they're not. They're young girls having fun together, facing joys and struggles in a school club. The lack of drama might be unrealistic, but is nonetheless refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all adorable and unique. I personally could identify with different aspects of each character, but I'm sure many people identify specifically with one or the other since the girls are all very different. Mugi, Mio, and Azusa are all shy, but in their own way. Mugi is content being quiet. Mio is more serious and paralyzed by embarrassment. Azusa is reserved and always wants to do what is proper. And then you have your extroverts, Yui and Ritsu. Yui is in her own little world, amused by cute things and food. She's lazy, but charming. Ritsu is more hyper and crazy, always wanting to have fun. These characters together form delightful and inspiring simple friendships.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch the series all at once, but spread out over a few months. At times it seemed to jump around a bit. But there is no complex plot. You could really jump in at almost any time and things would probably make sense for the most part. Some episodes just felt like they didn't really matter though, such as training camp episodes or the extra winter-day. They just diverted from the plot, although it isn't complex in any way. Also characters such as Azusa and Sawako Yamanaka seemed random and unnecessary to add in, but once they were there I appreciated them.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting more original music from the girls, but sadly it wasn't delivered. Much like Mio and Azusa are at times disappointed with the group's progress, so was I. There were only a few songs they wrote. And they were only briefly featured. \\n\\n\r\nK-On holds a lot more potential than it actually presents in many aspects, but it is enjoyable nonetheless because of its innocence.",

Instead, this is going to be my personal opinions informally thrown out there to tell people what this show is about. If you're looking for a step-by-step breakdown, don't read this review. Also, this review will not contain any spoilers.\r\nK-On! revolves around the local school's Light Music Club, which is basically just a club where everyone in it is in a band and they create songs, play instruments, all that stuffs. When the first year of high school starts, 2 girls find out thatthe club is going to be disbanded due to lack of members (nobody is in the club), so they decide to take up the club and own it. Gradually more and more girls join and there ends up being 4 of them fairly early in the series. Later, a 5th, Azu-nyan, joins about half way through. Now, the main story of K-On! is... well... I guess it's about them trying to make music and become a well-known band or something...? But honestly it's about them eating cake and drinking tea. After school each day, they have their \"practices\" or \"rehearsals,\" but they don't actually do a lot of practicing or rehearsing. Instead, they mainly sit around and talk while eating cake and drinking tea, which is usually very comical. The main aspect of this anime isn't necessarily about music, but more about being cute and funny. Yes there are music aspects as that's basically the whole plot and story of the show, but it's not as dominant as you'd think. For me, I'm glad. I liked just sitting back watching cute girls do cute and funny things, all while stuffing their faces with cake and tea. That is basically the summary of this whole anime: Cute girls do cute things while being funny, also while stuffing their faces with cake and tea. That's it. That's the show. Now, when they actually play songs and etc. and preform concerts, the music is awesome. The sound quality throughout the whole anime is very crisp and nice, and the songs are cutesy and very enjoyable. The characters are very enjoyable as well, as I said earlier they're all cute and do cute and funny things. I really liked Mio who was the shy and scaredy-cat one of the group. They all have their own unique personalities and each one of them plays a different instrument. Well, I guess that's the review.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I understand that this was a gigantic run on paragraph listing random facts about this series, but that's just what it came out to be. Again it's very informal and I'm just spewing out information about why I like this show, so there you go. You should definitely watch K-On!, because it's relaxing, cute, and thoroughly enjoyable. Unless you're looking for a deep plot or conflicts, because it has practically none of that.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 - Would eat cake and drink tea again",

            "content": "K-ON! is one of those rare shows that features music as the over-arching theme. It can be a hit-or-miss, considering who it is targeting to and what your own preference of music is.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe series follows Hirasawa Yui and how she gets herself involved in the Light Music Club. Even though she has little to no musical talent, she joins the club as their lead guitarist. The show was set to be simple -- nothing too fancy and nothing too bizzare. The comedic part of the series is extremely light and nothing that will make you burst into tears, but that's my own preference.\r\nArt &Animation: 7\\n\r\nKyoto Animation found that making shows more \"moe\" like would bring in the viewer's attention -- so they did it. Again, like the plot of the story, nothing too fancy. Each character was drawn to look cute with not that many details. The art for the ending was a lot more detailed, and that would've gotten me a bit more attached to the series if it was like that. Moe art for me, ehhh. It's not something I would prefer, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAgain, music is all about preference. It is a hit-or-miss for you if you like pop music. There is a big risk in making a series solely on music, since you don't have much to fall back on. The songs were meant to be nonsensical and also added a small part of the comical element to the series. Try reading some of the titles of the songs featured in the series -- it can be a bit odd. The lyrics are no different. Nevertheless, just about every song they have made is catchy and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI don't know what it is about having 1 of every character:\\n\r\nHirasawa Yui, the airhead and the main protagonist of the series. She gets the most development throughout the series, but it seems to lack at some aspects. (guitarist, singer)\\n\r\nAkiyama Mio, a timid girl where memes of her spreaded like wildfire (Just search up Moe Moe Kyun and you will know what i'm talking about). (Bassist, singer)\\n\r\nKotobuki Tsumugi, the rich one out of them all that offers tea and cake just about every episode.(pianist)\\n\r\nTainaka Ritsu, the tom-boyish character of the series. (drummist)\\n\r\nNakano Azusa, the semi-serious character in the series only to revert into the fanservice cat cosplayer that everyone loves. (guitarist)\\n\\n\r\nWhat do they all have in common? Their enjoyment of tea and cake while being extremely lax most of the time throughout the entire series... and being extremely moe. They all have a single specific characteristic that only they can have, leaving a lot to desire in character development. It develops a bit more in the second season, but this is just a review for the first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nIt wasn't really a show that got me excited, or pumped to watch the next episode. It was more of a, \"meh, i'll continue to see how it ends\". It became repetitive and my enjoyment level slowly depleted as a result. When Azusa was introduced in the series, it gave me hope that it may get a bit more serious, but I was let down as she got more and more affiliated with the Houkago Tea Time band. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI am not saying this series was bad. The plot of the series was to get a bunch of girls together to play some music -- and they achieved that. After that, there wasn't much following it. If it's not music, you just follow their daily lives at school, which just about every anime has adopted for some reason.\\n\r\nIf you want to expand your pool of music and want to just sit back and relax to a series that isn't taking itself too seriously, watch it. Otherwise, it's not something that you have to be extremely eager to see.",

            "content": "Story - 7\r\nThe story can be viewed in one of two ways:\r\n1- Yui's quest to join the Light Music Club and the club's attempts at playing shows, improving etc which is present in few episodes.\r\n2- A general following of the light music club's endeavours and their cutesy antics, this story being the more present one.\r\nIf you're looking for a strong story driven and episodic anime then this most likely won't be for you, whereas if you want an anime that doesn't require a lot of thinking and allows you to zone out or just put on when you want to have a laugh K-On! shouldbe right down your ally\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe show's art isn't exactly great meaning it can be hard for it to stand out in a crowd but it is still nice to look at. The characters in the anime all tend to be easily distinguished from each other although during certain scenes such as when they are asleep the characters can be difficult to tell apart (especially Yui, Ritsu and Ui)\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly the character's designs (cute girls, big eyes etc) are pretty similar to those of other characters in other moe; also taking from its ability to stand out in a crowd\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are most likely based on the archetypes of most moe characters you shouldn't let that put you off\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are easily likeable in K-On! with each of the main cast having their own role in drawing viewers in\\n\\n\r\nYui (guitarist and vocalist) plays the role the ditsy girl that provides the set ups for a majority of the funny moments and bounces off of Ritsu's character very well\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nRitsu (drummer) is best compared to a tomboy as she enjoys playing the drums and scaring the other characters (mostly Mio)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nMio (bassist and vocalist) is the serious character that usually tries to keep the band on track. She's also quite the scaredy cat which sets her up for multiple scenes of other characters scaring her\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nAsuza (rhythm guitarist) is also a more serious character that tried to keep the band inline. Asuza is the youngest in the band and often falls victim to being treated like a baby by Yui\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nMugi (keyboardist) is the rich girl that allows the club to indulge in opportunities such as visiting summer houses during the holidays in order to practice and also provides the expensive treats that often distract the club from working. She is often seen taking pleasure in the simple things in life.\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nSawa Chan (teacher and advisor) acts as the club's advisor, she is more often than not shown as being a sweet charger l character that is loved by the students for her kindness and beauty however sometimes her character takes a full turn and acts more hostile due to her guitarist past\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 (Dub sound)\\n\\n\r\nConsidering this anime is about a light music club and band the music is few and far between although the music IS pretty good when it does finally come into play and generally has an upbeat tone that gets your body bouncing even if you don't notice straight away\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is also done well with the characters sounding pretty much as you'd expect:\\n\r\nYui being high pitched and cutesy to match her ditsy personality.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nRitsu having an almost raspy voice to match her tomboy tendencies.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nMio and Asuza both having serious voices for the most part to compliment their work-then-play attitudes.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nMugi having a high 'wow everything is amazing' voice to match her habit of being happy 90% of the time and finding everything (including silverware cleaners) to be cool and interesting\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nFinely Sawa chan for the most part having a sweet voice letting her maintain her image of kind teacher, while also being able to switch to a volatile, raspy tone when letting her inner rock star shine\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is pretty enjoyable if you enjoy anime that don't follow a strong plot and generally don't have a very episodic nature. While watching K-On! you can relax, turn off your brain and just mindlessly tune in, all while being provided with laughs.\\n\\n\r\nYou can also opt to be an active viewer, fully engulf yourself in the show and take in the show's small pieces of plot and receive a little bit more enjoyment from the anime\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.2\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion K-On! is quite enjoyable and is a good way to provide yourself with some laughs, it has likeable characters, catchy music and a nice art style so it'd be recommended that you watch it rather than take a pass on it.",

            "content": "K-On! Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd enjoy an anime like this. Boy, oh boy.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nIf you started watching K-on expecting an actual plot, then it is you who is lacking, not the anime. That's like going to a Michael Bay film and expecting to get a nuanced classical drama. It is a 10/10 story, precisely because there is no story or plot (or rather a minimal one at that). You can pick it up at any episode and follow along. Sometimes, you just want to kick off your shoes, cozy up under a blanket and watch a cute little anime, youknow? And I cannot overstate the importance of not having any romantic aspect in this show. Seriously, if they had done that, it would've been a 2/10 show for me. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 & Art 10/10\\n\r\nImagine the cutest and clumsiest little dog you can think of. Now turn that dog into a human. You have Hirasawa Yui.\\n\\n\r\nHow the hell can something be this cute! Props to KyoAni. With Clannad, Hyouka and Inu Yasha, they were already up high in my list. But now, with K-on, yeah... Yui's character and interaction designer, or maybe it was the manga artist who did this in the first place, you sir, are simply amazing. If it were up to me, r/aww would have nothing but K-on gifs and screenshots.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the Hirasawa sisters interact is simply, healing. Hearing Yui say \"Ui\" is panacea.\\n\r\nThey rank pretty high up in my top conversational duo list, after Araragi/Senjougahara, and Holo/Lawrence, and Hachiman/Haruno and Araragi/Shinobu, and Araragi/Tsuki, and... well, the Monogatari series is cheating. But you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nNot just that, Yui just friggin lights up any and every scene that she is in. An MC that actually grabs and shines in every possible moment? It's Yui. No one can compare here. She 'makes' the show. And keep in mind, I'm not taking anything away from the other characters here. They're all so friggin adorable. It's just that Yui ties everything together.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nAll you voice actors, you simply could not have done a better job. But for a music oriented anime, it could've had some better OST.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, this anime might not be for everyone. People tend to expect different things from different shows for different reasons at different times. I was just frustrated by a couple of anime that I watched recently (Noragami, looking at you) and wanted to simply watch something where nothing happens. I'm really really glad I picked up K-On. Anyway, if you think, 'fun things are fun', you know what to do.\\n\\n\r\nSay, \"Moe Moe Kyuuun\" and give in to happiness.\\n",

It wants to be a slice of life, but one that does little to tell a good story, which is something pretty important for this type of show to do, or it just gets boring fast. Cute girls doing everyday things isn't enough to keep me interested.\r\n[ART: 7/10]\r\nThe art is above average and the character design is very well done, but that's all I can say. Nothing is spectacular about it that makes it stand out besides the carefully crafted cute characters.\r\n[SOUND: 6/10]\r\nCharacters can be annoying and loud, but the voice actors do a goodjob at least. Music for openings is pretty enjoyable, but otherwise it's pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 6/10]\\n\r\nThere are some enjoyable characters and some lackluster and generic ones, but the character design is done very well, as I said earlier. Nothing much to say besides that.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 5/10]\\n\r\n\"K-ON!\" could've benefited from a more interesting series of events that strayed away from the generic \"lets do club stuff and be high school kids\" idea that a huge chunk of these slice of life shows try to replicate (and only a few get it right). It definitely has standout character design, but lacks in most other areas and really brings it down to an average rating.",

Yes, certain episodes have some small roadblock for certain characters, but really, there's mainly nothing going on plot-wise in this anime. I don't necessarily have a problem with that. Lucky Star has no plot, and yet,it is one of my favorite anime of all time. It works due to the humor and characters. When it comes to K-On!, the humor is pretty good for the most part. It definitely had me laughing at certain parts that were silly and stupid, but in a cute way. None of the humor deals with fanservice or adult jokes of any kind. It's very safe. Some people may not like that, but I greatly enjoyed every minute. One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't an anime where we get band songs every episode. There's probably three times where we see the characters play together. Just something to keep in mind.\\n\\n\r\nIt's no surprise to anyone that the animation and character designs are beautifully crafted. It's a show that looks as amazing as one would assume from KyoAni. \\n\\n\r\nMusic here is definitely above average. I wouldn't cal it groundbreaking or anything. The songs played by the characters in the anime are all rock. They're well composed and everything, but not very memorable. Same with the OP and ED. Good, but slowly drifts away from the mind after watching an episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in K-On! are quite enjoyable too. They all have the traits you would assume from this type of anime. None really grow or transform that much throughout the series. Yui provides most of the comedy in the series. She's great. Her humor always hits a good note (no pun intended). One of my favorite jokes in the series deals with her and a guitar. I won't spoil it for you, but you'll know it when it happens. It's comedy gold. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy K-On!? Yeah, but it never went over the hill for me. Sure, the humor works, but it isn't as strong as other slice of life anime. The characters were all enjoyable to watch, especially Yui. There weren't any characters I disliked or found annoying. With that said, they weren't anything to write home about ether. At the end of the day, this is a very good anime that will entertain you while watching it. With that said, it's not life-changing. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it, but if you have nothing better to watch, it's a fun way to waste time and have some great laughs. Don't expect anything deep though.",

            "content": "K-On! Is a show that bases its appeal almost entirely in the relatability and evolution of its characters and its ability to create a light, fluffy atmosphere that viewers, given the time, can easily fall into. This review will cover the essential elements of the series using the component-by-component format and will be pertaining to only the first season, as I have not seen the second. Enjoy\u2026\r\nStory - 6: K-On\u2019s story is enjoyable and light, which is all it really needs to be. The four girls come across an abandoned club in their high school, The Light Music Club, and the first two to stumbleupon it, Mio and Ritsu, act as recruiting agents. Once they find two more girls to make it qualify as a club, the story gets going (by its standards). The following events are fairly mild and, objectively, uninteresting. If you find yourself getting frustrated watching this show after a few episodes for this reason, just keep in mind that a gripping plot couldn\u2019t be farther from the appeal of K-On!; rather, what the show goes for is a story that exists as nothing but a blueprint of sorts for the characters to interact with and make their own. This is where the life comes from in K-On!. Of course, characters will be covered in detail later in the review, but I bring it up now because the show\u2019s story is just about pointless without them. You might be thinking \u201cthen why aren\u2019t you giving the story a low-ass score if it is so weak on its own\u201d, and you\u2019d be right about it being weak on its own, but what\u2019s important to keep in mind is that, while the characters are tailored to the story and make it unique and interesting, the story is likewise tailored toward the girls and takes adequate steps to make sure they are all put in scenarios that work well with their characters, which is not something that is necessarily simple at all, especially looking at it from an entertainment perspective. All things considered, K-On!\u2019s story is adequate and lays a solid foundation for the more intriguing aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9: The animation and overall artistic flow of K-On! comes across as fairly simple and run-of-the-mill at first, particularly in its color scheme, I found. However, within a few more episodes, it becomes increasingly apparent that most of the way the show is animated is calculated and for a purpose. I noticed this almost bouncy feel in the manner of the girls\u2019 design, particularly in Yui\u2019s (which couldn\u2019t be more fitting for her), and this helped in giving the girls\u2019 antics, as well as the show as a whole, a more loving and airy tone unlike any other show I had seen. This is truly what hooked me about K-On! to begin with. Beyond this common factor, though, each girl in the band is animated a tad bit different, each having her animation tailored to her. Mio\u2019s elegant, sturdy design is reflective of her level-headed, and almost mother-like nature toward the girls, Ritsu\u2019s sketchy and almost sharp design is perfect for her off-the-wall shite, and Tsumugi is animated in a bubbly, lovey-dovey sort of style, representative of her role in the show as literally the girl who is made to be likeable beyond the point of being realistic. Aside from this, there is a general feel of completeness and attention to detail in all the settings the girls are in, contrasting greatly from the manga, which failed miserably in this department (as well as art in general). Another important thing to bring up about the settings and backgrounds is that they work to make up for the almost bland color schemes of the girl\u2019s designs in some scenes. With that said, the art of K-On! is one of those previously mentioned aspects that brings the simplistic story to life, and is satisfactory in just about every regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: The soundtrack of K-On! is frankly unmemorable, which is a shame because every other aspect of this category is absolutely stellar. The OP and ending are perfect and reflect one of the balances that is one of the show\u2019s goals to flesh out; the dichotomy of the girls\u2019 seemingly simplistic and joyous time together (the opening) and their individual insecurities (the ending). Of course, considering this is the sound category, I would need to mention that the music of each the OP and outro are perfectly fitting respectively, as well. In addition, the voice actors match this quality with beaming energy and engagement being brought to each of their roles, thus creating a feeling of consistency in what this show is producing sound-wise, as well as making the characters feel more lively and fun beyond their writing and artistic design. Overall, the sound in K-On! is good enough to match the other aspects of the show, which, considering how highly I regard K-On!, is saying quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10: This is the selling point of the series, as K-On!\u2019s characters retain a balance and chemistry that is yet to be matched by any slice-of-life, comedy-centric anime (or show, for that matter) that I\u2019ve seen. Truthfully, the whole appeal of their bond as a band (almost rhymed) is that they build each other up and possess what each other lack, which varies from member to member. While this is faaaaaaaaaaaaar from the most original premise in existence, K-On!, if anything, is a testament to the argument that what a show (or any visual storytelling medium, for that matter) comes down to is not themes or premise, but the execution thereof. The way I see it, classic stories of all mediums, while built around solid themes, are not considered genius for their theme or message, but how the writer conveys it to the audience in a relatable and interesting manner; execution. Any oaf can say \u201cmy story is about friendship and the importance of bonds\u201d, but not just anyone can make a cast of loveable characters using expert writing and art to make people give a shit about said message. I would summarize each character to further exemplify what I\u2019m saying, but I\u2019d rather just give an overview as to justify giving them a perfect 10, which is what I have done (and besides, I already covered in brief their personalities, excluding Azusa in the Art section). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9: With a show that is so solid in virtually every category, I don\u2019t think it comes as a surprise that my enjoyment of this series is high to say the least. The writing behind K-On! clearly takes into perspective the entertaining of its audience, as almost every scene involves the previously noted chemistry between characters, and the all-too-enjoyable art style. That said, the show did feel a bit slow in the beginning and I found myself constantly on edge over the fear that this was going to devolve into just another directionless, lackluster slice-of-life shitfest. However, as I continued, I found myself becoming strangely attached to the characters and the amazing amount of consistent badassery each had to offer. Later, as their insecurities became fleshed out, I felt sympathy for them, as well, which was the last piece in the puzzle of my complete admiration for the series. This caused me to acknowledge and respect how well this show knows its audience (including people who generally aren\u2019t big slice-of-life fans). Virtually all tastes are considered and the show never pandered me too much with one thing. All in all, my enjoyment of K-On! is just about as solid as the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: K-On! is a show that does exactly what it set out to do and more. As I have only seen a few of the light-hearted anime of its nature, I don\u2019t speak from a place of expertise, but I can recognize a good show when I see one. This series is fun, charming, and relatable and left me with a sense of completeness after viewing it. An important thing to note about the seemingly trite theme of friendship is that it is not an inherently harmful thing to incorporate into a show, and that it gets its bad rep simply for being used in media that generally is pretty repetitive and pointless. Thus, an action-oriented fan such as myself can easily find a solid foothold to enjoy this show on. Giving this show a fair chance would be in any anime fan\u2019s best interest, and I hope I presented my thoughts on the matter in a manner that is clear, interesting, and informative.\\n\r\nThanks for reading :3!!\\n",

            "content": "Every genre has its entries that define how you should do a show of this genre. K-On! is the king of CGDCT/Slice of Life-Moe anime and shows what to expect of the genre, it gives a good idea of if the genre is for you.\r\nPersonally, I don\u2019t need a great story of any story at all in a CGDCT anime or even basic things like character development. A good CGDCT-show can focus on its two main aspects: The cute girls and the cute things they are doing. Add some music of magic or any other fun thing, it should be fun, and you are onthe best way to make an entertaining and light-hearted piece of animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn K-On!, we follow four girls and their teacher living their carefree lives with drinking tea, eating cake and sometimes actually practicing for their band. There isn\u2019t any bigger plot or conflict, they just handle different everyday situations with their different characters. Just like every Slice of Life show you\u2019ve ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the main aspect of any Slice of Life show, and K-On! Does a pretty good job here. Every girl has personality and are characterized enough to make them different from each other. We have the lazy, but caring girl, the adult, but shy girl, the over-energetic girl and the rich and calm girl. In my opinion, the teacher really stands out here, she tries to leave her wild youth behind and become the loved and respected teacher she wants to be, but she also wants to be friends with the girls and make daring costumes for them. The cast works well together and you end up loving them, not for a specific character, but for their interactions and friendship. Everything you could imagine them doing can be justified by one of the characters. They are having a training camp in a huge house at the beach? Mugi\u2019s rich parents own it. Need some amazing costumes over night? Sawako can make them. Forgot to get permission for sleeping in school? Good thing we are friends with the president of the student council.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is always matter of taste, but I really liked it because it's light-heated and really suits the girls' personalities.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, K-On! suffers from the same problems many CGDCT and SOL anime suffer from. If you the characters, the whole experience is ruined, because the whole show is focusing the characters. But if you start to like the characters and their quirks, you start enjoying every minute of the show, seeing their friendships develop and overcoming every problem they encounter. This season is in my opinion the weaker one of the two, in season 2 they do more interesting things and there is some conflict and character development.",
