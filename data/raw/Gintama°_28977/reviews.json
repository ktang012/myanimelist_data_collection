            "content": "Have you ever wanted to laugh so hard that it feels like you're dying? Well, then this season is no different from any of its predecessors. The season dives straight into its main focus which is comedy and gives us all sorts of parodies and laughs that viewers can relate to other shows, which is what makes it so great. However, this season is not all laughs. As with this season, the show moves into some of the more serious arcs\u2014a must see for any fan of Gintama.\r\nBesides starting out with heavy action, comedy is one of the best ways to make people continue watchinga show. To hook the viewers into the first few episodes is what the producers try to do each season. If you don\u2019t start off with something funny in a show that is so well-known for its way of doing parodies and comedy, then there\u2019s no way the viewers are going to continue watching. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like a good ol\u2019 DBZ parody to start itself off? I know I do.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t like about how the season went is the skipping of some of the smaller arcs. Gintama has always been faithful at adapting all its arcs, but this season was quite different. This may be due to pushing it for OVAs to sell, or maybe they just didn\u2019t have the time slots available. That or something came up within the studio to make them adapt the bigger arcs earlier.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I guess we should talk about the highly anticipated arcs that a lot of people have been waiting for since the announcement of the season. Without trying to spoil, these arcs provide a lot to the watchers as to what\u2019s happening to some of the most known groups/people in the Gintama franchise.  The first arc is the Shogun arc which obviously focuses on the Shogun himself but also his enemies. Compared to the other big arcs, I\u2019d say this was a pretty good arc and rivaled some of the other ones from the past seasons. If you thought that was all for the big arcs, then think again! Not only do we get one major roller coaster arc this season, but two. The other being the Shinsengumi arc which focuses on the Police force of Edo and two other \u201cprominent\u201d groups\u2014the Joui rebels and the Mimawarigumi. Unlike the previous arc, this arc is more about emotion than it is about action. While this arc does have action, I wouldn\u2019t put it ahead of the arc before it in that sense. I still enjoyed this arc though because it shows us some backstory of some of the Shinsengumi, the Mimawarigumi, and even Gintoki. These two arcs go hand-in-hand as the former leads into the latter. Just what is in store for our beloved characters?\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, it has been up and down here and there. Mostly a hit though. Like most shows, or at least ones that want to stand out in scenes, the visuals will go above and beyond then the usual to look when it needs to. The comedy arcs were also pretty good in terms of its animation, but there were times when the animation took a turn down and looked pretty bad. Expect the animation budget to be really good during the action arcs, especially for the final two arcs. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t bad when it needed to be so there\u2019s nothing major I would note down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it has been really good. The OST was done pretty well and matches the overall mood of what the scene is trying to portray to the viewer\u2014whether its during comedy or action. The OP/ED songs I have mixed feelings for because I\u2019m mainly a fan of catchy songs, but they sounded good and is no different from past season. I\u2019ve been mainly a fan of Gintama\u2019s OP, but this season there was a few EDs I quite enjoyed more so than its OP counterpart, so props to the singers for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like that another season of Gintama ends. The waiting once again begins as per regular tradition. If you haven\u2019t enjoyed this season, then the season to come, which will most likely be the finale, is definitely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nGintama hasn\u2019t changed one bit; it will continue being its same old self until it finally brings a closure to all the characters we love and find so hilarious.\\n",

            "content": "Finally the season has ended and phew, what a journey it was. This season is the first one where I watched it as it aired. I used to be one of those people who were pissed off because Gintama took too many spots on MAL's top anime page but never actually tried to understand why people liked it. I had always been hesitant to start because the premise didn't seem  interesting at all but hey, it only took me 2 months to finish all the available episodes back in 2014 because once I started, I just can't stop. That's just how good this seriesis in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the review of this season!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, Gintama had never been an anime with high budget so please don't expect ufotable's godlike level of animation. For a long-running anime though, I think Gintama has the better animation out there, and especially during the last arc, the animation was pretty top notch. The characters design and the setting has always been distinct (I've always been a fan of their portrayal of 'modern' Edo) and I always thought that Gintama has good art anyway so in this season it still deserves a high score.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is one of my personal favourite aspects of Gintama. I like how they could make a recurring theme to give off different feelings according to the scene they're accompanying. The new OSTs for this season are very good too, especially for the last two arcs (there is one theme song for a new character that I really like in this season, it gives me literal chill everytime I hear it haha).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis season started with a very controversial comedic episode which reminded us that Gintama won't ever be afraid to make jokes on pretty much everything. The episodes which followed are great too (the lottery one is still my fav though) and the comedic arcs in this season are among my favorites (soul switch arc, dekoboko arc, afro arc, feigned illness arc, confessional arc...). They are very well written and always left us with an afterthought in a classic Gintama way.\\n\\n\r\nThe serious arcs, particularly the last two, are among the best in the entire series. The strength of the serious arcs in Gintama is that the pacing of the story is quite fast that our hype was always being kept at high. Also, as an anime-only watcher, a lot of the twist really caught me off-guard, and all I can say is despite some of the twists being typical shounen tropes, the way Gintama handled them are very tasteful. I guess it's because Gintama isn't your typical shounen with teenagers as MCs, which bring us to its endearing characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the reason why I finished all the previous seasons in only two months. If you asked me when I started to love a particular character I would never be able to answer that; they were all slowly creeping on me.\\n\\n\r\nGintama's character are well-rounded. Nobody is perfect; in fact some of the characters are really gross that it may seemed impossible to love them at first, but given the time, they are all endearing in their own ways. I mean, I can sympathize with a gorilla stalker that sometimes walk around naked and a gross homeless old man who seemed to have no ambition in life. My other favourites includes the clumsy leader of a rebellious faction nicknamed \"nobleman of fury\" who keeps an alien (duck?) as a pet, an inhumanely strong little girl with a weird accent who always eats like there's no tomorrow, and a police officer who should have been arrested for exposing everyone with secondhand smoke and for ruining all the good foods in this world with his disgusting mayonnaise addiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters this season are also memorable, but what hits me the most is the development of all the supporting characters. We've known them for 250+ episodes and we're very much already knew their personality traits. However, Sorachi gradually exposed bits by bits of those characters so what I feel that watching Gintama is not about the characters growing, but me knowing them better. I don't know if this makes sense or not, but watching Gintama feels like knowing your friends better in life instead of rooting for a celebrity you've only seen on TVs. So when they're hurt or something bad happened to them, the feels hit me as if something happened to someone I hold dear (okay this is getting out of hand because my inner otaku coming out but whatever). \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the supporting characters in Gintama are too good that they can probably lead their own series. That being said, the MC is by no means being overshadowed by them. Gintoki is deservedly the leader of the bunch, and this season just cemented the fact. There are many instances where Gintoki shines as the best shounen MC I've ever seen, both because his persona and how he deals with his relationship with other characters. He handled all the cliche shounen tropes in a surprising manner that keeps me rooting for him (there's one moment in this season when it's shown that he's really emotionally strong and mature and that was something I rarely saw in shounen jump's heroes).  \\n\\n\r\nGintoki though, has always been a contradiction; he had always been annoyingly talkative but actually he rarely said anything important, he always seemed greedy but when we think about it, he is actually very selfless. In this season, I feel that Gintoki had opened up and showing his true self more (he's talking about his past more, and he's also openly expressing his wishes). All in all, his relationship with all the characters, especially with his Yorozuya family and the Shinsengumi, is the highlight for me in this season.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nHell yeah the fast pacing keeps the enjoyment and the hype real and high. If you still don't get it from my ramblings above I really enjoy this season. Wednesday had been the day I waited the most for these past year (even more than the weekends!)\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the seiyuus is another highlight (especially Sugita and Nakai!) because without them masterfully voicing these weird characters, it won't feel the same. I believe I will listen if Gintama was made into radio series, their voices are already the heart of Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nWatching Gintama actually makes me very picky in watching other anime. It has a complete package that is hard to beat; I bet you it's not easy to make a series where you can laugh a little in between tears because they decided to put a slight comedy in an otherwise very emotional scene. Or makes you laugh like a madman because sometimes it's too funny that you need to stop watching to collect yourself first. And this season just has that perfect mix of comedy and action (and drama too) that I cemented it as one of the best series ever made.\\n",

            "content": "EDIT: This was a review written for April Fools. I wish to thank everyone for brightening my day with all the positive feedback and reactions, it really shows that Gintama has taught us to enjoy a good laugh. The review will stay as is, since my opinions can still be found in it, just written in a backwards kinda way.\r\n~\r\nLadies and gentlemen, feast your eyes upon the most overhyped anime of all time! Watch as our main protagonist uses his wooden sword of sentimentality, cutting into the bleeding hearts of all you emotional thinkers, corrupting your rotten brains with the stench of intellectual destitution! \r\nInthis particular season of Gintama, the author\u2019s masterplan finally takes shape. Every episode of comedy filler, every laugh, and every smile it has pulled from your innocent lips, it was all a ploy to steal your souls. He can now freely attach your emotions to these characters of absurd fiction. With emotional manipulation the anime makes you care for a bunch of clowns, and then takes a darker turn as you become complacent.\\n\\n\r\nWith superior animation it uses thrilling action-scenes and atmospheric direction, blinding you with pretty colors. The show\u2019s visuals are fast-food for the soul, delicious upon tasting it, but ultimately detrimental to your IQ, making you more creative and in touch with your emotions rather than with your cold and logical side.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to wreak havoc on your lowly opinions, by pointing out Gintama\u2019s greatest flaw of all, the horrendous writing and characters. The show has a tendency to make characters relatable and fascinating, only to retcon events so that you can retain those emotional connections, while the story just goes wherever it wants. It is one thing to play with expectations, but another to betray them by doing plot-twists that don\u2019t live up to my personal golden standard. Some characters will receive tragic backstories, only for it to be revealed that none of it mattered, because some current event undid it all or it was all a lie to begin with. Worst of all, on several occasions we see death-flags get raised, only to be ignored in the name of dramatic convenience, just so the few who DO die have more impactful farewells. \\n\\n\r\nI would call the author spineless, but that\u2019d be an insult to invertebrates. I would ask you all to make a drinking-game out of every time you notice plot-armor at play, or a character making an inspirational speech. When you all die of alcohol-poisoning I'll be left in a more agreeable world, one where only I rule over the anime-hegemony. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Gintama has reached a level of worship among anime-fans like no other. To think that the social nature of humanity would override their ability to think logically, it makes me want to give up on everything.\\n\\n\r\nOh and happy April Fools. This show is awesome.",

            "content": "When it comes to sequels, It is often unclear whether it will live up to the quality of its previous installments, and in the case of the fourth season of Gintama fans can be assured: it maintains its defining traits. There continues to be a great variety in the comedy offered, as well as its share of arguably one of the best consequent \"serious\" arcs in the entire series so far, expanding greatly upon the setting itself, as well as its cast of characters. However, it must be mentioned that it comes with a slight controversy amongst the fans, the main concern being the inevitableconclusion the series is heading to, and with that, loosing in the process some of its main charm, the comedy, which mainly affects the last third of the season. Regardless of said matter, Gintama delivers in all of its main aspects in a very satisfying manner, where viewers can observe the culmination of the author's experience in the different aspects the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show follows a similar structure to its previous seasons, following the daily, both chaotic and amusing, lives of the beloved trio of the Yorozuya: Kagura, Shimura Shinpachi and of course Sakata Gintoki. The series is known for its great variety in comedy incorporating different genres from both the East and West, in addition to providing great referential comedy to the variety of different anime to its advantage - Kuroko no Basuke or Saint Seiya anyone? These are often well executed, albeit being in some cases too repetitive. Naturally, it is not all referential comedy: it has its share of situational comedy, or just simple daily issues taken into a comedic stance: hiding pornmags, or even a marriage encounter.\\n\\n\r\nIn various instances it also provides some social critique; what is more, this time around it is more universally centered, making it much more accessible to audiences unaware of japanese culture. Examples such as paranoia over a lottery ticket, greedy shopkeepers, corruption amongst civil employers, you name it. Naturally it has its share comedic sketches mainly catered to the japanese viewers, which are arguably hilarious as well. Not to mention the premise of some of the mini arcs presented: the hilarious gender bender arc and of course, the beloved Shogun gags - which once again are arguably of the best sketches of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this time around it is impossible not to mention the story oriented arcs in the season: these are a magnificent portrayal of the author's acquired experience over the years, expanding upon the Amanto and the mysterious Tendoshu that rule over Edo. Its \"serious\" arcs were often criticized for being a bit random and too over the top, yet this time this is not the case. Furthermore, the foreshadowing that was done in the previous seasons become very apparent and explained, in addition to providing a very satisfying flow of events: fast-paced when required, yet balanced and thoughtful when necessary to emphasize on the atmosphere and gravity of the various situations. It ultimately works itself towards a great finale - or rather, another buildup, but to this later - with fantastic action across the board, with a minimal amount of \"asspulls\" action sh\u014dnen are well-known for. The battles are tense, the stakes are high, and it is in fact brutal as it can be: people die left and right, betrayal and disbelief are just some attributes that could be associated to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Gintama remain largely unchanged, with some exceptions, yet this was to be expected, as the series is building itself towards its inevitable finale. Instead, the anime expands on its characters by developing them, as well as further fleshing them out in a satisfying manner. Audiences are presented with the expansion upon Gintoki's past, and with that, his other comrades as well as his master - a wonderful and satisfying display to the character's personality, and of course the story as well. Not only that, it becomes apparent that all the story oriented arcs are in fact used as means to develop and flesh out various characters which initially remained clouded in mystery from the previous seasons: be it Sasaki Isaburou, the founding of the Shinsengumi and its integrants, or even the shogun himself.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, for the more comedic episodes audiences are presented with the homeless Hasegawa Taizou, a great representation of society itself, meaning the hardships or the apathetic attitude towards life. He is arguably one of the greatest characters in the series, alongside the noble and resourceful Katsura Kotarou. Besides his outdated sense of humour and his fantastic personality, It is truly curious to see his evolution as a character throughout the series from being a radical terrorist to a more pacificist person in the quest to change Edo without causing unnecessary deaths. There is a downside to its cast though: for example, Shimura Tae remains pretty much the same throughout the entire series as a forceful woman, who can instantly change to a damsel in distress whenever the plot required it; in addition, the gags surrounding her persona remained the same, and ultimately got annoying. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character interactions and relations, these are often very well handled because of the nature of the anime and the characters themselves that has been developed throughout its duration. This is however not always the case, as in some instances these were rather abruptly presented to the viewer, which in turn caused the whole scenario to feel unnatural. Some of the characters actions occasionally conflict with their own ideals and personality as well, but as a whole, it could be said that it was satisfying. Now there are some issues to be held with the background of some of the characters: these follow the same formulaic approach which is usual in the series, which naturally may be bothersome for audiences. In some instances it could be said that the motives were either too predictable or convenient for story progression.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Gintama was surprisingly consistent and well done considering the fact that it aired for a whole year. However, where it excelled was in its action scenes: the fights were incredibly dynamic and fast paced, accurate as well as fluid and detailed, never leaving any viewer bored throughout its entire duration. This however has a cost to it, the backgrounds suffering in various instances from poor quality character models, and the occasional still image that are displayed throughout the series. As for the art style itself, nothing new, it remains with the same standard as the previous seasons; character models are very simple as well, yet varied enough to easily distinguish its cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however stands out is the selection of soundtrack for the different scenes and atmospheres the anime was trying to portray: the usual tunes for the more relaxed and comedic moments, whereas for the serious moments the studio pulled out a great variety of soundtracks that matched wonderfully with the setting. Metal songs, rock songs, gloomy sounds or the usage of percussion instruments which serve to inspire suspense and tension from the viewer, further enhancing the whole experience the show has to offer. Naturally, the voice actors are of great importance as well, which retained their previous ones:  Sugita Tomozaku as Gintoki, god-like voice of Wakamoto Norio or Tachiki Fumihiko as Hasegawa which greatly enhanced the characters personality, and with that, the comedy as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth season of Gintama was overall a fantastic experience which I personally doubted to be able to surpass that of its previous seasons, yet was pleasantly surprised. It managed to maintain its variety in jokes, the references and such, as well as displaying the one of the greatest subsequent story driven arcs with great characterization contained within. This was all accompanied with a great usage of the soundtrack as well as the fantastic action scenes. It must be said that it did not reach the final conclusion, as the manga is still ongoing, and there were some chapters from the manga left out: this mainly affected the comedy parts.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not mean Gintama has no flaws: it does, and quite some in fact. There are some episodes that either were too repetitive on its theme to the point of being annoying, as well as the infamous episode where they literally turned into shit. This was rather distasteful and off-putting for obvious reasons. Another problem that arises with the \"serious\" arcs are the integration of some of its characters: these are either at times useless/helpless for such situations, yet miraculously survive; or they're included just for the sake of it. Other issue that fans may have with the series is the fact that due to its inevitable conclusion, the anime has gone past the point of no turning back. This in turn meant that the last third of the series had hardly any comedy in it, which may be an issue for some, as the comedy aspect is one of the main charms of Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, despite the above mentioned problems, I still loved the series as a whole and consider it to be the best comedy anime I have watched so far; I have blurted out in laughter a great amount of times, which is the whole point of comedy. It is very rare to find a series that can maintain this type of quality for over 300 episodes. For anyone who hasn't tried out the this sequel yet, I can highly recommend in checking it out, as it provides both great comedy and expansion upon the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Gintama is a hot mess. OH PLEASE\r\nAvoid this anime at all cost! I can't even fathom why people like this so much.\r\nPlot:\r\nWas too complicated. I expected Gintoki and the gang to go on adventures/ arcs and save helpless people who didn't have the power to save themselves. I was waiting for the moment when Gintoki beats the final boss of the arc in fact the main villain never showed up! Instead I got unexpected twist, turns and heartbreak. At one point I had to snatch my sisters weave to slap my computer screen!!!! Why Sorachi?!! WHY!!!\r\nCharacters:\r\nToo unusual and weird. Antagonists such as like Shinsukeand Isaburo were just completely wrong in their directions; they were not planning to destroy the world or to take over the country... Personally, I would have liked these motives instead. They had far deeper motives, reasoning and planning which is quite bothersome because I have to think and go back MANY chapters or episodes to fully understand and to think about it! Female characters and weaker male characters like Shinpachi / Kagura were far too independent... I thought that a stronger character like Sogo needed to help save them but I guess Sorachi got lazy. My far biggest complaint was Gin.. this sad excuse of a main character needs to stop sleeping and go train to unlock his hidden powers. I hated his backstory and I wished that they would just skipped to the senseless boss battle, friendship speeches and the one-hit-KO's. Sorachi was too focused on developing his characters and that is a MAJOR flaw. There needed to have more stupid gags or unnecessary fanservice next season. Whatever. \\n\\n\r\nSound/ Opening and Ending:\\n\\n\r\nIt was great! Both endings and openings were tolerable. Thats the only parts that are good.. to be frank.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSkip this overrated anime. This was far too much for me: character development was oversaturated and the plot was unexpected and shifted to many extremes. I suggest watching Fairy Tail or Bleach because of the familiar plot and characters. You wouldn't even tell a difference between episode 10 and 200 for these anime.. trust me. If Gintama was a boy not even Michael Jackson would have wanted his ass. 10/10\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Due to the nature of this sequel it is inevitable that there will be spoilers for those who haven't seen it though i have tried my level best to keep them to a minimum. I urge you to watch all the prequels before beginning Gintama (2015).\r\nI began Gintama about 3 months back, wondering what it was that captured the hearts of so many people, after all its sequels dominated MAL's top 10 and it had spawned countless memes on the internet. It didn't really pique my interest in terms of its storyline or animation at the beginning but i decided to keep watching becauseof its absolutely gold comedy. By the first serious arc in gintama (Benizakura hen) i was absolutely hooked. Slowly but surely i began to realize the gem that was gintama. \\n\\n\r\nNow with Gintama (2015) gintama has reached heights that i couldn't even imagine and has broken FMA Brotherhood's monopoly at the top of MAL's rankings and has rightfully taken its position as the best anime of the modern era, perhaps even of all time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Gintama is a very episodic anime generally and has no coherent plotline, at least that is how it seems initially, but over the course of the 300 episodes that gintama has lasted we have seen that there is indeed a very deep backstory to Gintoki and many of the other characters. These backstories intertwine with the serious arcs of the anime and present a brilliant combination. The arcs are not very long (the longest arc is 9 episodes that is the Farewell Shinsengumi arc) and this means that there is alot of action and drama packed into these episodes. The arcs aren't many but when the do arrive in the series you know you are in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the star attraction of Gintama (2015) the Shogun assassination arc and the Farewell Shinsengumi arc. To say they are some of the best arcs anime has ever seen would probably be an understatement. The drama and action packed into these 17 episodes is unrivalled. What really makes the storyline of this anime amazing is that despite the fact that it parodies many famous anime for eg Naruto, Bleach etc it never falls to their low level and in fact manages to avoid all their pitfalls. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime will make you laugh until your sides hurt and at points make you cry a river. This contrast is indeed what makes this such an exemplary anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I will not mince words here and come right out and say that the art is fucking awesome. The fights are so well animated you wouldn't believe that they belong to an anime that about 6 years ago was struggling with budget issues and was forced to air in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The art looks like something out of a movie and helps set up the atmosphere wonderfully well. The movements are very fluid and the BGs are very well drawn. Later when the anime takes a dark turn the change in the atmosphere is well conveyed through the darker tone of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound has always been a strong suit of Gintama and has one of the best ensemble of VAs today. perhaps the biggest difference between it and other anime is that in gintama the seiyuus enjoy their job and portray their characters from their heart. The OSTs are still quite good despite some being reused for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the OPs and EDs are concerned, absolute eargasms.  Two of my all time personal favorite OPs belong to Gintama (2015). Every band involved has done a phenomenal job especially 'Blue Encount' and 'Chico with honeyworks' for their 'DAYXDAY' and 'Pride Kakumei' respectively. It would have been awesome to see 'Spyair\" return for another song but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Even though Gintama has a very large number of characters it never makes the viewer feel as any of them is being ignored. All our favorite characters return this season as well and are better than ever. Gintoki is particular receives phenomenal amount of character development this season and becomes as even more endearing character than before (crazy right?). Charcaters like Sacchan and Zenzo play more pivotal roles along with the Shinsengumi's characters like Hijikata, Sougo and Kondo. Many of the characters with which gintoki interacted appear and a special mention must be made of Takasugi in this regard as even he receives a lot of development over the course of Gintama (2015)\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: I don't think this part needs any lengthy explananations as you may very well have judged that i consider gintama to very well be the holy grail of anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end i would like to say that 'Gintama' is an experience every anime fan must have regardless of preferences. If it was not evident by its rankings this anime is an absolute masterpiece n every sense of the word. This season is particular is a new high for the anime. In the end i would like to say that i am glad that i found this anime and gave it a chance for i am unlikely to encounter an amazing anime like this again.\\n\\n\r\nHere is to another 100 episodes of Gintama! \\n\\n\r\n(Thank you for reading this long review and any feedback is greatly appreciated)",

            "content": "Mini-disclaimer: I wasn't planning to write a review so soon but since Gintama has gotten top spot on MAL many people it seems are leaving negative reviews in an attempt to bring it back down. Please don't encourage those people in when it comes to any type of anime. So sorry if this was a bit rushed.\r\nGintama is just a giant cluster-f-word that even questions itself. When a fan asked the Gintama staff what the anime was trying achieve they answered with they don't know either. An anime like that probably wouldn't deserve top spot on MAL(Gintama is number 1 at the time of writingthis review) in a different context, but this is Gintama. \\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10\\n\r\nThe story is about Sakata Gintoki,and the more and more I try to describe the story the more confused I get. At times this anime seems aimless, and at others it seems to be trying to convey a very important message. All in all whatever the story is, it's an amazing one. Now include the parodies, the laughs,the gags, the neo-jet-armstrong-jet-cannon jokes, and you have yourself an enjoyable anime that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.\\n\r\nNow as for actual plot, this anime is pretty consistent; however, like most anime it does have its inconsistencies. But those are all wrapped together nicely and fixed by Gin-pachi sensei himself. For example in a misleading scene they created a voice over and fixed it in the funniest way possible lol. So if you're looking for an amazing story look somewhere else, if you're not sure what you're looking for let Gintama find it for you. (Actual Story rating 11/10, completely unique and the good kind)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nWhat you need to know about this anime is that even the staff uses the Characters in Gintama to complain about their low budgets. This isn't top notch animation, at times it can even feel like a picture book. But it's a really good picture book. This anime at times has used the same frame of a building for about 5 minutes, with the characters only talking in the background and that's it. Regardless I enjoyed those moments because those characters even without movement and just their dialogue made a very enjoyable scene, and only Gintama can pull that off. There was even an episode when the op was done in MS Paint, do you know how bad in terms of \"art\" that would be rated? But still it had me laughing and was very enjoyable, which only Gintama could pull off. If you're starting to notice a pattern, and this goes for the rest of the review, Gintama is not subjected to the typical ways of critiquing/reviewing. The art in this anime is inconsistent, but it's good when it needs to be good and it's still enjoyable everywhere else. \\n\\n\r\nSounds 8/10\\n\r\nOur cute heroine is puking again? Well let's just add beautiful background effects.\\n\r\nThe Music isn't what some may call a masterpiece but it's good. They always get the mood going, and at times they make me cry because of all the memories Gintama has shared with me and they just come to me when I listen to Samurai Heart. The people behind the music and sound production know what they're doing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nEvery Character in Gintama is pathetic.\\n\r\nThe cute heroine we all want pukes everywhere and picks her nose,she's not even old enough legally or morally to ship her with the MC-kun, the glasses side character loses sight of his goal and never gets anywhere until the last episodes that fixes his goal in a few said episodes, as if they were never important!? Not to mention he's weak and for a character with glasses he isn't particularly smart. Our Main character is nothing but middle aged man who's defining physical characteristics is his white natural perm. Yet I see them as all irreplaceable to story that is Gintama. \\n\r\nSince Gintoki is our protagonist I'll use him as a stand-in for \"characters\" in the anime. Gintoki gets a sad backstory like every other MC, but not once has this been used as a direct way to lead to story forward, hell it's not even fully revealed until later down the line. Not that it's wrong to have anime do that but I admire this about Gintama because Sorachi managed to pull off a Shonen character like this. Gintoki doesn't even have a special move or a legendary weapon. He wields a wooden sword with \"Lake Toya\" written on it. At first you think it has some super special significance but it doesn't. (LIGHT SPOILER: It's from a tv ad) Gintoki will extort money from anyone even if it were kids or his own friends. He's a freelancer with too much time that never pays his rent. The only redeeming quality he has is his sense of responsibility, which he doesn't directly show but he would put his life on the line for it. While that one part might seem typical of a shonen character, the way it's presented is nothing like it.\\n\r\nSorachi wanted every character have their faults shine rather than the typical \"determination/will\" of a shonen or any anime to be in fact. This isn't a new concept to say the least but it's done well and fits perfectly for the type of anime(whatever type of anime this is lol) it is. With most anime in terms of shonen it's defeat the strongest villain, and then it continues until there are stronger  enemies. With the exception to very few the antagonists in this anime are not flushed out at all. I at times end up feeling for them or relating to them as well. You could even argue at times that the antagonist could have been a better protagonist. I hope you fall in love with the characters as much as I have. (So yeah it was never a 1/10 but rather a -100/10 so bad that it's good, sort of like those really bad jokes your friends say but you can't stop laughing )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI cried, I laughed, I smiled. Sometimes all at the same time. I learned while laughing. You know how in school you would wish learning wasn't so boring? Gintama is the mom that gives you lectures while making them fun. Now I know that's a weird way to put it, but if Gintama has taught me anything it's that it's fine that way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nGintama 2015 was everything the previous seasons were and little more, this is why I spoke about Gintama as a whole, but in particular 2015 is my favorite so far. Same old Gintama. I love every second of this and I will miss this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnybody can write a review about their favorite series and make it seem good, but this review honestly doesn't do it any justice. As the reader you can think I'm being biased and being just a fanboy. But if an anime doesn't make you want to be biased or a fanboy how good was it really? Either way, biased or not I tried laying it bare bones at some parts for you while not spoiling much at all. \\n",

            "content": "*The following review contains major spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.*\r\n316 episodes. 17 OPs. 21 ED. Over a decade on the air. The journey of Gintama is a truly massive one, starting from humble beginnings but growing in leaps and bounds, surpassing its limits with every confident shattering of its modus operandi, blowing my expectations out of the water time and time again until it becomes almost comical to look back on my earlier posts and realize just how completely unprepared I was for the gargantuan\u2026 thing this story would become. Ideas and histories hinted at back in the very first cours will grow anddevelop into sprawling sub-epics of loss, redemption and determination, all twisting around each other in a single, ever-tangling vine of a narrative that is just as confident lobbing a volley of high-speed dick jokes at your face as it is letting its characters suffer, fight, break, and rise again over the course of a titanic struggle against the bonds of the past. Gintama is a show that never sits still, never rests on its laurels, always feeling like it has more to say, more stories to tell, more triumphs to reach, more despair to wallow in, something new to add to the living, breathing ecosystem of its vision of Edo and every single fantastic character inhabiting it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I have loved every single second of it, from the sharply observed meta understanding of its own place in popular culture to the intimately realized portraits of broken people picking themselves back up, from the endless wellspring of high-stakes comedy high-wire acts to the fist-pumping awe of the action scenes, through laughter and tears and shock and heartbreak and hope and joy and literally every single second Kagura is on screen. I love this show like I love few other pieces of entertainment, the kind of all-consuming love that sometimes scares me with how deeply it affects me. Almost no other story I\u2019ve seen is this brazenly confident about its potential, this sure and steadfast in its convictions, this secure in its ability to deliver on every single endeavor it embarks upon. The fact that it\u2019s only been getting better and better over these past 300 episodes, never once falling into an extended slump or betraying its promises, is nothing short of a miracle. Gintama should have peaked a hundred times by this point. But every time I think it\u2019s gone as far as it can go, that it\u2019s laid all of its cards on the table and reached the best possible version of itself it can be, it blows my mind all over again, proving that there is not a single goddamn limit to what this show is able to achieve. The stakes keep growing, the playing field keeps growing, the emotions keep growing, the climaxes keep growing, and yet it never once loses sight of the absurd, ridiculous, self-assured, achingly human core around which everything revolves.\\n\\n\r\nSo when I say that this season has been the best Gintama has ever been, know that I mean that statement with every fiber of my being.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s notable that Gintama\u00b0 has been perhaps the most focused the show has ever been. The aftereffects of the Pinky Promise arc in the climax of last season marked a turning point in the show\u2019s narrative that there really was no going back from. It was a sign that we were starting to enter the final act of this world, that the passions and confrontations were growing too massive for Edo to contain without cracking from the pressure. And while the first two thirds of this season were still just as wonderfully diverse as Gintama\u2019s always been, nonsensical and touching and never anything less than brilliant, there was a sense of anticipation in the proceedings that was never there before. The players on the massive field of Edo, from the Shogun to Katsura and everyone in between, were all preparing for battle. Massive legacy anchors from Sakamoto to Takasugi were starting to appear more regularly. And it wasn\u2019t uncommon for seemingly self-contained arcs and stories to nevertheless point at, or even end with, hints at the bigger picture, the car crash in waiting just underneath the surface. This entire season was essentially one long build-up, using the skin of Gintama\u2019s not-so-status quo as a cover to position the pieces that had been set in motion by last season's finale. It was like watching a bomb\u2019s timer tick down in slow motion, unable to look away as the impending catastrophe just kept drawing closer and closer with every sinister flick of Takasugi\u2019s bloodstained sword.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the final third of this season saw that bomb explode, and the result is the single greatest 17 episode stretch of Gintama\u2019s entire history.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot overstate how completely and utterly the combined impact of the Shogun Assassination arc and Farewell Shinsengumi arc obliterated my expectations. This wasn\u2019t just one massive climax to the season; this was the breaking point for the entire goddamn show up until now. This was the culmination of countless hours of growth and development, of Gintoki overcoming his survivor\u2019s guilt, of Katsura coming to terms with the responsibilities of fighting for a nation, of Takasugi\u2019s collapse into the black pits of his despair, of Kagura\u2019s determination to break free of her heritage and just be a normal girl living a normal life, of Hijikata trying to keep his family from falling apart all over again, of Okita grappling with his self-loathing, of Shigeshige\u2019s desire to do right by the people under his care, of the shadow of Amanto oppression that\u2019s always been leering at us through the slits in the show\u2019s armor, of every single step forward our heroes have made in pursuit of the future waiting just beyond their reach. This was the moment where everything we\u2019ve been fighting for comes crashing together in a single, furious battle for the soul of a nation, putting everything we\u2019ve come to care about over the past 300 episodes on the line. This is what every arc, every bond, every expression of love, every moment we\u2019ve cheered for the extended Odd Jobs family, has been building towards.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it. Is. EVERYTHING. The word \u201cepic\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice; the collapse and rebirth of Edo is the stuff of legends. It\u2019s bombastic and chaotic, bloody and intense, agonizing in the pain it levels at those we\u2019ve become so close to, heartbreaking in the depths of human despair it reveals, yet also uplifting, inspiring, cathartic, charged like a livewire on hope and determination. Takasugi\u2019s backstory made me cry harder than perhaps I\u2019ve ever cried on this show. Shigeshige\u2019s death completely destroyed me and upended everything this story was capable of. And then, Hijikata\u2019s farewell pulled me back together all over again. In this fiery crucible, everybody- including me- is beaten down, broken, and forged anew, casting their old shells off and stepping reborn into a new, more dangerous, but also more loving world. And you feel the unbearable weight of that loss, of every ray of light we lost along the way, but also of just how brightly the sun still shines ahead of us. We\u2019ve turned a page in Gintama\u2019s history that there\u2019s no going back from, and the battle that marks this rebirth is all the proof you need at just what a stunning new chapter this is going to be. This is a climax I rank right up with FMA\u2019s Promised Day as one of the greatest epic finales in anime history. It\u2019s that goddamn amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWe really are in the final stretch now. The status quo has been completely shattered, and everyone is ready to face the end. The new Shogun is still exerting the Amanto\u2019s cruenty over Edo. Takasugi and Kamui remain at large. Our heroes are splintered, yet closer together than ever before. The new world we\u2019ve been fighting so hard to reach is finally here. Now, all that\u2019s left is to defend it with all our might. And I\u2019m wise enough by now not to think I\u2019m ready for what comes next. I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not ready for all the explosive, heartwrenching moments still to come. I\u2019m not ready for all the pain we still have yet to suffer. I will never be ready to bid this show goodbye. But I will face it all the same, silver soul shining strong, just as Gintoki would want me to. Because I have never been more hopeful for these idiots. I have never been more certain that when the clouds eventually clear, the sun will still be shining down with all its might. I have never been more proud of how far they\u2019ve all come. And I have never been more excited to watch them soar.\\n\\n\r\nSo godspeed, Gintama. Welcome to your final chapter. I can\u2019t wait until you blow my mind all over again.",

            "content": "I don't do very long reviews so I'll be mildly brief while trying to express my thoughts. There should be no spoilers except if you consider the names of the Arcs themselves to be spoilers.\r\nComedy:\r\nComedy is one of the main aspects of Gintama and it does an okay job this season, however it does not reach the heights that previous seasons had and I don't think there are any truly hilarious episodes this time around. While I feel the main series ranges from very amusing to \"miss\" this one more ranges from \"meh\" to miss. It's amusing as a timesink but not much aside fromthat. \\n\\n\r\nThe serious \"main\" arcs:\\n\\n\r\nIn Gintama's serious arcs, comedy pretty much completely goes out of the window save for a few gags during the initial opening scenes before they get down to business. I've frankly found most of gintama's serious arcs quite boring although there have been a few that have been okay. The main reason I rated the first 201 episode season 7 rather than 8 was due to the prevelance of serious arcs in the latter half, which I found very generic and dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe elephant in the room with this season is the two ending arcs, so I'll get onto those.\\n\\n\r\nThe Shogun Assassination Arc and the Goodbye Shinsengumi Arc are constantly praised as some of the highpoints of the series, so when I went in I was expecting a step above the throwaway characters and melodramatic speeches of their regular (serious) arcs. However, aside from the fact that most the arc-specific characters are actually recurring ones rather than throwaway introduced ones, not much changed.\\n\\n\r\nSA Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThe SA Arc started off on a fairly simple premise and setup, but beyond that the arc does not evolve much at all except passable and clich\u00e9 plot developments in order to setup the big fights. I can understand why people really liked this, as it sets up fights that have been building up for hundreds of episodes, however the writing itself is thin and weak. I only mention this because I see people constantly call these two arcs \"the best shounen arcs\" around with amazing writing.. which is really not the case. Yes they're pretty \"hype\", but a writing masterclass they are not. It's all very generic as far as shounen goes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pet peeve I had with the SA (and Goodbye) arc was the very annoying trope of loads of major characters getting serious but conveniently non-fatal wounds to be knocked out of action. Yes obviously Gintama butchering all of its characters would just be stupid and out of tone with the show, but they keep reusing this trope over and over and it frankly gets irritating when you see the 15th major/recurring character within 5 episodes get a serious but conveniently non-fatal wound (in dramatic slow-mo) to remove them from the fight. It's just cheap drama.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye, Shinsengumi Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThis arc was a little different, the plot wasn't quite as generic and it involves some actually major characters rather than simply recurring ones. However, that went mainly down the drain due to quite a few flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe melodramatic speeches that were mercifully brief or not as prominent during the SA arc make a comeback... and a very strong one at that. This arc can be summed up by 10 seconds of action, 2 minutes of overly-sentimental speeches (with a bonus of finishing each other's sentences during them) followed by 3 minutes of flashback. The flashback was a serious issue in this arc, I'd say well over 50% of it is pure flashback, it frankly feels like 70%+ is. While some of it is useful using flashbacks so excessively is frankly just lazy storytelling to make up for the lack of it beforehand.\\n\r\nThe melodramatic speeches and the flashbacks are the main issues with this arc for me - what was actually a fairly interesting premise was kinda ruined every time the brief period of action was to be interrupted by yet another speech or flashback. And yes, the speeches do not really say anything of note, they are fairly typical shounen speeches.\\n\\n\r\nGintama also has a serious problem of constantly making the bad guys into good guys mid-arc and getting people to switch allegiances at the drop of a hat because one of their underlings just went \"oh he was actually doing it for this reason he was good all along.\" It feels like they do this every time, it gets pretty tedious.\\n\\n\r\nI do not think the two ending arcs were bad, in the context of the series as a whole they were okay, just disappointing. I did not go in expecting a masterpiece at all, I am quite used to the anime community proclaiming many an average series to be masterpieces, however, I was at least expecting something at least \"good\" compared to its other serious arcs. Frankly, it was still as generic as it got, even if it did involve characters with hundreds of episodes of introduction. Compared to the complete snoozefest I found most the other serious Gintama arcs to be, I guess it was slightly better.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big issues I had with Gintama's serious arcs in general was also in connection with its more goofy (and superior) episodes. It makes light of many anime tropes, and yet when it comes down its own serious arcs.. it becomes as clich\u00e9 and generic as you get. I do find it distracting that it mocks tropes and anime clich\u00e9s and then within its own serious arcs it employs them to an extent that goes beyond the very anime it mocks. It just seems very weird to me. You'd think such a self-aware anime would at least try and avoid being that tropey, but I guess not.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that the season as a whole was okay. Fans of previous series will be entertained, if you found all the serious arcs of previous series to be a bore.. nothing will probably change with this one, the second half is mostly serious.",

People never take the time to get used to it's weirdness, but once they do get comfortable and accept it, you'll have almost nothing that can compare to it.

Gintama is not like most anime's out there and I think that's why it's so good. \r\nStory - 10:\r\nI give the story a 10/10 because even though it doesn't have much of a story line, each episode has it's own little arcs and story about Gin or the Shinsengumi or Hasegawa. Each episode is extremely random and hilarious. But not all episodes are all about comedy. There are also serious and epic arcs that showcaseintense action scenes and serious plots.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10:\\n\r\nI loved the art and drawing style. To the funny faces to the serious ones. The drawings catch my attention and I'm instantly hooked. I don't know anything about art or drawing styles but Gintama is easy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10:\\n\r\nI think this season of Gintama had the best soundtracks. It used some of the same background music from the other seasons but there is this one episode, this one arc that uses the opening to its advantage, and created an epic fighting scene. I love all the openings and endings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nI think the characters are what makes this anime really enjoyable. As you watched from the very beginning of the anime, from season one to now, you see how much the characters have grown and how much closer they are to each other now. I loved the character development and how you learn something new about each character throughout the season. Everyone feels like family. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Gintama waay too much, so much that I'm rewatching it about ten thousand times. I honestly have to say that Gintama is my #1 favorite anime and no other anime could top this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10000:\\n\r\nOverall, Gintama is awesome. It might be hard at first to get into the anime but once you hit about the 60 episode mark from the first season, that's when the real awesome stuff starts. This is a very good anime that everyone should try out. It funny, action-y, epic, realistic (in some ways but not really), and really awesome. \\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is all my opinion since we're entitled to our own.",

            "content": "Crazy as it might seem, I knew from the moment that Gintama came back last year, that I would be floored by the amazingness. Not just because I read the manga but because of the stunning way it was adapted. Here's a more detailed review.\r\nStory (10): No matter how stupid or crazy or just plain random Gintama is, the story of each arc is a masterpiece. It's riveting, it's engaging, it's emotional. It's every indescribable feeling I had while I was watching each episode. I loved that the characters would make you laugh like you're gonna pop your head off then afterwards make you cryyour eyes out till it rolls on the floor then make you laugh again. It's polarizing...but in a good way. I dunno how Gori-sensei does it, but he should be crowned with a crown of bananas.  What's also so masterful about the story of this particular Gintama comeback is that it hits into a lot of the core arcs in the manga and it gives more detail about the relationships of each character and their struggles. We are given more than just a peek into what's happening and that's why it's superb.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): Gintama is not like that lollipop-bubblegum cute anime that you all know and love. In terms of art itself, Gintama is not necessarily up there. But in my mind it is. I love how distinct and unique each character is and how bold some of them are. I love how they can play with each character and somehow make them seem like they have another personality and it's too funny I can't. But what I think truly brings my score for Gintama so high up is that the animation of the fight scenes, does not shy away from absolute perfection. It's raw, rugged yet fluid and they ain't afraid to show blood y'all. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10): There's a few recurring background music that you can hear if a scene is absolutely funny or wickedly sad. It's constant with Gintama, yet it just makes me cry all the fcking time. I'm sorry I just had to curse. Especially if it involves flashbacks. GDI. Then the amazing opening and ending themes for the whole span of Gintama. I love, adore and wanna marry every single one of the artists. They just brought everything together. I just hope SPYAIR made one for this season though but all in all, perfect!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): Do I need to go into detail with this? Every character in Gintama is just so lovable and hurts you like you've been stabbed a 1000 times yet they keep you alive just so that they can stab you more and more. The characters absolutely funny and out of it and you love them soooooo much! I can't get enough of them\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If you watch Gintama and not enjoy yourself, are you hollow inside? One aspect of Gintama is it ability to make people laugh (as well as cry) and even if you cry, you'll enjoy the show so much. It's the perfect binge watch show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): GINTAMA IS UTTER PERFECTION KBYE",

            "content": "Note this review covers all of Gintama up until the end of 2015 since I don't like having to rate seasons of the same show. I have watched a lot of long running anime and I don't think I have enjoyed a long show more than Gintama. While it is primarily a comedy (probably the funniest comedy I have ever watched) Gintama also covers many genres including action, tragedy, and most others to some degree. None of these sub genres are half assed either Gintama knows when to alter its tone from its predominantly silly style to other style to fit their stories beautifully. Itsoverall story (yes it does have one) starts off really slow as you would expect from a long running show but gaining it along the way is incredibly rewarding and a very fun journey. Its episodic and small arc (3-5) episode nature make binge watching it so much more enjoyable than most other  long running anime since no episode or arc never outstays its welcome and always provides a fresh new experience. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has gone through many art upgrades over the years and while it may have never reached Ufotable level and the animation may not always be consistently amazing Gintama puts on a beautiful spectacle at the most important moments in the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic taste is very subjective but I feel that of all the long running shows, with the exception of Full Metal Alchemist + Brotherhood, Gintama has the strongest lineup of openings and endings. Openings 5 and 13 as well as ending 17 are my favorites as Does and Spyair have caused me to hit the replay button many times. The music within the anime is great to as it always fits the tone the show is going for and one tune in particular almost brought me to tears on its own. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have to be the strongest part of the show. The benefits of being a long running multi-genre anime means you get to see the light hearted and hilarious nature of the main cast as well as the dark and serious without having to sacrifice one for the other. Personally my favorite characters are Gintoki the protagonist, Katsura, and Hijikata. All three of them are hilarious in their own unique ways and have compelling stories that make me appreciate them infinitely more than if Gintama was simply just a comedy anime.",

So keep your eyes open, no matter how dark the night ahead may be.'\r\nGintama has finally, or rather, unfortunately, rolled up the sleeves and laid the foundations for its final showdown. What our Gin-san doesn't know is that the night could be darker than he thought.  All the unresolved questions, all the open wounds will be figured out in the second half of the season, leading us to an end which will completely satisfyin a first moment, but looking back, we'll leave a huge gap wanting us for a new series to come out so badly, like a madao is looking for a job, the desperation will tie us in a indissoluble bond. So get ready for some dark sleepless nights. The hype is real and it will keep your eyes very open! However sooner or later, it should have happened, so it's better to not overthink it and put our Tama to rest. Obviously i mean souls! not OO ..ok, you didn't get it.\\n\r\nGetting more in details, the action won't be the absolute protagonist of the season, in fact it will make room, in its usual style, to a good slice of comedy which will make the series start off with a bang and keep the pace on till the last 2 arcs, but this is legit, it just want to gift us ..sigh.. its last lightheartedness's moments ..sigh.. ok i'm not crying.. really.. so get a full taste as long as you can.\\n\r\nThe overall plot will be a real turning point, showing us a tons of glorious flashbacks joining all the puzzle's pieces on the troubled past of the legendary Joi team.\\n\r\nThe result is a perfect blend of action, drama, emotion and wit which will make you die from laughing up to cry for sadness, in poor words, the perfect anime. I'm not surprised it's ranked #1 because even with great efforts you won't find any flaws. If you did, i throw you an anpan right in the face.\\n\r\nWhat truly make gintama to shine soo bright lies in its capacity (under  all the jokes and crap) to teach us little life lessons touching the deepest part of ourselves. Each stand alone episode will satisfy more than a christmas lunch and this is a win-win for a series. The emotional osts bind up divinely to the moving moments and when the going gets tough the music is not lagging behind, exuding true Epicness in each battle theme. (Kabukicho 4 devas theme was memorable).\\n\r\nThe animation on the whole is good and quickly develops every season. It's not on the same level as ufotable but this really doesn't matter because you will spend 3/4 of episodes with the tears in your eyes from laughing or you're too much focused on what's going on to pay attention. \\n\r\nThe only complaint i could say for Gintama is the frequent use of kanji in the gags, but this is absolutely normal considering it's a japanese show, so the best compliment you can ever give to this anime is: \\n\r\nI wanted to be japanese just to understand better gintama!! :P\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this series and you're wondering why it's so popular, all i can say is, give it a try, seriously, it will worth every minute. \\n\r\nThis anime and all its fantastic characters will show you how strong or weak people can be, how fragile or precious they are, you will discover the true meaning of Samurai.",

            "content": "Gintama, known for gag series full of parodies that breaks the copyright law and some of them are taboo like politics as its reference, breaking the 4th wall with a wild abandon, and bodily crude punchlines. That's the Overall Image of Gintama.\r\nNevertheless, the series have been overshadowed by serious stories at the later part of the show. I'm probably wondering what happened to Sorachi-sensei, I don't know how many more characters Gori-Sensei intends to kill off,  he turned the Comedic Gintama into Tragic Gintama and even in the on-going manga, though he killed many characters before, even in the very first anime series ofGintama.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n ~STORY~\\n\r\nA weekly anime spanned for 51 episode that took a year to complete. Filled with humorous episodic and frame stories, but now it's known for its continuous serious arcs. The pacing was ok with a couple of two fillers in the first two episodes, at least it wasn't rushed nor it was slow, the episodes fits the arrangement, but they didn't adapted some arcs and chapters:\\n\r\n|| Kagura's boyfriend arc: 419-422\\n\r\n|| Excalibur arc: 424-429 // 430 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| Homeless arc: 431-433 // 435/444 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| HDZ48 arc: 445-449 // 487 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| Love Potion arc: 492-496 (Upcoming OVA)\\n\r\n|| Guardian Spirits arc: 499-501 \\n\r\n|| End of Farewell Shinsengumi: 551\\n\r\n|| Rakuyou Arc: 552+ \\n\\n\r\nThe Story was mixed with complex and simple ways of telling what it wants, sometimes the comedy gets absurd and sometimes they mixed it with ethics and there are few situations that it gets a full arc whether it\u2019s comedy or not by the end of it. The latest season of Gintama have more complexed themes than before, like Gender Issues, Military Code, Betrayal, Politics, War, and Death, and there's also some hidden references used by Sorachi which was mentioned in featured articles:\\n\r\n|| http://myanimelist.net/featured/407 \\n\r\n|| http://myanimelist.net/featured/1512\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not unique to be honest, but what makes Gintama exceptional was its Gag Shounen Series that have shown great flexibility on using themes. Gintama is in the middle of Shounen and Seinen Demographic, it's officially Shounen which gives the whole series an action scenes and is the reason why it prevents Gintama from killing the main characters, to feel as though the principal cast is at risk is what I want. Kondo's death was teased several times throughout this arc, but I never thought they'd actually kill him. The series wants to demonstrate the true cost of war, but it never reaches Game of Thrones levels, where every character felt like they are going to killed anytime, but in this season it isn't yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe Comedy was very subjective, it's a hit or miss to many viewers especially to those who doesn't live in Japan, since most of the parodies were taken there, even the translators have to interpret what it means just to make the jokes reasonable, and sometimes it gets absurd which doesn't make any sense. At least there were some funny episodes which had ethical values on it, especially I like how they put funny episodes in the beginning and ends sadly, welp there's only 20 episodes of serious episodes and 31 for comedy episodes.\\n\r\nThen there's the Action and if a series has this, it means it's Shounen, which means cliched or common or anything that doesn't make the Anime better, well in terms of Action I didn't see any incantations, shouting their techniques or anything, which most of the shounen does, Gintama is a Straight Action without showing Power, Titles or Anything which is appealing for kids. Also Gintama haven't won any of the major arcs, they might have a cliched motivation and action but it's a fact that the two serious arcs was not about winning. Being victorious in the end of the show is what most of the shounen shows, but this season, there are now victory shouts nor praises in the end, it's just sad. The main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other sh\u014dnen series.\\n\r\nThe Drama was the creme of Gintama, this series excels on it despite of the vast humorous chapters and episodes of the whole series, it makes every character likable and unique also gives them unpredictable future. So far Gintama is taking its Drama into a new level which destroys any Jokes or Gag Trope which was built before. Throughout the serious arcs, there have now been two character deaths. It is the evidence of how much Gintama has changed these past months. Although the main characters are still funny and durable, the fact that death is now an actual possibility.\\n\\n\r\n|| Categories \\n\r\nAliens | Alternate History | Episodic | Gag | Parody | Samurai | Shinsengumi | Strong Male Lead\\n\\n\r\n|| Tropes\\n\r\nArc Villain | Back-to-Back Badasses: | Dramatic Irony | Foreshadowing | Red Baron | Running Gag | Ship Tease | Wham Episode | Wham Line\\n\\n\r\n|| Literary Techniques \\n\r\nBackstory | Flashback | Frame story | Plot twist | Irony | Metaphor\\n\\n\r\nGintama(2015) the latest season of Gintama ended with a Great Ending. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nGintama has a good art overall, not realistic but not standard or common, it's quite unique and memorable. \\n\r\nThe Director was able to achieve the specific mood it's trying to convey, and the anime has surpass most of the Mangaka's work, but sometimes there're some broken or haphazard scenes. \\n\r\nThe Background is good but not as good as Shaft's Backgrounds, well the background is not memorable, it did a good job as a support artwork.\\n\r\nThe Character Design is the spotlight of the Art category, it matches the personality with memorable and unique design to each individual which makes them easy to recognize also gives them original characteristics and depth on their personalities. \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ \\n\r\nThe Seiyuu's are the best ever in Sound category, all characters who have worked in Gintama turned into the best Seiyuus in the Anime Industry which makes them Exceptional. They've easily matched the character and did a good job on conveying them in different situations whether it's funny or serious.\\n\r\nThe Background music is still the same, but they've added some new music to fit in the serious arc. The BGM is not that much, it's not average nor bad, actually it fits the anime but it still lacks, but it does not matter as long as it did a good job on it. The BGM fits the anime, can't be used as a track on something else, unlike some BGM where you can easily listen to them and some can give you some goosebumps, so it's exclusive for Gintama only.\\n\r\nThe Opening and the Ending is good as always, memorable visuals and music and fits the anime, unlike the BGM, the OP/ED were exceptional, they've even foreshadowed the individual cour, and the Last ED \"Acchi Muite\" was very deep that have shown the progress from the past which has been made throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ \\n\r\nThe Highlight of the Show, they are well rounded, flawed but with strengths, and usually they are stupid most of the time. Whenever they overreact during humorous episodes it makes them unrealistic but funny, but not on serious ones, where they act in realistic way. \\n\r\nThe characters were made exclusively to Japanese, that's why it's hard to relate on them, though sometimes they were relatable to everyy people when they used metaphors, but still they are enjoyable to watch. \\n\r\nThe characters have a small character development, the series is more focused on fleshing them out than making them ideal, at the same time the characters were balanced even some of them foils each other.\\n\r\nThe Real Antagonist is a mystery, for now there's few antagonist that have motivation, backgrounds, and depths like the other characters, they were not used as a plot device to progress the story, though I'm talking about the serious arc, most of the funny arcs have empty characters who disappears after their episode ended. \\n\r\nEvery characters are well rounded, except during humorous episodes, where they were usually doing their gag antics. They are well rounded when the story takes a serious turn, that's the time where the characters gets unpredictable even the supporting cast is not an exemption. \\n\r\nNarration was mostly did by the characters, I don't have any problem with their perspective literary technique, sometimes they break the 4th wall through their narration. \\n\r\nI love the characters in Gintama, though some of them were dealt as a comedy device and disappears in the series. The Supporting and the Main Characters are original and unique, the more the story goes, the more it uncovers their reasons, most of them have depth that even with their usual antics have been overshadowed. The anime have not yet covered the depth of some characters, so probably I'll hate some of them if I haven't read the manga. \\n\r\nGintama has the most memorable characters of all time in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nMajority of those who've watched Gintama have enjoyed this, and I'm not an exception, well it's easy to get hooked on an anime full of comedies, but what I've really loved in this anime was the Paradox Combination of it, Gintama is the only Anime that was able to combine the impossible, it's like \"Yin and Yang\" Known for the Comedy Gag Parody but Gets Serious filled with Drama and sometimes adds a Tragedy. Historical and Sci-Fi, an impossible combination done right, but also known for the alternate reality of the history in Japan. The best are the characters, they are funny yet so deep that the more the story progresses, you've got to know them and eventually surprises you in the process especially in serious arcs. \\n\r\nThis anime is not a good starter for newbies and non-anime/fans, because the whole series relies on the knowledge of the audience if it will be entertaining or not, They might like it but they might not get the meaning of some jokes and references throughout the whole series, but the series' continuity-lite nature ensures that new viewers won't feel totally left out.\\n\r\nRe-Watching Gintama adds my enjoyment throughout the series, I like the meaningful messages and laughable antics, but this Gintama season is the Saddest of all, it's easy to re-watch/re-read the whole series than to re-watch latest season. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nStory: 8 - Creative Gag anime Shounen Premise with Seinen Elements \\n\r\nArt: 8 - Directed and Executed better than the manga\\n\r\nSound: 7 - Great VA and OP/ED, the BGM does it job well but not memorable\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 - The Highlight of the Show \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I love this anime",

            "content": "Ah, this is my first review in a while, but I thought I might as well do a review of the #1 spot on MAL. My last review was probably some time last year, I don't remember doing one at all this year. Enough about my life, that's too boring, so let's get to the review.\r\nGintama is an anime that I stopped at episode 12 once because... well, uhm, I didn't want to watch a 300+ episode series on a small as hell screen aka my laptop. The site now continues to lie to me, and says it took me 119 days to complete it,when it reality, it really only took me around 3 days to finish. Well, that was the first season. The site is telling the truth when it comes to the seasons after it, which is Gintama', Gintama': Enchousen and this current season... \"Gintama Circle Thingy At Top\" is definitely what it is meant to be called. But, I binged Gintama very quickly, and I enjoyed it. A lot. Gintama has come to be one of my favorite series, but I'm a pleb and don't watch much anime, so who knows, something might beat it.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is a series of lots of laughs, and also tears streaming down your face. This particular season done exactly that, and delivered both quite well. The story about this particular Gintama, well, all I can say, is it's like any other Gintama. Nothing has changed. Gintama has always been a mix of hilarious, funny arcs and serious, sentimental arcs. It hasn't changed since Gintama has first begun. So that's why I feel I should have no need to explain the story to anyone who is familiar with Gintama.\\n\r\nIt's your same old Gintama, nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care much for art style and animation in anime, so I don't have much to say with it. As long as the story is good, and the anime is enjoyable, I'll watch it regardless of animation/art. But, the art for this specific Gintama doesn't seem to have changed at all from the others, or I suck and can't notice it, but I'm pretty sure it's been the same for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are great, which was expected because Gintama never fails on their openings and endings. I don't listen to endings much, but I do listen to them once and then download them. It's kinda pointless, but not really. The reason I skip them is because I suck and I really want to get to the next episode. I don't have a minute to spare apparently.\\n\\n\r\nThe same as the usual Gintama, is pretty much all I've been saying this review. But, it's true. Gintama still hasn't changed which is why I still love every character. From Takasugi to Gintoki, I love every character. Learning about character's pasts is also something I really enjoy. Although, I'm sure anyone would like to learn about a character's past instead of focusing on the present.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is epic, as stated in the start of my review, this is the same old Gintama. Nothing has changed. It's the show that everybody has loved for all these years.\\n\r\nIt's.... Gintama Circle Thingy At Top, also known as \"Gintama: Season 3\". Or season 7, depends. Though, it is technica- No, it is season 3.\\n\r\nAnyway, this show is awesome, I hope you all enjoy it too.\\n\\n\r\nHmm, was that review shit? I dunno. Haven't written one in a while.\\n\r\nWell, baiiiii!",

So if yall ever plan on ever watching this anime I highly recommend it, even though at first the show might seem awkward and weird since it takes that different route compare to other anime where the characters are always training or doing something productive, Gintama spends its episoderather horsing around and making a lore based off those moments of troll but it is indeed a spectacular anime.",

The one thing I really like about this anime is the characters, they are so troll-y, different from most characters I've seen in anime.

            "content": "Aye! here to make a quick review about \"Gintama\". \r\nGintama is the best anime I have ever watch that's long running, that isn't generic and predictable. It's pretty Original and YES it does have a plot.\r\nIntroduction\r\n10/10\r\nThe story revolves around a deadbeat samurai who is extremely lazy and does nothing but read shounen jump all day. His dream is neither to be the \"King of the samurai\", nor to be Hokage. He just wants his hair to be straight. He has deadfish eyes and has zero motivation to be called a main character. This only adds to his charms as a character though. He also seemsto have a pretty dark past behind him, which won't be revealed right outta the blue. The story focuses on how he meets various people and runs into trouble while having to fight and deal with extremely funny and awkward situations.\\n\\n\r\nPace and plot\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe story and plot are pretty unique and original. The series as a whole has a slow start from 1 - 30 episodes (Because it focuses on introducing the characters).  Tbh I dropped the series around episode 25 thinking it was \"Mediocre\" only to come back to it months later, when I ran out of Anime' to watch. AND BOY! was I glad I did. It's one of those series where every episode ends up relating to the plot one way or another. The pacing was pretty good. The plot was pretty intense and didn't fail to keep me at the edge of my seat. It was an amazing series for me personally. The plot was both sad and heartwarming. The show as a whole, NEVER fails to give you the experience of having watched the best of almost all genre. It can be the most funny one episode and it can turn into the most saddest the next and an Action packed episode the next. Honesty don't experience Anime these days that cover all those in one series.\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\n20/10\\n\r\nThis series is soo funny that it can be considered as \"Comedy gold\". It has some 18+ jokes with censored nudity and funny moments. The predicament Gintoki gets himself into each time is hilarious and funny. The show forcast a lot of parody of series like Bleach, One piece, Naruto and many more. The parodies are not just confined to anime alone as they have funny parodies of american movies, Actors, Famous franchise like \"Star wars\" and many more. If you ever wanna laugh your ass off to pure comedy gold, this series is defo the best one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all independent with great back story. They were introduced well and are far from your average cliche background character. Gintama is one of the shows where it's hard to hate on any character.  Gintoki to me is personally a troll. He may seem like he doesn't care but ends up getting himself into trouble cuz he cared too much about someone else' problems. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation from older episode like episode 1 are really nothing special. If I had to compare them they're basic 3:4 animation that's the same as the animation for long running series like \"Naruto\". However, in the 2015 anime that covered episode 316, the animation is defo refined and well made compared to the older seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment\\n\r\n30/10\\n\r\nIt really is one of the best series anyone could ever watch. Hopefully this review helped you to at least check this anime out. Though i'll have to warn you about the first 30 or so episodes which just focuses on introductions, but I promise there would be zero regret after finishing the series.",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to laugh so hard that it feels like you're dying? Well, then this season is no different from any of its predecessors. The season dives straight into its main focus which is comedy and gives us all sorts of parodies and laughs that viewers can relate to other shows, which is what makes it so great. However, this season is not all laughs. As with this season, the show moves into some of the more serious arcs\u2014a must see for any fan of Gintama.\r\nBesides starting out with heavy action, comedy is one of the best ways to make people continue watchinga show. To hook the viewers into the first few episodes is what the producers try to do each season. If you don\u2019t start off with something funny in a show that is so well-known for its way of doing parodies and comedy, then there\u2019s no way the viewers are going to continue watching. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like a good ol\u2019 DBZ parody to start itself off? I know I do.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t like about how the season went is the skipping of some of the smaller arcs. Gintama has always been faithful at adapting all its arcs, but this season was quite different. This may be due to pushing it for OVAs to sell, or maybe they just didn\u2019t have the time slots available. That or something came up within the studio to make them adapt the bigger arcs earlier.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I guess we should talk about the highly anticipated arcs that a lot of people have been waiting for since the announcement of the season. Without trying to spoil, these arcs provide a lot to the watchers as to what\u2019s happening to some of the most known groups/people in the Gintama franchise.  The first arc is the Shogun arc which obviously focuses on the Shogun himself but also his enemies. Compared to the other big arcs, I\u2019d say this was a pretty good arc and rivaled some of the other ones from the past seasons. If you thought that was all for the big arcs, then think again! Not only do we get one major roller coaster arc this season, but two. The other being the Shinsengumi arc which focuses on the Police force of Edo and two other \u201cprominent\u201d groups\u2014the Joui rebels and the Mimawarigumi. Unlike the previous arc, this arc is more about emotion than it is about action. While this arc does have action, I wouldn\u2019t put it ahead of the arc before it in that sense. I still enjoyed this arc though because it shows us some backstory of some of the Shinsengumi, the Mimawarigumi, and even Gintoki. These two arcs go hand-in-hand as the former leads into the latter. Just what is in store for our beloved characters?\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, it has been up and down here and there. Mostly a hit though. Like most shows, or at least ones that want to stand out in scenes, the visuals will go above and beyond then the usual to look when it needs to. The comedy arcs were also pretty good in terms of its animation, but there were times when the animation took a turn down and looked pretty bad. Expect the animation budget to be really good during the action arcs, especially for the final two arcs. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t bad when it needed to be so there\u2019s nothing major I would note down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it has been really good. The OST was done pretty well and matches the overall mood of what the scene is trying to portray to the viewer\u2014whether its during comedy or action. The OP/ED songs I have mixed feelings for because I\u2019m mainly a fan of catchy songs, but they sounded good and is no different from past season. I\u2019ve been mainly a fan of Gintama\u2019s OP, but this season there was a few EDs I quite enjoyed more so than its OP counterpart, so props to the singers for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like that another season of Gintama ends. The waiting once again begins as per regular tradition. If you haven\u2019t enjoyed this season, then the season to come, which will most likely be the finale, is definitely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nGintama hasn\u2019t changed one bit; it will continue being its same old self until it finally brings a closure to all the characters we love and find so hilarious.\\n",

            "content": "Finally the season has ended and phew, what a journey it was. This season is the first one where I watched it as it aired. I used to be one of those people who were pissed off because Gintama took too many spots on MAL's top anime page but never actually tried to understand why people liked it. I had always been hesitant to start because the premise didn't seem  interesting at all but hey, it only took me 2 months to finish all the available episodes back in 2014 because once I started, I just can't stop. That's just how good this seriesis in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the review of this season!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, Gintama had never been an anime with high budget so please don't expect ufotable's godlike level of animation. For a long-running anime though, I think Gintama has the better animation out there, and especially during the last arc, the animation was pretty top notch. The characters design and the setting has always been distinct (I've always been a fan of their portrayal of 'modern' Edo) and I always thought that Gintama has good art anyway so in this season it still deserves a high score.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is one of my personal favourite aspects of Gintama. I like how they could make a recurring theme to give off different feelings according to the scene they're accompanying. The new OSTs for this season are very good too, especially for the last two arcs (there is one theme song for a new character that I really like in this season, it gives me literal chill everytime I hear it haha).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis season started with a very controversial comedic episode which reminded us that Gintama won't ever be afraid to make jokes on pretty much everything. The episodes which followed are great too (the lottery one is still my fav though) and the comedic arcs in this season are among my favorites (soul switch arc, dekoboko arc, afro arc, feigned illness arc, confessional arc...). They are very well written and always left us with an afterthought in a classic Gintama way.\\n\\n\r\nThe serious arcs, particularly the last two, are among the best in the entire series. The strength of the serious arcs in Gintama is that the pacing of the story is quite fast that our hype was always being kept at high. Also, as an anime-only watcher, a lot of the twist really caught me off-guard, and all I can say is despite some of the twists being typical shounen tropes, the way Gintama handled them are very tasteful. I guess it's because Gintama isn't your typical shounen with teenagers as MCs, which bring us to its endearing characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the reason why I finished all the previous seasons in only two months. If you asked me when I started to love a particular character I would never be able to answer that; they were all slowly creeping on me.\\n\\n\r\nGintama's character are well-rounded. Nobody is perfect; in fact some of the characters are really gross that it may seemed impossible to love them at first, but given the time, they are all endearing in their own ways. I mean, I can sympathize with a gorilla stalker that sometimes walk around naked and a gross homeless old man who seemed to have no ambition in life. My other favourites includes the clumsy leader of a rebellious faction nicknamed \"nobleman of fury\" who keeps an alien (duck?) as a pet, an inhumanely strong little girl with a weird accent who always eats like there's no tomorrow, and a police officer who should have been arrested for exposing everyone with secondhand smoke and for ruining all the good foods in this world with his disgusting mayonnaise addiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters this season are also memorable, but what hits me the most is the development of all the supporting characters. We've known them for 250+ episodes and we're very much already knew their personality traits. However, Sorachi gradually exposed bits by bits of those characters so what I feel that watching Gintama is not about the characters growing, but me knowing them better. I don't know if this makes sense or not, but watching Gintama feels like knowing your friends better in life instead of rooting for a celebrity you've only seen on TVs. So when they're hurt or something bad happened to them, the feels hit me as if something happened to someone I hold dear (okay this is getting out of hand because my inner otaku coming out but whatever). \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the supporting characters in Gintama are too good that they can probably lead their own series. That being said, the MC is by no means being overshadowed by them. Gintoki is deservedly the leader of the bunch, and this season just cemented the fact. There are many instances where Gintoki shines as the best shounen MC I've ever seen, both because his persona and how he deals with his relationship with other characters. He handled all the cliche shounen tropes in a surprising manner that keeps me rooting for him (there's one moment in this season when it's shown that he's really emotionally strong and mature and that was something I rarely saw in shounen jump's heroes).  \\n\\n\r\nGintoki though, has always been a contradiction; he had always been annoyingly talkative but actually he rarely said anything important, he always seemed greedy but when we think about it, he is actually very selfless. In this season, I feel that Gintoki had opened up and showing his true self more (he's talking about his past more, and he's also openly expressing his wishes). All in all, his relationship with all the characters, especially with his Yorozuya family and the Shinsengumi, is the highlight for me in this season.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nHell yeah the fast pacing keeps the enjoyment and the hype real and high. If you still don't get it from my ramblings above I really enjoy this season. Wednesday had been the day I waited the most for these past year (even more than the weekends!)\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the seiyuus is another highlight (especially Sugita and Nakai!) because without them masterfully voicing these weird characters, it won't feel the same. I believe I will listen if Gintama was made into radio series, their voices are already the heart of Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nWatching Gintama actually makes me very picky in watching other anime. It has a complete package that is hard to beat; I bet you it's not easy to make a series where you can laugh a little in between tears because they decided to put a slight comedy in an otherwise very emotional scene. Or makes you laugh like a madman because sometimes it's too funny that you need to stop watching to collect yourself first. And this season just has that perfect mix of comedy and action (and drama too) that I cemented it as one of the best series ever made.\\n",

            "content": "EDIT: This was a review written for April Fools. I wish to thank everyone for brightening my day with all the positive feedback and reactions, it really shows that Gintama has taught us to enjoy a good laugh. The review will stay as is, since my opinions can still be found in it, just written in a backwards kinda way.\r\n~\r\nLadies and gentlemen, feast your eyes upon the most overhyped anime of all time! Watch as our main protagonist uses his wooden sword of sentimentality, cutting into the bleeding hearts of all you emotional thinkers, corrupting your rotten brains with the stench of intellectual destitution! \r\nInthis particular season of Gintama, the author\u2019s masterplan finally takes shape. Every episode of comedy filler, every laugh, and every smile it has pulled from your innocent lips, it was all a ploy to steal your souls. He can now freely attach your emotions to these characters of absurd fiction. With emotional manipulation the anime makes you care for a bunch of clowns, and then takes a darker turn as you become complacent.\\n\\n\r\nWith superior animation it uses thrilling action-scenes and atmospheric direction, blinding you with pretty colors. The show\u2019s visuals are fast-food for the soul, delicious upon tasting it, but ultimately detrimental to your IQ, making you more creative and in touch with your emotions rather than with your cold and logical side.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to wreak havoc on your lowly opinions, by pointing out Gintama\u2019s greatest flaw of all, the horrendous writing and characters. The show has a tendency to make characters relatable and fascinating, only to retcon events so that you can retain those emotional connections, while the story just goes wherever it wants. It is one thing to play with expectations, but another to betray them by doing plot-twists that don\u2019t live up to my personal golden standard. Some characters will receive tragic backstories, only for it to be revealed that none of it mattered, because some current event undid it all or it was all a lie to begin with. Worst of all, on several occasions we see death-flags get raised, only to be ignored in the name of dramatic convenience, just so the few who DO die have more impactful farewells. \\n\\n\r\nI would call the author spineless, but that\u2019d be an insult to invertebrates. I would ask you all to make a drinking-game out of every time you notice plot-armor at play, or a character making an inspirational speech. When you all die of alcohol-poisoning I'll be left in a more agreeable world, one where only I rule over the anime-hegemony. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Gintama has reached a level of worship among anime-fans like no other. To think that the social nature of humanity would override their ability to think logically, it makes me want to give up on everything.\\n\\n\r\nOh and happy April Fools. This show is awesome.",

            "content": "When it comes to sequels, It is often unclear whether it will live up to the quality of its previous installments, and in the case of the fourth season of Gintama fans can be assured: it maintains its defining traits. There continues to be a great variety in the comedy offered, as well as its share of arguably one of the best consequent \"serious\" arcs in the entire series so far, expanding greatly upon the setting itself, as well as its cast of characters. However, it must be mentioned that it comes with a slight controversy amongst the fans, the main concern being the inevitableconclusion the series is heading to, and with that, loosing in the process some of its main charm, the comedy, which mainly affects the last third of the season. Regardless of said matter, Gintama delivers in all of its main aspects in a very satisfying manner, where viewers can observe the culmination of the author's experience in the different aspects the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show follows a similar structure to its previous seasons, following the daily, both chaotic and amusing, lives of the beloved trio of the Yorozuya: Kagura, Shimura Shinpachi and of course Sakata Gintoki. The series is known for its great variety in comedy incorporating different genres from both the East and West, in addition to providing great referential comedy to the variety of different anime to its advantage - Kuroko no Basuke or Saint Seiya anyone? These are often well executed, albeit being in some cases too repetitive. Naturally, it is not all referential comedy: it has its share of situational comedy, or just simple daily issues taken into a comedic stance: hiding pornmags, or even a marriage encounter.\\n\\n\r\nIn various instances it also provides some social critique; what is more, this time around it is more universally centered, making it much more accessible to audiences unaware of japanese culture. Examples such as paranoia over a lottery ticket, greedy shopkeepers, corruption amongst civil employers, you name it. Naturally it has its share comedic sketches mainly catered to the japanese viewers, which are arguably hilarious as well. Not to mention the premise of some of the mini arcs presented: the hilarious gender bender arc and of course, the beloved Shogun gags - which once again are arguably of the best sketches of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this time around it is impossible not to mention the story oriented arcs in the season: these are a magnificent portrayal of the author's acquired experience over the years, expanding upon the Amanto and the mysterious Tendoshu that rule over Edo. Its \"serious\" arcs were often criticized for being a bit random and too over the top, yet this time this is not the case. Furthermore, the foreshadowing that was done in the previous seasons become very apparent and explained, in addition to providing a very satisfying flow of events: fast-paced when required, yet balanced and thoughtful when necessary to emphasize on the atmosphere and gravity of the various situations. It ultimately works itself towards a great finale - or rather, another buildup, but to this later - with fantastic action across the board, with a minimal amount of \"asspulls\" action sh\u014dnen are well-known for. The battles are tense, the stakes are high, and it is in fact brutal as it can be: people die left and right, betrayal and disbelief are just some attributes that could be associated to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Gintama remain largely unchanged, with some exceptions, yet this was to be expected, as the series is building itself towards its inevitable finale. Instead, the anime expands on its characters by developing them, as well as further fleshing them out in a satisfying manner. Audiences are presented with the expansion upon Gintoki's past, and with that, his other comrades as well as his master - a wonderful and satisfying display to the character's personality, and of course the story as well. Not only that, it becomes apparent that all the story oriented arcs are in fact used as means to develop and flesh out various characters which initially remained clouded in mystery from the previous seasons: be it Sasaki Isaburou, the founding of the Shinsengumi and its integrants, or even the shogun himself.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, for the more comedic episodes audiences are presented with the homeless Hasegawa Taizou, a great representation of society itself, meaning the hardships or the apathetic attitude towards life. He is arguably one of the greatest characters in the series, alongside the noble and resourceful Katsura Kotarou. Besides his outdated sense of humour and his fantastic personality, It is truly curious to see his evolution as a character throughout the series from being a radical terrorist to a more pacificist person in the quest to change Edo without causing unnecessary deaths. There is a downside to its cast though: for example, Shimura Tae remains pretty much the same throughout the entire series as a forceful woman, who can instantly change to a damsel in distress whenever the plot required it; in addition, the gags surrounding her persona remained the same, and ultimately got annoying. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character interactions and relations, these are often very well handled because of the nature of the anime and the characters themselves that has been developed throughout its duration. This is however not always the case, as in some instances these were rather abruptly presented to the viewer, which in turn caused the whole scenario to feel unnatural. Some of the characters actions occasionally conflict with their own ideals and personality as well, but as a whole, it could be said that it was satisfying. Now there are some issues to be held with the background of some of the characters: these follow the same formulaic approach which is usual in the series, which naturally may be bothersome for audiences. In some instances it could be said that the motives were either too predictable or convenient for story progression.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Gintama was surprisingly consistent and well done considering the fact that it aired for a whole year. However, where it excelled was in its action scenes: the fights were incredibly dynamic and fast paced, accurate as well as fluid and detailed, never leaving any viewer bored throughout its entire duration. This however has a cost to it, the backgrounds suffering in various instances from poor quality character models, and the occasional still image that are displayed throughout the series. As for the art style itself, nothing new, it remains with the same standard as the previous seasons; character models are very simple as well, yet varied enough to easily distinguish its cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however stands out is the selection of soundtrack for the different scenes and atmospheres the anime was trying to portray: the usual tunes for the more relaxed and comedic moments, whereas for the serious moments the studio pulled out a great variety of soundtracks that matched wonderfully with the setting. Metal songs, rock songs, gloomy sounds or the usage of percussion instruments which serve to inspire suspense and tension from the viewer, further enhancing the whole experience the show has to offer. Naturally, the voice actors are of great importance as well, which retained their previous ones:  Sugita Tomozaku as Gintoki, god-like voice of Wakamoto Norio or Tachiki Fumihiko as Hasegawa which greatly enhanced the characters personality, and with that, the comedy as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth season of Gintama was overall a fantastic experience which I personally doubted to be able to surpass that of its previous seasons, yet was pleasantly surprised. It managed to maintain its variety in jokes, the references and such, as well as displaying the one of the greatest subsequent story driven arcs with great characterization contained within. This was all accompanied with a great usage of the soundtrack as well as the fantastic action scenes. It must be said that it did not reach the final conclusion, as the manga is still ongoing, and there were some chapters from the manga left out: this mainly affected the comedy parts.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not mean Gintama has no flaws: it does, and quite some in fact. There are some episodes that either were too repetitive on its theme to the point of being annoying, as well as the infamous episode where they literally turned into shit. This was rather distasteful and off-putting for obvious reasons. Another problem that arises with the \"serious\" arcs are the integration of some of its characters: these are either at times useless/helpless for such situations, yet miraculously survive; or they're included just for the sake of it. Other issue that fans may have with the series is the fact that due to its inevitable conclusion, the anime has gone past the point of no turning back. This in turn meant that the last third of the series had hardly any comedy in it, which may be an issue for some, as the comedy aspect is one of the main charms of Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, despite the above mentioned problems, I still loved the series as a whole and consider it to be the best comedy anime I have watched so far; I have blurted out in laughter a great amount of times, which is the whole point of comedy. It is very rare to find a series that can maintain this type of quality for over 300 episodes. For anyone who hasn't tried out the this sequel yet, I can highly recommend in checking it out, as it provides both great comedy and expansion upon the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Gintama is a hot mess. OH PLEASE\r\nAvoid this anime at all cost! I can't even fathom why people like this so much.\r\nPlot:\r\nWas too complicated. I expected Gintoki and the gang to go on adventures/ arcs and save helpless people who didn't have the power to save themselves. I was waiting for the moment when Gintoki beats the final boss of the arc in fact the main villain never showed up! Instead I got unexpected twist, turns and heartbreak. At one point I had to snatch my sisters weave to slap my computer screen!!!! Why Sorachi?!! WHY!!!\r\nCharacters:\r\nToo unusual and weird. Antagonists such as like Shinsukeand Isaburo were just completely wrong in their directions; they were not planning to destroy the world or to take over the country... Personally, I would have liked these motives instead. They had far deeper motives, reasoning and planning which is quite bothersome because I have to think and go back MANY chapters or episodes to fully understand and to think about it! Female characters and weaker male characters like Shinpachi / Kagura were far too independent... I thought that a stronger character like Sogo needed to help save them but I guess Sorachi got lazy. My far biggest complaint was Gin.. this sad excuse of a main character needs to stop sleeping and go train to unlock his hidden powers. I hated his backstory and I wished that they would just skipped to the senseless boss battle, friendship speeches and the one-hit-KO's. Sorachi was too focused on developing his characters and that is a MAJOR flaw. There needed to have more stupid gags or unnecessary fanservice next season. Whatever. \\n\\n\r\nSound/ Opening and Ending:\\n\\n\r\nIt was great! Both endings and openings were tolerable. Thats the only parts that are good.. to be frank.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSkip this overrated anime. This was far too much for me: character development was oversaturated and the plot was unexpected and shifted to many extremes. I suggest watching Fairy Tail or Bleach because of the familiar plot and characters. You wouldn't even tell a difference between episode 10 and 200 for these anime.. trust me. If Gintama was a boy not even Michael Jackson would have wanted his ass. 10/10\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Due to the nature of this sequel it is inevitable that there will be spoilers for those who haven't seen it though i have tried my level best to keep them to a minimum. I urge you to watch all the prequels before beginning Gintama (2015).\r\nI began Gintama about 3 months back, wondering what it was that captured the hearts of so many people, after all its sequels dominated MAL's top 10 and it had spawned countless memes on the internet. It didn't really pique my interest in terms of its storyline or animation at the beginning but i decided to keep watching becauseof its absolutely gold comedy. By the first serious arc in gintama (Benizakura hen) i was absolutely hooked. Slowly but surely i began to realize the gem that was gintama. \\n\\n\r\nNow with Gintama (2015) gintama has reached heights that i couldn't even imagine and has broken FMA Brotherhood's monopoly at the top of MAL's rankings and has rightfully taken its position as the best anime of the modern era, perhaps even of all time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Gintama is a very episodic anime generally and has no coherent plotline, at least that is how it seems initially, but over the course of the 300 episodes that gintama has lasted we have seen that there is indeed a very deep backstory to Gintoki and many of the other characters. These backstories intertwine with the serious arcs of the anime and present a brilliant combination. The arcs are not very long (the longest arc is 9 episodes that is the Farewell Shinsengumi arc) and this means that there is alot of action and drama packed into these episodes. The arcs aren't many but when the do arrive in the series you know you are in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the star attraction of Gintama (2015) the Shogun assassination arc and the Farewell Shinsengumi arc. To say they are some of the best arcs anime has ever seen would probably be an understatement. The drama and action packed into these 17 episodes is unrivalled. What really makes the storyline of this anime amazing is that despite the fact that it parodies many famous anime for eg Naruto, Bleach etc it never falls to their low level and in fact manages to avoid all their pitfalls. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime will make you laugh until your sides hurt and at points make you cry a river. This contrast is indeed what makes this such an exemplary anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I will not mince words here and come right out and say that the art is fucking awesome. The fights are so well animated you wouldn't believe that they belong to an anime that about 6 years ago was struggling with budget issues and was forced to air in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The art looks like something out of a movie and helps set up the atmosphere wonderfully well. The movements are very fluid and the BGs are very well drawn. Later when the anime takes a dark turn the change in the atmosphere is well conveyed through the darker tone of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound has always been a strong suit of Gintama and has one of the best ensemble of VAs today. perhaps the biggest difference between it and other anime is that in gintama the seiyuus enjoy their job and portray their characters from their heart. The OSTs are still quite good despite some being reused for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the OPs and EDs are concerned, absolute eargasms.  Two of my all time personal favorite OPs belong to Gintama (2015). Every band involved has done a phenomenal job especially 'Blue Encount' and 'Chico with honeyworks' for their 'DAYXDAY' and 'Pride Kakumei' respectively. It would have been awesome to see 'Spyair\" return for another song but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Even though Gintama has a very large number of characters it never makes the viewer feel as any of them is being ignored. All our favorite characters return this season as well and are better than ever. Gintoki is particular receives phenomenal amount of character development this season and becomes as even more endearing character than before (crazy right?). Charcaters like Sacchan and Zenzo play more pivotal roles along with the Shinsengumi's characters like Hijikata, Sougo and Kondo. Many of the characters with which gintoki interacted appear and a special mention must be made of Takasugi in this regard as even he receives a lot of development over the course of Gintama (2015)\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: I don't think this part needs any lengthy explananations as you may very well have judged that i consider gintama to very well be the holy grail of anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end i would like to say that 'Gintama' is an experience every anime fan must have regardless of preferences. If it was not evident by its rankings this anime is an absolute masterpiece n every sense of the word. This season is particular is a new high for the anime. In the end i would like to say that i am glad that i found this anime and gave it a chance for i am unlikely to encounter an amazing anime like this again.\\n\\n\r\nHere is to another 100 episodes of Gintama! \\n\\n\r\n(Thank you for reading this long review and any feedback is greatly appreciated)",

            "content": "Mini-disclaimer: I wasn't planning to write a review so soon but since Gintama has gotten top spot on MAL many people it seems are leaving negative reviews in an attempt to bring it back down. Please don't encourage those people in when it comes to any type of anime. So sorry if this was a bit rushed.\r\nGintama is just a giant cluster-f-word that even questions itself. When a fan asked the Gintama staff what the anime was trying achieve they answered with they don't know either. An anime like that probably wouldn't deserve top spot on MAL(Gintama is number 1 at the time of writingthis review) in a different context, but this is Gintama. \\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10\\n\r\nThe story is about Sakata Gintoki,and the more and more I try to describe the story the more confused I get. At times this anime seems aimless, and at others it seems to be trying to convey a very important message. All in all whatever the story is, it's an amazing one. Now include the parodies, the laughs,the gags, the neo-jet-armstrong-jet-cannon jokes, and you have yourself an enjoyable anime that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.\\n\r\nNow as for actual plot, this anime is pretty consistent; however, like most anime it does have its inconsistencies. But those are all wrapped together nicely and fixed by Gin-pachi sensei himself. For example in a misleading scene they created a voice over and fixed it in the funniest way possible lol. So if you're looking for an amazing story look somewhere else, if you're not sure what you're looking for let Gintama find it for you. (Actual Story rating 11/10, completely unique and the good kind)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nWhat you need to know about this anime is that even the staff uses the Characters in Gintama to complain about their low budgets. This isn't top notch animation, at times it can even feel like a picture book. But it's a really good picture book. This anime at times has used the same frame of a building for about 5 minutes, with the characters only talking in the background and that's it. Regardless I enjoyed those moments because those characters even without movement and just their dialogue made a very enjoyable scene, and only Gintama can pull that off. There was even an episode when the op was done in MS Paint, do you know how bad in terms of \"art\" that would be rated? But still it had me laughing and was very enjoyable, which only Gintama could pull off. If you're starting to notice a pattern, and this goes for the rest of the review, Gintama is not subjected to the typical ways of critiquing/reviewing. The art in this anime is inconsistent, but it's good when it needs to be good and it's still enjoyable everywhere else. \\n\\n\r\nSounds 8/10\\n\r\nOur cute heroine is puking again? Well let's just add beautiful background effects.\\n\r\nThe Music isn't what some may call a masterpiece but it's good. They always get the mood going, and at times they make me cry because of all the memories Gintama has shared with me and they just come to me when I listen to Samurai Heart. The people behind the music and sound production know what they're doing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nEvery Character in Gintama is pathetic.\\n\r\nThe cute heroine we all want pukes everywhere and picks her nose,she's not even old enough legally or morally to ship her with the MC-kun, the glasses side character loses sight of his goal and never gets anywhere until the last episodes that fixes his goal in a few said episodes, as if they were never important!? Not to mention he's weak and for a character with glasses he isn't particularly smart. Our Main character is nothing but middle aged man who's defining physical characteristics is his white natural perm. Yet I see them as all irreplaceable to story that is Gintama. \\n\r\nSince Gintoki is our protagonist I'll use him as a stand-in for \"characters\" in the anime. Gintoki gets a sad backstory like every other MC, but not once has this been used as a direct way to lead to story forward, hell it's not even fully revealed until later down the line. Not that it's wrong to have anime do that but I admire this about Gintama because Sorachi managed to pull off a Shonen character like this. Gintoki doesn't even have a special move or a legendary weapon. He wields a wooden sword with \"Lake Toya\" written on it. At first you think it has some super special significance but it doesn't. (LIGHT SPOILER: It's from a tv ad) Gintoki will extort money from anyone even if it were kids or his own friends. He's a freelancer with too much time that never pays his rent. The only redeeming quality he has is his sense of responsibility, which he doesn't directly show but he would put his life on the line for it. While that one part might seem typical of a shonen character, the way it's presented is nothing like it.\\n\r\nSorachi wanted every character have their faults shine rather than the typical \"determination/will\" of a shonen or any anime to be in fact. This isn't a new concept to say the least but it's done well and fits perfectly for the type of anime(whatever type of anime this is lol) it is. With most anime in terms of shonen it's defeat the strongest villain, and then it continues until there are stronger  enemies. With the exception to very few the antagonists in this anime are not flushed out at all. I at times end up feeling for them or relating to them as well. You could even argue at times that the antagonist could have been a better protagonist. I hope you fall in love with the characters as much as I have. (So yeah it was never a 1/10 but rather a -100/10 so bad that it's good, sort of like those really bad jokes your friends say but you can't stop laughing )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI cried, I laughed, I smiled. Sometimes all at the same time. I learned while laughing. You know how in school you would wish learning wasn't so boring? Gintama is the mom that gives you lectures while making them fun. Now I know that's a weird way to put it, but if Gintama has taught me anything it's that it's fine that way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nGintama 2015 was everything the previous seasons were and little more, this is why I spoke about Gintama as a whole, but in particular 2015 is my favorite so far. Same old Gintama. I love every second of this and I will miss this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnybody can write a review about their favorite series and make it seem good, but this review honestly doesn't do it any justice. As the reader you can think I'm being biased and being just a fanboy. But if an anime doesn't make you want to be biased or a fanboy how good was it really? Either way, biased or not I tried laying it bare bones at some parts for you while not spoiling much at all. \\n",

            "content": "*The following review contains major spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.*\r\n316 episodes. 17 OPs. 21 ED. Over a decade on the air. The journey of Gintama is a truly massive one, starting from humble beginnings but growing in leaps and bounds, surpassing its limits with every confident shattering of its modus operandi, blowing my expectations out of the water time and time again until it becomes almost comical to look back on my earlier posts and realize just how completely unprepared I was for the gargantuan\u2026 thing this story would become. Ideas and histories hinted at back in the very first cours will grow anddevelop into sprawling sub-epics of loss, redemption and determination, all twisting around each other in a single, ever-tangling vine of a narrative that is just as confident lobbing a volley of high-speed dick jokes at your face as it is letting its characters suffer, fight, break, and rise again over the course of a titanic struggle against the bonds of the past. Gintama is a show that never sits still, never rests on its laurels, always feeling like it has more to say, more stories to tell, more triumphs to reach, more despair to wallow in, something new to add to the living, breathing ecosystem of its vision of Edo and every single fantastic character inhabiting it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I have loved every single second of it, from the sharply observed meta understanding of its own place in popular culture to the intimately realized portraits of broken people picking themselves back up, from the endless wellspring of high-stakes comedy high-wire acts to the fist-pumping awe of the action scenes, through laughter and tears and shock and heartbreak and hope and joy and literally every single second Kagura is on screen. I love this show like I love few other pieces of entertainment, the kind of all-consuming love that sometimes scares me with how deeply it affects me. Almost no other story I\u2019ve seen is this brazenly confident about its potential, this sure and steadfast in its convictions, this secure in its ability to deliver on every single endeavor it embarks upon. The fact that it\u2019s only been getting better and better over these past 300 episodes, never once falling into an extended slump or betraying its promises, is nothing short of a miracle. Gintama should have peaked a hundred times by this point. But every time I think it\u2019s gone as far as it can go, that it\u2019s laid all of its cards on the table and reached the best possible version of itself it can be, it blows my mind all over again, proving that there is not a single goddamn limit to what this show is able to achieve. The stakes keep growing, the playing field keeps growing, the emotions keep growing, the climaxes keep growing, and yet it never once loses sight of the absurd, ridiculous, self-assured, achingly human core around which everything revolves.\\n\\n\r\nSo when I say that this season has been the best Gintama has ever been, know that I mean that statement with every fiber of my being.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s notable that Gintama\u00b0 has been perhaps the most focused the show has ever been. The aftereffects of the Pinky Promise arc in the climax of last season marked a turning point in the show\u2019s narrative that there really was no going back from. It was a sign that we were starting to enter the final act of this world, that the passions and confrontations were growing too massive for Edo to contain without cracking from the pressure. And while the first two thirds of this season were still just as wonderfully diverse as Gintama\u2019s always been, nonsensical and touching and never anything less than brilliant, there was a sense of anticipation in the proceedings that was never there before. The players on the massive field of Edo, from the Shogun to Katsura and everyone in between, were all preparing for battle. Massive legacy anchors from Sakamoto to Takasugi were starting to appear more regularly. And it wasn\u2019t uncommon for seemingly self-contained arcs and stories to nevertheless point at, or even end with, hints at the bigger picture, the car crash in waiting just underneath the surface. This entire season was essentially one long build-up, using the skin of Gintama\u2019s not-so-status quo as a cover to position the pieces that had been set in motion by last season's finale. It was like watching a bomb\u2019s timer tick down in slow motion, unable to look away as the impending catastrophe just kept drawing closer and closer with every sinister flick of Takasugi\u2019s bloodstained sword.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the final third of this season saw that bomb explode, and the result is the single greatest 17 episode stretch of Gintama\u2019s entire history.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot overstate how completely and utterly the combined impact of the Shogun Assassination arc and Farewell Shinsengumi arc obliterated my expectations. This wasn\u2019t just one massive climax to the season; this was the breaking point for the entire goddamn show up until now. This was the culmination of countless hours of growth and development, of Gintoki overcoming his survivor\u2019s guilt, of Katsura coming to terms with the responsibilities of fighting for a nation, of Takasugi\u2019s collapse into the black pits of his despair, of Kagura\u2019s determination to break free of her heritage and just be a normal girl living a normal life, of Hijikata trying to keep his family from falling apart all over again, of Okita grappling with his self-loathing, of Shigeshige\u2019s desire to do right by the people under his care, of the shadow of Amanto oppression that\u2019s always been leering at us through the slits in the show\u2019s armor, of every single step forward our heroes have made in pursuit of the future waiting just beyond their reach. This was the moment where everything we\u2019ve been fighting for comes crashing together in a single, furious battle for the soul of a nation, putting everything we\u2019ve come to care about over the past 300 episodes on the line. This is what every arc, every bond, every expression of love, every moment we\u2019ve cheered for the extended Odd Jobs family, has been building towards.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it. Is. EVERYTHING. The word \u201cepic\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice; the collapse and rebirth of Edo is the stuff of legends. It\u2019s bombastic and chaotic, bloody and intense, agonizing in the pain it levels at those we\u2019ve become so close to, heartbreaking in the depths of human despair it reveals, yet also uplifting, inspiring, cathartic, charged like a livewire on hope and determination. Takasugi\u2019s backstory made me cry harder than perhaps I\u2019ve ever cried on this show. Shigeshige\u2019s death completely destroyed me and upended everything this story was capable of. And then, Hijikata\u2019s farewell pulled me back together all over again. In this fiery crucible, everybody- including me- is beaten down, broken, and forged anew, casting their old shells off and stepping reborn into a new, more dangerous, but also more loving world. And you feel the unbearable weight of that loss, of every ray of light we lost along the way, but also of just how brightly the sun still shines ahead of us. We\u2019ve turned a page in Gintama\u2019s history that there\u2019s no going back from, and the battle that marks this rebirth is all the proof you need at just what a stunning new chapter this is going to be. This is a climax I rank right up with FMA\u2019s Promised Day as one of the greatest epic finales in anime history. It\u2019s that goddamn amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWe really are in the final stretch now. The status quo has been completely shattered, and everyone is ready to face the end. The new Shogun is still exerting the Amanto\u2019s cruenty over Edo. Takasugi and Kamui remain at large. Our heroes are splintered, yet closer together than ever before. The new world we\u2019ve been fighting so hard to reach is finally here. Now, all that\u2019s left is to defend it with all our might. And I\u2019m wise enough by now not to think I\u2019m ready for what comes next. I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not ready for all the explosive, heartwrenching moments still to come. I\u2019m not ready for all the pain we still have yet to suffer. I will never be ready to bid this show goodbye. But I will face it all the same, silver soul shining strong, just as Gintoki would want me to. Because I have never been more hopeful for these idiots. I have never been more certain that when the clouds eventually clear, the sun will still be shining down with all its might. I have never been more proud of how far they\u2019ve all come. And I have never been more excited to watch them soar.\\n\\n\r\nSo godspeed, Gintama. Welcome to your final chapter. I can\u2019t wait until you blow my mind all over again.",

            "content": "I don't do very long reviews so I'll be mildly brief while trying to express my thoughts. There should be no spoilers except if you consider the names of the Arcs themselves to be spoilers.\r\nComedy:\r\nComedy is one of the main aspects of Gintama and it does an okay job this season, however it does not reach the heights that previous seasons had and I don't think there are any truly hilarious episodes this time around. While I feel the main series ranges from very amusing to \"miss\" this one more ranges from \"meh\" to miss. It's amusing as a timesink but not much aside fromthat. \\n\\n\r\nThe serious \"main\" arcs:\\n\\n\r\nIn Gintama's serious arcs, comedy pretty much completely goes out of the window save for a few gags during the initial opening scenes before they get down to business. I've frankly found most of gintama's serious arcs quite boring although there have been a few that have been okay. The main reason I rated the first 201 episode season 7 rather than 8 was due to the prevelance of serious arcs in the latter half, which I found very generic and dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe elephant in the room with this season is the two ending arcs, so I'll get onto those.\\n\\n\r\nThe Shogun Assassination Arc and the Goodbye Shinsengumi Arc are constantly praised as some of the highpoints of the series, so when I went in I was expecting a step above the throwaway characters and melodramatic speeches of their regular (serious) arcs. However, aside from the fact that most the arc-specific characters are actually recurring ones rather than throwaway introduced ones, not much changed.\\n\\n\r\nSA Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThe SA Arc started off on a fairly simple premise and setup, but beyond that the arc does not evolve much at all except passable and clich\u00e9 plot developments in order to setup the big fights. I can understand why people really liked this, as it sets up fights that have been building up for hundreds of episodes, however the writing itself is thin and weak. I only mention this because I see people constantly call these two arcs \"the best shounen arcs\" around with amazing writing.. which is really not the case. Yes they're pretty \"hype\", but a writing masterclass they are not. It's all very generic as far as shounen goes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pet peeve I had with the SA (and Goodbye) arc was the very annoying trope of loads of major characters getting serious but conveniently non-fatal wounds to be knocked out of action. Yes obviously Gintama butchering all of its characters would just be stupid and out of tone with the show, but they keep reusing this trope over and over and it frankly gets irritating when you see the 15th major/recurring character within 5 episodes get a serious but conveniently non-fatal wound (in dramatic slow-mo) to remove them from the fight. It's just cheap drama.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye, Shinsengumi Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThis arc was a little different, the plot wasn't quite as generic and it involves some actually major characters rather than simply recurring ones. However, that went mainly down the drain due to quite a few flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe melodramatic speeches that were mercifully brief or not as prominent during the SA arc make a comeback... and a very strong one at that. This arc can be summed up by 10 seconds of action, 2 minutes of overly-sentimental speeches (with a bonus of finishing each other's sentences during them) followed by 3 minutes of flashback. The flashback was a serious issue in this arc, I'd say well over 50% of it is pure flashback, it frankly feels like 70%+ is. While some of it is useful using flashbacks so excessively is frankly just lazy storytelling to make up for the lack of it beforehand.\\n\r\nThe melodramatic speeches and the flashbacks are the main issues with this arc for me - what was actually a fairly interesting premise was kinda ruined every time the brief period of action was to be interrupted by yet another speech or flashback. And yes, the speeches do not really say anything of note, they are fairly typical shounen speeches.\\n\\n\r\nGintama also has a serious problem of constantly making the bad guys into good guys mid-arc and getting people to switch allegiances at the drop of a hat because one of their underlings just went \"oh he was actually doing it for this reason he was good all along.\" It feels like they do this every time, it gets pretty tedious.\\n\\n\r\nI do not think the two ending arcs were bad, in the context of the series as a whole they were okay, just disappointing. I did not go in expecting a masterpiece at all, I am quite used to the anime community proclaiming many an average series to be masterpieces, however, I was at least expecting something at least \"good\" compared to its other serious arcs. Frankly, it was still as generic as it got, even if it did involve characters with hundreds of episodes of introduction. Compared to the complete snoozefest I found most the other serious Gintama arcs to be, I guess it was slightly better.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big issues I had with Gintama's serious arcs in general was also in connection with its more goofy (and superior) episodes. It makes light of many anime tropes, and yet when it comes down its own serious arcs.. it becomes as clich\u00e9 and generic as you get. I do find it distracting that it mocks tropes and anime clich\u00e9s and then within its own serious arcs it employs them to an extent that goes beyond the very anime it mocks. It just seems very weird to me. You'd think such a self-aware anime would at least try and avoid being that tropey, but I guess not.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that the season as a whole was okay. Fans of previous series will be entertained, if you found all the serious arcs of previous series to be a bore.. nothing will probably change with this one, the second half is mostly serious.",

Where your ass is already used to the shape of the toilet seat and it just... you can't explain it but.....\r\nit just feels right.\r\nI mean, when you use the schools toilet or anyone else's toilet, it just feels weird and even uncomfortable.\r\nWhen you get used to the toilet seat though(most likely not because you aren't going to be shitting that much) it's going to feel great. \r\nLike your home toiletseat, you can sit on it for almost an unlimited amount of time, and its just going to start feeling right again.\\n\\n\r\nThe same logic applies to Gintama. People never take the time to get used to it's weirdness, but once they do get comfortable and accept it, you'll have almost nothing that can compare to it. You'll be able to watch/read Gintama practically forever and not get bored of it, because the characters are very unique and fun. \\n\\n\r\nIf no one feels this analogy, I'm probably just weird....

            "content": "I am a big Gintama fan and I was sad and crying when it finished. Gintama is a very different, one-of-a-kind anime that will always keep you laughing and entertained. Gintama is not like most anime's out there and I think that's why it's so good. \r\nStory - 10:\r\nI give the story a 10/10 because even though it doesn't have much of a story line, each episode has it's own little arcs and story about Gin or the Shinsengumi or Hasegawa. Each episode is extremely random and hilarious. But not all episodes are all about comedy. There are also serious and epic arcs that showcaseintense action scenes and serious plots.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10:\\n\r\nI loved the art and drawing style. To the funny faces to the serious ones. The drawings catch my attention and I'm instantly hooked. I don't know anything about art or drawing styles but Gintama is easy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10:\\n\r\nI think this season of Gintama had the best soundtracks. It used some of the same background music from the other seasons but there is this one episode, this one arc that uses the opening to its advantage, and created an epic fighting scene. I love all the openings and endings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nI think the characters are what makes this anime really enjoyable. As you watched from the very beginning of the anime, from season one to now, you see how much the characters have grown and how much closer they are to each other now. I loved the character development and how you learn something new about each character throughout the season. Everyone feels like family. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Gintama waay too much, so much that I'm rewatching it about ten thousand times. I honestly have to say that Gintama is my #1 favorite anime and no other anime could top this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10000:\\n\r\nOverall, Gintama is awesome. It might be hard at first to get into the anime but once you hit about the 60 episode mark from the first season, that's when the real awesome stuff starts. This is a very good anime that everyone should try out. It funny, action-y, epic, realistic (in some ways but not really), and really awesome. \\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is all my opinion since we're entitled to our own.",

            "content": "Crazy as it might seem, I knew from the moment that Gintama came back last year, that I would be floored by the amazingness. Not just because I read the manga but because of the stunning way it was adapted. Here's a more detailed review.\r\nStory (10): No matter how stupid or crazy or just plain random Gintama is, the story of each arc is a masterpiece. It's riveting, it's engaging, it's emotional. It's every indescribable feeling I had while I was watching each episode. I loved that the characters would make you laugh like you're gonna pop your head off then afterwards make you cryyour eyes out till it rolls on the floor then make you laugh again. It's polarizing...but in a good way. I dunno how Gori-sensei does it, but he should be crowned with a crown of bananas.  What's also so masterful about the story of this particular Gintama comeback is that it hits into a lot of the core arcs in the manga and it gives more detail about the relationships of each character and their struggles. We are given more than just a peek into what's happening and that's why it's superb.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): Gintama is not like that lollipop-bubblegum cute anime that you all know and love. In terms of art itself, Gintama is not necessarily up there. But in my mind it is. I love how distinct and unique each character is and how bold some of them are. I love how they can play with each character and somehow make them seem like they have another personality and it's too funny I can't. But what I think truly brings my score for Gintama so high up is that the animation of the fight scenes, does not shy away from absolute perfection. It's raw, rugged yet fluid and they ain't afraid to show blood y'all. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10): There's a few recurring background music that you can hear if a scene is absolutely funny or wickedly sad. It's constant with Gintama, yet it just makes me cry all the fcking time. I'm sorry I just had to curse. Especially if it involves flashbacks. GDI. Then the amazing opening and ending themes for the whole span of Gintama. I love, adore and wanna marry every single one of the artists. They just brought everything together. I just hope SPYAIR made one for this season though but all in all, perfect!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): Do I need to go into detail with this? Every character in Gintama is just so lovable and hurts you like you've been stabbed a 1000 times yet they keep you alive just so that they can stab you more and more. The characters absolutely funny and out of it and you love them soooooo much! I can't get enough of them\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If you watch Gintama and not enjoy yourself, are you hollow inside? One aspect of Gintama is it ability to make people laugh (as well as cry) and even if you cry, you'll enjoy the show so much. It's the perfect binge watch show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): GINTAMA IS UTTER PERFECTION KBYE",

            "content": "Note this review covers all of Gintama up until the end of 2015 since I don't like having to rate seasons of the same show. I have watched a lot of long running anime and I don't think I have enjoyed a long show more than Gintama. While it is primarily a comedy (probably the funniest comedy I have ever watched) Gintama also covers many genres including action, tragedy, and most others to some degree. None of these sub genres are half assed either Gintama knows when to alter its tone from its predominantly silly style to other style to fit their stories beautifully. Itsoverall story (yes it does have one) starts off really slow as you would expect from a long running show but gaining it along the way is incredibly rewarding and a very fun journey. Its episodic and small arc (3-5) episode nature make binge watching it so much more enjoyable than most other  long running anime since no episode or arc never outstays its welcome and always provides a fresh new experience. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has gone through many art upgrades over the years and while it may have never reached Ufotable level and the animation may not always be consistently amazing Gintama puts on a beautiful spectacle at the most important moments in the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic taste is very subjective but I feel that of all the long running shows, with the exception of Full Metal Alchemist + Brotherhood, Gintama has the strongest lineup of openings and endings. Openings 5 and 13 as well as ending 17 are my favorites as Does and Spyair have caused me to hit the replay button many times. The music within the anime is great to as it always fits the tone the show is going for and one tune in particular almost brought me to tears on its own. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have to be the strongest part of the show. The benefits of being a long running multi-genre anime means you get to see the light hearted and hilarious nature of the main cast as well as the dark and serious without having to sacrifice one for the other. Personally my favorite characters are Gintoki the protagonist, Katsura, and Hijikata. All three of them are hilarious in their own unique ways and have compelling stories that make me appreciate them infinitely more than if Gintama was simply just a comedy anime.",

So keep your eyes open, no matter how dark the night ahead may be.'\r\nGintama has finally, or rather, unfortunately, rolled up the sleeves and laid the foundations for its final showdown. What our Gin-san doesn't know is that the night could be darker than he thought.  All the unresolved questions, all the open wounds will be figured out in the second half of the season, leading us to an end which will completely satisfyin a first moment, but looking back, we'll leave a huge gap wanting us for a new series to come out so badly, like a madao is looking for a job, the desperation will tie us in a indissoluble bond. So get ready for some dark sleepless nights. The hype is real and it will keep your eyes very open! However sooner or later, it should have happened, so it's better to not overthink it and put our Tama to rest. Obviously i mean souls! not OO ..ok, you didn't get it.\\n\r\nGetting more in details, the action won't be the absolute protagonist of the season, in fact it will make room, in its usual style, to a good slice of comedy which will make the series start off with a bang and keep the pace on till the last 2 arcs, but this is legit, it just want to gift us ..sigh.. its last lightheartedness's moments ..sigh.. ok i'm not crying.. really.. so get a full taste as long as you can.\\n\r\nThe overall plot will be a real turning point, showing us a tons of glorious flashbacks joining all the puzzle's pieces on the troubled past of the legendary Joi team.\\n\r\nThe result is a perfect blend of action, drama, emotion and wit which will make you die from laughing up to cry for sadness, in poor words, the perfect anime. I'm not surprised it's ranked #1 because even with great efforts you won't find any flaws. If you did, i throw you an anpan right in the face.\\n\r\nWhat truly make gintama to shine soo bright lies in its capacity (under  all the jokes and crap) to teach us little life lessons touching the deepest part of ourselves. Each stand alone episode will satisfy more than a christmas lunch and this is a win-win for a series. The emotional osts bind up divinely to the moving moments and when the going gets tough the music is not lagging behind, exuding true Epicness in each battle theme. (Kabukicho 4 devas theme was memorable).\\n\r\nThe animation on the whole is good and quickly develops every season. It's not on the same level as ufotable but this really doesn't matter because you will spend 3/4 of episodes with the tears in your eyes from laughing or you're too much focused on what's going on to pay attention. \\n\r\nThe only complaint i could say for Gintama is the frequent use of kanji in the gags, but this is absolutely normal considering it's a japanese show, so the best compliment you can ever give to this anime is: \\n\r\nI wanted to be japanese just to understand better gintama!! :P\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this series and you're wondering why it's so popular, all i can say is, give it a try, seriously, it will worth every minute. \\n\r\nThis anime and all its fantastic characters will show you how strong or weak people can be, how fragile or precious they are, you will discover the true meaning of Samurai.",

            "content": "Gintama, known for gag series full of parodies that breaks the copyright law and some of them are taboo like politics as its reference, breaking the 4th wall with a wild abandon, and bodily crude punchlines. That's the Overall Image of Gintama.\r\nNevertheless, the series have been overshadowed by serious stories at the later part of the show. I'm probably wondering what happened to Sorachi-sensei, I don't know how many more characters Gori-Sensei intends to kill off,  he turned the Comedic Gintama into Tragic Gintama and even in the on-going manga, though he killed many characters before, even in the very first anime series ofGintama.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n ~STORY~\\n\r\nA weekly anime spanned for 51 episode that took a year to complete. Filled with humorous episodic and frame stories, but now it's known for its continuous serious arcs. The pacing was ok with a couple of two fillers in the first two episodes, at least it wasn't rushed nor it was slow, the episodes fits the arrangement, but they didn't adapted some arcs and chapters:\\n\r\n|| Kagura's boyfriend arc: 419-422\\n\r\n|| Excalibur arc: 424-429 // 430 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| Homeless arc: 431-433 // 435/444 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| HDZ48 arc: 445-449 // 487 (unrelated chapter)\\n\r\n|| Love Potion arc: 492-496 (Upcoming OVA)\\n\r\n|| Guardian Spirits arc: 499-501 \\n\r\n|| End of Farewell Shinsengumi: 551\\n\r\n|| Rakuyou Arc: 552+ \\n\\n\r\nThe Story was mixed with complex and simple ways of telling what it wants, sometimes the comedy gets absurd and sometimes they mixed it with ethics and there are few situations that it gets a full arc whether it\u2019s comedy or not by the end of it. The latest season of Gintama have more complexed themes than before, like Gender Issues, Military Code, Betrayal, Politics, War, and Death, and there's also some hidden references used by Sorachi which was mentioned in featured articles:\\n\r\n|| http://myanimelist.net/featured/407 \\n\r\n|| http://myanimelist.net/featured/1512\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not unique to be honest, but what makes Gintama exceptional was its Gag Shounen Series that have shown great flexibility on using themes. Gintama is in the middle of Shounen and Seinen Demographic, it's officially Shounen which gives the whole series an action scenes and is the reason why it prevents Gintama from killing the main characters, to feel as though the principal cast is at risk is what I want. Kondo's death was teased several times throughout this arc, but I never thought they'd actually kill him. The series wants to demonstrate the true cost of war, but it never reaches Game of Thrones levels, where every character felt like they are going to killed anytime, but in this season it isn't yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe Comedy was very subjective, it's a hit or miss to many viewers especially to those who doesn't live in Japan, since most of the parodies were taken there, even the translators have to interpret what it means just to make the jokes reasonable, and sometimes it gets absurd which doesn't make any sense. At least there were some funny episodes which had ethical values on it, especially I like how they put funny episodes in the beginning and ends sadly, welp there's only 20 episodes of serious episodes and 31 for comedy episodes.\\n\r\nThen there's the Action and if a series has this, it means it's Shounen, which means cliched or common or anything that doesn't make the Anime better, well in terms of Action I didn't see any incantations, shouting their techniques or anything, which most of the shounen does, Gintama is a Straight Action without showing Power, Titles or Anything which is appealing for kids. Also Gintama haven't won any of the major arcs, they might have a cliched motivation and action but it's a fact that the two serious arcs was not about winning. Being victorious in the end of the show is what most of the shounen shows, but this season, there are now victory shouts nor praises in the end, it's just sad. The main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other sh\u014dnen series.\\n\r\nThe Drama was the creme of Gintama, this series excels on it despite of the vast humorous chapters and episodes of the whole series, it makes every character likable and unique also gives them unpredictable future. So far Gintama is taking its Drama into a new level which destroys any Jokes or Gag Trope which was built before. Throughout the serious arcs, there have now been two character deaths. It is the evidence of how much Gintama has changed these past months. Although the main characters are still funny and durable, the fact that death is now an actual possibility.\\n\\n\r\n|| Categories \\n\r\nAliens | Alternate History | Episodic | Gag | Parody | Samurai | Shinsengumi | Strong Male Lead\\n\\n\r\n|| Tropes\\n\r\nArc Villain | Back-to-Back Badasses: | Dramatic Irony | Foreshadowing | Red Baron | Running Gag | Ship Tease | Wham Episode | Wham Line\\n\\n\r\n|| Literary Techniques \\n\r\nBackstory | Flashback | Frame story | Plot twist | Irony | Metaphor\\n\\n\r\nGintama(2015) the latest season of Gintama ended with a Great Ending. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nGintama has a good art overall, not realistic but not standard or common, it's quite unique and memorable. \\n\r\nThe Director was able to achieve the specific mood it's trying to convey, and the anime has surpass most of the Mangaka's work, but sometimes there're some broken or haphazard scenes. \\n\r\nThe Background is good but not as good as Shaft's Backgrounds, well the background is not memorable, it did a good job as a support artwork.\\n\r\nThe Character Design is the spotlight of the Art category, it matches the personality with memorable and unique design to each individual which makes them easy to recognize also gives them original characteristics and depth on their personalities. \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ \\n\r\nThe Seiyuu's are the best ever in Sound category, all characters who have worked in Gintama turned into the best Seiyuus in the Anime Industry which makes them Exceptional. They've easily matched the character and did a good job on conveying them in different situations whether it's funny or serious.\\n\r\nThe Background music is still the same, but they've added some new music to fit in the serious arc. The BGM is not that much, it's not average nor bad, actually it fits the anime but it still lacks, but it does not matter as long as it did a good job on it. The BGM fits the anime, can't be used as a track on something else, unlike some BGM where you can easily listen to them and some can give you some goosebumps, so it's exclusive for Gintama only.\\n\r\nThe Opening and the Ending is good as always, memorable visuals and music and fits the anime, unlike the BGM, the OP/ED were exceptional, they've even foreshadowed the individual cour, and the Last ED \"Acchi Muite\" was very deep that have shown the progress from the past which has been made throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ \\n\r\nThe Highlight of the Show, they are well rounded, flawed but with strengths, and usually they are stupid most of the time. Whenever they overreact during humorous episodes it makes them unrealistic but funny, but not on serious ones, where they act in realistic way. \\n\r\nThe characters were made exclusively to Japanese, that's why it's hard to relate on them, though sometimes they were relatable to everyy people when they used metaphors, but still they are enjoyable to watch. \\n\r\nThe characters have a small character development, the series is more focused on fleshing them out than making them ideal, at the same time the characters were balanced even some of them foils each other.\\n\r\nThe Real Antagonist is a mystery, for now there's few antagonist that have motivation, backgrounds, and depths like the other characters, they were not used as a plot device to progress the story, though I'm talking about the serious arc, most of the funny arcs have empty characters who disappears after their episode ended. \\n\r\nEvery characters are well rounded, except during humorous episodes, where they were usually doing their gag antics. They are well rounded when the story takes a serious turn, that's the time where the characters gets unpredictable even the supporting cast is not an exemption. \\n\r\nNarration was mostly did by the characters, I don't have any problem with their perspective literary technique, sometimes they break the 4th wall through their narration. \\n\r\nI love the characters in Gintama, though some of them were dealt as a comedy device and disappears in the series. The Supporting and the Main Characters are original and unique, the more the story goes, the more it uncovers their reasons, most of them have depth that even with their usual antics have been overshadowed. The anime have not yet covered the depth of some characters, so probably I'll hate some of them if I haven't read the manga. \\n\r\nGintama has the most memorable characters of all time in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nMajority of those who've watched Gintama have enjoyed this, and I'm not an exception, well it's easy to get hooked on an anime full of comedies, but what I've really loved in this anime was the Paradox Combination of it, Gintama is the only Anime that was able to combine the impossible, it's like \"Yin and Yang\" Known for the Comedy Gag Parody but Gets Serious filled with Drama and sometimes adds a Tragedy. Historical and Sci-Fi, an impossible combination done right, but also known for the alternate reality of the history in Japan. The best are the characters, they are funny yet so deep that the more the story progresses, you've got to know them and eventually surprises you in the process especially in serious arcs. \\n\r\nThis anime is not a good starter for newbies and non-anime/fans, because the whole series relies on the knowledge of the audience if it will be entertaining or not, They might like it but they might not get the meaning of some jokes and references throughout the whole series, but the series' continuity-lite nature ensures that new viewers won't feel totally left out.\\n\r\nRe-Watching Gintama adds my enjoyment throughout the series, I like the meaningful messages and laughable antics, but this Gintama season is the Saddest of all, it's easy to re-watch/re-read the whole series than to re-watch latest season. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nStory: 8 - Creative Gag anime Shounen Premise with Seinen Elements \\n\r\nArt: 8 - Directed and Executed better than the manga\\n\r\nSound: 7 - Great VA and OP/ED, the BGM does it job well but not memorable\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 - The Highlight of the Show \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I love this anime",

'Shogun assassination Arc and the Shinsengumi Farewell Arc are 100% a masterpiece. every episode, every minute, even second i was like ''omg what is going to happen next?''- so many surprises.. yes at the beginning of the anime there is a lot of comedy but after that the serious Arcs are amazing- and also the fights are great! i have never watched this good fights in an anime. so gintama has paused now and it will return soon. i am verysure they will keep up the serious episodes... so guys, if you haven't watched Gintama yet or are still in the middle of it- GO ON. don't stop, because you won't regret it- trust me",

            "content": "Ah, this is my first review in a while, but I thought I might as well do a review of the #1 spot on MAL. My last review was probably some time last year, I don't remember doing one at all this year. Enough about my life, that's too boring, so let's get to the review.\r\nGintama is an anime that I stopped at episode 12 once because... well, uhm, I didn't want to watch a 300+ episode series on a small as hell screen aka my laptop. The site now continues to lie to me, and says it took me 119 days to complete it,when it reality, it really only took me around 3 days to finish. Well, that was the first season. The site is telling the truth when it comes to the seasons after it, which is Gintama', Gintama': Enchousen and this current season... \"Gintama Circle Thingy At Top\" is definitely what it is meant to be called. But, I binged Gintama very quickly, and I enjoyed it. A lot. Gintama has come to be one of my favorite series, but I'm a pleb and don't watch much anime, so who knows, something might beat it.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is a series of lots of laughs, and also tears streaming down your face. This particular season done exactly that, and delivered both quite well. The story about this particular Gintama, well, all I can say, is it's like any other Gintama. Nothing has changed. Gintama has always been a mix of hilarious, funny arcs and serious, sentimental arcs. It hasn't changed since Gintama has first begun. So that's why I feel I should have no need to explain the story to anyone who is familiar with Gintama.\\n\r\nIt's your same old Gintama, nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care much for art style and animation in anime, so I don't have much to say with it. As long as the story is good, and the anime is enjoyable, I'll watch it regardless of animation/art. But, the art for this specific Gintama doesn't seem to have changed at all from the others, or I suck and can't notice it, but I'm pretty sure it's been the same for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are great, which was expected because Gintama never fails on their openings and endings. I don't listen to endings much, but I do listen to them once and then download them. It's kinda pointless, but not really. The reason I skip them is because I suck and I really want to get to the next episode. I don't have a minute to spare apparently.\\n\\n\r\nThe same as the usual Gintama, is pretty much all I've been saying this review. But, it's true. Gintama still hasn't changed which is why I still love every character. From Takasugi to Gintoki, I love every character. Learning about character's pasts is also something I really enjoy. Although, I'm sure anyone would like to learn about a character's past instead of focusing on the present.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is epic, as stated in the start of my review, this is the same old Gintama. Nothing has changed. It's the show that everybody has loved for all these years.\\n\r\nIt's.... Gintama Circle Thingy At Top, also known as \"Gintama: Season 3\". Or season 7, depends. Though, it is technica- No, it is season 3.\\n\r\nAnyway, this show is awesome, I hope you all enjoy it too.\\n\\n\r\nHmm, was that review shit? I dunno. Haven't written one in a while.\\n\r\nWell, baiiiii!",

So if yall ever plan on ever watching this anime I highly recommend it, even though at first the show might seem awkward and weird since it takes that different route compare to other anime where the characters are always training or doing something productive, Gintama spends its episoderather horsing around and making a lore based off those moments of troll but it is indeed a spectacular anime.",

The one thing I really like about this anime is the characters, they are so troll-y, different from most characters I've seen in anime.

            "content": "Aye! here to make a quick review about \"Gintama\". \r\nGintama is the best anime I have ever watch that's long running, that isn't generic and predictable. It's pretty Original and YES it does have a plot.\r\nIntroduction\r\n10/10\r\nThe story revolves around a deadbeat samurai who is extremely lazy and does nothing but read shounen jump all day. His dream is neither to be the \"King of the samurai\", nor to be Hokage. He just wants his hair to be straight. He has deadfish eyes and has zero motivation to be called a main character. This only adds to his charms as a character though. He also seemsto have a pretty dark past behind him, which won't be revealed right outta the blue. The story focuses on how he meets various people and runs into trouble while having to fight and deal with extremely funny and awkward situations.\\n\\n\r\nPace and plot\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe story and plot are pretty unique and original. The series as a whole has a slow start from 1 - 30 episodes (Because it focuses on introducing the characters).  Tbh I dropped the series around episode 25 thinking it was \"Mediocre\" only to come back to it months later, when I ran out of Anime' to watch. AND BOY! was I glad I did. It's one of those series where every episode ends up relating to the plot one way or another. The pacing was pretty good. The plot was pretty intense and didn't fail to keep me at the edge of my seat. It was an amazing series for me personally. The plot was both sad and heartwarming. The show as a whole, NEVER fails to give you the experience of having watched the best of almost all genre. It can be the most funny one episode and it can turn into the most saddest the next and an Action packed episode the next. Honesty don't experience Anime these days that cover all those in one series.\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\n20/10\\n\r\nThis series is soo funny that it can be considered as \"Comedy gold\". It has some 18+ jokes with censored nudity and funny moments. The predicament Gintoki gets himself into each time is hilarious and funny. The show forcast a lot of parody of series like Bleach, One piece, Naruto and many more. The parodies are not just confined to anime alone as they have funny parodies of american movies, Actors, Famous franchise like \"Star wars\" and many more. If you ever wanna laugh your ass off to pure comedy gold, this series is defo the best one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all independent with great back story. They were introduced well and are far from your average cliche background character. Gintama is one of the shows where it's hard to hate on any character.  Gintoki to me is personally a troll. He may seem like he doesn't care but ends up getting himself into trouble cuz he cared too much about someone else' problems. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation from older episode like episode 1 are really nothing special. If I had to compare them they're basic 3:4 animation that's the same as the animation for long running series like \"Naruto\". However, in the 2015 anime that covered episode 316, the animation is defo refined and well made compared to the older seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment\\n\r\n30/10\\n\r\nIt really is one of the best series anyone could ever watch. Hopefully this review helped you to at least check this anime out. Though i'll have to warn you about the first 30 or so episodes which just focuses on introductions, but I promise there would be zero regret after finishing the series.",

            "content": "This season was really solid. Gintama is my favorite anime. It satisfies me in every thing that I crave for a tv show. I'll begin by talking about the comedy episodes before moving on to the serious ones.\r\nStory\r\nThe comedy episodes were not as strong this season compared to the previous ones. But make no mistakes. It still made me laugh so hard my chest started to hurt. Only this season didn't do it as often as the previous ones.\r\nMy favorites for this season were the Kuroko arc, The Shogun memory loss arc, the mindswap arc, the genderbender arc, and the Afro arc.\r\nThe serious episodes weresome of the best in the entire series. Which says something in of itself. The Shogun Assassination arc and The Farewell Shinsengumi arc have become 2 of my favorite anime arcs of all time! It had the right amount of tension, drama and action for every episode.\\n\r\nThese arcs also had some of the payoffs that we Gintama fans have been waiting for. And it did not disappoint in any way shape or form.\\n\r\nAnd I didn't even talk about the Shinigami arc, which is also a really solid arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful this season. Gintama has never looked better. The lighting, The shading, the background and the Characters were jawdroppingly gorgeous. It was seriously movie quality! The only time the actual art suffered was when it showed charcters from a distance. But nonetheless, the art is still high quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation was inconsistent in the serious arcs (I'm only talking about the serious episodes since the comedy ones didn't really need that much animation compared to the serious ones) Don't get me wrong. The animation was really fluid. But you had some episodes that were movie quality animation. And then you had some episodes that weren't that outstanding. But this may be because I'm comparing them which might not be fair. \\n\r\nThe point is, that when the animation needs to be good, it takes your expectations and makes it 3 times better.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack still has really great tracks. The new ones used in the Shogun Assassination arc and the Farewell Shinsgumi arc are particularly great.\\n\\n\r\nThe Openings were a little weaker than last Season. Gintama has some of the best openings in anime. Like Sakura Mitzutsuki, Wonderland, Tougenkyou Alien, Donten, etc. Gintama is the most consistent when it comes to it's openings. Which is why you have really high standards with this Anime. The only stand out one was KNOW KNOW KNOW. The rest were good, but again. This anime gives you really high standards, so the opening are still really really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWe got some great character moments this Season. Especially with Gintoki, Takasugi, Hijikata, Kondo, The Shogun, Zenzo, Sarutobi, and more. Almost everyone had their moments during this season, and the new ones are all interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I should judge a show based on enjoyment before anything else. Some people like to favor things that make them think, and have profound meaning to them. I still like those kinds of things in any media, but I like to place my enjoyment before anything else. I enjoyed Gintama more than any other anime out there. Even if this series doesn't have the most debt out of other anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow if you read this review since this season is really high up on the top anime charts, then you should know by know that you need to start with the original Gintama series before watching the rest. It may have a slow beginning, but once you get hooked, there will never come a point where it goes downhill.\\n",

            "content": "This will be my second review of the Gintama series and I will definitely get around to reviewing the other seasons of Gintama momentarily. Spoiler free!\r\n~~\r\nBefore I start this...\r\nAre you looking to start Gintama? Or maybe you're new to watching anime and came to check out the top anime; saw Gintama's substantially catchy cover art?\r\n!! Do NOT start with this season. Make sure you start at season 1 episode 3 (first two episodes are specials) to get the most out of this masterclass anime !!\r\nAnd for those who are under the impression that Gintama is just a gag or a parody: remove those expectations andlet yourself in for an experience that will change your life.\\n\r\n~~\\n\r\nNow let's review Gintama (with some focus on this season of Gintama)!\\n\\n\r\nIt is not often in anime where you not only watch through your eyes, but also with your heart and soul. Whether it causes you to binge watch a dozen episodes in succession or periodically; the emotions course through your body. Maybe it courses through the soul between your thighs too, as you try to connect with the pair of giant souls that eclipse the rest of the scene. Have some class, would you!\\n\\n\r\nMost anime viewers will watch one large series (150+ episodes) among series with smaller capacity or ongoing series. You may pick One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, HxH, Fairy Tail etc. which tend to be the obvious go-to in shonen. So where does Gintama assert itself in the grand scheme of things? Why is it so highly rated that each season & movie takes up the top 20 on MAL?\\n\r\nIf you ask me, Gintama not only deserves to be up there on the top anime of all time but it deserves the number 1 spot. It *is* the top anime of all time; there is no other anime that will resonate with you the way Gintama does.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nSorachi Hideaki, you wonderful b*stard. He just had to go and create the most tearjerkingly fantastic arc ever written in shonen. That's one of the things I enjoy most about Gintama, is how it does not recycle the same arc formula where you start to notice patterns (like in Fairy Tail); bad guys come in out of nowhere, overwhelm good guys and whatnot. Not Gintama! Gintama builds into this arc with such delicacy and it ends up harbouring the most raw, deep-seeded emotions you could comprehend. No fan service either.\\n\r\nGintama proves, yet again, that it has superior storytelling that other anime immediately fail to challenge. You cannot expect people to take the \"Gintama is just a gag\" remarks seriously while knowing arcs like this exist. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of how Gintama has already shown its storytelling prowess in previous seasons, this just adds to the experience that is Gintama. That goddamn gorilla mangaka... stop cutting onions!\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season of Gintama is certainly not anything to go nuts over in terms of art, later seasons are definitely where Gintama's art shines. Action scenes, specifically fight scenes, allow Gintama to explore creative and gripping art styles to match the intensity of the story. Gintoki, when he unleashes the White Yaksha (White Demon) within himself, is portrayed in black and white slow-motion scenes and the emotions radiate through the screen. You will never find an art style that portrays a demon in the same raw, cynical and terrifying way as Gintoki is portrayed in these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the openings shall we? Maybe this comes with a little bit of bias as I adore Gintama and its openings - & endings too - but every single opening complements the upcoming arcs. While some of the openings are not as catchy as others, they are all unique and all enjoyable to listen to. I don't think I have ever skipped an opening while watching Gintama, as the songs are excellent!\\n\r\nEven the endings produce the same effect; oftentimes they work seamlessly with the closing of an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is perfect, beyond perfect in fact. Nothing will make me cry with laughter as much as hearing him singing Doraemon out of fear or yelling obnoxiously.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound effects, they enhance combat scenes and especially comedy scenes. Sometimes the sound effects are what causes a scene to reach its climax, mostly due to how Gintama is action-heavy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhy is 10 the maximum for this? It should be 'Gintama'! Gintama is the pinnacle of character development in anime. The absolute pinnacle; unchallenged; nothing remotely comes close -- nothing! Sorachi is a genius when it comes to creating and developing a character, even side characters who will usually have one appearance. In fact, every single side character is memorable which is explored in one of the endings where every single one is shown in chronological order.\\n\\n\r\nGintama has a beautiful canvas of characters, personalities & relationships that puts it on a level so high it exceeds the scouter's limit tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, it is safe to say that Gintama has somehow achieved 4-dimensional characters. One of the reasons is to do with how they break the 4th wall, which is shown through them reading JUMP, referencing other shonen or talking about real-world events. Might I add, there is an enormous list of characters in the Gintama universe and every single one of them is memorable. You know exactly what they are doing when they are not on-screen, their backgrounds, how they react to events and their relationships with one another.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, the three main characters: Shinpachi, Kagura and of course, the White Yaksha, Sakata Gintoki-san! These three characters, along with Sadaharu, make up a beautiful family-like connection to one another. It is deep-seeded and exerts itself benevolently, while also fitting in with the comedy aspects of Gintama. In fact, the comedy enhances the bond between the Odd Jobs crew and any indifference felt causes a huge shockwave of emotion.\\n\r\nGintoki is the best protagonist in anime. With the ability to transition from a leader & father-figure, to a lazy, carefree gambler and further, the White Yaksha (white demon), while keeping his character consistent and memorable is an enormous feat. Not only is his appearance unique, but his personality as well. Never has there been a sadist with a heart (and smile) as big as Gintoki's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nHuh? An anime that can perfectly combine hilarious comedy with plot twists and tragedies, while making room for the emotions that come along with both? I can't remember how many tears I've shed at both dying of laughter and weeping in sadness; Gintama will tenderise the soft place in your heart with laughter, before soaking it with intense sorrow. If you don't have a soft spot in your heart, Gintama will certainly help in making one.\\n\r\nHaving taken this anime in varied portions, it has enabled the best possible experience in watching Gintama. Extremely enjoyable anime that will make you want to binge to the end of the rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nReaching the end of season 4 has given me a chance to look back at the journey I have taken with the Odd Jobs crew. It reminds you not to rush to the end nor to skip any steps; embrace every single journey you take and to trust those who will always be around you. For a long time I felt as though there was a missing place in my heart and Gintama has filled that void.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is a masterpiece. The perfect blend of comedy & tragedy; hard-hitting action and the occasional parody. It is the absolute pinnacle of storytelling, character development and the like. There is nothing you can fault this timeless anime for, as once you're into Gintama you can never avoid the way it will warm your heart and make your soul chern. A little inferno will gradually turn into a sacred, silver fire that will reside in you for as long as you live.\\n\r\nYour balls may even turn golden. \\n",

            "content": "I know many people will be looking at this review and thinking that i am such a hardcore fanboy, but the truth is I'm not. When I first started watching Gintama I kind of almost dropped the show, it really wasn't my kind of anime. So fast forward a couple of years and O decide to dive back into the anime. Now I'll admit it the first 30 or 40 episodes are not that great since they are just introducing characters ( Gintama has a REALLY huge set of characters), but after that the comedy episodes were absolutely HILARIOUS. And then came the arc thathooked me on and thats the Benizakura arc. It made me realize that this anime actually has a plot and a dark one at that. I had a blast with the first 3 seasons they were absolutely amazing. Then came Gintama 2015 this where I go in depth.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised when I saw how good the animation was in this season, it was like the studio increased their budget tenfold. The fights are absolutely mesmerizing and the quality of the show just improved by a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nGintama focuses a lot on the sound effects. For example: During the fight between Gintoki and Takasugi( I've re-watched it a couple of times since i was too busy shedding tears during the fight that i couldn't focus on the details.) you can literally hear Gintoki's sword smacking Takasugi with every hit, which shows that not even the most minor of details are overlooked when it comes to sound. To keep this short the sound is just perfect and the BGM just makes the battles feel even more intense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10/10 \\n\r\nSHOOOOOOOOOGUN KAYOOOOOOOOO!!! The characters are great i wont say anything else( props to Sorachi sensei). The voice acting is on point. The characters feel like real people and you can sympathize easily with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nThis season was a blast, I literally felt empty when I realized that the season ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\\n\r\nGintama is a masterpiece and if anything it really does deserve to be on the top.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my review.\\n",

            "content": "This review applies to all seasons of Gintama, including OVAs and movies.\r\nThis is my first review and much as I want this to be the best review for the best anime, well (shrug).\r\nOut of a hundred anime I have watched, I have always felt the desire to write a review for those that left an impact on me. It took me two years before I was able to find the series worthy of my first review. That's Gintama.\r\nOur opinions may differ, but for me, Gintama is the best anime of all time. I will seriously cry once the manga ends. I never did cry forNaruto or Bleach or Kuroko. I am pretty sure I will for Gintama. This series was my salvation during my toughest times. This series made me laugh (very hard), cry (very hard), annoyed (sometimes) and made me feel all other emotions you can think of.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nGintama is about a trolling samurai and his daily life as he struggles to pay his rent and find money to spend in pachinko. He runs a shop called \"Yorozuya\" or Odd Jobs, and does any errand in exchange for money. Or so it seems. I tell you, remember the word Yorozuya. Because by the time you get hooked in this anime, this word will make you cry. Many people go to Yorozuya to have their errands done, and most of the times it involves their lives and their family or friends. This is where the emotions come in. Once you encounter every character and the moral lessons they teach you (if there is), you will get attached to every single character in this anime. For the first 30 to 60 episodes, Gintoki Sakata is just a trolling samurai who picks his nose while reading Jump magazine. But his pain is greater than any of the characters in this series. At first, this will have you thinking, what the hell is happening? What's the plot? It's all nonsense. I'm staking my name on it, bear it for just 60 episodes, and I promise you'll never regret it. The memes you see where Gintama's plot is all over the place, while other shonen animes are all well laid, that's true. But that's the beauty of Gintama. It crosses other dimensions and does not care for the fourth wall, but it will make you cry after you realize the real depth of this anime. I can't detail the story and plot without spoiling anything, but trust me that Gintoki has one of the deepest pains in the anime history.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about Gintama's art. The animation is nice, not that great. You will see improvements as you go along every season until 2016. The fight scenes, oh, the fight scenes. Watch out for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nCan I just say one thing? I have all of Gintama's theme songs in my playlist. I listen to it everyday, again and again. I will never get tired of its soundtrack. Especially those sung by SpyAir and Does. They seriously give me goosebumps. The background music for emotional scenes are more than perfect. I always get on the verge of crying when I hear Sakura Mitsutsuki which is the opening song for the Suzuran Arc. The sounds for the fight scenes are more than fitting, it builds up the excitement. I don't know how more will I emphasize the greatness of its soundtrack, it's just that. Great.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors. I am willing to marry Tomokazu Sugita right now. The voice actors are godly. Perfect. They suit the characters so much, and I believe these guys deserve more recognition.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 11/10\\n\r\nOh no, don't get me started with the characters. The cast for this anime is magnificent. The female characters are all strong and well-developed. We have a ninja, a cabaret girl, a samurai, a Yoshiwara girl and an alien. All of them are lovable and funny. You will not get pissed off with a female character for crying in the corner while waiting to be saved. They are all badasses. Over all the bishies out there, I will still choose the male line-up of this anime: Gintoki, Hijikata and Sougo (sorry Kondo and Shinpachi). These guys mess the whole time, picking noses, over-eating mayonnaise and trying to kill each other once they get the opportunity. But never ever piss them off, or you'll see how devil behaves. Badass is an understatement. Their awesomeness and epicness are indescribable. One more great thing about these characters? Their relationships. Their bonds will make you cry rivers. The source of pain and happiness of Gintoki are the bonds he has with every character in this series, be it good or bad guys. His past, his present and future revolve around these bonds. Learn the definition of \"Nakama\" in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this anime. Every episode and every arc made a mark in my mind. I loved how there are episodic parts to give you a break from the emotional arcs before entering a new arc. I wouldn't say it's a filler 'cause that's just how Gintama works. The arcs in these series are to die for especially the recent ones. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nIf I can give this a 100/10, I will. Gintama will forever hold a special place in my heart as the best anime of all time. I never regretted watching this, because it changed my life. The only regret I had was not watching this earlier and for having hesitations at first. Sorachi-sensei, thank you for this gem. May the Gintama era never end.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this gem, as I want everyone to experience the pride I felt for having watched this series.",

No, there are some classic films that win.\r\nThis show competes however for a top 10 spot on thatlist.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't wanna survive hundreds of episodes of episodic anime to get here fine.

            "content": "Gintama, a show that is capable of both producing tears of laughter along with tears of joy, has not failed to impress me over the past decade it has been aired and this season is no different. If you haven't watched the first few seasons go ahead and do so. This review will just go through category by category \r\n(story-art-sound-character-enjoyment) and conclude with my overall statement about this seaon\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe true magic of Gintama is that it is episodic in nature and very comedic in nature. These comedic arcs and episodes help to connect the watcher to the side characters, so that when eventually aserious well-constructed arc does take place it takes a dramatic impact on the reader/watcher. The thing that this season will get a lot of flack for is stringing two serious arcs together. The arcs themselves are really good and I would place them in the top 3 in terms of serious arcs (courtesan of the nation is the best imo). However, it just so happened to be too bad that the arcs led directly into each other. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up this point, I really do enjoy the serious arcs and they are an essential part to Gintama. However, Gintama's strength lies primarily comedy and making the audience connected to side characters that would not get attention in typical shounen anime. But I do applaud Sorachi's attempt to steer Gintama in a new direction towards its finale.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where this season truly separates itself from the others. Although the fight scenes aren't as crisp as the season before, the back grounds are much prettier and the lines are much bolder. The detail in the faces are much more visible and give Gintama a great look.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nAs always, Gintama has a pretty great ost that establishes the emotional backdrops of scenes. However, 3/5 of the OPs this season were pretty mediocre until the last arc blew me away,the second OP was excellent as well. In terms of EDs Gintama was pretty excellent. Voice Actors 10/10, Gintama knows how to cast\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nNo other anime does better at connecting the audience to ALL of its characters as Gintama. It's one thing to have a well-written MC with strength and weaknesses as well as villains. But Gorilla has made it to where any character can be placed in the spotlight of an arc and the audience will feel sympathy for them. Gintoki will always have the focus on him as the main character should, but the voice acting and writing of the side characters truly  propel it further than other anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nEFFING HILARIOUS\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI like that in this season Sorachi is trying to lead Gintama to its inevitable close. However, it makes me feel sad when I'm reminded that Gintama is going to tie ends but it has to be done. If a lot of comedy has to be sacrificed then I stand by Gorilla-Sensei in making sure the series has a solid ending. This season is a success and it's no suprise Gintama composes most of the top 10 on MAL",

            "content": "Here's an updated review now that the series has officially ended.\r\nAs a person who just started watching Gintama at exact one year ago, when this 2015 series started, I understand that you think \"wait why is Gintama popular again?\" or maybe now, \"Why is it in the first ranking of MAL???\" and unfortunately my friend, I can't answer that. Because I myself, don't know why either. To be honest, I started watching Gintama at the seventh season (this season) first episode and the next thing I knew, I was laughing hard.\r\nWhat make Gintama interesting and why you should watch this? Well for me, the storypretty much unpredictable. You don't know what's coming and that make Gintama interesting. That is also why I rated the story 10/10. When people said that there all kinds of genre are packed in Gintama, it is true. At one moment you can laugh out loud without knowing when you will stop laughing, moments later you might be looking frantic for a tissue box because you were crying your eyes out or maybe, I don't know, sitting at the edge of your seat and praying for all went well during the last two serious arcs of this season? Well, it's a bit exaggerated but it's true. I experienced it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gintama art and animation steadily improved from the first season, which was 10 years ago. It deserves some credits for the improvement. You could see the improvement and the difference of the art and animation of this series. In the beginning of Gintama series (the 2006 ones), their art was very sharp and shounen-ish  but in the latest one, the art and the animation was more soft and somewhat relaxing to stare at. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the OST fits perfectly with the moments, whether it was in comedy mode, action mode even sad mode. The OP/ED also fits perfectly. For example, Day by Day was filled with bright colors while Pride Kakumei was fill with more darker colors and gave us some seriousness vibe. After that, you got Beautiful Days with its upbeat and cheerfulness, giving us a hint that the comedy episodes has returned before turning it into an again, a dark and full of action opening. Lastly, Gintama closes its book with a gloomy, serious yet epic opening with Know, Know, Know by DOES. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are incredible as well. They delivered their best performances into this series in every single scene and sometimes I wondered how they managed to held back their laughter during the recording session. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the most interesting part. It's not a rare thing to see them breaking fourth wall, including mocking the very own protagonist, insulting their own mangaka, making fun of the producer and director of the shows in the previous six seasons. Every character have their perfections and their flaws and there are no characters in this series that was not insulted by the mangaka. The male characters are unique, you have the lazy protagonist, the stalker gorilla, the sadist, etc. Meanwhile, the female characters portrayed as a strong willed and independent individual, and yet the mangaka still made fun of them. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched the previous seasons of Gintama, you've seen how each of the characters grew and developed in the most awesome way. Or if you haven't, and you should do so by the way, you might've had this strong feelings toward secondary characters who has very small screen time yet relatable to you somehow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a 9/10. If you are interested with an anime in their seventh season that was filled with other animes parodies, toilet and dirty jokes, comedy gags and sometimes could switch into more serious and touching mode, then Gintama is your choice. Gintama is also great to watch it if you feel bored or searching for an anime to binge watch. That's what I did and I didn't regret it. Oh and the reason I chose 9 not a 10 was because my disappointment of why didn't they adapt more of the comedy arcs or stories because I was hoping them to do so :(\\n\\n\r\nBut Gintama is still cool.",

            "content": "This will be a review of Gintama (as an anime series) and a bit of comparison between this season (2015) and its previous season to be able to convince you on what makes this season much more awesome than the previous ones.\r\nSTORY/CHARACTERS:\r\nThere's this group/company called \"Odd Jobs\" which consists of three members: Sakata Gintoki (the leader), Shimura Shinpachi, and Kagura. Basically what they do is that they'll accept any requests from people as long as they get paid.\r\nThe story doesn't only limit to these three characters. We also meet the Shinsengumi which is one of the special police in Edo. The three main characters inthere are Kondo, Hijikata, and Okita. We also get to meet Gintoki's neighbors like Otose, Catherine, and Tama. We also see other characters in Edo and outside of it like Sarutobi, Tsukuyo, Hinomi, etc. It doesn't leave any characters behind. The story's comedy gives them time to shine. If not comedy, then they shine on the serious arcs.\\n\\n\r\nNow... Where's the plot? Where does it go? This is a comedy Shounen series. When you watch the early episodes of Gintama, you think there's no plot. However, it could be that you already watched an episode that leads up to one of its serious arcs. Like some comedy episodes about the Shogun. The Shogun appears around Episode 80+ and appears again around Episode 150+ and around 230+. You may not know that this is actually a development that leads to one of its serious arcs and that is \"Courtesan of a Nation arc\", but that doesn't stop there. Some serious arc could lead to sequels and that is the latest's season \"S.A. arc\" (Had to make that an acronym. I don't want to spoil there).\\n\\n\r\nIt is recommendable that you need to watch at least all episodes of Gintama so when the time comes that you'll watch the serious arcs, you will feel the emotion of each characters, and you won't get lost while you're watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe question lies here: Does the comedy click for me? Are the serious arcs that amazing?\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy, yes, it is hilarious. The early parts of the show however, didn't really click me. Like around the first 10 episodes, its comedy were just okay, but the comedy gets better later on. What I do notice about its comedy is that when the characters deliver their punchlines, it's not only once. It's like there's a chain of continuous punchlines in one segment that connects to the joke and it's hilarious. The comedy also features breaking the fourth wall jokes and I thought that was also hilarious. They even do parodies outside of Gintama's universe so you'll see them making fun of Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, Kuroko no Basket, etc. The only flaw that I can point out on its comedy is that there are inside jokes. Meaning, jokes that most likely only the Japanese audience can get, but I understood most of Gintama's jokes.\\n\\n\r\nFor its serious arcs, it's good. However, I don't think some lives up to the hype like what some people say. Arcs like Benizakura and Shinsengumi Crisis maybe emotional, but at the back of my head, it felt like I've seen something like this before and it doesn't really differentiate from other Shonen anime. However, I wouldn't say the same for Red Spider and Four Devas arc. While Red Spider didn't really had connection to Gintoki's past, it showed some similarities. Four Devas arc really opened up a lot of character development for the characters like Gintoki and Otose. However, there weren't a lot of turning points or there were only few turning points on these two arcs I've mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nGintama's latest season (2015) blow these arcs away and give us much more serious arcs - S.A. arc and F.S. arc (Mentioning the arc's name is a huge spoiler, so might as well make it an acronym). I mean, there was another serious arc called \"Reaper\", but then it suffers the same flaw from the other serious arcs I've mentioned. What makes S.A. and F.S. different from others is the turning point of the story. These arcs had a HUGE SHIFT from its characters. We got to know more about Gintoki's past, the Shinsengumi and its rival, Mimawarigumi. It had more character development and it opened up much more on the past and I thought it was outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\r\nI'm not going to mention the early days of its animation. It's old, we get it. As long as it improved, I don't think that's going to matter, so I'm just going to critique its latest animation which is impressive. I love how the animation shifts its tone from comedy to being serious. Like, you can see the distinct change on its shadings when it's about time to laugh or to get serious. However, I wouldn't say the animation, in terms of its fight scenes, are always consistent. It does have its moments, but not most of the time. Still, I think the animation is great. \\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack, it's also great. Its comedic soundtracks and its serious soundtracks are played at the right time and I thought they were memorable. For the OPs and EDs, there are some great ones, but some are okay. However, some OPs and EDs sometimes don't match to the content of its latest arcs. Take \"Beautiful Days\" by OKAMOTO'S as an example. Lyrics? \"Beauty Beauty Beautiful Monday. Beauty Beauty Beautiful Tuesday--\" and it shows that the arc is going to be sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nYou need patience and dedication to watch this show. It's comedy maybe off for some at the beginning, but it does get better and better. Gintama's latest season isn't the conclusion though. It left hanging as the manga is still ongoing, but its conclusion doesn't disappoint. This series is easily one of my biggest recommendations to some people who hasn't watched it yet.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10 (9.6, but fudge it. I enjoyed it a lot and round it up to 10/10).",

More often than not, it is about how to win at life which no one in the anime does. But whenever the story gets serious it has a well written and manages to emotionally involve you in it.\r\nArt: \r\nIt is out standing. Sticking closely to the manga, the anime hasn't left out any comic features thatyou would find in the manga. The characters are well drawn and have a significant features that distinguish them. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoices and well done and the music is memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDespite the amount of characters, each character is well introduced and it helps you makes an impression of them and remember them.

I'll get right into 'cause this is my first time writing a review so yeah cut me some slack, alright? \r\nStory: The show in itself is very episodic, while the yorozuya get most of the spotlight every now and then other supporting characters get a story of their own. Showing the shenanigans everybody gets into while sprinkling a lot crude humour, and at times the serious situations they get into which ends in them learning more about each other, being more open with eachother (especially Gintoki), showing the underlying tension in the lawless town. Each arc builds and builds and builds until at some point it collapses and all hell breaks loose , which is what this season mostly covers. The one sad thing though is that they didn't cover some arcs which is disappointing but what can ya' do? Overall the story hasn't changed, there definitely is a shift in genre as the most serious arc in the manga is about to take place in the anime but don't worry the beloved humour we all adore is still sprinkled in there somewhere. My score: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think this was my only real complaint this season, the animation in the beginning was amazing, didn't fall short of it's predecessors but somewhere in the middle it dipped for me. The animation felt odd and it just didn't feel like Gintama's style, granted that a new company is handling Gintama now and I did read the manga before this season came out but very powerful moments in the manga fell short in this season. It wasn't too much to deter me from enjoying it but just enough to bug me. Score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice actors still sound superb and there's more variety to the soundtrack now. Some of the tracks do feel out of place but I got used to it. Score: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ah, the reason why so many of us love this anime. Nothing unusual about the characters until the serious arcs kick in and I mean serious. We begin to learn more about our 3 veteran warriors and why they act the way they do, their backgrounds, the hostility towards each other. Our beloved yorozuya and shinsengumi are put in a situation where they openly rely on each other, character development skyrockets in this season. Characters we had mixed or bad feelings about ended up being characters we cried for. At the end of this season everybody learned something new about each other and some even helped open each others eyes whether intentional or unintentional. Score: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this season granted it did fall short for me but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Score: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\\n",

(I think ep 305 and 307 says enough...)\r\nIt wasn't the first time but I can't remember ever crying SO hard watching an anime. I'm still not recovered emotionally and I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to watch it further xp\r\nBut in general, I think the humor in the Gintama series is getting better and better andthe main plot of the story as well. The art has also improved a lot compared to previous season but what surprised me the most was how good the music this season was!! I believe there were some new soundtracks I hadn't heard before but I loved it and they fit perfectly within the scenes and made it better than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nSo when I'm ready (mentally) I'll definitely watch the next season or even re-watch this season!

            "content": "Well in normal Gintama tradition this started out as a 8-9 out of 10 as usual for me ...i.e. this series just has that great mix of comedy with some action sprinkled in..it's got just the right mix to be at the top of my list for best anime's of all time.  This season however, finally got a fantastic upgrade to the graphics though and looked PHENOMENAL....truly beautiful to behold.\r\nWhat really did it for me though was the last 20 or so episodes....outstanding.  FINALLY getting to see some history behind Gintoki and what happened during the war was beyond satisfying, quickly pushing thisseason into my fav's of all time.  I LOVE the comedy in this series, but my god they know how to do a serious story right as well, and I simply cannot get enough of the badass scenes of Gintoki being well...badass....MORE, MORE, I need MORE!!!\\n\\n\r\nGreat season, def one of my faves, esp toward the second half.  Truly outstanding and well worth the watch for any Gintama fan.",

This season we get to see the cast in an unfamiliar level of badassery. It almost starts to feel like you could be watching an entirely different show... but our characters can't help being the lovable idiots that they are and the audience is thrown right back into the Gintama of old.\r\nGintama is only getting better with age, so if you're a newcomer trying to decide if you want to give this show a go or not, you won't be dissapointed.I certainly wasn't!",
