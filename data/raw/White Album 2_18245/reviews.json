            "content": "Music Room 2. It's the most unassuming of the three that populate Houjou High. Music Room 3 in the building across has the benefit of being bigger and newer, and the adjacent Music Room 1's been sectioned for everyone save those enlisted in the musical curriculum. Nevertheless, it's where Haruki Kitahara spends his time practicing \u201cWhite Album\u201d by Yuki Morikawa on his guitar. And out of nowhere, from the adjacent room, from the rooftop, a sound has him spellbound. A piano so soothing, a voice so transfixing, plays, sings to the song's melody. And here is where the story of White Album 2 takes off,where he has to know who.\\n\\n\r\nAn adaptation of a Leaf and Aquaplus visual novel White Album 2: Introductory Chapter, White Album 2 itself was produced by Satelight, directed by relative dark horse Masaomi Ando, and scripted by Fumiaki Maruto, who was also the original scenario writer for the source material. A qualification before going any further is that outside sharing the same universe, using the same name, and borrowing  a few of the same songs, this show is completely unrelated to its predecessor, White Album. Do not expect the same characters or story from then, which I've heard from general consensus is less than favorable, to be present here.\\n\\n\r\nAnother qualification since this particular plot device's the bane of a number of viewers: this show is driven under the auspices of a love triangle. Feel free to refrain from watching if you absolutely can't stand them. This love triangle, however, does something somewhat different from the usual one male, two female dynamic. Haruki Kitahara, Setsuna Ogiso, and Kazusa Touma are friends. The best of friends. Friends of the dearest kind. The viewer's left with rather maddening issues, monogamy withstanding. How can the guy pursue one girl and avoid hurting the other? How can one girl pursue the guy and leave the other unscathed? How can we all remain close? Each main character wants to have their cake and eat it too, yet the show makes the reality clear: You can't. The heart wants what it wants when it's found it, despite any one party's attempts toward the contrary, and to deny it that when it's within grasp, combined with each character's own baggage, is tantamount to torture, agony of the most existential kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe agony's even more poignant when they're written as more than just fictional characters. For the female leads, it wouldn't be incorrect to group them under a certain personality, a certain archetype, the warm, popular school idol and the cold, aloof musical prodigy. And yet, they're more than that, never relegated to the distinction of mere stereotypes. They may be extroverts or introverts, but no one girl's one absolute. No one girl's simply the life of the party, just as no one girl's simply a shut-in. Neither is unconditionally anti-social, and both are, by their own past experiences, insecure. Loneliness is an issue for all, manifesting as much in a crowded class as in an empty room. Not one girl is perfect, their masks, their mischief, their indecisiveness, cowardice, impulsiveness, selfishness... they all show, despite themselves and their counterintuitive efforts to preserve the status quo. More than just characters, they're people, female, adolescent, and flawed through and through. And for the male lead? Outside of his sex, he's no exception, especially towards the second half. \\n\\n\r\nIf what you seek out of this show is your idealistic conception of what a romance should entail, then read well: that's not going to happen here. The ordeals are messy, frustrating, not because they're emotionally manipulative, but because they're real, because the characters, being who they are, are complex, conflicted, and real themselves. It's what would happen in this unextractable web of complexities and contradictions of \u201cI wills,\u201d \u201cI won'ts,\u201d and \u201cIt hurts,\u201d where cutting one thread leads to the mangling of another.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are those little touches, subtle, never exaggerated, that give these characters sincerity as well as charm. Overly sweetened coffee black, for instance, to match my craving for black milk tea in the morning for every morning.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show exploits these touches and others, subtleties of all kinds and layers, scattered, embedded, and incorporated into the narrative to outstanding degrees. Barring the first episode, this show's direction and script is all about subtly, about inference, of \u201cshow\u201d and not simply \u201ctell.\u201d Where the camera pans, zooms, cuts, and lingers. When the facades of facial expressions slip into distress and recover to overcompensate, the eyes, the lips, the bangs. The deliberate tones in lighting, or the selective shades of lack thereof, complemented by the beautiful looking set pieces. The conversations, highly nuanced, roundabout, indirect, and, when it's called for, blistering. The use of flashbacks before the show's start, combined with the retracing of new and carefully omitted ground within past scenes at the most heart-wrenching of moments, the foreshadowing, and even the character of the character designs and clothes. Barring Episode 1, with masterful strokes of minimalist direction, interwoven seamlessly and purposefully with the music, whether bgm or insert, no one direction is ever oversold. They perfectly illustrate the personalities and emotional states of the cast at any given moment, whether they are bubbling underneath the surface or blasting corkscrew out of it. The best part, and perhaps the most refreshing part, is that it takes its time to do all of this, so that every form of direction feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of three qualifications, this show has a sex scene, one without shots of anything particularly precious, but it's easy to infer what's happening. That being said, it's completely within taste, substantially enhances the narrative, and subscribes to a rather waning view that sex is emotional consummation rather than just physical titillation. Also, adolescent intercourse does happen in the real world, and I personally congratulate the staff for including it in, but if you happen to be allergic to sex scenes regardless, then you're going to have trouble fully enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic's, unsurprisingly, a strong element in this series. Outside of tackling the technicalities or philosophies behind notes, though practice does make perfect, the series does everything else in exploiting the medium to create meaning in the music. Outside noise fillers and mood setters, they express powerful sentiments that put the thoughts and actions of characters within context, especially with Touma, whose feelings unseen and unspoken, given her reserved nature, bleeds into her piano pieces. It adds another layer of \u201cshow\u201d through melodies and harmonies, and even the lyrics of the songs that have them are loaded with meaning in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the OP, \u201cA Love That Cannot Be.\u201d Known in romaji as \u201cTodokanai Koi 13\u201d by Rena Uehara in one track and Madoka Yonezawa, Ogiso's seiyuu, in another, its vocals, combined with electronic keyboard, electric guitar, and a synthetic backtrack, rocks and croons of a passionate nostalgia, of happier times in younger days past caked in a film of melancholy. The visual detail's not quite Kyoto Animation or P.A. Works standards, but it's still really good, and the visual content corresponds excellently with the music, blurs, glare, overlays, and the waning light from sunsets. It also features visually vague moments that occur in the show that contribute to this aesthetic, but aren't really spoilers since they're only fully significant in, once again, hindsight. It's best thought as a bittersweet reminisce by an adult of his or her turbulent youth. White Album 2 is winter-themed, and snow can be beautiful, if chilling. In addition, the transitions are handled with a quiet, yet powerful mix of grace and dignity. It also attempts to do this interesting thing with omitting Touma's face until Episode 3 to reflect a certain in-show direction, which would have been clever had it not been compromised by something in Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED for Episodes 3-6 and 8-10 (Episode 7 doesn't have an ED), \u201cSayonara no Koto,\u201d or \u201cGoodbye\u201d also by Uehara, flows in the same thematic vein, with recaps of scenes of the episode now past, an evolution from a delicate, yet noble instrumental chorus of electric synthetics, keyboard, classic guitar, violin, then vocals, then electric bass, then drumset, then electric guitar, before it reaches a climax with a vigorous and progressive rock beat, and, finally, settling back down to its quiet origins. Episodes 2, 11, and 12 have their own Uehara EDs, \u201cclosing 13,\u201d \u201cAfter All ~Tsuzuru Omoi~,\u201d or \u201cAfter All ~Writing Down My Feelings~\u201d and \u201cTwinkle Snow 13\u201d respectively are also great in their own ways but, for the sake of brevity, I'll refrain from their music other than saying they accompany rather significant moments with a certain someone. And after all, they're better enjoyed in context than not. That goes double for the insert concert songs, \"White Album,\" \"Sound of Destiny,\" and the OP, since, outside of singing, they contain some really nice surprises involving solos.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1. It's not a bad episode, all in all; in fact, I think its conclusion was very well choreographed. Still, compared to its successive sisters, this episode has a couple of things that stick out like a sore thumb. There's a questionable amount of exposition within it that I think was a bit superfluous. A few carefully chosen words especially towards the end, coupled with the music, would have been better for the mood, but by far the biggest concern I have was the beginning, where the show previewed portions of the concert from Episode 7. I suspect it was supposed to be kind of a hook, but, returning to an earlier instance of direction which could have been clever, the omission of Touma's facial features seemed to be intended as a means for suspense that also worked in character, given her cold, aloof exterior. While it may have been no surprise that she would play one of the center role, what she looked like would, had it not been spoiled earlier by that flash forward.\\n\\n\r\nHe has to know, climbing the stairs to the roof, treading the outer walls of the school from stories high to get into the adjacent room's open window. The rest is history. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been an unparalleled experience to have watched this show and I sincerely hope after reading this review, everyone who's interested watch it as well. It is one of the most finely told romantic dramas I have ever had the pleasure to see, and while the ending was conclusive, since this is only the Introductory Chapter, the story's not even over yet.\\n\\n\r\nI give White Album 2 a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations have always had a notorious reputation in anime communities. Whether it be issues with pacing, narration, or some nonlinear route structure, these adaptations suffer from a variety of heated complaints from fans of the original source material, sometimes even as to have their very existence denied.\r\nThankfully, White Album 2 is not one of those adaptations.\r\nAdapted from the ~introductory chapter~ segment of the bestselling Leaf visual novel of the same name, White Album 2 (henceforth referred to as \u201cWA2\u201d) manages to retain a lot of the strengths of the source material while approaching it in a different, but appropriate, fashion. It is importantto note that, despite the title, WA2 is not a direct sequel to the first White Album, related only by setting and a number of references, so viewing of the first series is not required.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, WA2 is, simply put, a romance. To be more specific, it is a love triangle. It begins with a student named Kitahara Haruki trying to revive his high school\u2019s light music club. In doing so, he eventually finds himself involved with the two girls who join the club: Ogiso Setsuna and Touma Kazusa.  Certainly, this is a fairly basic set-up for the genre. WA2\u2019s romance is played out in a straight and down-to-earth manner, and its strengths lie with the subdued execution of that romance.  In a genre filled with stories that often resort to predictable archetypes and tropes to drive themselves forward, WA2 avoids the pitfalls of many other titles by doing away with the excessive melodrama and roundabout confessions. It does not strive beyond the boundaries of its genre, and thus certainly cannot be compared to shows that feature Titans being screamed at. \\n\\n\r\nConsider the very beginning of the show, which reveals some key events that will occur at the end of the anime. In this brief sequence, viewers will be made aware of the kind of road that WA2 is set on. Both readers familiar with the source material and newcomers may initially find this to be a questionable directorial decision. However, in the grand scheme of things, WA2 is not focused on the fact that these events occur, but on how the characters and their relationships caused these events. After all, there are only so many ways a romance can turn out without treading on the grounds of bizarre or convoluted narratives. In general, the genre should focus on the chemistry between the characters and how they deal with the emotions of love.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters are undoubtedly central to the romance in WA2. The characters are not dolls made to fulfill a given role, but believable people with distinct personalities. In particular, the main lead Haruki seems like an excellent student, yet so obviously flawed. His altruistic personality leads him into making many unintentional mistakes, and he is unable to avoid the problems he is causing despite being aware of them. And just like Haruki, Setsuna and Kazusa also try to avoid the problems in their own way, but inevitably end up hurting the others in the process. These characters make sensibly human mistakes that some viewers will resonate strongly with, while others may find themselves incredibly frustrated. The notion that viewers opt for a favorite heroine need not apply when the characters can be both endearing and detestable. The alleged title of \u201cbest girl\u201d might as well be given to Haruki.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, much of the characterization is owned to the wonderful script written by Fumiaki Maruto, the original scenario writer for WA2.  The characters and their interactions are brought to life through clear and purposeful dialogue. The lines illustrate the chemistry between the characters and the gradual build-up of romantic tension as the show progresses. As an adaptation, the script is very much condensed to serve time constraints in the animated form, and Haruki\u2019s insightful narration is lost. Thankfully, this is substituted by visual expressions and gestures used by the characters to show certain emotions rather than tell them. Setsuna\u2019s physical distancing during some conversations in the earlier episodes, for example, indicate her perceptions toward Kazusa. In many cases, this use of storytelling adds to the scenes, improving upon the original. On the other hand, some lines in the script are altered, perhaps changing the nuance of the original scenes. A particular example of this is with the scene that introduces Kazusa, in which she speaks with an angry tone as opposed to a confused one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show\u2019s use of visual storytelling, the technical aspects of the animation suffer from a number of problems, particularly due to the production by Satelight. While the character designs themselves are arguably an improvement over the original's, quality mishaps are abound regarding the anatomy of the characters in some shots. There is also a general lack of \u201cliveliness\u201d in the animation, resulting in dull movements and stills. A notable offender of this is when the concert scene occurs in the story, and repetitive shots of the school\u2019s scenery are seen as music is playing. Moreover, a few other important scenes feature questionable fanservice shots and odd angles, intruding on the mood of these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the aural aspects of WA2 make up for the mishaps in the animation. The soundtrack, featuring tracks that are played by an actual pianist, really complement the nature of the show, more so due to the focus on music. Dramatic sequences are accentuated with powerful yet delicate melodies, such as the instrumental of the aptly-named ending theme, \u201cSayonara no Koto.\u201d Vocal songs are also prominent, reinforcing the show\u2019s themes through their lyrics.  Ultimately, the music is an integral part of the experience in WA2.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the experience is certainly something else. Despite being only a prologue to a larger story, the anime adaptation of WA2 offers a sense of completeness that most adaptations, and anime series in general, should strive for. It is faithful as an adaptation, yet carries its own unique charm. It has a fairly simple premise, yet goes much deeper than that with its characters.  The season of White Album has gracefully passed us by, but it won\u2019t be forgotten so easily.",

            "content": "Have you ever fallen in love? \r\nI did. I still am.\r\nWhite Album 2 is set after 10 years of the events that occurred in the original White Album. Despite the title being White Album 2, the story isn't a sequel but is pretty much a standalone or what you could say an alternate setting which has minimal relevance to its predecessor. The only apparent connection are the songs which were sung in the first anime and the people who wrote them, and that it is set in the same world. In simple words, you don't need to watch the first anime to understand this andI would not recommend in doing so since I find the first one to be the complete opposite of what this is - a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of White Album 2 is pretty straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story revolves around the three main characters namely Kitahara, Touma, and Ogisa. These three are so relatable that I'm pretty sure some of us could even picture themselves living and experiencing the different social dillemmas each character is facing - they're as real as it gets. At first they might look common, typical or plain but later on as the characters reveal more and more of their personalities and problems, they'll also grow on you. With the intent of being good friends, a simple admiration turned into something more but the intrusion of another led to a love triangle conflict without even realizing it. The story grows beyond from here but as much as I would like to tell more, I would rather have you watch it as it would only spoil all the fun. \\n\\n\r\nPeople tend to do crazy things when in love. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as beyond what logic could measure, humans would do anything when it comes to love. Love is such an extraordinary phenomenon that people would do something they normally won't do. Trust, betrayal, and even sacrificing one's good for the sake of another - as long as love is present, there is so much an ordinary person could do yet there's so much to lose. That's what I find so great in this anime; it depicts real human emotions at its finest, and at its worst.\\n\\n\r\nFor a mature and a serious drama/romance anime, the animation is as fitting as it should be. The characters and the backgrounds are very well drawn, the movements are fluid, and the shadings too are very well applied. Not only is the animation good on its own but it also compliments the feel to its amazing music. \\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect from a musical anime, the music is really good. In fact the soundtracks are absolutely breathtaking from the first episode and it never did go any less up to the last. The lyrics of the songs completely fit the atmosphere adding up to the emotional feeling of the scenario they were on. The voice actors too did their roles very well, might it be just a simple conversation or was it through singing; you can really feel the emotions flowing.\\n\\n\r\nAt its shining moments, the drama intensifies and the confrontations would make your heart skip a beat. You'd even start to wonder why is it so wrong when it's supposed to feel right, or the opposite. But if you were a person in love, you would know why. After all has been said and done, I could understand why some would feel a bitter aftertaste but let's face it - because even in real life, not everything goes the way we want it to.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is such an emotional rollercoaster. At times you'll find yourself smiling along with the characters, and at some you'll find yourself crying. You'll be totally engrossed that you'll find yourself glued onto the screen wondering what would they do next then asking yourself if you would have done the same thing. But by then you won't have even realized that you're already teary-eyed because of how you care and sympathize for the characters that have already grown on you. It is just that good.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest. I enjoyed every single bit of this anime. But I guess \"enjoyed\" is an understatement since I pretty much fell in love with this anime. And know what, people do crazy things when they're in love just like what White Album 2 made me do - to once again write a review in which I swore I would never ever do.",

            "content": "White Album 2 is one of those series many people tend to overlook these days because for a variety of obvious reasons. Some of them might be prior experience with other \u201cWhite Album\u201d franchise anime that left with mediocre impressions. Then, there\u2019s also a belief that anime series based off of visual novel tends to be the inferior brand. Finally, maybe it could just be the synopsis or premise of the show. It looks simple, tends to be simple, and it is simple. But what you might be surprised at is that White Album 2 is not what it appears to be. Rather than goingthrough a bunch of stereotypical ideas wrapped in a loop of cliches, White Album 2 actually jumps out of that zone on various occasions.\\n\\n\r\nTake first note that White Album 2 is not a sequel of the original series. The characters from White Album do not make appearance nor their story connect in any way. Instead, the show stands out as a standalone series based off the visual novel of the same name developed by Leaf. The series chronicles the lives of three young individuals as they become a trio of close friends during their last semester of high school. It\u2019s their final chances to make some memories they won\u2019t forget and chances don\u2019t come easily.\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place in high school but focuses it at its ending stages or rather, the final semester. There\u2019s a pressure of futuristic opportunities and decisions to make often during these times. Think of it this way: when you were in high school, have you ever thought what you wanted to be or what you wanted to do after you graduate? For Haruki Kitahara, he can be described as one of those individuals without an exact goal in mind. What he does have in mind though is his ambition to play at the annual school festival. The problem? They need members for the light music club to accomplish this task. This is where our two heroines comes in from the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there\u2019s Setsuna Ogiso, a popular girl at school known well for her beauty and talent in singing. It\u2019s easy for people to make friends with Setsuna because of her bright personality. In fact, many of the times we see her throughout the series is where she is compassionate towards others. Setsuna also possesses the talents of a singer especially after Haruki discovers her on the rooftop one faithful day. The way she sings is majestic, beautiful, and those moments defines her character. On the other hand, there\u2019s Kazusa Touma. Unlike Setsuna, she is usually cold, aloof, and distant towards others. This is evidenced by her hobby of skipping classes and falling asleep that often results in scolding from her professors. But if there\u2019s one thing she does care is music. Music, a word that has transformed words into a form of art and revolutionized entertainment, is what Touma holds dearly to her life. With a common idea in mind, these three characters are the core of the show that define White Album 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization plays an imperative role throughout the show so it\u2019s important to pay attention to them. Haruki seems to be your typical high school student without much to stand out. He is friendly towards others, honest, accepting, loving, generous, and determined. He might not be a celebrity but Haruki isn\u2019t just a guy that looks around to goof off at school or hit on girls. Instead, he truly cares about his friends and be there when they need the most. On another scale, Setsuna is like a walking billboard of radiance that attracts others. But if we look at her carefully, there\u2019s a sense of insecurity coming out from her character. The smile she wears sometimes seems to formulate a mask that hides her true emotions. It\u2019s not that Setsuna wants to be selfish but some of her decisions tends to be an act based on herself and what she believes in. Finally, Touma is like a stone of hieroglyphics that is hard to decipher. No one really knows what she\u2019s thinking because of her cold personality. It is evidenced that her childhood can be defined as lonely and solitary so that could be part of the reason that made her whom she is today. Luckily, Touma\u2019s love for music defines her character in another way, as a girl that embraces the art and tries to perfect it as a passion. White Album 2\u2019s main characters all get their spotlights and screen time that examines their personalities, lives, and development as they finish their finish year at high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of White Album 2 might take a while to get used to. I\u2019m referring to the rather slow pacing especially in the beginning as we get to know our main protagonists. Taking place in a high school life setting also places the story in a way that is relatable because of the focus on future, struggles at school, and relationships. The story doesn\u2019t drive off with odd plot holes. Instead, it is quite straight forward that is easily comprehensible. It also offers anime-only viewers a way of predicting future events as each episodes unfolds itself. The series also defines itself as a romance show so it\u2019s interesting to theorize who Haruki will choose as his partner for an everlasting relationship. It can be perturbing at some instances but can also create excitement especially for our main characters at the apex of their school lives. Yes, what I\u2019m referring to here is their dreams and ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Touma is passionate about music. Thanks to her skills with the piano, electric guitar, and other instruments, she stands out as a prominent star of the series. The core of their school life doesn\u2019t come easily as there\u2019s an old saying that goes \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019. This concept generally applies to Haruki as he lacks the skills of a child prodigy. What he does have though is a determined heart and spirit to tackle any obstacle through. His dedication fortifies a will that seems to spread like an inspiration to others such as Touma. Setsuna\u2019s skills of singing also becomes the voice of White Album 2. This only defines half the story however as White Album 2 later on takes on a route of that brings forth more emotional impact. It chronicles the relationships of our main characters that is a mixed bag of love, loyalty, respect, and sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nWhile White Album 2 remains refreshing, relatable, and realistic, the show suffers some problems as well. There\u2019s a lack of focus on supporting characters as most of them fades behind the scenes. Most of them plays little roles other than being introduced that becomes part of the cast only on some occasions. The story itself also becomes a bit predictable on various occasions. There\u2019s also some fan service that can be distracting and forceful. Haruki also seems to be portrayed as Mr. Nice Guy with nothing special in particular. I also find a few of his decisions to be irrational and seemingly absurd. Some events also comes as abrupt and hard to sympathize with in terms of development especially involving relationships. There\u2019s also a problem with narrative as the show focuses on three characters but none of them goes through the story by their point of view.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, White Album 2 is realistic and designed to look as well as feel like a slice of life. The character designs fits most of their roles well. The outfit designs during the light music club\u2019s debut are fashionable and artistic. (Although more embarrassing in some ways for Touma) But taken on a technical perspective, the artwork is realistic enough that camera angles focuses on each movement of the club when they play music. Examples of this include Touma\u2019s finger movements on the piano, Haruki\u2019s flow with his guitar, or the way Setsuna sings her heart out at her fans. There\u2019s no doubt that realism is strong in the artwork department with a peculiar sense of normalcy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of White Album 2 is an embodiment that defines our main characters\u2019 passion and unites them as a group. The OST is calm and pleasant throughout the series but it\u2019s the songs that truly shines. Songs such as White Album, Sayonara no Koto, and the OP song Todokanai Koi '13' defines the show\u2019s style at its finest form. It feels like a juggernaut of feelings poured into the lyrics that makes the show stands out. Voice acting wise, I give praise to Hitomi Nabatame (Strawberry Panic: Shizuma, Chaos;Head: Aoi, Gantz: Kei Kishimoto) as her role of Kazuma Touma. Her voice fits perfectly with her mature and cold voice that defines the character that Touma is.\\n\\n\r\nSo White Album 2 is probably a show that would stand as something a lot of people might overlooked. It could be the fact that the anime didn\u2019t have much expectations based from the synopsis, preview, or experiences from the previous franchise. As a dark horse, White Album 2 is one of those series that realistic with a fusion of music, relationships, and characterization explored in ways that is surprisingly interesting. The story might feel a bit slow and predictable sequences will pop up. However, patience is a key to unlock the satisfaction of this show. And once you open that door, you\u2019ll discover the true essence of White Album 2.",

            "content": "Two's a plenty, three's a crowd. Or so the saying goes.\r\nPeople like to say friendship lasts forever. They want to believe that things will never change between themselves and the ones closest to their hearts during their teenage years. However, when multiple men and women grow close enough to each other there eventually comes a point where life-changing decisions must be made. And if your social circuit happens to consist of one man and two women... then odds are that someone is going to have to be left out.\r\nWhite Album 2 is a rare anime in the sense that it is a story about actualtrue love in a mature sense. It is also highly realistic and tangible, which is a strangely unusual thing to find in today's anime industry. Above all however... it is simply beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a short summary of what White Album 2 has to offer then here's a quick rundown of it. Otherwise the full review follows below:\\n\\n\r\n- One of the most faithful visual novel adaptations you'll ever find \\n\r\n- Close to perfect pacing, not a single scene feels needless yet nothing feels like it's missing either\\n\r\n- Very mature and realistic take on romance\\n\r\n- Lots of actual romantic progression and relationship development\\n\r\n- Quite serious emotional drama, this can either result in it being found tear-jerking or a bit clich\u00e9 depending on who you ask\\n\r\n- No stereotypical anime character tropes are utilized, everyone in White Album 2 feels like a real person\\n\r\n- No moe, ecchi or other fanservice-esque elements\\n\r\n- Very high-level and emotional voice acting\\n\r\n- Heavy emphasis on music: the main characters together make up their high school's light music club and Setsuna's voice actress sing many of the series tracks (beautifully at that I have to say)\\n\r\n- While the ending isn't conclusive since only the first chapter of the visual novel is adapted, it still leaves off on a very satisfying note, and therefore the anime works totally fine as a standalone product even for anime-only viewers\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is one of the absolute most critically acclaimed visual novels of all time, currently sitting at #2 on Erogamescape and #5 on VNDB among other things at the time of writing this, and it is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. This anime does not cover anywhere near the entire story however, but rather solely the ~Introductory Chapter~ which makes up roughly the first 15% of it. Now you may find the notion of an adaptation only covering such a tiny amount disheartening, but that is not really the case here as the first chapter on its own works just as well as a standalone anime. Furthermore, by narrowing down the scope this much, the anime instead manages to nail what little content it covers more or less perfectly, and as a result this is one of the absolute best VN adaptations I have ever seen. Satelight made an outstanding job turning this into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 (henceforth only referring to the anime) is the story of Kitahara Haruki, a diligent student and one of the only two remaining members of the light music club. He dreams of reviving the club after all its other members resigned, and to have them perform at the upcoming school festival as their last event before graduation. In order to do so he manages to get the aid of the cheerful karaoke-loving school idol Ogiso Setsuna, as well as the quiet black-haired beauty Touma Kazusa who is his fellow classmate and a high-level pianist. Together they try to somehow scrape together a performance in what limited time they have left in order to create a final memory before they graduate. That was the only intention.\\n\\n\r\nOr at least, that's what is what supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor the three of them however, the bonds they acquire with each other intertwine in a very intricate and complicated web of emotions, resulting in a rather convoluted and tension-filled love triangle. One without any optimal resolution in sight and packed to the brim with conflicting emotions. This results in the anime being somewhat of a tearjerker but an exquisitely written one at that. Of course not everyone appreciates these kinds of stories since it can also be interpreted as somewhat clich\u00e9, and while I cannot deny that fact I still think this is easily one of the best series of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really cannot be understated with this anime is just how good the pacing is. The ~Introductory Chapter~ of the visual novel is only seven or so hours long, yet the anime is given a full 13 episodes for that alone. It's such a refreshing feeling seeing a story with no holes in it at any point, yet it doesn't ever feel slow or boring for a single second either. Everything in White Album 2 feels like it's actually important and serves as an important piece of the overall story. There are also some neat narrative tricks utilized in the story presentation such as specific camera angles leaving out certain elements intentionally, as well as using flashbacks instead of a totally linear style of story-telling in order to give the show a bigger sense of unpredictability and creativity.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of White Album 2 are not based on generic anime tropes like the vast majority of today's shows are, but rather feel like genuine human beings. The concept of fanservice is more or less non-existent in this anime, and instead it offers a very mature outlook on what youthful love might look like in real life, as well as what responsibilities and consequences comes along with it. Is it right to wish for your own happiness if it comes with the misfortune of others? Is it always justified to follow the calling of your heart? These are some of the questions this anime asks.\\n\\n\r\nThese types of intricate questions make the character development of White Album 2 quite spectacular, as you can clearly see how all three of the main characters change drastically over the course of time. This goes both for how they act by themselves and towards the other two. Whether the choices they all make are right or wrong at times is up to interpretation, but I think all of them are perfectly understandable at least. Above all though, it results in something actually HAPPENING. The biggest problem in most romance anime is the lack of actual romantic development but White Album 2 has it aplenty, despite only being 13 episodes long. Furthermore it actually feels sincerely believable for once, yet not completely predictable either.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is stellar. The animation is very crisp and clean, and fits perfectly for the theme and atmosphere of the series. Above all though, the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. It primarily consists of remakes of the OST from the original visual novel, and contains mainly vocal-heavy and instrumental tunes. These tracks are further enhanced by them oftentimes actually being performed live by the characters themselves, albeit merely in practice more often than on stage. The timing of the music is also used excellently, as the key emotional scenes of the story are heavily supported by the background music and the superb voice acting. Really White Album 2 would not have been the same as it is if it wasn't for the audio department. I really cannot praise it enough.\\n\\n\r\nAs always with these kinds of series, there will be some heavy shipping wars going on regarding which of the two girls every viewer happens to prefer, but regardless of who you happen to fancy I still think that the overall story progression of White Album 2 should be very satisfactory either way. This is not an anime about which is the #bestgirl, it's much deeper and more touching than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although this anime only covers a tiny portion of the full story of the visual novel, it is without a doubt an outstanding series in and of itself. Ironically despite the majority of the story not being shown in this anime, the ending of it still feels a hell of a lot more conclusive than most romance series out there. If you didn't know there was any more story left to be told, then you'd probably never imagine there was. It really feels that conclusive despite everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for:\\n\r\nFans of mature romance and emotional dramas, as well as people who can appreciate exquisite presentation and directive for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for:\\n\r\nPeople who are looking for a lighthearted romcom and those who place too much emphasis on their personal favorite coupling coming into fruition. The latter is not what this show is about on a metalevel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the amount of emotion and sheer quality White Album 2 manages to squeeze out of a mere 13 episodes is phenomenal. It goes to show just how far you can come with a good source material and some stellar directing.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only all visual novel adaptations could do the same thing...",

This is a show that should not be taken lightly. The first episode does not at all warn the viewer of the emotional rollercoaster that is to follow. WA2 will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. It is filled with realistic characters with the best of intentions; however, acting on emotion instead of logic is the surest recipe for disaster. Perhaps this realism is the reason why I was so drawn to it. It is definitely an anime that will captivate you from its very first frame and linger in your heart long after its last. \\n\\n\r\nThis review may include spoilers (particularly the conclusion). You've been warned.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 (which will from this point on be referred to as WA2) is a simple love story involving three main characters, who, cruel by the stroke of fate, meet one fall afternoon. The trio become friends, and shortly after, a love triangle soon forms. One of the many reasons why I love the show is its consistency. The very first line in this anime sets the mood of the show, and never does it once falter from it. Going into this show, I didn't know what to expect; I was expecting your generic rom/com with excessive fanservice, nonsensical/nonexistent plot, and characters as flat and one-dimensional as paper. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nAt the core of WA2 lies its characters. The first episode portrays each and every character in the most stereotypical, most cliche ways. We meet the geeky honor student, the tsundere, and the school idol. They are portrayed as characters without flaws; characters who always keep their cool and calm demeanor, knowing just what to say in a situation. By the second half of the story, however, this fascade that we (the viewers) have been shown this whole time starts to fall off, and we are met with a very flawed, imperfect, selfish, and greedy cast. Despite all the downright terrible things they do to each other, you can't blame them. As I said earlier in the review, these characters always have the best of intentions, wishing for everyone to be happy; however, acting solely on emotion while disregarding any logical reasoning will always lead to disaster. The character's actions, especially near the end, are always justified. They may be acting thoughtlessly, sometimes even blantly disregarding what happens to anyone around, but to them, their hearts are telling them that they are in the right. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? In almost every romance anime, we see characters fall head over heels for each other; however, rarely do we actually FEEL how much these characters WANT to be with one another. In WA2, I actually felt myself being immersed in these characters' personalities, even empathizing for them, and when everything comes crashing down toward the end (and it does), my heart broke just as our protagonist's and the heroines' hearts did as well.\\n\\n\r\nWA2 was produced by Satelight, a studio known for its most notorious work, Fairy Tail. Needless to say, the studio didn't hold back in terms of sound or animation. The colors, lighting, and character designs fit the mood of the show perfectly, so did its sound. For an anime revolving around music and art, I thought that the OST, particularly the ending song, \"After All\", was superb. I loved the emotion and score of each and every one of the soundtracks, and to this day, I still listen to them.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, the viewers are shown time and time again that love is messy. Unlike all the other romance/harems out there, WA2 realistically shows why a love triangle will never work. White Album 2 is a tragic tale revolving around three people who become friends and fall in love for the first time, and how their friendship is tested, strained, and eventually violently ripped apart because of \"a love that cannot be.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy any form of romance anime, whether it be harem, comedy, psychological, or dramatic, I recommend you give White Album 2 a watch. If you don't end up liking it, I would be very surprised.",

            "content": "Let me go right off the bat and say this anime was disappointing, the first half was fine and looking like it will  turn into a decent romance anime but unfortunately for this series where you would expect it to start becoming really good it completely falls down on its fat face. WARNING CONTAINS SPOILS. You have been warned\r\nStory : 6\r\nThe story starts off as any romance anime does, introduce the love interests and develop some back story for the characters. The story then revolves around Kazusa Touma, Setsuna Ogiso and Haruki Kitahara getting ready for the school fair which for their act isputting on a music show. This is the part that looked promising, 3 friends working hard together to achieve a common goal and the bonds that are forged in the process but that all ends after the school fair arc. After the school fair arc Setsuna and Haruki start to date because Haruki (who has feelings for Kazusa, I will get into this in the character section) isn't firm enough with her and on the spur of the moment kisses and subsequently starts to date Setsuna. Setsuna despertly trying to keep the 3 of them together arranges various activities for them to do such as go to a spar. The final part of the anime revolves around the reveal that Touma is moving to europe and Haraki subsequent attempts to get her to stay in japan. This is the part of the story I fucking hate, Haruki lies to Setsuna (on her birthday) that he is sick and goes to visit Touma, a series of events happen that lead to them HAVING SEXUALLY INTERCOURSE, whilst he is still dating Setsuna on her birthday. Touma still decides to leave after all that shit and goes to catch her plain to europe but not before a heart warming last good bye right? WRONG Haruki then proceeds to start making out with Touma in front of Setsuna (who is still his gf btw). Touma then says her feelings in front of setsuna and then leaves for europe leaving Setsuna and Haraki with a broken Relationship. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo with the first half looking like a fun happy anime ends up with every character being sad and depressed. Fuck this story and everything it represents. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8 \\n\\n\r\nBecause this show is based on music you would expect it to be good and fortunately this is true. Their isnt' anything noteworthy to be said but the sound track (mostly the same) is good and lives up to the name  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nHaruki Kitahara: \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of this anime Haruki is a good guy, he treats people nicely and is overall not an asshole. This all changes however in the second half. As I mentioned before despite having a gf he proceed to have sex with touma, and then at the airport start kissing her in front of said gf. I just find him to such a despicable asshole. He has next no morals and only gives a fuck about what he wants with no consideration for anyone around him. The only other character I can compare him to is the main character from school days as both are assholes but unfortunately for this anime he didn't die in the end. \\n\\n\r\nSetsuna Ogiso. \\n\\n\r\nThe only word I can use to describe her with is Crazy. Despite the fact the she knew that Haruki liked Touma he still basically forced him to go out with her which at the point was the downfall for the group she so desperately wanted to keep going. Then after finding out that her bf cheated on her and then kissed touma in front of her leaving her in tear, She still stayed with him. All in all shes a terrible character that probably contributed the most to the fall of the group she loved so much. DUMB BITCH \\n\\n\r\nKazusa Touma: \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime all she did was leave the guy she liked the cold shoulder. All she did was basically be a bitch to him but that didnt stop her from dumping all her feelings on him and having sex with him, despite the fact that she \"valued\" her relationship with Setsuna. She was the best of the worst in my opinion as till the end she sticked with what she wanted to do and said fuck Haruki im going to Europe, hopefully those two can clean after my mess. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a strong start but feel off at around the mid point of the show. The characters all betrayed each other and by the end all that was left was 3 very sad people who did it to them selves. To be honest its quite a stretch to gives this anime a 6",

            "content": "If you're an anime fan and you're anything like me, then you're getting a little goddamn tired of high school rom-com slice of life shows. They seem to breed like rabbits, flooding each new season with waves of uninspired crap. Worse than the fact that they're founded on generic, predictable stories is the fact that 95% of them rely on overused tropes, poor attempts at slapstick humor, cliches, terrible dialogue and more anime-isms than one can count. Shows that are airing now like Ore Monogatari get credit just for deviating ever-so-slightly from the formula, and while I do give such shows credit I still cannothelp but feel as though the vast majority of all of these shows are unwatchable crap. This is ANIME, aka, DRAWINGS. You can do ANYTHING. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical pieces, surrealism: the number of possibilities and the the amount of potential is unbelievable. The fact that so much of that is being wasted is a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2, however, is not wasting anything. Yes, it is set at a high-school with a male protagonist. Yes, it has drama. Yes, it has romance. But it's difficult to even compare it to other shows of its genre. White Album 2 has something to say. It doesn't \"deconstruct\" the genre: that would imply that it uses any of the genre's common elements to begin with. White Album 2 reinvents the high school slice-of-life, showing just what can be done with it if you have a creative mind, an understanding of chemistry, conversation and people, and a goal in mind besides getting two people together. It's a powerful, evocative tale about how complicated emotions and relationships can be, and while it doesn't change my stance on the genre it certainly rises above it. If all high school slice-of-life shows were this good, I would have a vastly different opinion of them.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspects of the show to grab my attention were the art and the music. This is a bit of an irregular for me, considering I usually place a considerably lower value on aesthetics than I do characters and plot. However, from the very beginning the show's aesthetics struck me not because they're of exceptionally high caliber (though they are extremely impressive) but because they're used creatively and effectively. They work with the story, not only complementing it but also adding to it. Art and music in anime are some of the best ways to achieve show-don't-tell, capable of highlighting character traits, establishing tone, and even telling their own story when subjected to good direction. This is something that should seem obvious, but a lot of shows under-utilize or just straight up ignore this possibility. My go-to example is Fate/Zero, a show with both top-notch animation and music (it seriously looks like it's from 2020) that puts neither to any use past having gorgeous fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 makes full use of its aesthetics from episode 1. It uses gorgeously drawn sunsets to emphasize feelings of nostalgia and to reflect the feeling of not wanting the status quo to change (the setting sun implying the transition to a new day). It uses shot-framing to demonstrate what characters are focused on, as well as lighting to imply how characters feel (oftentimes characters having a conversation will be lit in different ways even though they are in the same place, showing how each of them view the other). It even makes use of font, using a crystalline and gleaming lettering for its credits and on-screen text that fits in with Touma's cold-feeling yet elegant aura. The music is another story entirely: White Album 2 is a show that revolves around music with several of its characters striving to be musicians of their own and everyone in the show being profoundly affected by music. Several of the songs that the characters listen to/play are repeated across the entirety of the show, both as diegetic sound and as background music, garnering meaning both to the characters and the audience as the show progresses. The song 'White Album', first featured in the beginning of episode 1, both physically brings the characters together and is a reflection of the nature of their relationships. I was constantly impressed by the show's directing and the emotional response it was able to instill using aesthetics alone, and I award it full points in both of these categories for being a gleaming example of how these elements of a show can be used.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, regardless of how well art and sound are used in a show, they are never single-handedly enough to make it a masterpiece (at least in my opinion). Nisekoi was a striking example of this, showing that even SHAFT can't make everything good. So lets talk about the story. Look, I never thought I'd say this. Even in the best high school slice-of-life shows the story is rarely very interesting, with execution and characters usually carrying the brunt of the burden. This is because after having so many of these goddamn shows and the extreme limitations they are bound by, there's really not much you can do outside of School Days that comes off as original or unique. Even Toradora, one of my long-standing favorites, has a plot that is for the most part generic. I am, however, forced to admit:\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 has a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nScratch that, it's outstanding. The underlying cause of this is that, as mentioned before, it has a goal in mind other than getting two characters together, and whilst it is completely unafraid to throw itself whole-heartedly into romance, it's not remotely exclusively about that. It's also about nostalgia (both for the past and the present), fearing the future, mistakes, heartbreak of many kinds, and regret. It weaves a tale that follows multiple characters thoroughly, valuing each of their ENTIRELY different struggles equally, and crafting them all together due to the character's shared bonds. None of the characters overwhelms the show by being viewed as more important or hogging too much of the focus. This allows for a story that is refreshingly original, relies on absolutely no cliches (there is no pool episode. There is no school festival episode. There is no school trip episode. There is no no fucking new years episode.) and follows what is important to the characters rather than what is going on at the goddamn high school. It also understands that high schoolers oftentimes do weird sh*t (in fact, all people do) and manages to embrace that in a way that is surprisingly touching and honest rather than coming off as creepy or \"irregular\". The show is absolutely void of fan-service: there is sexuality and sexual themes because hormones are a real thing that oftentimes take tangible form (WHO'D A THUNK??) but they're handled in a mature way. For a show a mere 13 episodes long, White Album 2 covers an amazing amount of ground and really makes you feel as though you've only seen a sliver of a long story with more on either end. That's perhaps the plot's strongest aspect: it doesn't feel as though it begins when the camera stars rolling. The show starts then, but the story started long before then and will continue long afterwards. So far I haven't even mentioned the ending, which simultaneously provides an unbelievably satisfying and powerful resolution to the story whilst still leaving the viewer feeling like there's much more to see. I guess that's what happens when you acknowledge that a kiss and a confession aren't the ultimate goal of life and don't result in an end to all struggles?\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you should have enough good reasons to go watch this show. Stellar direction, unique, refreshing and impressive story, gorgeous music, outstanding art: that's high praise. I'm pretty picky. But I'm not done yet. There's still something I want to want to give the show credit for.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 has two aspects in which it stands above pretty much every other anime I've seen: the combination of characters & writing. I know those are similar, but there is definitely a distinction. For instance, a show like Princess Tutu has amazing characters because the motivations and ideas behind those characters are original and believable, but the show's writing is pretty impressive because the dialogue through which the characters express who they are is bland and repetitive. White Album 2 both has outstanding characters in the sense that the ideas behind them are great and in the sense that their dialogue is crisp, real and refreshing. It is an absolute JOY to just watch people talk to each other in this show because they talk in the same way that, oh, I don't know, people actually converse! There are no rough or awkward transitions in subject matter, there are reasons behind the things that everyone in the show says and sometimes that reason is that people oftentimes talk without thinking. Emotions are expressed realistically and conveyed in ways that are deliciously real. Characters misinterpret each other in believable ways due to phrasing and every word actually counts. White Album 2 understands that people don't directly convey intentions to each other, they convey words and that others often misinterpret intentions through those words. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are amazing. I don't want to get too much into them for the sake of spoilers, but by the end of the show no commonly used archetype could be used to describe any of them. They're all individuals. There are three main characters: Haruki Kitahara, Kazusa Touma and Ogiso Setsuna. Each of them has a distinct relationship with each of the others and they have a group dynamic between the three of them as well. Each of them possesses a wealth of both common and more uncommon personality traits, and the show allows these to play off of each other in the way that makes sense. Kitahara is unyielding self-sacrificing to a fault where he is kind to everyone but not to any one person in particular: no one feels as though they are actually special to him because he white-washes his relationships with his selfless attitude. Touma is reclusive and unmotivated, initially having succumbed to feeling hopeless and numb and expressing that through a cold exterior that is clearly crying for attention, something that she refuses to admit to herself. Ogiso Setsuna- well, Ogiso Setsuna is one of my favorite characters of all time. She craves an idea so badly that once it becomes reality all she can think about is her fear of losing it and does everything in her power to ensure that it will endure. She searches for happiness and validation from the people around her, seeing that other people with close friends are happy and wanting to have that closeness as well without realizing that unless she can accept herself and love herself no amount of compassion from others will make her feel at peace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, White Album 2 was an absolutely incredible and unexpected experience. It easily made its way into my all-time favorites and I'm currently in the process of rewatching it. If you're tired of repetitive garbage, anime tropes, romance cliches, and slice-of-life bullshit, give this a shot anyways. It wont change your opinion about any of those other shows, but who cares: it's a masterpiece of a show, and at this point it's entirely its own thing.",

            "content": "Love sucks, plain and simple. Of course, that little detail is often lost in the overwhelming sea of romance anime/mangas out there which paints the whole ordeal of falling in love and actually getting into a relationship like it's all sunshine and rainbows. I think I can speak for the majority of us when I say that romance in real life is nothing like Kimi ni Todoke or Clannad. Furthermore, I think it's safe to say that if you've ever been caught in a love triangle in real life as well, it ain't gonna be like a harem comedy. Humans are fucked up creatures andby the end of it all, nobody comes out of a romantic encounter unscathed. People get hurt, and it fucking sucks. Say what you will about White Album 2, but you know what? It's probably the only anime that truly captures what romance is actually like without treating it like a farcical melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I can really see anyone having with this programme is the potential inability to empathise with what's going on and what the characters are going through. I'll say this right now: if you've never been caught in the middle of a love triangle in real life or don't at least make the effort to understand why the characters are doing what they're doing, you'll irrevocably hate this show. I mean, looking at this stuff from the outside-in is fucking frustrating to say the least because everything seems so simple in hindsight. Unfortunately, romance has this nasty habit of making simple things become a Herculean effort. Sure, you can say \"that's not always the case\" but it's sadly the case for most of us.\\n\\n\r\nI should give a warning to people who expect all their romances to be happy-go-lucky, but the only people who would ever expect ALL romances to be vanilla are mouth-breathing weeaboos with absolutely no social skills with their only romantic experience being masturbating to their high school crushes and being rejected when they tried to ask him/her out. To paraphrase something that Bob Ross once said during an episode of The Joy of Painting: you need some sadness so you know when the good times roll by. It's not like White Album 2 is completely devoid of happy/cute/sweet/heartwarming moments, because that's not the case whatsoever. It's just that we're more prone to remembering the bad shit happening than the good shit. \\n\\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that WA2 is probably like Oyasumi Punpun because you're never going to get that fairy tale ending where they all live happily ever after because that ain't how it works. As much as we might want Setsuna, Kazusa, and Haruki to end up in a poly relationship so that nobody will get hurt, we all know that shit *rarely* happens in anime, let alone in real life. Someone always gets the short end of the stick and people end up doing some pretty fucked up shit to each other along the way. In many ways, White Album 2 manages to perfectly capture all the feelings that people end up going through in romance: good, bad, and ugly.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said and done, you might be wondering why I didn't give this programme a 10/10. Well, the biggest reason is that White Album 2 is a visual novel adaptation by the end of it all. The anime only covers the introductory chapter of the VN which takes up around ~10-15% of the story. Whilst the anime is perfectly capable of standing on its own and ends in a manner which provides a sense of closure/resolution, I still want to know what happens to Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna after high school. Did I forget to mention that the visual novel is a massive work which covers ~5 years' worth of story (because that's kind of important)? If there's one thing I hate, it's knowing there's more story out there that is unfortunately unavailable (ref: Fruits Basket, Rurouni Kenshin, Berserk, etc). Even then, at least I can read the manga if there is no more anime available but therein lies the problem: the visual novel barring Introductory Chapter is untranslated so it makes me even saltier. Enough about that though, I guess you want my final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, White Album 2 is the among the best experiences I've ever had with anime in quite some time. While there are some frustrations that I have with the series, they aren't enough to actually affect my recommendation of the show. It's just such a shame that people end up dismissing romance as a genre deeply entrenched in the melodramatic. The biggest strength romance as a genre has is the fact that if done properly, it's something that can make for an incredibly empathetic experience. Unfortunately, the bulk of what passes for romance these days is uninspired drivel that's rife with so many tired-out clich\u00e9s that it's no wonder people can't stand romantic stories. I'm not making any promises here, but I'm sure if you were to give White Album 2 a shot, you might like it. I guess that's all I can really say at this point so with that, I'm out. Peace.",

            "content": "Walking on the streets of Kobe one late night on the eve of Christmas has showed me wonderful sights: couples holding hands together, wispy white breaths from salarymen rushing past me, swinging leather briefcases and purses, glaring red and green lights, smiles, and the children who sneaked out at night to sing carols in that small corner right over there. \r\nOf all the things that make Christmas what it is, this Kobe street is missing something. Not Santa Claus -- that large man with a huge belly donned in that trademark woolen clothing of his is crying out, \"Hohoho~,\" in the wooden chair. Not Rudolfthe Reindeer -- he's there but not as a living being; he's just a cardboard cutout standing beside him. And definitely not the jingles -- Frosty the Snowman is being played on the speakers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this Christmas is lacking is snow.\\n\\n\r\nIt is something I look forward to, even if winter is not my favorite season. It's hard to picture Santa Claus in the tropics of Malaysia; even in Kuala Lumpur, his stature is in front of a snowy backdrop. Many people see snow as purifying, romantic, and cleansing. But it can also be harsh and bitter.\\n\\n\r\nI see White Album 2 (both this season and the obviously-going-to-exist next season) as an extension of it. In this show, WA2 dives into a high school love triangle start with humble beginnings. Like all love triangles, it fosters innocently like a child clinging to his mother and then festers like a sore blister. White Album 2 seeks to not only hurt their lovable characters but you the viewer as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard for me to remember a show with a cast so likable and hatable at the same time. Kitahara Haruki, the protagonist, is just an average high school honors student. Until he finds himself loving two distinct personalities: Ogiso Setsuna (the idol) and Touma Kazusa (the aloof pianist). Setsuna's a homely, hardworking girl in a family that cries, \"We're family alright!\" On the other hand, Kazusa's estranged relationship with her mother leaves her in shambles and she practices piano alone in a small music room at school. These three characters, bland when separated, harmonize like those seamless sequences of chords Kazusa plays on her piano. They love each other dearly. A genuinely affectionate relationship between three friends who wanted to play some good music on the school concert. \\n\\n\r\nWithout that bond, I don't think the show (or even the VN) will work. One of the strengths of White Album 2 is Setsuna's insistence in that they must be together. At all costs. Even though they know it's not going to end well, the characters in their own quirky ways want to be together.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the drama takes place. The problem with most love triangles is simply this: you care about siding with the so-called \"best girl\". White Album 2 differs from the typical bunch and moves on a different path: there are no best girls. You want everyone to be together. Is friendship better than love? That's a very good question and you're going to struggle with it as the show moves on. Preserve the status quo or confess that you like him/her? Another good question.\\n\\n\r\nNobody has the right answers to them. By the end of this season, the characters are in a mess so unsolvable world-class detectives refuse to approach it. All you can do is be a miserable wreck and cry yourself out.",

            "content": "\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\"\r\nI hated this show.\r\n\"But,\" I hear you say, \"you gave it a 10/10, so you can't think it all that bad.\"\r\nWell, no. I don't think it's a bad show, in fact a very good one.\r\nBut I still hate it.\r\nLike what the games Spec Ops: The Line and Doki Doki Literature Club are to their respective genres, this is a show that swings a sledge hammer to your face for liking the musical genre.\r\nStory: On the surface, it's a fairly typical high school story about a young guitarist by the name of Haruki Kitahara trying to piece together enough musicians for aperformance at the school festival. He seeks out school idol Setsuna Ogiso and virtuoso pianist Kazusa Touma to join his club.\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls, one guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is the lead-up to the performance, which was very much a spectacle. However, not all of it is initially shown. Most people watching will recognise the final song played at the end of the anime - and it's a real gut punch despite its familiarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show depicts what happens once the seeds shown in the first half of the show begin to bloom. And die.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: It did its job. Being a winter-themed show, it goes heavy on blue, grey, white, dark green and other dark colours. The backgrounds seem at times blurred and indistinct, or even bland. I mean that not as a criticism. In fact, it makes the characters stand out more, and contributes to White Album 2 having the delicate feeling of a half-remembered dream. Or nightmare.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: It's a musical anime! Naturally the music (even the background music) was of a high standard. The song \"White Album\" had me hunting down the sheet music, and the OP and EDs still have me listening to them from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It is a romance show, and primarily character driven, with deeply human, flawed characters, that take a wide berth to stereotypes. take Haruki Kitahara is a worker, and has a typical anime protagonist design - messy dark hair. Someone who helps set up events and sticks around afterwards to help pack up. One can readily identify with his desire to help out. Although he has two clear goals in mind, \"reform the club\" and \"perform on stage\", he does often lack conviction. Something of a serious flaw in a romance show.\\n\\n\r\nNo character is a pure stereotype. All are well written and believable. So much so, that the usually fierce ship rivalries in comment sections could understand the other perspective, a mark of unusually good writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There is something of a tragedy that takes place at the end of the show. Depending on how you look at it, any one of the three characters (or all three) could be said to be the one at fault for what happened. That's what makes this show so good, drawing you in with relatable characters, letting their flaws manifest in a deeply human way.\\n\r\nIt's also why I hate it so much.\\n\\n\r\nNot for the downer ending, but because it was the characters own actions, all three of them, that led to them all losing what mattered to them most and in such a way that reason cannot sort who is in the right and who is in the wrong, for all their behaviours can be rationalised, depending on whose perspective you take.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is music preparation, with the performance at the half-way mark. What happens in the final few episodes re-frames your view of the entire show, but it doesn't feel forced. Rather, a natural extension of how we know the characters behave.\\n\\n\r\nI only hate one other anime as much as I do this show, and that's for the crime of wasted potential. There is no wasted potential here, with the show developing its characters and themes to the fullest extent a short single-cour story will allow.\\n\\n\r\nThe initial relatability of the main character caused this reviewer to chime with him very closely. This investment is what caused me to hate it so much. Being told \"Watch it! If you misstep like that, and we say you might, you will be punished harshly\" leaves me, understandably, feeling pretty angry.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also why I can't give this show anything less than a 10/10. Objectively, the show captures a piece of objective truth. Truth that can only be touched on in great stories and artworks, the beauty and horror of human nature, and the danger of following your deceitful and desperately wicked heart. It's a horrifying thing to hear, especially from a musical anime so unexpectedly.\\n\r\nIt did what it set out to do perfectly.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr The reviewer dislikes this objectively amazing show.",

            "content": "After being almost forced into it by a friend, who\u2019s basically in love with romantic stories, I\u2019ve decided to watch White Album 2, despite the fact that I\u2019ve had enough of soap operas about unlucky love for some time already. Anyways, I started watching. Before we get to rating and justifying the aforementioned, I have to admit one thing \u2013 this anime evokes borderline emotions. Whether positive or negative depends on the personal taste of the viewer, however, you can\u2019t just walk past them indifferently. And because of that, it reminds me a bit of Golden Time (and not only because of that, mind you).\r\nWarning,the following review contains a few minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe plot presented in the anime is solid and nothing above that. As it is portrayed in many stories, the school festival is the moment in the lives of the students in which they all enter a state of rut, and therefore, they want to do something about it no matter the cost. Here we have the revival of the Light Music Association. What\u2019s interesting, the climax of the story, namely the festival, happens almost halfway through. Unfortunately, what happens afterwards only impacts negatively on the rating. Stupid behavior, attractions, crying, and tears have been unnecessarily condensed into four-five last episodes, which tires and disgusts very fast. Not going into detail, the plot, although trivial, had potential, however a bit wasted because of the uneven distribution of romantic aspects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne can bicker about many thing in this anime, but being impartial, one cannot refuse that fact that from an artistic standpoint, the visuals are top notch. I totally don\u2019t know the terminology to define the quality, but I know one thing \u2013 it\u2019s pleasant on the eye and looks good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing what one notices is the music \u2013 delicate and subtle rhythms played one some kind of string instrument (a cello?) and the sounds played by the protagonists on the guitar or piano are the best medicine for ears brutally raped by the cacophony of some anime. The singing of one of the heroines is very pleasant for the ear, as well as the other voices are very appropriate, not irritating or distracting one bit. In brief \u2013 a good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nOne of the sections that cause the most mixed feelings in me. The MC looks promising, so different from the banality of most of the drama/romanse anime protags (either a total idiot that can\u2019t open his mouth around somebody representing the different sex and getting beet red just from mentioning a woman, or a wuss that can\u2019t decide on anything and always relegating his responsibility to others), but sadly, this changes with each passing episode. On the other hand, Setsuna and Touma are just cookie cutter characters. In the left corner we have an ex-idol dere-dere, and in the right corner we have a tsundere sociopath, one red haired and one black haired. One almost exudes her feelings for the MC in buckets, and the other is the classic case of \u201cwhy won\u2019t senpai notice me\u201d. The scriptwriter probably tried to save the situation in the last episodes, but he just worsened the whole thing. During that time, the MC sheds more tears than Shinji during the whole course of Evangelion, and the love triangle starts shifting sides like in a kaleidoscope. Reassuming \u2013 what looked good in the beginning got screwed up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nI really had a dilemma what rating to give here. The first eight episodes went in like a glass of Stolichnaya with an appetizer, but the next five just started causing a massive hangover. Maybe I don\u2019t stomach love triangles and MC\u2019s so \u2018manly\u2019 I\u2019m pondering how deep their vajay goes, and maybe it\u2019s just me who thinks that such behavior and choices are so totally and utterly stupid that my head starts to hurt. That\u2019s why many people won\u2019t probably agree with me, happens. However, in the end, I\u2019ll give a 6. The first few episodes were genuinely fun to watch, pleasant both for the eyes, ears, and for my sense of aesthetics. Unfortunately, the next ones started spoiling my idealized picture of the anime. Despite all the errors and irritating design choices, the anime stand above average in my book.\\n\r\nEveryone that likes such stories can easily add two points to my score, especially if you don\u2019t mind a lead character that couldn\u2019t decide anything and carry on the consequences of his decisions. Be what it may, I encourage you to watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Generic romance anime with generic characters all of whom fill a stereotype. We have a nice guy man-pussy, a popular kawaii-wannabe idol and you run of the mill tsundere. For an anime focused on music the music is surprisingly generic. The ending song is alright I guess, but the rest of the sounds are rather forgettable. The anime picks up after about 10 episodes and the last two episodes are decent. But the journey to get there is slow, ardous and painful and the ending is just too little too late. I almost dropped the show post the 7th episode. Each of three main characterscan be distilled down to a single action they repeat over and over again. Haruki - ever dependable, always present to help others. The definition of a mangina essentially. Setsuna - \"I hope we can be like this forever\". Repeat that line 10 times each episode and Kazusa - I will be rude to hide that I like Haruki. Whatever \"growth\" the characters have occurs in the last two episodes and that growth is only for Setsuna and Kazusa. Haruki remains a mangina to the end. \\n\\n\r\nHaving seen a bunch of anime now, I have to ask, does Japan have an aversion to normal male characters? Every character I see lately is an effeminate man-pussy who cannot take control of any situation. And ofc said mangina gets all the chicks in the end. Top lel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall an exceedingly bland and generic anime saved from being truly dismal by the above average ending. At the end of the show, I was hard pressed to really be bothered about the characters, story or the music. Not really recommended. 5/10",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I'll do my best.\r\nWhite Album 2 is, to me, the epitome of human romance in anime. \r\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, I mean it's a perfect mix of irrational love taking over imperfect human beings and dictating their own actions to a point where those aren't their own anymore, spiced with artistic expression such is music, and with passionately written script.\r\nThere are a few flaws in the package of course, like the imprecision (borderline laziness I'd say sometimes) in the graphic department (at some scene, a guitar is being played by itself, without fingers to help createthe notes), or some proportion errors in a few scenes, but you're not really looking for perfection in that department when watching a romance/drama anime, from my humble opinion. Still, it affected the overall score accordingly, just not my personal choice of calling this 13 episode long show my favourite anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\\n\r\nIt certainly isn't an out of the norm plot, romantic triangles are quite abundant in the current romance anime meta, specially when based around a school setting. Still, the way it develops is close to no other, the storyline doesn't feel rushed at all, yet it manages to keep you attached to the screen and to the characters (specially the female ones) up until the last, heartbreaking scene. You may cry in despair, you might be angry at some points, even outraged. You might even laugh, or feel deeply happy at some stages of the story, but in the end the story feels truly human, and it manages to touch you in a rare way that you'll want to cherish forever, and you'll certainly be able to relate to the situations presented on this anime as long as you keep your heart open to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt has its moments, as I stated above, but overall the art (which is inspired in the visual novel this anime is adaptation of) is great. It doesn't have extremely outstanding visuals, it's rather austere, nothing like Byousuku 5 Centimeter and other shows with a much higher artistic budget, but it certainly does its job well. The character designs are fitting, and some scenes are truly precious and unforgettable. My wallpaper is one of those scenes, I'll let you guess which one if you're interested~ \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThis. This right here is the brightest star of the anime. The soundtrack level is worthy of Clannad: After Story and the likes. Madoka Yonezawa (Setsuna's seiyuu, relevant to the whole story) and Uehara Rena give voice to some of the most touching melodies ever composed. I honestly believe the music gives the story the extra push it needed to reach the highest place in my favourites list, and even now months after finishing the story I still keep the whole OST in my mp3, and upload entries of it to my blog rather frequently. Just listening some of these songs brings tears to my eyes. They say music is the language the heart speaks, and these songs speak directly to heart of the listener. It doesn't even matter if you don't understand the lyrics at first, they will touch even the remotest corners of your soul with barely a few chords and tones. You can feel their struggles within their melodic landscape. A masterpiece of a soundtrack. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI could say a lot of things about the characters, and it would be okay. But I think their most important trait is... they are human. Their actions, their thoughts... they are mirrors of the human nature. You can relate to their suffering and joy, you can feel it's not some kind of fairytale story but rather something that could be happening anywhere else in the world at the moment you're watching it. And that, to me, is one of the most important traits a character can have, specially in a romance/drama story. Being able to identify your own psyche in them... is a priceless feeling, and increases the overall value of the story to a point you start thinking it's a real incident what's through the screen. And certainly a heartfelt one.\\n\\n\r\nThe main male character is the weak spot of this segment, but I'll let you judge by yourself about this, since I might be a tad biased after I finished the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI actually got all emotional while writing this review, what can I say? It struck right to my heart, and while it might leave you hanging for a few hours or days, I call that enjoyment. It's an unforgettable anime, much like the love stories most of us have gone through.  If you only like \"happy-go-lucky\" anime, well, you won't enjoy this, but if you appreciate a story that will leave you thinking for days about attachment, infatuation and how puppet-like we are under the effect of them... look no further. This will make you angry, sad, happy... but overall, it'll make you feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nEventhough it's my favourite anime...by no means do I think this is the ultimate anime, or that it's perfect in every way. It's certainly imperfect. Just like us, humans.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think that's one extra charm added to it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my first review, but I wish you'll enjoy the anime as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nCheers, Sona.\\n",

            "content": "It didn't take much to get me interested in this title. I saw \"high school\" and \"music\" and I was sucked in. I HAD to watch White Album 2. It wasn't until later that I found out this was also a love triangle anime. White Album 2 is one of those shows that manages to achieve a balance between its multiple elements without losing focus of its main objective. The story and characters of White Album 2 are unrelated to the first White Album anime (which I've heard, by all accounts, is mediocre). The show is based off of the \"Introductory Chapter\" of the visualnovel. I haven't read the visual novel, but other viewers claim that the anime stays pretty faithful to its source material. There are some fanservice shots, but it's nothing overly gratuitous. There is also a sex scene, but it's brief and most of it isn't seen. There is no explicit nudity.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 - Kitahara Haruki, an average guitarist, is the last remaining member of the Light Music Club. He's determined to put together a band in time to perform at the school fair, just weeks away. By a stroke of luck, he finds that the \"school idol,\" Ogiso Setsuna, is a talented vocalist, and the quiet, antisocial girl who sits next to him in class, Touma Kazusa, is the daughter of a world-famous pianist and is a musical prodigy herself. Thus, the Light Music Club is reformed and a love triangle begins to take shape. However, preparing for the school fair is not the focus of the entire show--in fact, this only accounts for about half of the episodes. The remaining episodes focus on the drama of the love triangle. In my opinion, this was an excellent screenwriting decision as this allows for both the music and the drama aspects of the show to have their respective time in the limelight. The show feels balanced. Each episode is a logical continuation of the next and thus the storytelling feels almost seamless. This is not a wishy-washy romance story; the characters' actions are decisive. My only complaint about the story is its ending. Although I know that this is just the first part of a larger story, the ending left me feeling incomplete, and I felt there should have been an additional scene to provide more closure. I sincerely hope that the second installment of the visual novel will get an anime adaptation, because I need to see a definitive conclusion to this story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 - Perhaps the show's weakest link is its art. Although the character designs are appealing, the animation seems to lack liveliness. This is painfully evident during the musical performances--do not expect Angel Beats-level detail here. Shots avoid detail so the intricacies of the instruments are left unseen. There are way too many shots from the rear, which conveniently obscure the act of playing instruments. Haruki's hands barely move when he's playing the guitar, regardless of whether he's playing chords or a lengthy guitar solo. Even shots of Setsuna singing feel like a bit of a cop-out: repeated shots of her legs and feet are interspersed with quick shots of her face that attempt to give the impression that attention is being given to details. There are far too many uses of stills. Ultimately, the animation doesn't feel nearly as dynamic as it should, which really sucks the life out of the performance scene as well as many others.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - Expectations are high here, being as this is a music anime. And it doesn't disappoint. Being a pianist myself, I especially appreciated the piano tracks, recorded by an actual pianist. Haruki's stumbles while playing the guitar sound genuine, and not just like a missed note on Guitar Hero. The soundtrack is excellent. The titular song, \"White Album,\" is a wonderful tune that I found myself humming hours afterwards. The quality of the sound doesn't fully make up for the lacking animation, but it gets pretty close.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - The three main characters are all pretty well fleshed out, thanks to a script that doesn't reduce them to shallow, stereotypical love triangle characters. Haruki is a sincere guy who seems to have realized what his dream is a little too late. Setsuna puts on the image of being a \"school idol\" in order to avoid her worst fear, being left out. Because of events within her family, Kazusa understandably has issues with authority and cares about, well...nothing. It's enjoyable to watch how these three each change and grow as a result of each others' company. They're all likable, and it's because we like them that the romantic drama hits so hard. We want all of them to be happy, but we know that can never happen. And ironically, that's what makes White Album 2 so enjoyable to watch. We feel their sadness; we feel their frustration as they struggle with their own personal dilemmas. We empathize.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 - The art and the ending were definitely detractors for me on this one. But, the most important thing is, first and foremost, having an engaging storyline and characters. White Album 2 has both. Combine that with an excellent soundtrack, and regardless of the art and the incompleteness of the ending, White Album 2 is still an enjoyable watch, although its lacking aspects prevent it from becoming truly great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - White Album 2 is a good anime. It's emotionally engaging without wandering into the realm of melodrama. It also avoids creating characters that fall into any extreme trope. This is just a story of three teenagers, about to enter the next stage of their life, who play music together and fall in love. And in the end, there's something a little beautiful about it.",

            "content": "This is a hard anime for me to review, and honestly, I'm not sure that the score that I gave it is really representative of my feelings towards White Album 2. Hopefully, as I'm writing this review, I can get some type of closure and maybe fortify my rating decision. So bear with me a bit.\r\nI have strayed away from the pure romantic drama genre for years now, I thought that I was offered the best that a romantic drama can deliver in Clannad, and the worst that it can offer in School Days. I've also enjoyed shows like True Tears and Ef in thepast. \\n\\n\r\nWhile starting White Album 2, I immediately got sucked in by the beautiful art work, the excellent pieces of music, and the introductions of these rather well made characters. The main character, Haruki Kitahara, is not depicted as the usual MC. Haruki is a great student, a great leader ( he's shown organizing events, and even helping out clubs that he doesn't belong to), caring and conscious. To me, he was depicted a lot different than the usually dense as a rock main characters of romantic anime. I actually liked him a lot and related to his personality. I've always been the guy every one runs to for advice, and assumes that I got all the answers. And though Haruki was well known around campus, he didn't seem to be super popular, his personality was irritable to some. I think that is a good description of how perfectionists can come off sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main two girls were also introduced well. Ogiso Satsuna is your typical popular high school girl, she's pretty and has a sociable personality.  You may think you can put her in a box, however, Ogiso is a little deeper than what is shown in the beginning, and has some deep traumas that really affected her and defined her in this anime, for better or worse. Kazusa Touma is the second girl introduced, and she's rather unique. She's the opposite of what Ogiso is, Touma is introverted, quick witted,and cold. Touma was by far my favorite of the two. Their character designs matched their personalities perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n Since I hadn't watched a pure romantic drama in a while, the feelz for me during the first half of the anime were strong. I loved the way the friendship between the main characters formed through the shared goal of performing in the fall festival. There were a lot of training session, but they didn't feel dragging, and the songs that they played were not over-played to the point of annoyance. During those training sessions, it was somewhat eery and foreshadowing getting a glimpse of what was to come in the romantic lives of these characters. It's pretty easy to see who loves who, and I was hypnotized by the intensity matched with the music and bgm during the first seven episodes. The first seven episodes were easily all 10/10s for me, I fell back in love with the romantic genre just through these beginning episodes. Unfortunately, the last six episodes gave me a hard reality check, it reminded me the reason why I left this genre for so long.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of this anime, the fall festival has ended, and music becomes a less central part of the anime. The drama between the three main characters thicken, and I'm being careful of not revealing spoilers, the invisible wedge between them grows bigger as time advances. It was painfully obvious what was going on, and you knew that one person (or possibly more) were going to get their heart demolished. \\n\\n\r\nIn this second half, I started to see elements that I never enjoyed seeing in anime due to personal preference. Elements such as betrayal, lying, cowardice, and jealousy. These emotions are very hard to depict well in an anime, and can sometime come off as either fake, childish, or forced. I can say with supreme confidence that White Album 2 expressed these elements perfectly. Anytime you feel bad for the character that you don't think is the right fit for the MC, or when you  show fits of anger as you watch a particular action that a character has done, or when you actually feel the tears of a character longing for the affection of a person that they cannot be with......then you can say for certainty that the emotional elements of this anime was well represented. \\n\\n\r\nThere were times during the second half where it took me hours to finish an episode because I would pause it so much. There were a lot of times in which I would face-palm and ask myself why I'm even continuing with this anime. These reactions are usually similar to reactions that you have when you watch really crappy shows, you think that this is so bad and face-palm at the stupidity of it. I think I may have confused, initially, why I was reacting this way. It wasn't because the anime was crappy, but rather the opposite, this anime did a great job depicting the earlier-mentioned elements to their fullest extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are experiencing real feelings, and the plot takes dark and unsettling paths. It is very different from other anime, because it doesn't want to leave you with this third party mindstate, it engages you into feeling the guilt, feeling the anguish, and feeling the betrayal. The worst thing is that the anime doesn't care if it leaves you in an ambiguous note, there is no guarantee of a concrete ending.   Wow, this part of the anime was just really well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't give this anime a 10/10 because the second half of the anime was just a little bit too overbearing for me. A lot of conversations seemed insignificant, and the anime was starting to run in circles a bit. The ending also left me with a really bad aftertaste. After watching the ending episode, I literally took a shower, mouth-washed, and I still couldn't wash away this unsettling and sour feeling. I guess that's a sign of the quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend this anime, I think you will enjoy the first half a lot, and the second half will be up to your personal preference. It didn't initally cut it with me but the ending was realistic and well made, so I'm not going to chronically complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway do check it out, and if you want to discuss the ending with me (since I didn't want to reveal spoilers here) feel free to just comment me about your reaction.",

            "content": "\"The last moment the three of us could truly be together.\"\r\nThis quote perfectly describes the situation of the 3 main characters within the story and the problems they face. I'd also say that this anime identically portrays situations that people in reality face, as people are always looking for ways to get what they want without hurting their friends. This anime truly makes it fall in love with you as they portray their characters in a way to relate it to reality by showing that humans truly do not like change, as shown in anime as the 3 main characters wish to stay the waythey are currently living forever. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, to the people who wonder as to whether they should be watching this anime or not, I highly suggest that you don't dismiss this anime based on a preconceived opinion without much reasoning behind it. Although I do understand that people simply dislike the 'love triangle' category because of their own reasons, 'White Album 2' isn't quite the average love triangle anime that displays two boys fighting over a girl. I also want to mention that 'White Album' and 'White Album 2nd Season' are completely irrelative to this anime and are based off of completely different characters. I wouldn't suggest you watch it due to its mediocrity but you're always welcome to do so.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the plot, the story revolves around the three best friends who make up the Light Music Club. Haruki Kitahara, who had begun playing the guitar and strived to improve in order to play on stage with his two other friends. Setsuna Ogiso, the school idol whom is adored by many due to her looks and kindness. And her polar opposite, Kazusa Touma, who is known as a rebel who is selfish and only cares about her music, therefore never paying attention to not only students but also teachers. Eventually, the three turn into best friends who adore each other possibly because the situation that they face are so similar in terms of the problems they face and  the things they're interested in. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed in a way where they believe that the time they spend together is just time spent developing their relationship with the intent of getting to know each other and becoming better friends, but that simple adoration towards each other turns into romantic love where they strive to develop a relationship that goes further than being friends. The way they face their incoming problems and how they react to that is truly something that will make you fall in love with the characters as they continuously still strive to staying as the three best friends who are part of the Light Music Club, but fail to do so as love intrudes their daily lives and prevent them from being the same trio ever again.\\n\\n\r\nPeople say that they strive to maintain friendly relationships with others, or that they would do anything for loved ones. Humans tend to sacrifice things like trust, destroy relationships, hurt others, or even disregard other emotions just because of one simple fact - that they love another. 'White Album 2' portrays a person's true personality, and the things they would do for a romance. It perfectly singles out how human emotions can affect one's rationality and decision making ability and this similarity between reality and the anime; may or may not, make you fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime, however, isn't really as special as the story, and is just average, though I still think that the normal-like art perfectly fits this deep romance story and still successfully delivers and shows the watcher how the protagonists of the story are feeling. Whether it be a character blushing, or feeling angered, the art of the anime perfectly delivers visually.\\n\\n\r\nAs a musical oriented anime, I would have been seriously surprised if the music and OST were bad and didn't fit with a certain scene, and fortunately, I wasn't disappointed as I really did enjoy the songs they sang during their concert and played with their instruments. The sound of the voice actors were also clear-cut, and the voice actors themselves deserve a clap and truly did an awesome job as well, as they spoke in a way that fit the mood of many scenes and also made me feel really into it. They successfully delivered and spoke in a truly emotional way that made me seriously fall in love with their characters, for example, the end of the anime shows a certain character leaving and another character is truly depressed about it, and the way that character spoke made me feel seriously bad for him.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, I really do think that all three of the main protagonists are really well developed and the anime chronologically develops them and shows how the romance and guilt from betrayal affects them and eventually changes their thoughts and ideals. The romance between a set of characters is further developed than another set of characters due to scenes that showed they really loved each other and were crucial parts of each others daily lives, however, the peak of development was near the end of the anime where a sex scene is displayed (nothing is really shown) which shows how much these characters had grown as they were now entering their adolescent stages where they had to decide their future. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone whose watched the series twice, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and hope people will watch this anime after reading my review, and as this is my first review, I don't think it turned out as great as I wanted it to be, but in the end, I just want to say that 'White Album 2' is a masterpiece and indeed, the best romance anime I've ever watched, and overall...\\n\\n\r\nI give 'White Album 2' a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Since being done with Ligotti's Conspiracy Against the Human Race, I've been attached to this idea of Zappfe's Four-Way philosophy. Especially interesting is Sublimation because it seems strange that the pessimistic mindset would be conquered by itself in a self-mutilating loop (though maybe its because it feels self-mutilating that it becomes pessimistic, the thing about pessimistic philosophy is that its based entirely around aesthetic and gut feel over anything else). The point I'm making in bringing up one of the big daddies of dark philosophy is that love for dark things is as fundamental a drive as love for romantic idealist things. It's just asaesthetic to describe life as grand meaningless pestilent Gothic drama as it is to describe it as grand eschatological redemption. We live, especially in these times, in a world where the evils aren't even morally horrific and tragic as they are mere humiliations of the human spirit. Thus what appears to be great movements of the interior human spirit and great passions, especially with regard to our daily romances, comes across as petty and insipid when viewed from cruel reality. I mean we all want to lie on the grass and stare romantically at the stars with a significant Other, or we want to go crazy and shout our love everywhere, or dance on rooftops and drink champagne, but the truth of the matter is that from the view of another there isn't any fleeting transcendence involved in that when outside our own solipsism. Some of it comes across as banal and juvenile, as ridiculous embarrassment. So the true use of Art is to play our own little realities as fully as we possibly can, to make as it truthful to the tragic overtures or the idealistic life-affirmation that we conceive in our heads. Since we aren't romantics anymore though we turn to sickness, degradation, decay and edginess as the last bastion for meaning in our lives (or at least a whole bunch of people but not everyone does. I too am trying for the whole ornamented pessimist Gothic feel that Ligotti was aiming for it writing like this)\\n\\n\r\n\"THE culture-heroes of our liberal bourgeois civilization are anti-liberal and anti-bourgeois; they are writers who are repetitive, obsessive, and impolite, who impress by force\u2014not simply by their tone of personal authority and by their intellectual ardor, but by the sense of acute personal and intellectual extremity. The bigots, the hysterics, the destroyers of the self\u2014these are the writers who bear witness to the fearful polite time in which we live. Mostly it is a matter of tone: it is hardly possible to give credence to ideas uttered in the impersonal tones of sanity. There are certain eras which are too complex, too deafened by contradictory historical and intellectual experiences, to hear the voice of sanity. Sanity becomes compromise, evasion, a lie. Ours is an age which consciously pursues health, and yet only believes in the reality of sickness. The truths we respect are those born of affliction. We measure truth in terms of the cost to the writer in suffering\u2014rather than by the standard of an objective truth to which a writer\u2019s words correspond. Each of our truths must have a martyr. (Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation)\"\\n\\n\r\nWell okay then what's that gotta do with White Album 2?\\n\\n\r\n\"Many books promoted as vehicles of a \u201cdark vision\u201d finish up by lounging in a warm bath of affirmation, often doing a traitorous turnabout in their closing pages or paragraphs.2 As every author, publisher, and carnival owner knows, lurid billing gets a patron in the door. And so we have innumerable books and magazine articles with such inquiring titles as The Misadventure of Consciousness: Are Human Beings a Mistake of Evolution? or \u201cShould We Stop Having Children?\u201d The answer is always \u201cNo,\u201d sometimes resounding in its declamation but more often qualified, which is even more vile. Searchers after bleakness would do well, then, to begin at the ending of books and magazine articles with doomful titles or angst-fraught openings if they are not to be chiseled by a bait-and-switch maneuver.\" (The Conspiracy Against the Human Race)\\n\\n\r\nPessimism, as defined by Ligotti, is the belief that behind all the normal things of humanity, all our daily struggles and feelings, is monstrosity. If we take a Freudian viewpoint to romance then its less about pure feelings but more about uncontrollable drives. Whatever it is that moves us is horrific and we are constantly teetering on the edge of realizing this and falling into madness or decay. Likewise behind all the high-school nostalgia of White Album 2, behind the romantic tones of the orange evening and the light strum of the guitar, is poison. White Album 2 is relentless in its pursuit of a horrible metaphysical truth. It needed no Lovecraftian monstrosity or Ligottian nightmare to prove this but all it needed was to simply display a tight tapestry of destructive human desires and insecurities. It drags things to their eventual dark conclusions in a way that Ligotti would love (well then again Ligotti is a guy who likes Symbolist Gothic stuff and would probably not even raise a finger to touch slice of life anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about White Album 2 is that somewhere deep inside there it can be described as Ligottian, Schopenhauerian, Beckettian, or Kafkaesque but its touch is so subtle that there's hardly a linger of any such undertones. The dialogue is Absurdist in the way language is specifically used to weave elaborate labyrinths of meaning. Setsuna's talk about maintaining the status quo and remembering the school festival is a miniature version of Pinter's constant question dodging and silence in Betrayal. Haruki's heroism seems driven more by some dark puppeteer of insecure desire than anything else until he finally realizes what he wants and breaks down. A good work of art (like Evangelion and Kyousogiga) is when the microcosm is equivalent the macrocosm, which is why Evangelion is the travails of adolescence driven up to an apocalyptic level while Kyousogiga is the hardships of family pushed up to the realm of divinity. White Album 2 is fitting a complete pessimism into a slice of life narrative. It never deviates from its atmosphere the same way NANA or Clannad does (NANA with its mini Shojo comedic moments and Clannad with its light-hearted first arcs. WA2's comedy never causes a shift in its nature because it still is set in the realm of the illusion of high school nostalgia). It feels cohesive and constant in its vision.\\n\\n\r\nPostnote: This idea of formal unity has its roots in the Ancient Greek poetics, especially with Aristotle's unities. Generally the ancient genres were established in order to give poets a framework to work in so that they could focus on the formal content rather than spend time on deriving a complicated and subversive structure. As seen with Shakespeare's problem plays, having a disunity of atmosphere may work, but it can also be extremely jarring. Even though Hamlet is narratively experimental, with plays inside plays and supernatural elements, even in its most comedic moments, especially during the grave digger scene or Hamlet's bouts of madness, it never forgets that its about Death and the existential worry and insignificance attached to human life. White Album 2 never forgets that its a story about the perils of raising a naive ideal above a certain threshold of reality to the point that it becomes a dangerous game of betrayal to maintain the visage of the ideal. Kyousogiga never forgets that its about the awkward development of a group of people into the constructed instituition of Family. Evangelion never forgets that its about miscommunication the ability for humans to hurt each other due to being unable to communicate each others personal realities to one another. I could go on with this all day. Kara no Kyoukai never forgets that its a Buddhist Noir that raises questions about the nature of Time, Identity and Reality in the way Buddhism always likes to do. Madoka Magica never forgets that its a Goethian Fairy-tale dream. 5cm Per Second takes the nostalgic romantic high school perspective, where everything is about love and grasping, to the pinnacle of beauty. Toradora is always about the inconstant light fluttering of the human heart. Whatever it is when a work is grounded into some perspective, dreamview or worldview it always feels more meaningful and whole than when it attaches itself to a plethora of techniques and genre tropes to try to string together a story.",

            "content": "Music Room 2. It's the most unassuming of the three that populate Houjou High. Music Room 3 in the building across has the benefit of being bigger and newer, and the adjacent Music Room 1's been sectioned for everyone save those enlisted in the musical curriculum. Nevertheless, it's where Haruki Kitahara spends his time practicing \u201cWhite Album\u201d by Yuki Morikawa on his guitar. And out of nowhere, from the adjacent room, from the rooftop, a sound has him spellbound. A piano so soothing, a voice so transfixing, plays, sings to the song's melody. And here is where the story of White Album 2 takes off,where he has to know who.\\n\\n\r\nAn adaptation of a Leaf and Aquaplus visual novel White Album 2: Introductory Chapter, White Album 2 itself was produced by Satelight, directed by relative dark horse Masaomi Ando, and scripted by Fumiaki Maruto, who was also the original scenario writer for the source material. A qualification before going any further is that outside sharing the same universe, using the same name, and borrowing  a few of the same songs, this show is completely unrelated to its predecessor, White Album. Do not expect the same characters or story from then, which I've heard from general consensus is less than favorable, to be present here.\\n\\n\r\nAnother qualification since this particular plot device's the bane of a number of viewers: this show is driven under the auspices of a love triangle. Feel free to refrain from watching if you absolutely can't stand them. This love triangle, however, does something somewhat different from the usual one male, two female dynamic. Haruki Kitahara, Setsuna Ogiso, and Kazusa Touma are friends. The best of friends. Friends of the dearest kind. The viewer's left with rather maddening issues, monogamy withstanding. How can the guy pursue one girl and avoid hurting the other? How can one girl pursue the guy and leave the other unscathed? How can we all remain close? Each main character wants to have their cake and eat it too, yet the show makes the reality clear: You can't. The heart wants what it wants when it's found it, despite any one party's attempts toward the contrary, and to deny it that when it's within grasp, combined with each character's own baggage, is tantamount to torture, agony of the most existential kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe agony's even more poignant when they're written as more than just fictional characters. For the female leads, it wouldn't be incorrect to group them under a certain personality, a certain archetype, the warm, popular school idol and the cold, aloof musical prodigy. And yet, they're more than that, never relegated to the distinction of mere stereotypes. They may be extroverts or introverts, but no one girl's one absolute. No one girl's simply the life of the party, just as no one girl's simply a shut-in. Neither is unconditionally anti-social, and both are, by their own past experiences, insecure. Loneliness is an issue for all, manifesting as much in a crowded class as in an empty room. Not one girl is perfect, their masks, their mischief, their indecisiveness, cowardice, impulsiveness, selfishness... they all show, despite themselves and their counterintuitive efforts to preserve the status quo. More than just characters, they're people, female, adolescent, and flawed through and through. And for the male lead? Outside of his sex, he's no exception, especially towards the second half. \\n\\n\r\nIf what you seek out of this show is your idealistic conception of what a romance should entail, then read well: that's not going to happen here. The ordeals are messy, frustrating, not because they're emotionally manipulative, but because they're real, because the characters, being who they are, are complex, conflicted, and real themselves. It's what would happen in this unextractable web of complexities and contradictions of \u201cI wills,\u201d \u201cI won'ts,\u201d and \u201cIt hurts,\u201d where cutting one thread leads to the mangling of another.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are those little touches, subtle, never exaggerated, that give these characters sincerity as well as charm. Overly sweetened coffee black, for instance, to match my craving for black milk tea in the morning for every morning.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show exploits these touches and others, subtleties of all kinds and layers, scattered, embedded, and incorporated into the narrative to outstanding degrees. Barring the first episode, this show's direction and script is all about subtly, about inference, of \u201cshow\u201d and not simply \u201ctell.\u201d Where the camera pans, zooms, cuts, and lingers. When the facades of facial expressions slip into distress and recover to overcompensate, the eyes, the lips, the bangs. The deliberate tones in lighting, or the selective shades of lack thereof, complemented by the beautiful looking set pieces. The conversations, highly nuanced, roundabout, indirect, and, when it's called for, blistering. The use of flashbacks before the show's start, combined with the retracing of new and carefully omitted ground within past scenes at the most heart-wrenching of moments, the foreshadowing, and even the character of the character designs and clothes. Barring Episode 1, with masterful strokes of minimalist direction, interwoven seamlessly and purposefully with the music, whether bgm or insert, no one direction is ever oversold. They perfectly illustrate the personalities and emotional states of the cast at any given moment, whether they are bubbling underneath the surface or blasting corkscrew out of it. The best part, and perhaps the most refreshing part, is that it takes its time to do all of this, so that every form of direction feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of three qualifications, this show has a sex scene, one without shots of anything particularly precious, but it's easy to infer what's happening. That being said, it's completely within taste, substantially enhances the narrative, and subscribes to a rather waning view that sex is emotional consummation rather than just physical titillation. Also, adolescent intercourse does happen in the real world, and I personally congratulate the staff for including it in, but if you happen to be allergic to sex scenes regardless, then you're going to have trouble fully enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic's, unsurprisingly, a strong element in this series. Outside of tackling the technicalities or philosophies behind notes, though practice does make perfect, the series does everything else in exploiting the medium to create meaning in the music. Outside noise fillers and mood setters, they express powerful sentiments that put the thoughts and actions of characters within context, especially with Touma, whose feelings unseen and unspoken, given her reserved nature, bleeds into her piano pieces. It adds another layer of \u201cshow\u201d through melodies and harmonies, and even the lyrics of the songs that have them are loaded with meaning in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the OP, \u201cA Love That Cannot Be.\u201d Known in romaji as \u201cTodokanai Koi 13\u201d by Rena Uehara in one track and Madoka Yonezawa, Ogiso's seiyuu, in another, its vocals, combined with electronic keyboard, electric guitar, and a synthetic backtrack, rocks and croons of a passionate nostalgia, of happier times in younger days past caked in a film of melancholy. The visual detail's not quite Kyoto Animation or P.A. Works standards, but it's still really good, and the visual content corresponds excellently with the music, blurs, glare, overlays, and the waning light from sunsets. It also features visually vague moments that occur in the show that contribute to this aesthetic, but aren't really spoilers since they're only fully significant in, once again, hindsight. It's best thought as a bittersweet reminisce by an adult of his or her turbulent youth. White Album 2 is winter-themed, and snow can be beautiful, if chilling. In addition, the transitions are handled with a quiet, yet powerful mix of grace and dignity. It also attempts to do this interesting thing with omitting Touma's face until Episode 3 to reflect a certain in-show direction, which would have been clever had it not been compromised by something in Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED for Episodes 3-6 and 8-10 (Episode 7 doesn't have an ED), \u201cSayonara no Koto,\u201d or \u201cGoodbye\u201d also by Uehara, flows in the same thematic vein, with recaps of scenes of the episode now past, an evolution from a delicate, yet noble instrumental chorus of electric synthetics, keyboard, classic guitar, violin, then vocals, then electric bass, then drumset, then electric guitar, before it reaches a climax with a vigorous and progressive rock beat, and, finally, settling back down to its quiet origins. Episodes 2, 11, and 12 have their own Uehara EDs, \u201cclosing 13,\u201d \u201cAfter All ~Tsuzuru Omoi~,\u201d or \u201cAfter All ~Writing Down My Feelings~\u201d and \u201cTwinkle Snow 13\u201d respectively are also great in their own ways but, for the sake of brevity, I'll refrain from their music other than saying they accompany rather significant moments with a certain someone. And after all, they're better enjoyed in context than not. That goes double for the insert concert songs, \"White Album,\" \"Sound of Destiny,\" and the OP, since, outside of singing, they contain some really nice surprises involving solos.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1. It's not a bad episode, all in all; in fact, I think its conclusion was very well choreographed. Still, compared to its successive sisters, this episode has a couple of things that stick out like a sore thumb. There's a questionable amount of exposition within it that I think was a bit superfluous. A few carefully chosen words especially towards the end, coupled with the music, would have been better for the mood, but by far the biggest concern I have was the beginning, where the show previewed portions of the concert from Episode 7. I suspect it was supposed to be kind of a hook, but, returning to an earlier instance of direction which could have been clever, the omission of Touma's facial features seemed to be intended as a means for suspense that also worked in character, given her cold, aloof exterior. While it may have been no surprise that she would play one of the center role, what she looked like would, had it not been spoiled earlier by that flash forward.\\n\\n\r\nHe has to know, climbing the stairs to the roof, treading the outer walls of the school from stories high to get into the adjacent room's open window. The rest is history. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been an unparalleled experience to have watched this show and I sincerely hope after reading this review, everyone who's interested watch it as well. It is one of the most finely told romantic dramas I have ever had the pleasure to see, and while the ending was conclusive, since this is only the Introductory Chapter, the story's not even over yet.\\n\\n\r\nI give White Album 2 a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations have always had a notorious reputation in anime communities. Whether it be issues with pacing, narration, or some nonlinear route structure, these adaptations suffer from a variety of heated complaints from fans of the original source material, sometimes even as to have their very existence denied.\r\nThankfully, White Album 2 is not one of those adaptations.\r\nAdapted from the ~introductory chapter~ segment of the bestselling Leaf visual novel of the same name, White Album 2 (henceforth referred to as \u201cWA2\u201d) manages to retain a lot of the strengths of the source material while approaching it in a different, but appropriate, fashion. It is importantto note that, despite the title, WA2 is not a direct sequel to the first White Album, related only by setting and a number of references, so viewing of the first series is not required.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, WA2 is, simply put, a romance. To be more specific, it is a love triangle. It begins with a student named Kitahara Haruki trying to revive his high school\u2019s light music club. In doing so, he eventually finds himself involved with the two girls who join the club: Ogiso Setsuna and Touma Kazusa.  Certainly, this is a fairly basic set-up for the genre. WA2\u2019s romance is played out in a straight and down-to-earth manner, and its strengths lie with the subdued execution of that romance.  In a genre filled with stories that often resort to predictable archetypes and tropes to drive themselves forward, WA2 avoids the pitfalls of many other titles by doing away with the excessive melodrama and roundabout confessions. It does not strive beyond the boundaries of its genre, and thus certainly cannot be compared to shows that feature Titans being screamed at. \\n\\n\r\nConsider the very beginning of the show, which reveals some key events that will occur at the end of the anime. In this brief sequence, viewers will be made aware of the kind of road that WA2 is set on. Both readers familiar with the source material and newcomers may initially find this to be a questionable directorial decision. However, in the grand scheme of things, WA2 is not focused on the fact that these events occur, but on how the characters and their relationships caused these events. After all, there are only so many ways a romance can turn out without treading on the grounds of bizarre or convoluted narratives. In general, the genre should focus on the chemistry between the characters and how they deal with the emotions of love.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters are undoubtedly central to the romance in WA2. The characters are not dolls made to fulfill a given role, but believable people with distinct personalities. In particular, the main lead Haruki seems like an excellent student, yet so obviously flawed. His altruistic personality leads him into making many unintentional mistakes, and he is unable to avoid the problems he is causing despite being aware of them. And just like Haruki, Setsuna and Kazusa also try to avoid the problems in their own way, but inevitably end up hurting the others in the process. These characters make sensibly human mistakes that some viewers will resonate strongly with, while others may find themselves incredibly frustrated. The notion that viewers opt for a favorite heroine need not apply when the characters can be both endearing and detestable. The alleged title of \u201cbest girl\u201d might as well be given to Haruki.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, much of the characterization is owned to the wonderful script written by Fumiaki Maruto, the original scenario writer for WA2.  The characters and their interactions are brought to life through clear and purposeful dialogue. The lines illustrate the chemistry between the characters and the gradual build-up of romantic tension as the show progresses. As an adaptation, the script is very much condensed to serve time constraints in the animated form, and Haruki\u2019s insightful narration is lost. Thankfully, this is substituted by visual expressions and gestures used by the characters to show certain emotions rather than tell them. Setsuna\u2019s physical distancing during some conversations in the earlier episodes, for example, indicate her perceptions toward Kazusa. In many cases, this use of storytelling adds to the scenes, improving upon the original. On the other hand, some lines in the script are altered, perhaps changing the nuance of the original scenes. A particular example of this is with the scene that introduces Kazusa, in which she speaks with an angry tone as opposed to a confused one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show\u2019s use of visual storytelling, the technical aspects of the animation suffer from a number of problems, particularly due to the production by Satelight. While the character designs themselves are arguably an improvement over the original's, quality mishaps are abound regarding the anatomy of the characters in some shots. There is also a general lack of \u201cliveliness\u201d in the animation, resulting in dull movements and stills. A notable offender of this is when the concert scene occurs in the story, and repetitive shots of the school\u2019s scenery are seen as music is playing. Moreover, a few other important scenes feature questionable fanservice shots and odd angles, intruding on the mood of these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the aural aspects of WA2 make up for the mishaps in the animation. The soundtrack, featuring tracks that are played by an actual pianist, really complement the nature of the show, more so due to the focus on music. Dramatic sequences are accentuated with powerful yet delicate melodies, such as the instrumental of the aptly-named ending theme, \u201cSayonara no Koto.\u201d Vocal songs are also prominent, reinforcing the show\u2019s themes through their lyrics.  Ultimately, the music is an integral part of the experience in WA2.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the experience is certainly something else. Despite being only a prologue to a larger story, the anime adaptation of WA2 offers a sense of completeness that most adaptations, and anime series in general, should strive for. It is faithful as an adaptation, yet carries its own unique charm. It has a fairly simple premise, yet goes much deeper than that with its characters.  The season of White Album has gracefully passed us by, but it won\u2019t be forgotten so easily.",

            "content": "Have you ever fallen in love? \r\nI did. I still am.\r\nWhite Album 2 is set after 10 years of the events that occurred in the original White Album. Despite the title being White Album 2, the story isn't a sequel but is pretty much a standalone or what you could say an alternate setting which has minimal relevance to its predecessor. The only apparent connection are the songs which were sung in the first anime and the people who wrote them, and that it is set in the same world. In simple words, you don't need to watch the first anime to understand this andI would not recommend in doing so since I find the first one to be the complete opposite of what this is - a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of White Album 2 is pretty straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story revolves around the three main characters namely Kitahara, Touma, and Ogisa. These three are so relatable that I'm pretty sure some of us could even picture themselves living and experiencing the different social dillemmas each character is facing - they're as real as it gets. At first they might look common, typical or plain but later on as the characters reveal more and more of their personalities and problems, they'll also grow on you. With the intent of being good friends, a simple admiration turned into something more but the intrusion of another led to a love triangle conflict without even realizing it. The story grows beyond from here but as much as I would like to tell more, I would rather have you watch it as it would only spoil all the fun. \\n\\n\r\nPeople tend to do crazy things when in love. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as beyond what logic could measure, humans would do anything when it comes to love. Love is such an extraordinary phenomenon that people would do something they normally won't do. Trust, betrayal, and even sacrificing one's good for the sake of another - as long as love is present, there is so much an ordinary person could do yet there's so much to lose. That's what I find so great in this anime; it depicts real human emotions at its finest, and at its worst.\\n\\n\r\nFor a mature and a serious drama/romance anime, the animation is as fitting as it should be. The characters and the backgrounds are very well drawn, the movements are fluid, and the shadings too are very well applied. Not only is the animation good on its own but it also compliments the feel to its amazing music. \\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect from a musical anime, the music is really good. In fact the soundtracks are absolutely breathtaking from the first episode and it never did go any less up to the last. The lyrics of the songs completely fit the atmosphere adding up to the emotional feeling of the scenario they were on. The voice actors too did their roles very well, might it be just a simple conversation or was it through singing; you can really feel the emotions flowing.\\n\\n\r\nAt its shining moments, the drama intensifies and the confrontations would make your heart skip a beat. You'd even start to wonder why is it so wrong when it's supposed to feel right, or the opposite. But if you were a person in love, you would know why. After all has been said and done, I could understand why some would feel a bitter aftertaste but let's face it - because even in real life, not everything goes the way we want it to.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is such an emotional rollercoaster. At times you'll find yourself smiling along with the characters, and at some you'll find yourself crying. You'll be totally engrossed that you'll find yourself glued onto the screen wondering what would they do next then asking yourself if you would have done the same thing. But by then you won't have even realized that you're already teary-eyed because of how you care and sympathize for the characters that have already grown on you. It is just that good.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest. I enjoyed every single bit of this anime. But I guess \"enjoyed\" is an understatement since I pretty much fell in love with this anime. And know what, people do crazy things when they're in love just like what White Album 2 made me do - to once again write a review in which I swore I would never ever do.",

            "content": "White Album 2 is one of those series many people tend to overlook these days because for a variety of obvious reasons. Some of them might be prior experience with other \u201cWhite Album\u201d franchise anime that left with mediocre impressions. Then, there\u2019s also a belief that anime series based off of visual novel tends to be the inferior brand. Finally, maybe it could just be the synopsis or premise of the show. It looks simple, tends to be simple, and it is simple. But what you might be surprised at is that White Album 2 is not what it appears to be. Rather than goingthrough a bunch of stereotypical ideas wrapped in a loop of cliches, White Album 2 actually jumps out of that zone on various occasions.\\n\\n\r\nTake first note that White Album 2 is not a sequel of the original series. The characters from White Album do not make appearance nor their story connect in any way. Instead, the show stands out as a standalone series based off the visual novel of the same name developed by Leaf. The series chronicles the lives of three young individuals as they become a trio of close friends during their last semester of high school. It\u2019s their final chances to make some memories they won\u2019t forget and chances don\u2019t come easily.\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place in high school but focuses it at its ending stages or rather, the final semester. There\u2019s a pressure of futuristic opportunities and decisions to make often during these times. Think of it this way: when you were in high school, have you ever thought what you wanted to be or what you wanted to do after you graduate? For Haruki Kitahara, he can be described as one of those individuals without an exact goal in mind. What he does have in mind though is his ambition to play at the annual school festival. The problem? They need members for the light music club to accomplish this task. This is where our two heroines comes in from the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there\u2019s Setsuna Ogiso, a popular girl at school known well for her beauty and talent in singing. It\u2019s easy for people to make friends with Setsuna because of her bright personality. In fact, many of the times we see her throughout the series is where she is compassionate towards others. Setsuna also possesses the talents of a singer especially after Haruki discovers her on the rooftop one faithful day. The way she sings is majestic, beautiful, and those moments defines her character. On the other hand, there\u2019s Kazusa Touma. Unlike Setsuna, she is usually cold, aloof, and distant towards others. This is evidenced by her hobby of skipping classes and falling asleep that often results in scolding from her professors. But if there\u2019s one thing she does care is music. Music, a word that has transformed words into a form of art and revolutionized entertainment, is what Touma holds dearly to her life. With a common idea in mind, these three characters are the core of the show that define White Album 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization plays an imperative role throughout the show so it\u2019s important to pay attention to them. Haruki seems to be your typical high school student without much to stand out. He is friendly towards others, honest, accepting, loving, generous, and determined. He might not be a celebrity but Haruki isn\u2019t just a guy that looks around to goof off at school or hit on girls. Instead, he truly cares about his friends and be there when they need the most. On another scale, Setsuna is like a walking billboard of radiance that attracts others. But if we look at her carefully, there\u2019s a sense of insecurity coming out from her character. The smile she wears sometimes seems to formulate a mask that hides her true emotions. It\u2019s not that Setsuna wants to be selfish but some of her decisions tends to be an act based on herself and what she believes in. Finally, Touma is like a stone of hieroglyphics that is hard to decipher. No one really knows what she\u2019s thinking because of her cold personality. It is evidenced that her childhood can be defined as lonely and solitary so that could be part of the reason that made her whom she is today. Luckily, Touma\u2019s love for music defines her character in another way, as a girl that embraces the art and tries to perfect it as a passion. White Album 2\u2019s main characters all get their spotlights and screen time that examines their personalities, lives, and development as they finish their finish year at high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of White Album 2 might take a while to get used to. I\u2019m referring to the rather slow pacing especially in the beginning as we get to know our main protagonists. Taking place in a high school life setting also places the story in a way that is relatable because of the focus on future, struggles at school, and relationships. The story doesn\u2019t drive off with odd plot holes. Instead, it is quite straight forward that is easily comprehensible. It also offers anime-only viewers a way of predicting future events as each episodes unfolds itself. The series also defines itself as a romance show so it\u2019s interesting to theorize who Haruki will choose as his partner for an everlasting relationship. It can be perturbing at some instances but can also create excitement especially for our main characters at the apex of their school lives. Yes, what I\u2019m referring to here is their dreams and ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Touma is passionate about music. Thanks to her skills with the piano, electric guitar, and other instruments, she stands out as a prominent star of the series. The core of their school life doesn\u2019t come easily as there\u2019s an old saying that goes \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019. This concept generally applies to Haruki as he lacks the skills of a child prodigy. What he does have though is a determined heart and spirit to tackle any obstacle through. His dedication fortifies a will that seems to spread like an inspiration to others such as Touma. Setsuna\u2019s skills of singing also becomes the voice of White Album 2. This only defines half the story however as White Album 2 later on takes on a route of that brings forth more emotional impact. It chronicles the relationships of our main characters that is a mixed bag of love, loyalty, respect, and sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nWhile White Album 2 remains refreshing, relatable, and realistic, the show suffers some problems as well. There\u2019s a lack of focus on supporting characters as most of them fades behind the scenes. Most of them plays little roles other than being introduced that becomes part of the cast only on some occasions. The story itself also becomes a bit predictable on various occasions. There\u2019s also some fan service that can be distracting and forceful. Haruki also seems to be portrayed as Mr. Nice Guy with nothing special in particular. I also find a few of his decisions to be irrational and seemingly absurd. Some events also comes as abrupt and hard to sympathize with in terms of development especially involving relationships. There\u2019s also a problem with narrative as the show focuses on three characters but none of them goes through the story by their point of view.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, White Album 2 is realistic and designed to look as well as feel like a slice of life. The character designs fits most of their roles well. The outfit designs during the light music club\u2019s debut are fashionable and artistic. (Although more embarrassing in some ways for Touma) But taken on a technical perspective, the artwork is realistic enough that camera angles focuses on each movement of the club when they play music. Examples of this include Touma\u2019s finger movements on the piano, Haruki\u2019s flow with his guitar, or the way Setsuna sings her heart out at her fans. There\u2019s no doubt that realism is strong in the artwork department with a peculiar sense of normalcy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of White Album 2 is an embodiment that defines our main characters\u2019 passion and unites them as a group. The OST is calm and pleasant throughout the series but it\u2019s the songs that truly shines. Songs such as White Album, Sayonara no Koto, and the OP song Todokanai Koi '13' defines the show\u2019s style at its finest form. It feels like a juggernaut of feelings poured into the lyrics that makes the show stands out. Voice acting wise, I give praise to Hitomi Nabatame (Strawberry Panic: Shizuma, Chaos;Head: Aoi, Gantz: Kei Kishimoto) as her role of Kazuma Touma. Her voice fits perfectly with her mature and cold voice that defines the character that Touma is.\\n\\n\r\nSo White Album 2 is probably a show that would stand as something a lot of people might overlooked. It could be the fact that the anime didn\u2019t have much expectations based from the synopsis, preview, or experiences from the previous franchise. As a dark horse, White Album 2 is one of those series that realistic with a fusion of music, relationships, and characterization explored in ways that is surprisingly interesting. The story might feel a bit slow and predictable sequences will pop up. However, patience is a key to unlock the satisfaction of this show. And once you open that door, you\u2019ll discover the true essence of White Album 2.",

            "content": "Two's a plenty, three's a crowd. Or so the saying goes.\r\nPeople like to say friendship lasts forever. They want to believe that things will never change between themselves and the ones closest to their hearts during their teenage years. However, when multiple men and women grow close enough to each other there eventually comes a point where life-changing decisions must be made. And if your social circuit happens to consist of one man and two women... then odds are that someone is going to have to be left out.\r\nWhite Album 2 is a rare anime in the sense that it is a story about actualtrue love in a mature sense. It is also highly realistic and tangible, which is a strangely unusual thing to find in today's anime industry. Above all however... it is simply beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a short summary of what White Album 2 has to offer then here's a quick rundown of it. Otherwise the full review follows below:\\n\\n\r\n- One of the most faithful visual novel adaptations you'll ever find \\n\r\n- Close to perfect pacing, not a single scene feels needless yet nothing feels like it's missing either\\n\r\n- Very mature and realistic take on romance\\n\r\n- Lots of actual romantic progression and relationship development\\n\r\n- Quite serious emotional drama, this can either result in it being found tear-jerking or a bit clich\u00e9 depending on who you ask\\n\r\n- No stereotypical anime character tropes are utilized, everyone in White Album 2 feels like a real person\\n\r\n- No moe, ecchi or other fanservice-esque elements\\n\r\n- Very high-level and emotional voice acting\\n\r\n- Heavy emphasis on music: the main characters together make up their high school's light music club and Setsuna's voice actress sing many of the series tracks (beautifully at that I have to say)\\n\r\n- While the ending isn't conclusive since only the first chapter of the visual novel is adapted, it still leaves off on a very satisfying note, and therefore the anime works totally fine as a standalone product even for anime-only viewers\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is one of the absolute most critically acclaimed visual novels of all time, currently sitting at #2 on Erogamescape and #5 on VNDB among other things at the time of writing this, and it is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. This anime does not cover anywhere near the entire story however, but rather solely the ~Introductory Chapter~ which makes up roughly the first 15% of it. Now you may find the notion of an adaptation only covering such a tiny amount disheartening, but that is not really the case here as the first chapter on its own works just as well as a standalone anime. Furthermore, by narrowing down the scope this much, the anime instead manages to nail what little content it covers more or less perfectly, and as a result this is one of the absolute best VN adaptations I have ever seen. Satelight made an outstanding job turning this into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 (henceforth only referring to the anime) is the story of Kitahara Haruki, a diligent student and one of the only two remaining members of the light music club. He dreams of reviving the club after all its other members resigned, and to have them perform at the upcoming school festival as their last event before graduation. In order to do so he manages to get the aid of the cheerful karaoke-loving school idol Ogiso Setsuna, as well as the quiet black-haired beauty Touma Kazusa who is his fellow classmate and a high-level pianist. Together they try to somehow scrape together a performance in what limited time they have left in order to create a final memory before they graduate. That was the only intention.\\n\\n\r\nOr at least, that's what is what supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor the three of them however, the bonds they acquire with each other intertwine in a very intricate and complicated web of emotions, resulting in a rather convoluted and tension-filled love triangle. One without any optimal resolution in sight and packed to the brim with conflicting emotions. This results in the anime being somewhat of a tearjerker but an exquisitely written one at that. Of course not everyone appreciates these kinds of stories since it can also be interpreted as somewhat clich\u00e9, and while I cannot deny that fact I still think this is easily one of the best series of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really cannot be understated with this anime is just how good the pacing is. The ~Introductory Chapter~ of the visual novel is only seven or so hours long, yet the anime is given a full 13 episodes for that alone. It's such a refreshing feeling seeing a story with no holes in it at any point, yet it doesn't ever feel slow or boring for a single second either. Everything in White Album 2 feels like it's actually important and serves as an important piece of the overall story. There are also some neat narrative tricks utilized in the story presentation such as specific camera angles leaving out certain elements intentionally, as well as using flashbacks instead of a totally linear style of story-telling in order to give the show a bigger sense of unpredictability and creativity.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of White Album 2 are not based on generic anime tropes like the vast majority of today's shows are, but rather feel like genuine human beings. The concept of fanservice is more or less non-existent in this anime, and instead it offers a very mature outlook on what youthful love might look like in real life, as well as what responsibilities and consequences comes along with it. Is it right to wish for your own happiness if it comes with the misfortune of others? Is it always justified to follow the calling of your heart? These are some of the questions this anime asks.\\n\\n\r\nThese types of intricate questions make the character development of White Album 2 quite spectacular, as you can clearly see how all three of the main characters change drastically over the course of time. This goes both for how they act by themselves and towards the other two. Whether the choices they all make are right or wrong at times is up to interpretation, but I think all of them are perfectly understandable at least. Above all though, it results in something actually HAPPENING. The biggest problem in most romance anime is the lack of actual romantic development but White Album 2 has it aplenty, despite only being 13 episodes long. Furthermore it actually feels sincerely believable for once, yet not completely predictable either.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is stellar. The animation is very crisp and clean, and fits perfectly for the theme and atmosphere of the series. Above all though, the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. It primarily consists of remakes of the OST from the original visual novel, and contains mainly vocal-heavy and instrumental tunes. These tracks are further enhanced by them oftentimes actually being performed live by the characters themselves, albeit merely in practice more often than on stage. The timing of the music is also used excellently, as the key emotional scenes of the story are heavily supported by the background music and the superb voice acting. Really White Album 2 would not have been the same as it is if it wasn't for the audio department. I really cannot praise it enough.\\n\\n\r\nAs always with these kinds of series, there will be some heavy shipping wars going on regarding which of the two girls every viewer happens to prefer, but regardless of who you happen to fancy I still think that the overall story progression of White Album 2 should be very satisfactory either way. This is not an anime about which is the #bestgirl, it's much deeper and more touching than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although this anime only covers a tiny portion of the full story of the visual novel, it is without a doubt an outstanding series in and of itself. Ironically despite the majority of the story not being shown in this anime, the ending of it still feels a hell of a lot more conclusive than most romance series out there. If you didn't know there was any more story left to be told, then you'd probably never imagine there was. It really feels that conclusive despite everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for:\\n\r\nFans of mature romance and emotional dramas, as well as people who can appreciate exquisite presentation and directive for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for:\\n\r\nPeople who are looking for a lighthearted romcom and those who place too much emphasis on their personal favorite coupling coming into fruition. The latter is not what this show is about on a metalevel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the amount of emotion and sheer quality White Album 2 manages to squeeze out of a mere 13 episodes is phenomenal. It goes to show just how far you can come with a good source material and some stellar directing.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only all visual novel adaptations could do the same thing...",

This is a show that should not be taken lightly. The first episode does not at all warn the viewer of the emotional rollercoaster that is to follow. WA2 will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. It is filled with realistic characters with the best of intentions; however, acting on emotion instead of logic is the surest recipe for disaster. Perhaps this realism is the reason why I was so drawn to it. It is definitely an anime that will captivate you from its very first frame and linger in your heart long after its last. \\n\\n\r\nThis review may include spoilers (particularly the conclusion). You've been warned.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 (which will from this point on be referred to as WA2) is a simple love story involving three main characters, who, cruel by the stroke of fate, meet one fall afternoon. The trio become friends, and shortly after, a love triangle soon forms. One of the many reasons why I love the show is its consistency. The very first line in this anime sets the mood of the show, and never does it once falter from it. Going into this show, I didn't know what to expect; I was expecting your generic rom/com with excessive fanservice, nonsensical/nonexistent plot, and characters as flat and one-dimensional as paper. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nAt the core of WA2 lies its characters. The first episode portrays each and every character in the most stereotypical, most cliche ways. We meet the geeky honor student, the tsundere, and the school idol. They are portrayed as characters without flaws; characters who always keep their cool and calm demeanor, knowing just what to say in a situation. By the second half of the story, however, this fascade that we (the viewers) have been shown this whole time starts to fall off, and we are met with a very flawed, imperfect, selfish, and greedy cast. Despite all the downright terrible things they do to each other, you can't blame them. As I said earlier in the review, these characters always have the best of intentions, wishing for everyone to be happy; however, acting solely on emotion while disregarding any logical reasoning will always lead to disaster. The character's actions, especially near the end, are always justified. They may be acting thoughtlessly, sometimes even blantly disregarding what happens to anyone around, but to them, their hearts are telling them that they are in the right. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? In almost every romance anime, we see characters fall head over heels for each other; however, rarely do we actually FEEL how much these characters WANT to be with one another. In WA2, I actually felt myself being immersed in these characters' personalities, even empathizing for them, and when everything comes crashing down toward the end (and it does), my heart broke just as our protagonist's and the heroines' hearts did as well.\\n\\n\r\nWA2 was produced by Satelight, a studio known for its most notorious work, Fairy Tail. Needless to say, the studio didn't hold back in terms of sound or animation. The colors, lighting, and character designs fit the mood of the show perfectly, so did its sound. For an anime revolving around music and art, I thought that the OST, particularly the ending song, \"After All\", was superb. I loved the emotion and score of each and every one of the soundtracks, and to this day, I still listen to them.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, the viewers are shown time and time again that love is messy. Unlike all the other romance/harems out there, WA2 realistically shows why a love triangle will never work. White Album 2 is a tragic tale revolving around three people who become friends and fall in love for the first time, and how their friendship is tested, strained, and eventually violently ripped apart because of \"a love that cannot be.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy any form of romance anime, whether it be harem, comedy, psychological, or dramatic, I recommend you give White Album 2 a watch. If you don't end up liking it, I would be very surprised.",

            "content": "Let me go right off the bat and say this anime was disappointing, the first half was fine and looking like it will  turn into a decent romance anime but unfortunately for this series where you would expect it to start becoming really good it completely falls down on its fat face. WARNING CONTAINS SPOILS. You have been warned\r\nStory : 6\r\nThe story starts off as any romance anime does, introduce the love interests and develop some back story for the characters. The story then revolves around Kazusa Touma, Setsuna Ogiso and Haruki Kitahara getting ready for the school fair which for their act isputting on a music show. This is the part that looked promising, 3 friends working hard together to achieve a common goal and the bonds that are forged in the process but that all ends after the school fair arc. After the school fair arc Setsuna and Haruki start to date because Haruki (who has feelings for Kazusa, I will get into this in the character section) isn't firm enough with her and on the spur of the moment kisses and subsequently starts to date Setsuna. Setsuna despertly trying to keep the 3 of them together arranges various activities for them to do such as go to a spar. The final part of the anime revolves around the reveal that Touma is moving to europe and Haraki subsequent attempts to get her to stay in japan. This is the part of the story I fucking hate, Haruki lies to Setsuna (on her birthday) that he is sick and goes to visit Touma, a series of events happen that lead to them HAVING SEXUALLY INTERCOURSE, whilst he is still dating Setsuna on her birthday. Touma still decides to leave after all that shit and goes to catch her plain to europe but not before a heart warming last good bye right? WRONG Haruki then proceeds to start making out with Touma in front of Setsuna (who is still his gf btw). Touma then says her feelings in front of setsuna and then leaves for europe leaving Setsuna and Haraki with a broken Relationship. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo with the first half looking like a fun happy anime ends up with every character being sad and depressed. Fuck this story and everything it represents. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8 \\n\\n\r\nBecause this show is based on music you would expect it to be good and fortunately this is true. Their isnt' anything noteworthy to be said but the sound track (mostly the same) is good and lives up to the name  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nHaruki Kitahara: \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of this anime Haruki is a good guy, he treats people nicely and is overall not an asshole. This all changes however in the second half. As I mentioned before despite having a gf he proceed to have sex with touma, and then at the airport start kissing her in front of said gf. I just find him to such a despicable asshole. He has next no morals and only gives a fuck about what he wants with no consideration for anyone around him. The only other character I can compare him to is the main character from school days as both are assholes but unfortunately for this anime he didn't die in the end. \\n\\n\r\nSetsuna Ogiso. \\n\\n\r\nThe only word I can use to describe her with is Crazy. Despite the fact the she knew that Haruki liked Touma he still basically forced him to go out with her which at the point was the downfall for the group she so desperately wanted to keep going. Then after finding out that her bf cheated on her and then kissed touma in front of her leaving her in tear, She still stayed with him. All in all shes a terrible character that probably contributed the most to the fall of the group she loved so much. DUMB BITCH \\n\\n\r\nKazusa Touma: \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime all she did was leave the guy she liked the cold shoulder. All she did was basically be a bitch to him but that didnt stop her from dumping all her feelings on him and having sex with him, despite the fact that she \"valued\" her relationship with Setsuna. She was the best of the worst in my opinion as till the end she sticked with what she wanted to do and said fuck Haruki im going to Europe, hopefully those two can clean after my mess. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a strong start but feel off at around the mid point of the show. The characters all betrayed each other and by the end all that was left was 3 very sad people who did it to them selves. To be honest its quite a stretch to gives this anime a 6",

            "content": "If you're an anime fan and you're anything like me, then you're getting a little goddamn tired of high school rom-com slice of life shows. They seem to breed like rabbits, flooding each new season with waves of uninspired crap. Worse than the fact that they're founded on generic, predictable stories is the fact that 95% of them rely on overused tropes, poor attempts at slapstick humor, cliches, terrible dialogue and more anime-isms than one can count. Shows that are airing now like Ore Monogatari get credit just for deviating ever-so-slightly from the formula, and while I do give such shows credit I still cannothelp but feel as though the vast majority of all of these shows are unwatchable crap. This is ANIME, aka, DRAWINGS. You can do ANYTHING. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical pieces, surrealism: the number of possibilities and the the amount of potential is unbelievable. The fact that so much of that is being wasted is a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2, however, is not wasting anything. Yes, it is set at a high-school with a male protagonist. Yes, it has drama. Yes, it has romance. But it's difficult to even compare it to other shows of its genre. White Album 2 has something to say. It doesn't \"deconstruct\" the genre: that would imply that it uses any of the genre's common elements to begin with. White Album 2 reinvents the high school slice-of-life, showing just what can be done with it if you have a creative mind, an understanding of chemistry, conversation and people, and a goal in mind besides getting two people together. It's a powerful, evocative tale about how complicated emotions and relationships can be, and while it doesn't change my stance on the genre it certainly rises above it. If all high school slice-of-life shows were this good, I would have a vastly different opinion of them.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspects of the show to grab my attention were the art and the music. This is a bit of an irregular for me, considering I usually place a considerably lower value on aesthetics than I do characters and plot. However, from the very beginning the show's aesthetics struck me not because they're of exceptionally high caliber (though they are extremely impressive) but because they're used creatively and effectively. They work with the story, not only complementing it but also adding to it. Art and music in anime are some of the best ways to achieve show-don't-tell, capable of highlighting character traits, establishing tone, and even telling their own story when subjected to good direction. This is something that should seem obvious, but a lot of shows under-utilize or just straight up ignore this possibility. My go-to example is Fate/Zero, a show with both top-notch animation and music (it seriously looks like it's from 2020) that puts neither to any use past having gorgeous fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 makes full use of its aesthetics from episode 1. It uses gorgeously drawn sunsets to emphasize feelings of nostalgia and to reflect the feeling of not wanting the status quo to change (the setting sun implying the transition to a new day). It uses shot-framing to demonstrate what characters are focused on, as well as lighting to imply how characters feel (oftentimes characters having a conversation will be lit in different ways even though they are in the same place, showing how each of them view the other). It even makes use of font, using a crystalline and gleaming lettering for its credits and on-screen text that fits in with Touma's cold-feeling yet elegant aura. The music is another story entirely: White Album 2 is a show that revolves around music with several of its characters striving to be musicians of their own and everyone in the show being profoundly affected by music. Several of the songs that the characters listen to/play are repeated across the entirety of the show, both as diegetic sound and as background music, garnering meaning both to the characters and the audience as the show progresses. The song 'White Album', first featured in the beginning of episode 1, both physically brings the characters together and is a reflection of the nature of their relationships. I was constantly impressed by the show's directing and the emotional response it was able to instill using aesthetics alone, and I award it full points in both of these categories for being a gleaming example of how these elements of a show can be used.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, regardless of how well art and sound are used in a show, they are never single-handedly enough to make it a masterpiece (at least in my opinion). Nisekoi was a striking example of this, showing that even SHAFT can't make everything good. So lets talk about the story. Look, I never thought I'd say this. Even in the best high school slice-of-life shows the story is rarely very interesting, with execution and characters usually carrying the brunt of the burden. This is because after having so many of these goddamn shows and the extreme limitations they are bound by, there's really not much you can do outside of School Days that comes off as original or unique. Even Toradora, one of my long-standing favorites, has a plot that is for the most part generic. I am, however, forced to admit:\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 has a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nScratch that, it's outstanding. The underlying cause of this is that, as mentioned before, it has a goal in mind other than getting two characters together, and whilst it is completely unafraid to throw itself whole-heartedly into romance, it's not remotely exclusively about that. It's also about nostalgia (both for the past and the present), fearing the future, mistakes, heartbreak of many kinds, and regret. It weaves a tale that follows multiple characters thoroughly, valuing each of their ENTIRELY different struggles equally, and crafting them all together due to the character's shared bonds. None of the characters overwhelms the show by being viewed as more important or hogging too much of the focus. This allows for a story that is refreshingly original, relies on absolutely no cliches (there is no pool episode. There is no school festival episode. There is no school trip episode. There is no no fucking new years episode.) and follows what is important to the characters rather than what is going on at the goddamn high school. It also understands that high schoolers oftentimes do weird sh*t (in fact, all people do) and manages to embrace that in a way that is surprisingly touching and honest rather than coming off as creepy or \"irregular\". The show is absolutely void of fan-service: there is sexuality and sexual themes because hormones are a real thing that oftentimes take tangible form (WHO'D A THUNK??) but they're handled in a mature way. For a show a mere 13 episodes long, White Album 2 covers an amazing amount of ground and really makes you feel as though you've only seen a sliver of a long story with more on either end. That's perhaps the plot's strongest aspect: it doesn't feel as though it begins when the camera stars rolling. The show starts then, but the story started long before then and will continue long afterwards. So far I haven't even mentioned the ending, which simultaneously provides an unbelievably satisfying and powerful resolution to the story whilst still leaving the viewer feeling like there's much more to see. I guess that's what happens when you acknowledge that a kiss and a confession aren't the ultimate goal of life and don't result in an end to all struggles?\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you should have enough good reasons to go watch this show. Stellar direction, unique, refreshing and impressive story, gorgeous music, outstanding art: that's high praise. I'm pretty picky. But I'm not done yet. There's still something I want to want to give the show credit for.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 has two aspects in which it stands above pretty much every other anime I've seen: the combination of characters & writing. I know those are similar, but there is definitely a distinction. For instance, a show like Princess Tutu has amazing characters because the motivations and ideas behind those characters are original and believable, but the show's writing is pretty impressive because the dialogue through which the characters express who they are is bland and repetitive. White Album 2 both has outstanding characters in the sense that the ideas behind them are great and in the sense that their dialogue is crisp, real and refreshing. It is an absolute JOY to just watch people talk to each other in this show because they talk in the same way that, oh, I don't know, people actually converse! There are no rough or awkward transitions in subject matter, there are reasons behind the things that everyone in the show says and sometimes that reason is that people oftentimes talk without thinking. Emotions are expressed realistically and conveyed in ways that are deliciously real. Characters misinterpret each other in believable ways due to phrasing and every word actually counts. White Album 2 understands that people don't directly convey intentions to each other, they convey words and that others often misinterpret intentions through those words. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are amazing. I don't want to get too much into them for the sake of spoilers, but by the end of the show no commonly used archetype could be used to describe any of them. They're all individuals. There are three main characters: Haruki Kitahara, Kazusa Touma and Ogiso Setsuna. Each of them has a distinct relationship with each of the others and they have a group dynamic between the three of them as well. Each of them possesses a wealth of both common and more uncommon personality traits, and the show allows these to play off of each other in the way that makes sense. Kitahara is unyielding self-sacrificing to a fault where he is kind to everyone but not to any one person in particular: no one feels as though they are actually special to him because he white-washes his relationships with his selfless attitude. Touma is reclusive and unmotivated, initially having succumbed to feeling hopeless and numb and expressing that through a cold exterior that is clearly crying for attention, something that she refuses to admit to herself. Ogiso Setsuna- well, Ogiso Setsuna is one of my favorite characters of all time. She craves an idea so badly that once it becomes reality all she can think about is her fear of losing it and does everything in her power to ensure that it will endure. She searches for happiness and validation from the people around her, seeing that other people with close friends are happy and wanting to have that closeness as well without realizing that unless she can accept herself and love herself no amount of compassion from others will make her feel at peace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, White Album 2 was an absolutely incredible and unexpected experience. It easily made its way into my all-time favorites and I'm currently in the process of rewatching it. If you're tired of repetitive garbage, anime tropes, romance cliches, and slice-of-life bullshit, give this a shot anyways. It wont change your opinion about any of those other shows, but who cares: it's a masterpiece of a show, and at this point it's entirely its own thing.",

            "content": "Love sucks, plain and simple. Of course, that little detail is often lost in the overwhelming sea of romance anime/mangas out there which paints the whole ordeal of falling in love and actually getting into a relationship like it's all sunshine and rainbows. I think I can speak for the majority of us when I say that romance in real life is nothing like Kimi ni Todoke or Clannad. Furthermore, I think it's safe to say that if you've ever been caught in a love triangle in real life as well, it ain't gonna be like a harem comedy. Humans are fucked up creatures andby the end of it all, nobody comes out of a romantic encounter unscathed. People get hurt, and it fucking sucks. Say what you will about White Album 2, but you know what? It's probably the only anime that truly captures what romance is actually like without treating it like a farcical melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I can really see anyone having with this programme is the potential inability to empathise with what's going on and what the characters are going through. I'll say this right now: if you've never been caught in the middle of a love triangle in real life or don't at least make the effort to understand why the characters are doing what they're doing, you'll irrevocably hate this show. I mean, looking at this stuff from the outside-in is fucking frustrating to say the least because everything seems so simple in hindsight. Unfortunately, romance has this nasty habit of making simple things become a Herculean effort. Sure, you can say \"that's not always the case\" but it's sadly the case for most of us.\\n\\n\r\nI should give a warning to people who expect all their romances to be happy-go-lucky, but the only people who would ever expect ALL romances to be vanilla are mouth-breathing weeaboos with absolutely no social skills with their only romantic experience being masturbating to their high school crushes and being rejected when they tried to ask him/her out. To paraphrase something that Bob Ross once said during an episode of The Joy of Painting: you need some sadness so you know when the good times roll by. It's not like White Album 2 is completely devoid of happy/cute/sweet/heartwarming moments, because that's not the case whatsoever. It's just that we're more prone to remembering the bad shit happening than the good shit. \\n\\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that WA2 is probably like Oyasumi Punpun because you're never going to get that fairy tale ending where they all live happily ever after because that ain't how it works. As much as we might want Setsuna, Kazusa, and Haruki to end up in a poly relationship so that nobody will get hurt, we all know that shit *rarely* happens in anime, let alone in real life. Someone always gets the short end of the stick and people end up doing some pretty fucked up shit to each other along the way. In many ways, White Album 2 manages to perfectly capture all the feelings that people end up going through in romance: good, bad, and ugly.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said and done, you might be wondering why I didn't give this programme a 10/10. Well, the biggest reason is that White Album 2 is a visual novel adaptation by the end of it all. The anime only covers the introductory chapter of the VN which takes up around ~10-15% of the story. Whilst the anime is perfectly capable of standing on its own and ends in a manner which provides a sense of closure/resolution, I still want to know what happens to Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna after high school. Did I forget to mention that the visual novel is a massive work which covers ~5 years' worth of story (because that's kind of important)? If there's one thing I hate, it's knowing there's more story out there that is unfortunately unavailable (ref: Fruits Basket, Rurouni Kenshin, Berserk, etc). Even then, at least I can read the manga if there is no more anime available but therein lies the problem: the visual novel barring Introductory Chapter is untranslated so it makes me even saltier. Enough about that though, I guess you want my final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, White Album 2 is the among the best experiences I've ever had with anime in quite some time. While there are some frustrations that I have with the series, they aren't enough to actually affect my recommendation of the show. It's just such a shame that people end up dismissing romance as a genre deeply entrenched in the melodramatic. The biggest strength romance as a genre has is the fact that if done properly, it's something that can make for an incredibly empathetic experience. Unfortunately, the bulk of what passes for romance these days is uninspired drivel that's rife with so many tired-out clich\u00e9s that it's no wonder people can't stand romantic stories. I'm not making any promises here, but I'm sure if you were to give White Album 2 a shot, you might like it. I guess that's all I can really say at this point so with that, I'm out. Peace.",

            "content": "Walking on the streets of Kobe one late night on the eve of Christmas has showed me wonderful sights: couples holding hands together, wispy white breaths from salarymen rushing past me, swinging leather briefcases and purses, glaring red and green lights, smiles, and the children who sneaked out at night to sing carols in that small corner right over there. \r\nOf all the things that make Christmas what it is, this Kobe street is missing something. Not Santa Claus -- that large man with a huge belly donned in that trademark woolen clothing of his is crying out, \"Hohoho~,\" in the wooden chair. Not Rudolfthe Reindeer -- he's there but not as a living being; he's just a cardboard cutout standing beside him. And definitely not the jingles -- Frosty the Snowman is being played on the speakers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this Christmas is lacking is snow.\\n\\n\r\nIt is something I look forward to, even if winter is not my favorite season. It's hard to picture Santa Claus in the tropics of Malaysia; even in Kuala Lumpur, his stature is in front of a snowy backdrop. Many people see snow as purifying, romantic, and cleansing. But it can also be harsh and bitter.\\n\\n\r\nI see White Album 2 (both this season and the obviously-going-to-exist next season) as an extension of it. In this show, WA2 dives into a high school love triangle start with humble beginnings. Like all love triangles, it fosters innocently like a child clinging to his mother and then festers like a sore blister. White Album 2 seeks to not only hurt their lovable characters but you the viewer as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard for me to remember a show with a cast so likable and hatable at the same time. Kitahara Haruki, the protagonist, is just an average high school honors student. Until he finds himself loving two distinct personalities: Ogiso Setsuna (the idol) and Touma Kazusa (the aloof pianist). Setsuna's a homely, hardworking girl in a family that cries, \"We're family alright!\" On the other hand, Kazusa's estranged relationship with her mother leaves her in shambles and she practices piano alone in a small music room at school. These three characters, bland when separated, harmonize like those seamless sequences of chords Kazusa plays on her piano. They love each other dearly. A genuinely affectionate relationship between three friends who wanted to play some good music on the school concert. \\n\\n\r\nWithout that bond, I don't think the show (or even the VN) will work. One of the strengths of White Album 2 is Setsuna's insistence in that they must be together. At all costs. Even though they know it's not going to end well, the characters in their own quirky ways want to be together.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the drama takes place. The problem with most love triangles is simply this: you care about siding with the so-called \"best girl\". White Album 2 differs from the typical bunch and moves on a different path: there are no best girls. You want everyone to be together. Is friendship better than love? That's a very good question and you're going to struggle with it as the show moves on. Preserve the status quo or confess that you like him/her? Another good question.\\n\\n\r\nNobody has the right answers to them. By the end of this season, the characters are in a mess so unsolvable world-class detectives refuse to approach it. All you can do is be a miserable wreck and cry yourself out.",

            "content": "\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\"\r\nI hated this show.\r\n\"But,\" I hear you say, \"you gave it a 10/10, so you can't think it all that bad.\"\r\nWell, no. I don't think it's a bad show, in fact a very good one.\r\nBut I still hate it.\r\nLike what the games Spec Ops: The Line and Doki Doki Literature Club are to their respective genres, this is a show that swings a sledge hammer to your face for liking the musical genre.\r\nStory: On the surface, it's a fairly typical high school story about a young guitarist by the name of Haruki Kitahara trying to piece together enough musicians for aperformance at the school festival. He seeks out school idol Setsuna Ogiso and virtuoso pianist Kazusa Touma to join his club.\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls, one guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is the lead-up to the performance, which was very much a spectacle. However, not all of it is initially shown. Most people watching will recognise the final song played at the end of the anime - and it's a real gut punch despite its familiarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show depicts what happens once the seeds shown in the first half of the show begin to bloom. And die.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: It did its job. Being a winter-themed show, it goes heavy on blue, grey, white, dark green and other dark colours. The backgrounds seem at times blurred and indistinct, or even bland. I mean that not as a criticism. In fact, it makes the characters stand out more, and contributes to White Album 2 having the delicate feeling of a half-remembered dream. Or nightmare.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: It's a musical anime! Naturally the music (even the background music) was of a high standard. The song \"White Album\" had me hunting down the sheet music, and the OP and EDs still have me listening to them from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It is a romance show, and primarily character driven, with deeply human, flawed characters, that take a wide berth to stereotypes. take Haruki Kitahara is a worker, and has a typical anime protagonist design - messy dark hair. Someone who helps set up events and sticks around afterwards to help pack up. One can readily identify with his desire to help out. Although he has two clear goals in mind, \"reform the club\" and \"perform on stage\", he does often lack conviction. Something of a serious flaw in a romance show.\\n\\n\r\nNo character is a pure stereotype. All are well written and believable. So much so, that the usually fierce ship rivalries in comment sections could understand the other perspective, a mark of unusually good writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There is something of a tragedy that takes place at the end of the show. Depending on how you look at it, any one of the three characters (or all three) could be said to be the one at fault for what happened. That's what makes this show so good, drawing you in with relatable characters, letting their flaws manifest in a deeply human way.\\n\r\nIt's also why I hate it so much.\\n\\n\r\nNot for the downer ending, but because it was the characters own actions, all three of them, that led to them all losing what mattered to them most and in such a way that reason cannot sort who is in the right and who is in the wrong, for all their behaviours can be rationalised, depending on whose perspective you take.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is music preparation, with the performance at the half-way mark. What happens in the final few episodes re-frames your view of the entire show, but it doesn't feel forced. Rather, a natural extension of how we know the characters behave.\\n\\n\r\nI only hate one other anime as much as I do this show, and that's for the crime of wasted potential. There is no wasted potential here, with the show developing its characters and themes to the fullest extent a short single-cour story will allow.\\n\\n\r\nThe initial relatability of the main character caused this reviewer to chime with him very closely. This investment is what caused me to hate it so much. Being told \"Watch it! If you misstep like that, and we say you might, you will be punished harshly\" leaves me, understandably, feeling pretty angry.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also why I can't give this show anything less than a 10/10. Objectively, the show captures a piece of objective truth. Truth that can only be touched on in great stories and artworks, the beauty and horror of human nature, and the danger of following your deceitful and desperately wicked heart. It's a horrifying thing to hear, especially from a musical anime so unexpectedly.\\n\r\nIt did what it set out to do perfectly.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr The reviewer dislikes this objectively amazing show.",

            "content": "After being almost forced into it by a friend, who\u2019s basically in love with romantic stories, I\u2019ve decided to watch White Album 2, despite the fact that I\u2019ve had enough of soap operas about unlucky love for some time already. Anyways, I started watching. Before we get to rating and justifying the aforementioned, I have to admit one thing \u2013 this anime evokes borderline emotions. Whether positive or negative depends on the personal taste of the viewer, however, you can\u2019t just walk past them indifferently. And because of that, it reminds me a bit of Golden Time (and not only because of that, mind you).\r\nWarning,the following review contains a few minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe plot presented in the anime is solid and nothing above that. As it is portrayed in many stories, the school festival is the moment in the lives of the students in which they all enter a state of rut, and therefore, they want to do something about it no matter the cost. Here we have the revival of the Light Music Association. What\u2019s interesting, the climax of the story, namely the festival, happens almost halfway through. Unfortunately, what happens afterwards only impacts negatively on the rating. Stupid behavior, attractions, crying, and tears have been unnecessarily condensed into four-five last episodes, which tires and disgusts very fast. Not going into detail, the plot, although trivial, had potential, however a bit wasted because of the uneven distribution of romantic aspects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne can bicker about many thing in this anime, but being impartial, one cannot refuse that fact that from an artistic standpoint, the visuals are top notch. I totally don\u2019t know the terminology to define the quality, but I know one thing \u2013 it\u2019s pleasant on the eye and looks good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing what one notices is the music \u2013 delicate and subtle rhythms played one some kind of string instrument (a cello?) and the sounds played by the protagonists on the guitar or piano are the best medicine for ears brutally raped by the cacophony of some anime. The singing of one of the heroines is very pleasant for the ear, as well as the other voices are very appropriate, not irritating or distracting one bit. In brief \u2013 a good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nOne of the sections that cause the most mixed feelings in me. The MC looks promising, so different from the banality of most of the drama/romanse anime protags (either a total idiot that can\u2019t open his mouth around somebody representing the different sex and getting beet red just from mentioning a woman, or a wuss that can\u2019t decide on anything and always relegating his responsibility to others), but sadly, this changes with each passing episode. On the other hand, Setsuna and Touma are just cookie cutter characters. In the left corner we have an ex-idol dere-dere, and in the right corner we have a tsundere sociopath, one red haired and one black haired. One almost exudes her feelings for the MC in buckets, and the other is the classic case of \u201cwhy won\u2019t senpai notice me\u201d. The scriptwriter probably tried to save the situation in the last episodes, but he just worsened the whole thing. During that time, the MC sheds more tears than Shinji during the whole course of Evangelion, and the love triangle starts shifting sides like in a kaleidoscope. Reassuming \u2013 what looked good in the beginning got screwed up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nI really had a dilemma what rating to give here. The first eight episodes went in like a glass of Stolichnaya with an appetizer, but the next five just started causing a massive hangover. Maybe I don\u2019t stomach love triangles and MC\u2019s so \u2018manly\u2019 I\u2019m pondering how deep their vajay goes, and maybe it\u2019s just me who thinks that such behavior and choices are so totally and utterly stupid that my head starts to hurt. That\u2019s why many people won\u2019t probably agree with me, happens. However, in the end, I\u2019ll give a 6. The first few episodes were genuinely fun to watch, pleasant both for the eyes, ears, and for my sense of aesthetics. Unfortunately, the next ones started spoiling my idealized picture of the anime. Despite all the errors and irritating design choices, the anime stand above average in my book.\\n\r\nEveryone that likes such stories can easily add two points to my score, especially if you don\u2019t mind a lead character that couldn\u2019t decide anything and carry on the consequences of his decisions. Be what it may, I encourage you to watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Generic romance anime with generic characters all of whom fill a stereotype. We have a nice guy man-pussy, a popular kawaii-wannabe idol and you run of the mill tsundere. For an anime focused on music the music is surprisingly generic. The ending song is alright I guess, but the rest of the sounds are rather forgettable. The anime picks up after about 10 episodes and the last two episodes are decent. But the journey to get there is slow, ardous and painful and the ending is just too little too late. I almost dropped the show post the 7th episode. Each of three main characterscan be distilled down to a single action they repeat over and over again. Haruki - ever dependable, always present to help others. The definition of a mangina essentially. Setsuna - \"I hope we can be like this forever\". Repeat that line 10 times each episode and Kazusa - I will be rude to hide that I like Haruki. Whatever \"growth\" the characters have occurs in the last two episodes and that growth is only for Setsuna and Kazusa. Haruki remains a mangina to the end. \\n\\n\r\nHaving seen a bunch of anime now, I have to ask, does Japan have an aversion to normal male characters? Every character I see lately is an effeminate man-pussy who cannot take control of any situation. And ofc said mangina gets all the chicks in the end. Top lel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall an exceedingly bland and generic anime saved from being truly dismal by the above average ending. At the end of the show, I was hard pressed to really be bothered about the characters, story or the music. Not really recommended. 5/10",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I'll do my best.\r\nWhite Album 2 is, to me, the epitome of human romance in anime. \r\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, I mean it's a perfect mix of irrational love taking over imperfect human beings and dictating their own actions to a point where those aren't their own anymore, spiced with artistic expression such is music, and with passionately written script.\r\nThere are a few flaws in the package of course, like the imprecision (borderline laziness I'd say sometimes) in the graphic department (at some scene, a guitar is being played by itself, without fingers to help createthe notes), or some proportion errors in a few scenes, but you're not really looking for perfection in that department when watching a romance/drama anime, from my humble opinion. Still, it affected the overall score accordingly, just not my personal choice of calling this 13 episode long show my favourite anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\\n\r\nIt certainly isn't an out of the norm plot, romantic triangles are quite abundant in the current romance anime meta, specially when based around a school setting. Still, the way it develops is close to no other, the storyline doesn't feel rushed at all, yet it manages to keep you attached to the screen and to the characters (specially the female ones) up until the last, heartbreaking scene. You may cry in despair, you might be angry at some points, even outraged. You might even laugh, or feel deeply happy at some stages of the story, but in the end the story feels truly human, and it manages to touch you in a rare way that you'll want to cherish forever, and you'll certainly be able to relate to the situations presented on this anime as long as you keep your heart open to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt has its moments, as I stated above, but overall the art (which is inspired in the visual novel this anime is adaptation of) is great. It doesn't have extremely outstanding visuals, it's rather austere, nothing like Byousuku 5 Centimeter and other shows with a much higher artistic budget, but it certainly does its job well. The character designs are fitting, and some scenes are truly precious and unforgettable. My wallpaper is one of those scenes, I'll let you guess which one if you're interested~ \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThis. This right here is the brightest star of the anime. The soundtrack level is worthy of Clannad: After Story and the likes. Madoka Yonezawa (Setsuna's seiyuu, relevant to the whole story) and Uehara Rena give voice to some of the most touching melodies ever composed. I honestly believe the music gives the story the extra push it needed to reach the highest place in my favourites list, and even now months after finishing the story I still keep the whole OST in my mp3, and upload entries of it to my blog rather frequently. Just listening some of these songs brings tears to my eyes. They say music is the language the heart speaks, and these songs speak directly to heart of the listener. It doesn't even matter if you don't understand the lyrics at first, they will touch even the remotest corners of your soul with barely a few chords and tones. You can feel their struggles within their melodic landscape. A masterpiece of a soundtrack. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI could say a lot of things about the characters, and it would be okay. But I think their most important trait is... they are human. Their actions, their thoughts... they are mirrors of the human nature. You can relate to their suffering and joy, you can feel it's not some kind of fairytale story but rather something that could be happening anywhere else in the world at the moment you're watching it. And that, to me, is one of the most important traits a character can have, specially in a romance/drama story. Being able to identify your own psyche in them... is a priceless feeling, and increases the overall value of the story to a point you start thinking it's a real incident what's through the screen. And certainly a heartfelt one.\\n\\n\r\nThe main male character is the weak spot of this segment, but I'll let you judge by yourself about this, since I might be a tad biased after I finished the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI actually got all emotional while writing this review, what can I say? It struck right to my heart, and while it might leave you hanging for a few hours or days, I call that enjoyment. It's an unforgettable anime, much like the love stories most of us have gone through.  If you only like \"happy-go-lucky\" anime, well, you won't enjoy this, but if you appreciate a story that will leave you thinking for days about attachment, infatuation and how puppet-like we are under the effect of them... look no further. This will make you angry, sad, happy... but overall, it'll make you feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nEventhough it's my favourite anime...by no means do I think this is the ultimate anime, or that it's perfect in every way. It's certainly imperfect. Just like us, humans.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think that's one extra charm added to it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my first review, but I wish you'll enjoy the anime as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nCheers, Sona.\\n",

            "content": "It didn't take much to get me interested in this title. I saw \"high school\" and \"music\" and I was sucked in. I HAD to watch White Album 2. It wasn't until later that I found out this was also a love triangle anime. White Album 2 is one of those shows that manages to achieve a balance between its multiple elements without losing focus of its main objective. The story and characters of White Album 2 are unrelated to the first White Album anime (which I've heard, by all accounts, is mediocre). The show is based off of the \"Introductory Chapter\" of the visualnovel. I haven't read the visual novel, but other viewers claim that the anime stays pretty faithful to its source material. There are some fanservice shots, but it's nothing overly gratuitous. There is also a sex scene, but it's brief and most of it isn't seen. There is no explicit nudity.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 - Kitahara Haruki, an average guitarist, is the last remaining member of the Light Music Club. He's determined to put together a band in time to perform at the school fair, just weeks away. By a stroke of luck, he finds that the \"school idol,\" Ogiso Setsuna, is a talented vocalist, and the quiet, antisocial girl who sits next to him in class, Touma Kazusa, is the daughter of a world-famous pianist and is a musical prodigy herself. Thus, the Light Music Club is reformed and a love triangle begins to take shape. However, preparing for the school fair is not the focus of the entire show--in fact, this only accounts for about half of the episodes. The remaining episodes focus on the drama of the love triangle. In my opinion, this was an excellent screenwriting decision as this allows for both the music and the drama aspects of the show to have their respective time in the limelight. The show feels balanced. Each episode is a logical continuation of the next and thus the storytelling feels almost seamless. This is not a wishy-washy romance story; the characters' actions are decisive. My only complaint about the story is its ending. Although I know that this is just the first part of a larger story, the ending left me feeling incomplete, and I felt there should have been an additional scene to provide more closure. I sincerely hope that the second installment of the visual novel will get an anime adaptation, because I need to see a definitive conclusion to this story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 - Perhaps the show's weakest link is its art. Although the character designs are appealing, the animation seems to lack liveliness. This is painfully evident during the musical performances--do not expect Angel Beats-level detail here. Shots avoid detail so the intricacies of the instruments are left unseen. There are way too many shots from the rear, which conveniently obscure the act of playing instruments. Haruki's hands barely move when he's playing the guitar, regardless of whether he's playing chords or a lengthy guitar solo. Even shots of Setsuna singing feel like a bit of a cop-out: repeated shots of her legs and feet are interspersed with quick shots of her face that attempt to give the impression that attention is being given to details. There are far too many uses of stills. Ultimately, the animation doesn't feel nearly as dynamic as it should, which really sucks the life out of the performance scene as well as many others.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - Expectations are high here, being as this is a music anime. And it doesn't disappoint. Being a pianist myself, I especially appreciated the piano tracks, recorded by an actual pianist. Haruki's stumbles while playing the guitar sound genuine, and not just like a missed note on Guitar Hero. The soundtrack is excellent. The titular song, \"White Album,\" is a wonderful tune that I found myself humming hours afterwards. The quality of the sound doesn't fully make up for the lacking animation, but it gets pretty close.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - The three main characters are all pretty well fleshed out, thanks to a script that doesn't reduce them to shallow, stereotypical love triangle characters. Haruki is a sincere guy who seems to have realized what his dream is a little too late. Setsuna puts on the image of being a \"school idol\" in order to avoid her worst fear, being left out. Because of events within her family, Kazusa understandably has issues with authority and cares about, well...nothing. It's enjoyable to watch how these three each change and grow as a result of each others' company. They're all likable, and it's because we like them that the romantic drama hits so hard. We want all of them to be happy, but we know that can never happen. And ironically, that's what makes White Album 2 so enjoyable to watch. We feel their sadness; we feel their frustration as they struggle with their own personal dilemmas. We empathize.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 - The art and the ending were definitely detractors for me on this one. But, the most important thing is, first and foremost, having an engaging storyline and characters. White Album 2 has both. Combine that with an excellent soundtrack, and regardless of the art and the incompleteness of the ending, White Album 2 is still an enjoyable watch, although its lacking aspects prevent it from becoming truly great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - White Album 2 is a good anime. It's emotionally engaging without wandering into the realm of melodrama. It also avoids creating characters that fall into any extreme trope. This is just a story of three teenagers, about to enter the next stage of their life, who play music together and fall in love. And in the end, there's something a little beautiful about it.",

            "content": "This is a hard anime for me to review, and honestly, I'm not sure that the score that I gave it is really representative of my feelings towards White Album 2. Hopefully, as I'm writing this review, I can get some type of closure and maybe fortify my rating decision. So bear with me a bit.\r\nI have strayed away from the pure romantic drama genre for years now, I thought that I was offered the best that a romantic drama can deliver in Clannad, and the worst that it can offer in School Days. I've also enjoyed shows like True Tears and Ef in thepast. \\n\\n\r\nWhile starting White Album 2, I immediately got sucked in by the beautiful art work, the excellent pieces of music, and the introductions of these rather well made characters. The main character, Haruki Kitahara, is not depicted as the usual MC. Haruki is a great student, a great leader ( he's shown organizing events, and even helping out clubs that he doesn't belong to), caring and conscious. To me, he was depicted a lot different than the usually dense as a rock main characters of romantic anime. I actually liked him a lot and related to his personality. I've always been the guy every one runs to for advice, and assumes that I got all the answers. And though Haruki was well known around campus, he didn't seem to be super popular, his personality was irritable to some. I think that is a good description of how perfectionists can come off sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main two girls were also introduced well. Ogiso Satsuna is your typical popular high school girl, she's pretty and has a sociable personality.  You may think you can put her in a box, however, Ogiso is a little deeper than what is shown in the beginning, and has some deep traumas that really affected her and defined her in this anime, for better or worse. Kazusa Touma is the second girl introduced, and she's rather unique. She's the opposite of what Ogiso is, Touma is introverted, quick witted,and cold. Touma was by far my favorite of the two. Their character designs matched their personalities perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n Since I hadn't watched a pure romantic drama in a while, the feelz for me during the first half of the anime were strong. I loved the way the friendship between the main characters formed through the shared goal of performing in the fall festival. There were a lot of training session, but they didn't feel dragging, and the songs that they played were not over-played to the point of annoyance. During those training sessions, it was somewhat eery and foreshadowing getting a glimpse of what was to come in the romantic lives of these characters. It's pretty easy to see who loves who, and I was hypnotized by the intensity matched with the music and bgm during the first seven episodes. The first seven episodes were easily all 10/10s for me, I fell back in love with the romantic genre just through these beginning episodes. Unfortunately, the last six episodes gave me a hard reality check, it reminded me the reason why I left this genre for so long.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of this anime, the fall festival has ended, and music becomes a less central part of the anime. The drama between the three main characters thicken, and I'm being careful of not revealing spoilers, the invisible wedge between them grows bigger as time advances. It was painfully obvious what was going on, and you knew that one person (or possibly more) were going to get their heart demolished. \\n\\n\r\nIn this second half, I started to see elements that I never enjoyed seeing in anime due to personal preference. Elements such as betrayal, lying, cowardice, and jealousy. These emotions are very hard to depict well in an anime, and can sometime come off as either fake, childish, or forced. I can say with supreme confidence that White Album 2 expressed these elements perfectly. Anytime you feel bad for the character that you don't think is the right fit for the MC, or when you  show fits of anger as you watch a particular action that a character has done, or when you actually feel the tears of a character longing for the affection of a person that they cannot be with......then you can say for certainty that the emotional elements of this anime was well represented. \\n\\n\r\nThere were times during the second half where it took me hours to finish an episode because I would pause it so much. There were a lot of times in which I would face-palm and ask myself why I'm even continuing with this anime. These reactions are usually similar to reactions that you have when you watch really crappy shows, you think that this is so bad and face-palm at the stupidity of it. I think I may have confused, initially, why I was reacting this way. It wasn't because the anime was crappy, but rather the opposite, this anime did a great job depicting the earlier-mentioned elements to their fullest extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are experiencing real feelings, and the plot takes dark and unsettling paths. It is very different from other anime, because it doesn't want to leave you with this third party mindstate, it engages you into feeling the guilt, feeling the anguish, and feeling the betrayal. The worst thing is that the anime doesn't care if it leaves you in an ambiguous note, there is no guarantee of a concrete ending.   Wow, this part of the anime was just really well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't give this anime a 10/10 because the second half of the anime was just a little bit too overbearing for me. A lot of conversations seemed insignificant, and the anime was starting to run in circles a bit. The ending also left me with a really bad aftertaste. After watching the ending episode, I literally took a shower, mouth-washed, and I still couldn't wash away this unsettling and sour feeling. I guess that's a sign of the quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend this anime, I think you will enjoy the first half a lot, and the second half will be up to your personal preference. It didn't initally cut it with me but the ending was realistic and well made, so I'm not going to chronically complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway do check it out, and if you want to discuss the ending with me (since I didn't want to reveal spoilers here) feel free to just comment me about your reaction.",

            "content": "\"The last moment the three of us could truly be together.\"\r\nThis quote perfectly describes the situation of the 3 main characters within the story and the problems they face. I'd also say that this anime identically portrays situations that people in reality face, as people are always looking for ways to get what they want without hurting their friends. This anime truly makes it fall in love with you as they portray their characters in a way to relate it to reality by showing that humans truly do not like change, as shown in anime as the 3 main characters wish to stay the waythey are currently living forever. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, to the people who wonder as to whether they should be watching this anime or not, I highly suggest that you don't dismiss this anime based on a preconceived opinion without much reasoning behind it. Although I do understand that people simply dislike the 'love triangle' category because of their own reasons, 'White Album 2' isn't quite the average love triangle anime that displays two boys fighting over a girl. I also want to mention that 'White Album' and 'White Album 2nd Season' are completely irrelative to this anime and are based off of completely different characters. I wouldn't suggest you watch it due to its mediocrity but you're always welcome to do so.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the plot, the story revolves around the three best friends who make up the Light Music Club. Haruki Kitahara, who had begun playing the guitar and strived to improve in order to play on stage with his two other friends. Setsuna Ogiso, the school idol whom is adored by many due to her looks and kindness. And her polar opposite, Kazusa Touma, who is known as a rebel who is selfish and only cares about her music, therefore never paying attention to not only students but also teachers. Eventually, the three turn into best friends who adore each other possibly because the situation that they face are so similar in terms of the problems they face and  the things they're interested in. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed in a way where they believe that the time they spend together is just time spent developing their relationship with the intent of getting to know each other and becoming better friends, but that simple adoration towards each other turns into romantic love where they strive to develop a relationship that goes further than being friends. The way they face their incoming problems and how they react to that is truly something that will make you fall in love with the characters as they continuously still strive to staying as the three best friends who are part of the Light Music Club, but fail to do so as love intrudes their daily lives and prevent them from being the same trio ever again.\\n\\n\r\nPeople say that they strive to maintain friendly relationships with others, or that they would do anything for loved ones. Humans tend to sacrifice things like trust, destroy relationships, hurt others, or even disregard other emotions just because of one simple fact - that they love another. 'White Album 2' portrays a person's true personality, and the things they would do for a romance. It perfectly singles out how human emotions can affect one's rationality and decision making ability and this similarity between reality and the anime; may or may not, make you fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime, however, isn't really as special as the story, and is just average, though I still think that the normal-like art perfectly fits this deep romance story and still successfully delivers and shows the watcher how the protagonists of the story are feeling. Whether it be a character blushing, or feeling angered, the art of the anime perfectly delivers visually.\\n\\n\r\nAs a musical oriented anime, I would have been seriously surprised if the music and OST were bad and didn't fit with a certain scene, and fortunately, I wasn't disappointed as I really did enjoy the songs they sang during their concert and played with their instruments. The sound of the voice actors were also clear-cut, and the voice actors themselves deserve a clap and truly did an awesome job as well, as they spoke in a way that fit the mood of many scenes and also made me feel really into it. They successfully delivered and spoke in a truly emotional way that made me seriously fall in love with their characters, for example, the end of the anime shows a certain character leaving and another character is truly depressed about it, and the way that character spoke made me feel seriously bad for him.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, I really do think that all three of the main protagonists are really well developed and the anime chronologically develops them and shows how the romance and guilt from betrayal affects them and eventually changes their thoughts and ideals. The romance between a set of characters is further developed than another set of characters due to scenes that showed they really loved each other and were crucial parts of each others daily lives, however, the peak of development was near the end of the anime where a sex scene is displayed (nothing is really shown) which shows how much these characters had grown as they were now entering their adolescent stages where they had to decide their future. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone whose watched the series twice, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and hope people will watch this anime after reading my review, and as this is my first review, I don't think it turned out as great as I wanted it to be, but in the end, I just want to say that 'White Album 2' is a masterpiece and indeed, the best romance anime I've ever watched, and overall...\\n\\n\r\nI give 'White Album 2' a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Since being done with Ligotti's Conspiracy Against the Human Race, I've been attached to this idea of Zappfe's Four-Way philosophy. Especially interesting is Sublimation because it seems strange that the pessimistic mindset would be conquered by itself in a self-mutilating loop (though maybe its because it feels self-mutilating that it becomes pessimistic, the thing about pessimistic philosophy is that its based entirely around aesthetic and gut feel over anything else). The point I'm making in bringing up one of the big daddies of dark philosophy is that love for dark things is as fundamental a drive as love for romantic idealist things. It's just asaesthetic to describe life as grand meaningless pestilent Gothic drama as it is to describe it as grand eschatological redemption. We live, especially in these times, in a world where the evils aren't even morally horrific and tragic as they are mere humiliations of the human spirit. Thus what appears to be great movements of the interior human spirit and great passions, especially with regard to our daily romances, comes across as petty and insipid when viewed from cruel reality. I mean we all want to lie on the grass and stare romantically at the stars with a significant Other, or we want to go crazy and shout our love everywhere, or dance on rooftops and drink champagne, but the truth of the matter is that from the view of another there isn't any fleeting transcendence involved in that when outside our own solipsism. Some of it comes across as banal and juvenile, as ridiculous embarrassment. So the true use of Art is to play our own little realities as fully as we possibly can, to make as it truthful to the tragic overtures or the idealistic life-affirmation that we conceive in our heads. Since we aren't romantics anymore though we turn to sickness, degradation, decay and edginess as the last bastion for meaning in our lives (or at least a whole bunch of people but not everyone does. I too am trying for the whole ornamented pessimist Gothic feel that Ligotti was aiming for it writing like this)\\n\\n\r\n\"THE culture-heroes of our liberal bourgeois civilization are anti-liberal and anti-bourgeois; they are writers who are repetitive, obsessive, and impolite, who impress by force\u2014not simply by their tone of personal authority and by their intellectual ardor, but by the sense of acute personal and intellectual extremity. The bigots, the hysterics, the destroyers of the self\u2014these are the writers who bear witness to the fearful polite time in which we live. Mostly it is a matter of tone: it is hardly possible to give credence to ideas uttered in the impersonal tones of sanity. There are certain eras which are too complex, too deafened by contradictory historical and intellectual experiences, to hear the voice of sanity. Sanity becomes compromise, evasion, a lie. Ours is an age which consciously pursues health, and yet only believes in the reality of sickness. The truths we respect are those born of affliction. We measure truth in terms of the cost to the writer in suffering\u2014rather than by the standard of an objective truth to which a writer\u2019s words correspond. Each of our truths must have a martyr. (Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation)\"\\n\\n\r\nWell okay then what's that gotta do with White Album 2?\\n\\n\r\n\"Many books promoted as vehicles of a \u201cdark vision\u201d finish up by lounging in a warm bath of affirmation, often doing a traitorous turnabout in their closing pages or paragraphs.2 As every author, publisher, and carnival owner knows, lurid billing gets a patron in the door. And so we have innumerable books and magazine articles with such inquiring titles as The Misadventure of Consciousness: Are Human Beings a Mistake of Evolution? or \u201cShould We Stop Having Children?\u201d The answer is always \u201cNo,\u201d sometimes resounding in its declamation but more often qualified, which is even more vile. Searchers after bleakness would do well, then, to begin at the ending of books and magazine articles with doomful titles or angst-fraught openings if they are not to be chiseled by a bait-and-switch maneuver.\" (The Conspiracy Against the Human Race)\\n\\n\r\nPessimism, as defined by Ligotti, is the belief that behind all the normal things of humanity, all our daily struggles and feelings, is monstrosity. If we take a Freudian viewpoint to romance then its less about pure feelings but more about uncontrollable drives. Whatever it is that moves us is horrific and we are constantly teetering on the edge of realizing this and falling into madness or decay. Likewise behind all the high-school nostalgia of White Album 2, behind the romantic tones of the orange evening and the light strum of the guitar, is poison. White Album 2 is relentless in its pursuit of a horrible metaphysical truth. It needed no Lovecraftian monstrosity or Ligottian nightmare to prove this but all it needed was to simply display a tight tapestry of destructive human desires and insecurities. It drags things to their eventual dark conclusions in a way that Ligotti would love (well then again Ligotti is a guy who likes Symbolist Gothic stuff and would probably not even raise a finger to touch slice of life anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about White Album 2 is that somewhere deep inside there it can be described as Ligottian, Schopenhauerian, Beckettian, or Kafkaesque but its touch is so subtle that there's hardly a linger of any such undertones. The dialogue is Absurdist in the way language is specifically used to weave elaborate labyrinths of meaning. Setsuna's talk about maintaining the status quo and remembering the school festival is a miniature version of Pinter's constant question dodging and silence in Betrayal. Haruki's heroism seems driven more by some dark puppeteer of insecure desire than anything else until he finally realizes what he wants and breaks down. A good work of art (like Evangelion and Kyousogiga) is when the microcosm is equivalent the macrocosm, which is why Evangelion is the travails of adolescence driven up to an apocalyptic level while Kyousogiga is the hardships of family pushed up to the realm of divinity. White Album 2 is fitting a complete pessimism into a slice of life narrative. It never deviates from its atmosphere the same way NANA or Clannad does (NANA with its mini Shojo comedic moments and Clannad with its light-hearted first arcs. WA2's comedy never causes a shift in its nature because it still is set in the realm of the illusion of high school nostalgia). It feels cohesive and constant in its vision.\\n\\n\r\nPostnote: This idea of formal unity has its roots in the Ancient Greek poetics, especially with Aristotle's unities. Generally the ancient genres were established in order to give poets a framework to work in so that they could focus on the formal content rather than spend time on deriving a complicated and subversive structure. As seen with Shakespeare's problem plays, having a disunity of atmosphere may work, but it can also be extremely jarring. Even though Hamlet is narratively experimental, with plays inside plays and supernatural elements, even in its most comedic moments, especially during the grave digger scene or Hamlet's bouts of madness, it never forgets that its about Death and the existential worry and insignificance attached to human life. White Album 2 never forgets that its a story about the perils of raising a naive ideal above a certain threshold of reality to the point that it becomes a dangerous game of betrayal to maintain the visage of the ideal. Kyousogiga never forgets that its about the awkward development of a group of people into the constructed instituition of Family. Evangelion never forgets that its about miscommunication the ability for humans to hurt each other due to being unable to communicate each others personal realities to one another. I could go on with this all day. Kara no Kyoukai never forgets that its a Buddhist Noir that raises questions about the nature of Time, Identity and Reality in the way Buddhism always likes to do. Madoka Magica never forgets that its a Goethian Fairy-tale dream. 5cm Per Second takes the nostalgic romantic high school perspective, where everything is about love and grasping, to the pinnacle of beauty. Toradora is always about the inconstant light fluttering of the human heart. Whatever it is when a work is grounded into some perspective, dreamview or worldview it always feels more meaningful and whole than when it attaches itself to a plethora of techniques and genre tropes to try to string together a story.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free (kept as minimal as possible) to ensure that it helps anime-fans to decide whether or not to watch this anime or not.\r\nFirst of all, this is almost completely different than White Album 1. If you have never watched White Album 1 or is discouraged to watch White Album 2 because of all the criticism towards White Album 1 then forget all that and jump straight into White Album 2. That's what i did; i have never watched White Album 1. The only reference from White Album 1 would be the song, \"White Album.\"\r\nWhite Album 2 can be described as, beautiful.It is a tear jerking anime that leaves you with pain in your chest. That's how good of an anime this is.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8):\\n\r\n     A student with a bright future picks up a guitar and continues playing it despite how horrible he is at it. This deepens his relationship with a delinquent who's a genius musician. This also leads to an encounter with the school idol who has a beautiful voice. Dreams sprout but the drama within the love triangle causes all sorts of pain between the characters and even the people watching the anime. It is a simple story that goes by very fast because of how it is limited to 13 episodes but it would not have made it any better if this was dragged on into a 24 episode series. It is perfect as is even though i did not rate it as a 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10):\\n\r\n     The anime is just beautiful. The art style, scenery, characters, everything. The only words or word that i can come up with to describe the art is the word \"beautiful.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\n     This is an anime focused on music. Normally i wouldn't bother writing anything about the sound. The music they've used for this anime matches the emotions that are in the atmosphere. The music that the three play is soothing and easy to listen to. The seiyuu's voices match their characters. What amazes me even more is that usually when a character sings in an anime, the voice sounds different than their usual voice but it's not the case for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6fPKWWiFIM\\n\r\nHere is a 4 min youtube video that gives a good sample of the art and the music.\\n\r\n\"White Album\" by Setsuna Ogiso (one of the female leads)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9):\\n\r\n     The two heroines are easily likeable. It's hard to decide which one you want to \"win.\" There are times where you pick one but then something happens and it sways your decision. The MC is likeable too although people might disagree due to how he handled things and what happens near the end. That is if you do not put any thought into why he did what he did. If people think about what choices he had and everything, the MC can be forgiven or at least not hated. There are only a few supporting characters and they were pretty much unimportant until near the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (x):\\n\r\n     I did not rate the enjoyment of this anime. Like i said, this anime is beautiful but tear-jerking and even painful to watch. It's hard to enjoy feeling the pain of the \"feels\" of the anime but that's what makes this anime so good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\n     One of the most beautiful animes I've seen. The combination of the art and sound flows well with the story and sways your emotions. The love triangle is hard to handle due to the circumstances of the bond between the three. The only spoiler that i believe is okay to tell you all is that throughout the anime, many viewers have the feeling of \"School Days\". I totally agree that i had the \"School Days\" feeling throughout the whole anime but don't worry it is not like School Days. It is just heart retching, that's all.",

            "content": "White Album 2. What can one say about White Album 2. Well, it is obviously one of the most underrated series I have seen in a while. Going into this series, I had no idea what to expect. I should make it clear that i have not seen the original White Album series, so I didn't really care much when it was announced that White Album 2 was going to be animated. Now what kind of anime is this? I will point out right now I have seen awesome, great however you want to describe it tear jerking animes such as Angel Beats, Clannad,AnoHana, etc., Being the cold person that i am, I did not shed a single tear, leading to my friends calling me a cold monster. After watching episode 1 of white album 2, i immediately got my hopes up of finally shedding a tear from watching anime.\\n\r\nThere is nothing special about the story. It is a typical school setting with a club about to be dispanded. Events occur and eventually, three best friends come together and a love triangle is formed as their friendship is tested by their love. What is special about this series is its pacing of the story. The first 5-6 episodes not only progresses the story further, but plays a great role in character development and makes each of the characters lovable and unique. More onto the characters later. The art and animations are good. The music used in the series immediately became my all-time favorite. The club the three friends are in the Light Music Club, so a lot like K-on, the group plays a series of songs, and like i mentioned earlier, the songs became one of my alltime favorites. I mentioned earlier about how the characters are good in the series. Well The male lead is Kitahara Haruki, a reliable and dependable student, whose, umm, not that good at the guitar. He practices every day with a mysterious student next door which happens to be Kazusa Touma a prodigy at music. One day, a beautiful voice by Setsuna Ogiso joins the group as the story goes on. I won't go into detail about the characters. You'll have to see it for yourself. The enjoyment, ahh yes. I have to say, this is one of the best drama romances i have seen yet( and ive seen a lot) With an average story, good art, great sound, awesome characters, and a unique form of enjoyment, I see it fair to give this anime a 9.     \\n",

            "content": "Love is such a difficult concept to grasp analytically. To a logical person, its very existence breeds chaos, confusion, and worst of all, addiction. Love compels, love pulls, love creates, love destroys - I would argue love is the most powerful human force. White Album 2 ignores the typical Hollywood-esque bland high school romances and sets in motion the most feels I've had in recent memory. \r\nThis won't be like my typical reviews, in that I break down each and every category. I'm just going to pour my heart out by saying, if you want to feel something move inside you, watch this beautiful anime.There are some cheeky, corny moments, as well as a few archetypal and stereotypical characters, but once the story gets rollin' (oh, it goes by so fast) you soon forget. \\n\\n\r\nThough i can't personally relate to any of the characters, the way the story progressed made them see so real. Cartoon references aside, I felt each and every character's sharp emotional responses, and since the story is set in senior year of high school (not too long ago from my own life) and the finality of it all, it helps solidify a very personal view of each character. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising theme is the music. I enjoyed the songs, the piano, everything was well written and well put together. The background music, the songs, the opening...everything just screamed well done. \\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't convinced you already, please just watch it. 13 episodes, you can finish it in a day or two if you have nothing better to do, especially in the summer. \\n\\n\r\nIt was an emotional rollercoaster I normally would refuse to ride. But it's a ride I'll never forget. Haruki, Sestuna and Touma. Names that'll stick with me, forever. Look, it's snowing outside.",

Well i thought what i fear the most was being cheated... But i never had a relationship or love that is so strong that would totally tear me apart if i lose my loved one. In this show, love between characters are so strong that you can feel it as if its your love which is being torn apart.\r\nStory: 10/10 (*Slight spoilers for this section*)\r\nEvery human in this planet, i do think feels incomplete. They search for thingsthat they can complete them, maybe that's a nice suit, maybe that's cars, maybe it's so small like a flower, maybe it is love... In this show love is told in an abstract way, like it should. Feelings we have for people should be abstract, it should not be straightforward or else that would be only liking... Real love is complex, real love finds its way, real love does hurt, real love has obstacles, real love is understanding even if you don't, real love is hope, real love is sorrow... this show has real love. I think guitar playing which is accompanied by piano is a really good example for that, real love just sticks together without any plan or without any form of thinking in mind.\\n\\n\r\n*Big Spoiler Here*\\n\r\nI get really really sad when piano sounds from music room 2 has stopped. It broke my heart so much, it didn't feel good at all... Like my love is the one being torn apart.\\n\r\n*End of epic spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not a good judge of art, but if art is conveying feelings, then this one does it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSound plays a really big role in this anime. Voice actors i think did a great job but i don't think original soundtrack of this anime was that catching. I have heard some epic soundtrack of final fantasy series and animes like Clannad's before so i can't really give it a 10 in this area, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (*Slight spoilers for this section*)\\n\r\nI have to say, i hate people that cheat. I really hate people that cheat but i kinda felt sad for all of the main characters of this show. I knew they all did bad things, they all had bad thoughts and they all were so selfish that i wanted to smack them in face... but at the same time i feel pretty bad for all of them and wished best for all of them through the end of the show. Characters have some special aura between them that they stick together pretty well; like that complicated puzzle of yours, you cant see the small pieces when you look at it from afar. Each character was as realistic as possible, they had their own thoughts and motivations but they don't show those straightly as real humans do. You have to guess their inner motivations, as it is in real life...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\r\nThis part will be interesting for some because it is so low compared to other sections. I do believe episodes of 2-3-4-5-6-8 were not necessary and had slow pace compared to other part of the series. Last 3 episodes were absolutely striking in terms of enjoyment and other episodes from the ones mentioned above was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNow i have to write things here, i usually am pretty logical guy when it comes to decisions and by logic i can say this anime deserves 8.5 overall score. But my feelings would give it 10/10 if i was deciding anime ratings with my feelings. This time i will make a special treatment for the series since i feel its the most realistic anime that i have watched in terms of emotions so i will rate it with only my emotions in mind.\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10.",

            "content": "There are many things I can say about White Album 2, but I think in fairness just a direct approach. This anime is delicate perfection. Everything flowed nicely, and stayed empowered right to the end. Thankfully White Album 2 did not suffer from '13 episode syndrome' as I like to call it. We as viewers were treated to something magical with this. Nothing was left to short, as well nothing was overdrawn. The progression of the Story, the Artistic feel, the Sounds, the Character development and perseverance and the overall Enjoyment.\r\nTo touch on the Story a bit more. Firstly I love how they handled adelicate aspect of a mature love triangle and didn't give it any gimmicks. Kept it strong and flowing from the start to the end. Along with the maturity of the Anime itself, didn't seem too corny, it all fell into perfect harmony. Secondly I really enjoyed that there was no letting up on the throttle. We didn't start running, we got to build up to it. There was no slowing down. The way the Story was handled did nothing but wonders for the Enjoyment I received from WA2, every minute of it I will cherish.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate on the Art and Sound from this Anime. Well let's get the fact that music plays a large part into the plot, it wasn't too in your face. The Sounds and music we got treated to were nice. We didn't get that over used sound byte(s) that I've seen far too much. As well the songs were all perfectly executed. The main stick out from the OST in WA2 was it's OP. For the Artistic views. Well it was simple in design, but dynamic in effect. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally my favorite asset of WA2 was the Characters. The way each Character was introduced. The way the three main characters were further developed, and the back story of Kazusa affection towards Haruki. The design of each Character was nice as well, the design seemed to fit with the personality we were given. I was able to connect with the three main characters, I felt as if I was in the shoes of all three.\\n\\n",

            "content": "White Album 2 is an odd show before the viewer even takes the first step into it. The title alone would give most people pause; White Album 2? What of White Album 1? Well, it would appear (correctly) that White Album 1 is not needed to watch this show. It takes place about 10 years after White Album 1 with a whole different set of characters; the protagonists of WA 1 are only referred to in passing, when they are credited with song names. The songs actually serve more purpose than the characters who originally sang them do. \r\nI heard the stories and the murmursof those who were saying back in 2013 that this was the greatest anime drama ever produced. I try and keep my hype and expectations low for such things, having been disappointed by far too many shows in the past. But being a sucker for romance and drama I couldn't pass this up. So I sat down on a Sunday and watched all 13 episodes to understand what I was missing. And I sure as hell was missing a LOT. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nSo where do we start? At the beginning? Sure. From the very beginning of the show it almost looks to be nothing special. What, just another band anime where someone is trying to make their \"dreams\" come true? Boring. Seen it a thousand times. NEXT. But no, it teases you. Sucks you in with the concert at the beginning and then the flashback to how it started. The dream has been realized, but you don't know how or why. I give credit to Satelight for making a premise that has been tried time and again and making something fresh out of it. I have to say though, some of the story did tend to trend towards odd decisions made by characters that were most likely left out of the VN due to time constraints. Unfortunately it makes for a less than perfect story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for how the whole story goes up until that concert at the beginning is a different story. The only spoiler you could find is that it is indeed a romance so yes, there will be romance in between here and there. And yes it is a drama so there will be drama, etc. etc. It's impossible to tell you how the story is without you having watched it. It's something words can't convey, it's \"you had to be there\". It's wonderful and it's dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nTalk about a beautiful show. Whether it be looking out on a crowd, a snowy mountain, or a simple still shot from the top of the school, the imagery and camera angles do wonder to tell the story. Some scenes look almost movie quality and the characters are all very pretty. And the HAIR seems to be quite the focus. Flipping, twirling, falling down naturally, it is definitely something the animators spent a lot of time on.\\n\\n\r\nMy only small criticism with the art is probably more of a criticism of the original artistic choices. You're always reminded that you're indeed watching an anime due to the somewhat odd physics of some characters' hair. It doesn't seem to fall naturally and I'm not sure how many naturally orange or green haired girls Japan has. Regardless this is as minor as minor can be, but something big enough to irk me.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nA music show with good sound. Who would have guessed. A fantastic use of vocal songs sung by the characters themselves combined with intense piano pieces and the oh so familiar \"song being sung while montage happens.\" This happens more than once in the show but it's a show about a band who is making music. Of course there's going to be an abundance of music; for a 13 episode show the OST in its entirety has about 60 tracks. Some J-pop, some piano, some background music.\\n\\n\r\nI can't find a criticism with the sound itself. Nothing sounded \"generic\" or boring. It was used perfectly to set the mood when it was needed and blended seamlessly with the show when there was the need for it. Never a silent moment. Plus, it fit the mood of the season. All is white during the Christmas season and there's that specific tone of music you just HAVE to have. And the show hits the nail on the head, time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nWe have three main characters who feel utterly real. The biggest fault is that the main character could be seen as one of those normal, generic, nice guy MCs but he's given enough personality that the viewers can actually care about him. He has his passions and his desires and his faults. He's not perfect but he's not a helpless little child. We have the good girl who is the school's sweethart, surprisingly shy given her status, with the beautiful voice. And we have the n'er-do-well anti-establishment bad girl who appears cold, distant, and cruel. \\n\\n\r\nBut even though you could shoehorn them all into a character archetype it wouldn't be fair to the characters who feel so utterly real. Their struggles and their emotions are all conveyed so well to the viewers that they appear as any teenager would - brash, foolish, full of hope for the world. And that's why I enjoyed them. I love those characters you can relate to with life experience. The struggles that feel REAL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a drama THIS is a drama. Nothing comes close in terms of quality. This should be the poster child for years to come about romance and drama and how the two of them blend together. There's no telling how each individual person will feel by the end of the show; of course, it's something each person has to experience for themselves. Anyone who has ever loved another person will understand these characters and what they're going through. Anyone who has ever been a TEENAGER will understand. \\n\\n\r\nThis show should absolutely be viewed by anyone who even has a passing interest in drama or romance. Say what you will about your tastes and what's interesting to you, but the show, the director, and all the staff who worked on it deserve praise in turning what could have EASILY been a generic visual novel adaptation into one of the mostly highly praised works of 2013.",

            "content": "Sometimes, words can't describe how much you love something, how much you've take pleasure in doing it, how much it's beautiful. I should keep silence now but I need to express myself, need to tell people why I can't understand this show is so underrated in comparison to Shitgatsu. \r\nI've watch White Album 2 in one day for two reasons. The first one is because I want to do it, that's a bit my chrismast gift ( I'm too poor to bought reals presents, see ? ). And the second reason is because I've enjoy it so much that my eyes can't unhook from thescreen. The second I've hear those three characters playing and singing together, I was totally charmed. \\n\r\nSo, enough talking about myself, let me tell why this, ladies and gentleman, is not a masterpiece but close to.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nWell, the story.\\n\r\nIt's a bit classical at the beginning but get really good in the second part.\\n\r\nBecause I've separated the anime in two parts, the before part and the after part. The \"before\" part is focusing on learning, training and mostly form relationship between the protagonist. I really love the way they met, It was outstanding. Well, I'm maybe getting a little excited now because It wasn't \"awesome\". In fact, It was almost boring, just like a generic school life start. But, over the clich\u00e9s, I've found my drug in the following events and then, It was really good. The main characters get to know them better, but in a really good atmosphere. They're practicing music, and that's all. There we are, why I love WA2 so much. The characters aren't doing some random shits to make some fan service, no, they are doing what they are working for, the high school fair and mainly them light music club. \\n\r\nThis part is good, really good but It can't beat the \"after\" part, who's happening after the concert ( Flash forward in the episode 1 and for real in episode 7 ).\\n\r\nWell, it's a psychological part and I don't know why, it's often compared to School Days. God, I'm gonna kill the first one who dare to say it. Yes, there is a love triangle, yes this is drama but no, it's not about killing and no, the male main character is not a dick like that Makoto faggot. fuu~\\n\r\nWell, I can't really tell you without spoiling so I'm gonna be clear.\\n\r\nThis is probably six of the best episode I've ever seen and I was enjoying it as hell. It's deep and not trying to be some soft romance, no, It bears with real thematics, being very harsh, maybe gritty by times. But well, it was great, all the ways to the ending. And let's talk about it, the ending. Well, It makes totally sense and in some way, It couldn't be otherwise. I wasn't frustrated, not happy too, just a bit sad.\\n\r\nSo yeah, the story is such rich in revelations, plot twist and entertaining dialogs. And god, the drama is good, it's good at a point I can't even define.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nAt the first thought, I was thinking of WA2 like some Kyo Anim or P.A Works production. But well, it's Satelight, a studio I wasn't knowing before. And so, I found the art legit. Yeah, it's correct for a 2013 anime, really. I kinda love the character design. The sceneries are beautiful, with a \"palette tr\u00e8s vive\" like we say in France. It means colorful, a pleasure to eyes. And so, the animation was very fluid even if, like it's a VN adaptation, it was more talking than moving. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nGod, that was gorgeous.\\n\r\nWhen, in the first episode, I got to hear the piano + guitar + voice version of White Album, I totally fell in love with and while I'm writing these lines, I'm still listening to. The OST in itself is not a masterpiece but just that god damn song is suffisiant to satisfy me. The opening is good, the endings are great, all of them. Well, for a music-related anime, bad music is impossible, don't you think ?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nKazusa Touma is my japanimation's favorite character, since her first appearance. Why ? Because I love her cold but thoughtful way to think, her honesty, her look and every single fiber from her body. Well, I'm maybe getting a bit creepy so .. AHEM. I truly love that character, that was a blessing to see her playing or just chatting with the others. She's bad at school but had a lot of qualities to erase her difficulties and stubborn mind. For the others, It wasn't super good but well, It wasn't bad at last. Haruki is a straight boy, who's lecturing others but with some reasons. He's not dishonest and always try to do the best for his friends or people in general. That guy is, I think, the perfect male protagonist for this type of anime, with love triangle. And ... then, I don't really like Setsuna. Not because of her choices in the late story but I don't really like her way to do act, nothing more.\\n\r\nBut hell, finally an anime who's focusing on the protagonists and not on a supporting useless casting. It was just perfect for that kind of anime, really.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement - 10\\n\r\nYeah, a 10. I've never give a ten to any anime. The overall is a 8 because the story wasn't perfect but If I could rate by enjoyment, It mostly would be a ten. I was in love with this anime and I can't even hear people who are praising jus average animes like Shigatsu who bet everything in tearjerker, not giving enough stake to the story. It's sad, very sad and that's why I love if people start looking animes by another way than rating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nWA2 is not perfect, WA2 is not a masterpiece but damn, WA2 is an excellent anime. I can recognize the defaults and yes, there's a lot of defaults in this anime but maybe less than others school-life musical stories. Yeah, you'll maybe dislike it because It's too slow to reach the climax or characters don't fit with the tastes of yours. But well, it's such a great anime at my eyes and I'm not gonna drop my opinion because of weebs legion. Coming for me, I'm defending my kingdom.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: With the school festival only a few weeks away and his light music club disbanded the armature guitarist Kitahara Haruki (Mizushima, Takahiro) seems to be out of luck until one day, while playing in the music room, a melodious voice coming from the roof of the school harmonizes with his instrument. Along with the enigmatic piano playing coming from the next music room over, the resulting song inspires Haruki to recruit Ogiso Setsuna (Yonezawa, Madoka) and Touma Kazusa (Nabatame, Hitomi) in order play at the upcoming festival as a newly reformed light music club.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nAs the showis a romantic drama I would normally say that the characters were the centerpiece of the show and that their characterization is what made the show what it is however I actually found that the story as well as the show\u2019s music elements made up a good deal of the show\u2019s strength as well and so while the characters were compelling they were not the sole strength of the show. The cast itself is fairly small \u2013 I might even argue too small in that, outside of the main trio of characters, the side characters seem to only appear at the show\u2019s convenience and are both low in number and lack any development throughout. That being said, they are not a negative influence on the show and the individual strength of the main characters more than makes up for the lackluster background cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kitahara Haruki, is an intellectual and one of the top students in his class as well as the former class president. He is kind in how he interacts with others and can be a bit intrusive in his attempts to get to know people however his intentions are good. While he is a good student he is only a mediocre guitar player having only picked up the instrument recently and his improvement with the instrument is a decent part of the first half of the show as the school festival approaches. His good qualities aside, his incompetence in the area of romance is in part responsible for some of the drama that arises in the show and is a generalization of some of the character flaws that he possesses that make him compelling as a romantic lead character. He thankfully avoids the stereotype of the thickheaded protagonist however he has shortcomings in this area none the less.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the two heroines of the show is Setsuna Ogiso who is, on the surface, a kind and cheerful person and having won the Miss Houhou content two years in a row she is treated as somewhat of a school idol. Ogiso herself is a bit more complex and her desire for close friends is perhaps one of the biggest driving forces within the plot as it complicates the relationship of the main trio in unique ways. She is the first of the two female members to join the light music club after Haruki discovers her on the roof of the school.\\n\\n\r\nThe second heroine is Touma Kazusa, a musical genius and the source of the piano playing from music room 2. She either skips or sleeps through the majority of her classes as her interests lie elsewhere however Haruki causes her to be more involved in her school life and interact with him and Ogiso. Like Ogiso she is kind however this trait is not immediately observable behind her tough appearance and her persistence and ruthlessness serves as the driving factor behind Haruki\u2019s improvement with the guitar as the school festival approaches.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to avoid character spoilers I am required to be vague in this category however I will say that the compelling nature of White Album\u2019s characters lies in their complications and missteps. The characters are very deliberately flawed in different ways and occasionally must choose between what is selfishly best for themselves and what is best for the person that they harbor affection for. The disparities in their actions and incomplete perceptions give form to their shortcomings as people and their character defects. Normally one might get angry at the thickheadedness of a character like Haruki or the flakiness of the heroines as, through the dramatic irony of the show, we can assess their own crude actions in a way they themselves cannot however White Album does a great job of providing the context for these missteps and decisions which I felt made them far more complex than aggravating in any way. The characters are free to be selfish \u2013 they are free to mess up and make mistakes and this freedom of character makes them feel alive within the plot and is probably the strongest attribute of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the city and school setting of White Album does not allow for much inventiveness in the art department it is executed at a perfectly acceptable level and there are no real quality drops throughout the course of the show. The character designs are fairly reserved which helped compliment the realistic nature of the show and grounded the characters in a more serious way than if they were more elaborate or flamboyant \u2013 their simplicity worked well within their dramatic setting. The animation was fluid and natural in its depiction. There wasn\u2019t anything in this category that wow\u2019d me in unexpected ways however the art does a fantastic job of executing the characters, emotion, and story and this way does it exactly what it needs to while avoiding any and all pitfalls.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most surprising things about White Album 2 was the structure and progression of its story and plot. Typically I am far more invested in the characters in a romantic drama than the story itself which usually serves as more of a framework and point of reference for the character interactions however White Album I felt utilized its story to it\u2019s full potential alongside a cast of good characters.\\n\\n\r\nI think the structure of the story contributes a good deal to it\u2019s success as the first half of the show, which focuses on the upcoming school festival and Haruki\u2019s guitar playing, is drastically different than the latter half. The first part of the show introduces us to the main characters and lays the groundwork for future drama and plot developments and is far more laid back than what follows. Things truly begin to unfold after the festival is over and the relationships of the three main characters become the central focus as we gain new insights and a retrospective appreciation for what has transpired thus far.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach worked well for the show and the flashback elements of the show worked well to give us a sort of contextual reveal that complicated the latter half of the show magnificently \u2013 This allowed me to appreciate the show in simple ways for what it was initially and then forced me to partially reevaluate what I had seen before delving into the far more dramatic section of the show. One final thing I will commend the show for was its avoidance of melodrama despite how serious its tone became \u2013 the drama felt legitimate and real instead of feeling trivial by real world standards and again the character flaws and complications complimented this aspect of the show tremendously. You never truly feel that any one character is in the right and from time to time they each act somewhat inappropriately which causes the viewer to reassess their opinion of them in an ever more complicated relationship.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the actual presence of music somewhat falls off in the second half of the show after the school festival is over it is still a large part of the show. The music the characters play in the show is good and the main recurring theme of \u2018White Album\u2019 was catchy enough to avoid getting old in my opinion. There is definitely emotional and sentimental work being done within the music of White Album and many of the pieces played as well as their lyrics offer additional commentary on the characters and their situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was additionally good however I found that it had a slightly problematic habit of using only a few go-to songs during certain dramatic moments that caused them to grow a little tired before the end of the show. The songs themselves are powerful as emotional background however their repeated and predictable usage grew a little old at times. None the less, the music works hand in hand with the drama on screen to bring forth a genuine feeling of emotion and its presence is nothing if not beneficial.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nWhite Album surprised me in a variety of ways and I ended up liking it more than I thought I would after the slightly less involved first half of the show (that is by no means bad). It wasn\u2019t afraid to explore the relationships of the characters even after the vocalization of the character\u2019s feelings which some shows tend to act more coyly around. The serious tone and melancholic attitude of the show pushed it into a more appreciable place for me as a viewer and I was most happy with how it developed the characters in reasonable ways while avoiding melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nI gave White Album a 8 because of the numerous strengths of its characters and story and I don\u2019t think it could be called anything less than \u2018good\u2019. What stops it from rising any higher I don\u2019t feel is any fault of the show but more simply personal preferences and the unfortunate shortness of the show itself \u2013 The story felt comfortable in its 13-episode run and ended in a conclusive manner however because of how it ended as well as the lengthy nature of its source material I feel that the story could only benefit from additional content and development. Any great fan of the romantic drama genre I\u2019m sure would fall in love with this show and perhaps grant it a higher score than 8 however I would consider this grade high praise.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 was most certainly worth the watch and its concise format makes it easily digestible in an afternoon or two. The show excelled quite predicatively in the areas of its romance and drama and so I would most primarily recommend the show for these reasons above all else. While the characters don\u2019t quite exhibit complexity in the more classical sense of the word they do ultimately come off as being so and so any viewers interested in this character trait would do fine to pick up the show. Lastly, while the show has a decent amount of slice of life style episodes at the beginning, it is almost entirely devoid of comedy and so I would caution anyone who picks up these kinda of shows anticipating the infrequent gag or comedic bit as White Album takes itself fairly seriously throughout and doesn\u2019t really have any comedic traits about it.",

Story is very realistic and little bit complex. But it's story is full of amazing climaxes.\r\nfor those who have watched it.\r\n[spoiler]\r\nFor me ending is 180 degree out of phase. I expected other couple to be together.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\nSound:\r\nThe only thing that stopped me from making this anime in top 5 is its lack of OST. Thought it is music oriented and its music are all good but still when there was emotional climax.\r\nfor those who have watched it.\r\n[spoiler]\r\nClannad andwhite album 2 has same emotional strength. In clannad due to OST my tears were on auto. But for this I had to cry because I wanted to cry.\\n\r\n[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters are very realistic and character development is very good. \\n\r\nWhat happens if two girls who are friends with each other fall in love with same guy.\\n\r\nExactly this thing happen what White Album 2 showed. Too realistic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI will give it 10/10. Best love triangle that I have seen so far.",

I went through joy and pain while watching this and I shed my very first tears just watching this. (Maybe because it reminded me of my first love)\r\nWell yeah. Story? Simply said, a love triangle between a boy, who just in his nature itself is kind and friendly to others, and two girls, Setsuna and Toumou. Consequences? Girls fall in love with him. I personally disliked how the MC dealt with this problem, butI suppose that's what made this extremely good.\\n\\n\r\nAs a viewer you'll be able to grab out some hints on how the plot will develop, but I personally loved how they displayed the show not only in one perspective, but in two somewhere in two episodes when the series came near to the end.\\n\r\nToumou's behind story was phenomenal in my opinion and you could just see why she just had to fall for him.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this was my first review and I hope it'll help some of you get into this series and go through the same experience that I did. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 for me.",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nOver the years, anime's romance genre has been oversaturated with mislabeled shows featuring over exaggerated breasts and fanservice. Thankfully White Album 2 (WA2 for short), does not join the countless series in its genre, whose plot revolves around useless plot devices, excessive fanservice, and little to no character development. White Album 2 is an excellently told romantic drama that isn't afraid to stab you right in the emotions and then twist the knife just to be sure.\r\nThe Story:\r\nWhite Album 2 revolves around three separate individuals whose lives, by the cruel string of fate, meet one Fall afternoon. Two anharmonic sounds - a sad piano anda lonely guitar, are brought together by one angelic voice, singing on top of the school roof. The three soon decide to make a band, and as the story progresses, form a deep friendship, which eventually turns into a love triangle by the middle of the story. Unlike other shows in its genre, who put love above friendship, White Album 2 outshines its peers by showing a more realistic view. In WA2, the level of importance of the two heroine's friendship is on the same level of importance as the romance each one of them desires with Haruki.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the story, each of the characters are generically portrayed. The school idol, tsundere, and plain protagonist are all cliche character archetypes abused in countless of comedies/harems. As the story progresses, and the characters develop, we see that they are not as perfect as they seem. Each character has their own flaws and weaknesses, and they do downright terrible things to each other throughout the course of the show. But it is because of these flaws and weaknesses that these characters can be best described as human. It is through this humanity that the viewer feels for the characters, and knows just how much they want to be with each other. We come to realize that they all have the best of intentions, but they let their feelings rule over logic, which is a surefire recipe for disaster. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Music:\\n\r\nAs expected of an anime whose core focus is the music, the art and music overall is top-notch. The character designs are pleasing to look at, the backgrounds are detailed, and the color palette of the show fits perfectly with its theme. There are no complaints for this section.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nBrilliantly told and flawlessly executed, White Album 2 is a show that all future adaptations should strive for. It has a simple premise, yet it delves much deeper than that. It is a show that will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. The emotions that it will leave in your heart will linger there long after the final credits of episode 24 roll past. It is a show that will leave you thinking and at the edge of your seat. A truly unpredictable emotional rollercoaster that will capture your heart from its very first scene, and leave you scarred and longing for more at its last.\\n",

            "content": "Interpersonal relationships have and will always have some sort of difficulty. Depending on the person, these relationships (wether romantic ones or not) will be hard at certain points of it. Some will have trouble engaging and starting one, others will have a hard time facing and overcoming certain things, and well, others will even go through tough times making the decision to end these relationships. It is indeed a very difficult thing, and you can see people's \"flaws\" and acting irrationally when these things happen. The \"right\" decision is always easy to see on paper, but acting accordingly is harder than you ever thought.\r\nWelcome toWhite Album 2, a romantic drama that focuses heavily on human romantic relationships, and accepting and embracing our own flaws in order to go on and grow up in an emotional and empathic way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a high school guy who's trying hard to recruit new members into his music club, as the former members suddenly abandoned him, apparently because the lack of ambition and goals. Just about dropping his motivations completely, he starts roaming around the school, only to find two enormously talented and beautiful girls, who inspire him and give him back his hype, wanting to go all in for the music festival.\\n\\n\r\nThe story will find its course by showing you how they start spending a lot of time with each other, trying hard to give their best into the festival working together. And of course, creating close bonds.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot finds its peak when we can celarly see the characters true colors, having hard times making decisions that are written in their own morals, but are extremely hard to execute, as they would severely hurt their own happiness and desires. And this is, in my opinion, the strongest point in WA 2. It shows you clearly the kind of people we can be when our own desires are in danger, and deep inside we are all selfish at some point. The emotions are very relatable and you get to care for the characters, even when they do what they do.\\n\\n\r\nI usually enjoy anime's that have this \"dark\" atmosphere and emotional tension a lot. And the struggle that you see in the characters was something we have all been through. I suggets you to watch this if you enjoy some realistic drama and relantionships (not character) development.",

The Tsundere girl - the pop idol and of course the timid, ignorant male protagonist. But it's not... Kind of.\r\nWhile yes, there are those standard character tropes there on the surface of the White Album 2, the characters are so much deeper and brilliantly developed than they seem. The scenes containing the main trio are captivating, yet still believable. No character is perfect yet I feel that the chemistry between Haruki, Setsuna and Kazusa is as close to it asyou can find.\\n\\n\r\nOne note I must make about this is the music. Now I'm aware that it is based as a [music club] which brings certain expectations to the table but i was well impressed by the score. Normally i'm not one to criticise the sound of a show because it simply passes over my head, but the songs in this show really set the stage for some of the most sentimental final episodes that i have ever watched.\\n\\n",

            "content": "One thing about anime adapted from a VN, they usually tend to be one sided to just one character and leave the other side characters to just be there. This would then give rise to an imbalance to the overall character development.\r\nBut White Album 2 (WA2) is a totally different thing. \r\nWhen I watched WA2. my first impression would be, 'it must be just like any other VN adaptation where there will be one winner'. but certainly that was proven wrong during the last episode. There were no winners, only three people who were broken.\r\nThe story itself is about Kitahara Haruki, Touma Kazusa and OgisoSetsuna. Haruki, the main male lead was just a decent guitar player. Had always been the second guitarist. When the school festival was just around the corner, plus with the members pulling out from his club, he was on the verge pulling his club out of the festival itself. For him that time, nothing else mattered to him. Only practicing his guitar. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough practising alone, someone from the music room 2 always accompanied her, which is Kazusa. But he didn't know that. When these two were playing, Setsuna heard them and started singing along with it. And this was the start of the story.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first moment of the anime, it had stated, the happiest moment was halfway of the story. Which is in fact true.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters showed almost realistic emotion in each situation. And for me, the one character that developed the most, was Setsuna. Yes she was the school idol and people would die to be her boyfriend. Haruki managed to get her. As an anime character, she was actually very realistic in the way she talked to Haruki and all.  But then again, everything is not what it seems.\\n\\n\r\nKazusa is basically an anti-social girl who just wants to play piano. At first you would definitely think that she won't get Haruki. because not much was shown about her, but you know that there are more to it because how she acted and talked with Haruki felt more comfortable. You can feel that Haruki was more comfortable with Kazusa.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you would never had guessed which one will be the main girl. You don't even know. But the anime itself made you feel Haruki's choice. And why he chose that person. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a certain episode, you would then see how little things could give you a huge impact, like they said, the little things matter the most. and you would start asking yourself, is she the one? \\n\\n\r\nThis anime explores the depth of ones friendship and ones desire. How three friends who seemingly formed a love triangle with friendship on the line. And how evil can a person become when they are being selfish. All of this aspects were introduced in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as the result of that, everything crumbles to tiny pieces and can't be fixed. The beautiful friendship, now lost. For an anime adapted from a VN, this particular ending is very unique, and the fact that they managed to pull it off and the emotions made it through to the audience. It was brilliant. I could never ask for anything more that that. \\n\\n\r\nThe music accompanying each scenes were executed perfectly and hit on the spot with the emotions. Even the H-scene was actually for me very emotional. They knew they can't be together forever, but for just one night, please let them be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, from episode 1 till 13 build up consistently. Towards the end, i can only say that the episodes were all solid episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love watching romance, and is trying to find something different, you can try watching WA2. If you are a Key fan, you should try this because i think, WA2 is on par with some Key animes. Sometimes, in life, not everything will go according to plan. and that was what the anime tried to convey. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it is true.",

Where this story shines is in the development of the events that follows post confession. I will not say more than that about what happens. \r\nComing from someone who, excluding the musical talent, have been in this exact situation and first hand experienced about the exact same outcome as in this series. I really need to emphashize the realismof the direction of which the story travels.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art. The lighting was increadible and the color palette changes beautifully to match the mood of scenes. Even if noses have a slight tendency to vanish at certain angles like in most anime, facial expressions are at a really high level in this anime. My only complaint about the animation lies with the handling of instruments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe op and end is great. The actual songs performed are increadibly solid(10/10). The underlaying soundtrack is also superb, BUT it's not as varied as I would like, mostly piano. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLike previously stated the realism in this story is remarkable. That also goes for the characters. They all want to be happy, but they don't want to hurt others. They are kind and selfish. They make mistakes and try to make them right. I loved the characters and wanted them all to be happy. An amazing feat in a mere 13 episodes. What makes these characters stand out from alot of other romance anime I've seen is that their features are not over cooked. We don't have the super tsundere and stupidly shy female characters. And our MC doesn't get flustered at the sight of a female knee. They all have a mix of traits that you should easily recognize from real life.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen people brand some of the characters choises as too drastic for real life. But I can tell you from experience, they are frightenly realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nI had to watch all episodes straight after I passed episode 3. Related to characters and situations. Fell in love with the characters. And loved the show. \\n\\n\r\nI know there is no 11/10, but I want to point out that my personal experiences was not the reason for the 10/10. I would in all likelyhood have given this show 10/10 without them. Therefore, I added my experiences on top of that for a solid 11/10 because the show hit home as much as it did.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the show, look for the little things and allow yourself to be put in their positions.",

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERS   Follow the story of a generic black haired \"nice guy\" Haruki Kitahara as he combats his first world problems of his love triangle. Which consist of Setsuna Ogiso yet again a generic character who is overly excited and annoyingly clingy who constantly reminding her friends not to leave her behind this type of character is probably found in any romance/slice of life and then there is Kazusa Touma who is also very dull, she's a refined black haired girl who hides her emotions through irrational verbal and violent actions. Seriously with only this piece of information i'm sure you've already figuredout the just of this story. \\n\\n\r\nAll three of them have a passion for music at their school and they take part in the school fair as a band which strengthened their already decaying bond. As I mentioned you'd expect drama to form around this problematic trio and of course it does as one of the girls makes a move on the simple minded,sluggish teenage boy who doesn't look into the logic of this relationship and the next day it's announced that they are dating which no surprise there disturbs the third wheel.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I told you from above this story is another love triangle story filled with predictable betrayals and tarnished relationships, that makes it extremely boring and overused. The least they could've done was end it with actual originality like them being  angry at each other or you know they grow up and fix this.. I really could careless if this ends in a tragedy as I don't have any actual reason to want any of these characters to stay together.\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nLooks great...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if I've been bashing these characters they seem to acknowledge their problems and seem to want to repair them, you can see that they are emotionally in pain. Yet they seemed time and time again betraying each others because Haruki Kitahara can't seem to have any self-control over himself as if it's cocaine and that was what made me even write this poorly structured review because all of this situation could've been avoided if he made the right decisions, he obviously had feelings for one of the girls more then the other yet he's so thick he doesn't think before he makes his move. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI expected this from this anime being affiliated with music but I really enjoyed when they went on stage and sang those songs because, I really liked white album.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION \\n\\n\r\nI personally didn't have a good experience watching this besides laughing at the predictable plot and mentality of these pathetic characters and how they deal with there first world problems. And I'll solve their love triangle problem right now to show how stupid this is. Setsuna Ogiso who made the first move felt in competition with Kazusa Touma so she quickly made a move on the thick boy so that he would fall for her and eventually date yet, we knew that Haruki Kitahara prefered Kazusa Touma and had more of a connection with her and Setsuna even knows that those two are better off together so, to solve this problem Kitahara gets with Kazusa they be happy together and enjoy there mediocre life, Setsuna shouldn't be too crushed as her ultimate goal was to keep the three of them close so she should settle for that and since she is more popular then Kazusa she should easily fine someone else (Hopefully Smarter and less of a cheater) and then Kazusa wouldn't leave the country as she would have a future in Japan. I might get hate because of how popular this anime is and it's regarded highly so I'm putting a safety net on myself here : If you liked this anime that's completely fine as a fast paced romance isn't too bad once in a while and your personal enjoyment is really all that matters not the opinion of someone else, but I felt like sharing my opinion for those that are open to the fact that this anime could be uninteresting to others eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10",

Pretty early on, you notice that both female protagonists have (or develop) feelings for the main protagonist, yet there's no real telling what will happen relationship-wise. What makes it even harder is that all three of them really are likeable. It doesn't try to build up drama by having an obvious coupling and some people just trying to break them apart. No matter what the outcome will be, at least one of them will be heartbroken in the end. \r\nThe ending for me was really saddening, and definitely not what I would'veexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThere's kisses, romance, hugs, a sex-scene, but also betrayal, heartache and a lot of tears.",

            "content": "\"We finally became friends. I've said everything I wanted to say. Now we know everything about each other. Though, from the moment we become friends, we'll never speak to each other again\" - Touma Kazusa \r\nI was quite skeptical going into this show because of the fact that music anime is not my strong suit as well as the fact that the first season of this show left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite the first season lacking key elements that made it a grind for me to watch this does not hinder the fact that White Album 2 was quite enjoyable even moreso than I expected it to be. I love when any sequel to any anime can raise the bar from it predecessor and White Album 2 did just that with a completely different story only carrying over music that was used in the first season as a starting point and is the only connection that it makes to the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does White Album 2 bring elements to an anime that I enjoy as a viewer. It captivated me with the heart-wrenching drama it portrayed throughout the show, it made me sympathize with the characters I enjoyed and rooted for, and it taught me the value of friendships.... And how fragile they truly are..... \\n\\n\r\nStory: White Album 2 takes place in a traditional high school setting which is what I prefer in anime when realism, drama, and romance are what drive the story. We take the place of Haruki Kitahara who is part of the slowing dissipating club known as the \"Light Music Club\" and his dreams to someday play in the upcoming school festival. With his friends Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna by his side the story then unfolds as they together as a group must practice towards Kitahara's dream of playing in the the school festival through each of their own unique talents and skills. Let me admit this now so I can get this off my chest. Yes. It is a love triangle and with most love triangles things can seem quite predictable especially if you watch anime of this nature as is my favorite type of anime to watch on a regular basis; however, this doesn't mask the fact that this is a remarkable show for it seriousness and dark dramatic moments truly compensate for the traditional \"generic\" guidelines that this show has to follow. What I enjoyed most about this anime is sheer drama this show illustrates through these so called \"friendships\" the three of these characters share together. Selfishness, Betrayal, Love, and Friendship are the 4 main words I can use to describe this show and it does not disappoint those who want a good drama. We all know that when a love triangle is involved someone is bound to get hurt especially if someone breaks that triangle which is the fundamental reason why relationships stay in the friend zone all so that no ones feelings are hurt or left out. This show incorporates this ideal and blows it up \"dramatically\"... Literally..... And is part of the reason why I enjoyed this anime so much. I love any anime that has genuine realism to it because it makes me ponder if \"This could actually happen?\" even though I know it's an anime which is why White Album 2 has such a compelling story from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: White Album 2 has 3 main characters that drive the show these characters being Haruki Kitahara who is our main male protagonist along with Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna who are our 2 female leads. Let's start with Haruki Kitahara, Kitahara overall is a genuine young man who cares for his friends and wants nothing but the best for them. Kitahara tries his hardest weather it be practicing guitar or helping someone out and this is what makes Kitahara a perfect target for someone to fall in love with. Next we have Touma (who is my personal favorite of the show) and she can be described in one word and that word is cold. Touma literally does nothing but sleep during class and after it all she does is practice on the piano (which she is really really good at) when she has time. She can be very pragmatic at times and other times she can be sincere and down to earth depending on her mood or if something is bothering her which is usually Kitahara and Ogiso most of the time. Lastly we have Ogiso Setsuna who can be described as our \"Genki\" character of the show. She just radiates sunshine and smiles and is often called a \"beauty\" in the eyes of most fellow classmates and to go even further she has a beautiful  singing voice which is what drew in Kitahara to find her on top of the roof. These 3 characters are vital in the  development of the show and each build off each other which in the ends leads to a powerful dramatic collapse in the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The overall art of the show is... Great. It's simply great. Satelight productions did a great job producing this show just as they did with Aquarion and other various anime projects. The whole winter theme greatly enhances the drama because of the fact that it is cold, dark, and enduring and colors were on point not being way to colorful or bright to let the atmosphere of the show sink in for the viewers. Now let's talk about the sound, I'm going to try my hardest not to be biased towards sound just because it is a music anime but sound was outstanding and I just love the fact that they borrowed soundtracks from the \"White Album\" to use in \"White Album 2\" . The OST that I found simply amazing was called \"Silent Winter Night\" it was played just at the right times throughout the show and it it evoked a feeling every time it played. To this day when I hear \"Silent Winter Night\" I get goosebumps and it transports me back to those moments when the dramatic moments played synchronized perfectly with the song. Now let's talk about Openings and Endings, the opening to this show.... I loved... and it set the correct mood for the journey you are about to embark on. The ending on the other hand.... I found forgetful and didn't really do much to enhance the show for me personally. In the end, you are going to get great sound and art from this show and expect to get \"The Feels\" once all is said and done.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 did a lot and has proven to me that drama can successfully blend with music to create a beautiful  show. It gave me an anime that was enjoyable from start to finish, an anime that left me pumped and excited for the school festival from the start and left me emotionally torn and teary eyed in the end. I can't express enough how much I love the drama in the show and how serous the show can be with its dark and romantic elements. After all is said and done \"White Album 2\" was an overall amazing show with my only complaint being how short it was.... I know the anime was adapted off a visual novel and stretching the show could cause problems but in the end..... \"White Album 2\" left me sad yet happy that such a show exist.",

            "content": "As powerful as love is in bringing two people closer, it is equally as powerful in tearing two people apart. \r\nAlthough this is a high school romance anime with the clich\u00e9 love triangle, White Album 2 takes a much more mature approach to this kind of story structure. The story revolves around our 3 main characters: Kitahara, the class representative, Ogiso, the school idol, and Touma, the outcasted piano genius. The first 7 episodes are told in a flashback format so episode one introduces an event that happens at the end of episode 7 and episodes 1-6 detail the events that lead up to thatscene. In the first 7 episodes, we follow Kitahara as he tries to get a band together in time for the cultural festival. These episodes mainly function to establish Kitahara's relationship with the two girls. There's not much drama that happens here. The real drama in White Album 2 begins in episode 8. From here on, this is where the story really stands out. Unlike other anime with love triangles where the romance is all lovey-dovey, White Album 2 paints romance in a very realistic light. It does not try to tell us that love always has a happy ending, or that people will just cry and move on. Love gets wild and White Album 2 is not afraid to tell us that. Further, the anime doesn't only showcase romantic love. Because they are in the same band, Ogiso and Touma become friends. However, they find themselves eyeing the same guy. Can they both love the same man without hurting each other? The power of love can really test a friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 has a very relatable cast. Although the anime has a relatively \"elite\" cast of members (a class president, a guy's dream girl, a piano prodigy, you can't get more ideal than that), they eventually become very down-to-earth, to put it crudely. In other words, their layers gradually get peeled off and in the center, their true desires are laid out for all to see. Kitahara has an outgoing and caring personality but he struggles with his feelings when he finds himself entangled in the love triangle. Ogiso has a pretty bubbly character who, as she admits, is selfish at times. Finally, Touma is very antisocial and as a result, has trouble expressing her feelings. As the characters develop, their human desires begin to surface and interestingly, the line between a fictional character and a real person began to blur. As the characters make their decisions, I began asking myself, would I have done anything different? \\n\\n\r\nIn the art department, White Album 2 does a really good job. The animators did slack off during the performance scenes as it was mostly stills and simple movements, but they made it up with their stellar scenery. The best aspects of the scenery is exemplified through the lighting and in particular, the rays of the sun (those scenes left quite a lasting impact on me). In retrospect, the lighting reminded me of JJ Abrams' lens flares (for those of you who are familiar with his work). The anime rests primarily on a mellow color palette, particularly any colour that goes well with the color of sunset.\\n\\n\r\nSince White Album 2 is primarily a music anime, the music has to shine and indeed, it did. The background music primarily consisted of strings and solo piano. Everything from the guitar rhythms to the piano solos were all beautifully composed. One standout song in the anime is called \"White Album.\" It has a really catchy rhythm and I find myself humming this song throughout my day.  The OP had a great blend of the upbeat guitar and the melancholic lyrics. It has become one of my favourite anime openings of all time.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 was definitely an enjoyable anime. It takes a fresh approach to the standard romantic models. From the typical love triangle to the general character archetypes, it is always great to see an anime once in a while that throws these models aside and develop a sincere and real story. It is unfortunate that this show doesn't get enough publicity. For example, I was unable to find this title listed in any top 10 romance shows. White Album 2's story, characters, complexity have all captured my heart. If you are a big romance fan, you need to add White Album 2 to complete your romance anime list. If you are just looking for a great, realistic, and psychological story, you should go pick up this show right now.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend White Album 2 to all anime viewers!\\n\\n\r\nDid this story speak to you in any way? If you want to discuss anything about this show, please drop me a comment! I would love to hear from you!!",

            "content": "If you want the heartfelt, warm romance anime that are typical of romance dramas nowadays, I suggest you stray from this one. Yet it is exactly those aspects of White Album 2 that makes it one of the best animes I have seen to date. The story is balanced and well-paced; the characters are not only relatable but dynamic. There is symbolism and emotion at every turn in the series. It is, without a doubt, an emotional rollercoaster, but the melancholic feeling that follows finishing the series and the story is one that is bitter yet also at closure. \r\nBeginning in episode 1, the storygrabs the attention of the viewer. Retrospect and flashback techniques are nice, but the anime lets you know this is not going to be the happiest. Without spoiling anything, the series and characters have you in suspense throughout the entire series. Al lot of this was mainly through the characterization of the Setsuna, Haruki, and Kazusa. Their dynamic was one that not only I could relate to, but one that evolves, breaks, and repairs itself. It was a real life model of what romance is really like, it's one that hurts, that thieves, that drives people to do things we don't understand. Each character had their own personality, different and complex, yet how they interacted and melded together was really the highlight of the story. \\n\\n\r\nRomance Dynamic: The three characters, Setsuna, Haruki, and Kazusa, are not just static characters. Nor do they hold the same traits throughout the series. By interacting with each other, they change and adapt. They fight, laugh, and love just like we would imagine doing in real life. In the end though, is it enough to let a problem get so big that it begins to hurt all three of them? This story has much more hidden under the surface than it seems. With every action, every interaction, the story changes, it becomes more of a living idea, it grows on itself. And the viewer can follow. They can understand why things are happening, as well as become frustrated at both the characters and story itself. A nice balance of the two lends itself well to the romance aspect and the characters as a whole, giving it even more of a realistic feel.\\n\\n\r\nUniversal Ideals: Love is not a smooth road. It is filled with bumps, cracks, and turns. The decisions we make influence those around us, and sometimes change how we interact with others forever. There are words and actions that we regret, end up not taking, or change our lives. These are just some of the many universal ideas that one can take from watching White Album 2. Again, the writers and producers did an amazing job at incorporating a real life relationship complex into fiction, giving us dynamic characters that have more depth than we originally thought. Actions aren't just forgotten or wasted, they are beginnings of the chain reactions that can come back around if we aren't careful. Love is a dangerous and often disheartening game.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending: No spoilers here, but I will comment about the melancholic way the show ends. I have seen anime which end abruptly, without closure or giving the show proper justice. This is not one of those series. The producers end the show in a way that makes sense, one that's predictable, but not necessarily to the extent the audience would want. That being said, one of the greatest points of this anime is the ending, and I encourage those who finish watching it and complain about the ending to look back on WA2 as a whole. The dynamic of the entire show and its characters makes the ending perfectly clear and understandable. The story is a lot more serious and significant than one may think, especially toward the second half. It drives itself to the finish, piling on emotions and relationships one after another. \\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, White Album 2 is amazing. While I won't comment on the art or sound (I mainly judge anime on its story and characters unless art or sound really detracts from the overall presentation), I will make the argument that this show takes real life implications of a complicated issue and spins it on its face. Romance, life, and choices. These are not small things in our society, so why shouldn't they be in the anime? Why shouldn't serious issues lead to serious consequences? The show does a marvelous job at integrating some of the things we don't like talking about in romance and putting characters and actions on them. We can feel and relate to the characters, we can imagine the story, and we can see the complex relationships and hardships that they go through. It reminds us how reckless, heartfelt, disappointing, rewarding, complex, heartbreaking, and bittersweet real love can be. An emotional roller coaster ride, a bittersweet and complex story, and lovable yet frustrating characters all contribute to me giving this series a 10/10.",

            "content": "Visual Novels are often easily overlooked once they are adapted into an Anime, mostly because of how the adapting studio includes all paths in a story; often leaving a mess that can't be called a story.\r\nWhite Album 2 is very much different from the usual structure, because it's story branches still compliment each other in order to create what has became an all time favourite of mine. Here's why.\r\nThe story of White Album 2 can be said to revolve around Houjou High School's 'Light Music Club', which includes our protagonists, Haruki Kitahara, Setsuna Ogiso, and Kazusa Touma; a simple love triangle, right? No, in fact,the complexity of it all is why I like this series so much. WA2's (which is what I shall call the series for the rest of this review) Visual Novel roots can still be noticed here-and-there, but it doesn't change the overall feel of the show, it still feels like it is part of one branch.\\n\r\nRomance, in my opinion, is more of a side-genre in the first part of the series, which is where music plays a larger part in the story. I am a music student, which is perhaps why I have a soft spot for this arc. The newly formed Light Music Club task themselves with performing at a music festival, held at Christmas in Houjou High. That is the beginning of the trio's story. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another part of WA2 that is executed amazingly well. No character can fit into an archetype, they all show different parts of their personality throughout the show, each with their own meaning. Of course, you can still say that one character is a happy-go-lucky, and the other a tsundere, however all characters are designed to have their flaws. Insecurity, and lack of trust is evident throughout, often changing the feel of an episode for bad or for good. \\n\r\nHaruki is (despite it not being mentioned more than once or twice) top of his class, with the best grades in his grade. Despite his intelligence, he lacks musical skill, yet he still decides to keep faith in the Light Music Club. He isn't good enough to perform to a stage audience, yet that is his dream. \\n\r\nNext, is Setsuna. She is the idol of the school, and yet that is not her real self. Her kind attitude and good looks accumulate to her victory in the Miss Houjou competition for two years running, but she wants to do something different with her final school year. She may seem easy to understand from a summary, but Setsuna turns out to become one of the most complex characters in any fictional work.\\n\r\nThe final main character is Kazusa. Kazusa likes to sleep in class, and only moved into Haruki's class at the start of their senior year. Her attitude, that likes to bite at the others in her class, is often why most people have given up on her, even the teachers.\\n\\n\r\nGiving the summary of those characters, I again realised why I like that complexity of the plot, and how hard it is to categorise each character into an archetype. Although I could if I looked at the first episode of the series, the next episode could show something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's art is nothing outstanding or special, however is is still extraordinary in how it portrays key scenes in the show, especially those where the characters perform their respective instruments. The emotion of these scenes are delivered perfectly, provoking my emotions, something that I always love to experience in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound is always an important department for me, as I am a music student and will always love a good soundtrack. WA2 does not disappoint. Being a musical anime, every single piece that is either performed on screen or as part of a background track is beautiful. The feelings that I gain from a scene is often a cause of a song that compliments the character's actions perfectly. The majority of the soundtrack consists of acoustic piano/guitar pieces, which is common in anime, but the way each song is composed to fit a certain scene is outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nNow for overall enjoyment of the show. In case you couldn't tell, I love this show. I love it for its romantic complexity, as well as the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies it. Of course, I was left annoyed at many points, namely in the latter half of the series, but that did not stop me from enjoying it any less. In fact, it made trying to predict what will happen next (which I am usually correct about, WA2 being the only ever exception to this) useless, because I knew that this show is unpredictable, yet it doesn't leave me angered in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nMy final scores:\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9.75\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves me with an overall score of 10/10.",

            "content": "Well this is my first time reviewing an anime at this site,so bear with me!\r\nWhite Album 2.. it may sound and look like your everyday RomCom about a love triangle but it actually turns out that the anime is something entirely Beautiful and The Love Triangle consists of everything! friendship,hatred,jealousy,revenge,heartbreaks and of course! LOVE! \r\nStory-\r\nThe Story was pretty much simple, about how a guy and 2 girls form a band and after that love blossoms but it wasn't a comedy like most of the animes present out there. It gets deep after every episode. After every episode we come to know every character's inner desiresand hatred. What started as a love Triangle ends with Three line segments that do not intersect each other whatsoever. It feels like there should be more to it! I Want more! but what is, it is... Heartbreak...\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe Art was really fitting as everything looked as it should . Perfect lip movements and perfect flow\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nNormally I do not watch animes with a musical theme but i got addicted to this anime because of what I normally hate- Music, that's right. The Soundtrack is perfect. Nothing goes out of beat. I even watched the op's and ed's every episode which i normally don't.\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nEvery character. Yes, every! Everyone has their own uniqueness well developed and well drawn.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nWhat Can I Say? Normally animes made from visual novels are bad... very very bad.. But there are a few exceptions like Myself; Yourself, Little Busters And Of Course This Gem! This is not a sequel or continuation. It is a completely different story from from the first white album which pretty much sucked! Watch this if you want to Feel The FEELS...",

            "content": "What in the hell can I say is wrong about this anime?\r\nOk to be honest, maybe a little bit.\r\nRomance isn't easy to write or show, and this one went through the thing that replaces my heart for pumping blood through my body (from a friend). I thought a lot about this anime when I was done with it. Needless to say, the romance of the story was well written, and I applaud anyone who was involved with the making of this anime.\r\nTime to get down to brass tacks:\r\nStory 10/10\r\nAlright, I end up thinking about anime a lot even after I finished it. Bad or good,I think how it could have ended differently, and how it could've been better (applies to bad anime).  This story has so much to offer, it pretty much overwhelmed me. \\n\r\nOverall, the story kept me up at night (not really, its an expression) and was unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is not 10 because I found the art slightly off at times. This may seem hard to get, but to me, the faces seemed odd. Other than that, the art was beautiful and pleasant on the eyes. The art may possibly be one of two bad things I can say about this.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThis isn't no K-On, but it is a music based anime, so I shall judge the music they play along with background music. My verdict is, are you kidding me? I loved all of it! There's not much I can say about sound. It's pretty, and nice to listen to along with the moments the characters have. That's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters, they're not plastic. I guess they are relateable, if you are a struggling dude in a failing light music club or some nonsocial piano player, or some school idol who's status makes you unreachable by all guys. Ok, no seriously though, no character here was a blockhead who doesn't notice obvious feelings being pointed at him/her. That seems to happen way too often. I'm glad all the characters were smart, and realistic. If you don't know what I mean by that, watch it and you'll understand how much this can be similar to a real life scenario.  There's only one character I just couldn't understand. It's not even the main characters, it's a side character. >;/\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAt first, I was mad. I ranted about how the guy didn't do *spoilers* or that. This was when I was in the first few episodes. My friend called me a dumbass and told me to keep watching. I was soo happy by the end of it.\\n\r\nDid I forget to mention this is a \"makeyoucry\" anime? Yeah, still no spoilers here, but it will hopefully make you cry. Unless you \"aren't human\" like me ;-; \\n\r\nThe music and the deep connections of the friendships between the characters felt so... real, for lack of a better word. I felt like it was possible to go to Japan, and find these people living there with their struggles and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nWhy are you still reading this review? Go watch it now! White Album 2 is a deep story full of romance and music that will touch your heart deeply. \\n\r\nI absolutely loved this anime, and did not cry to this either. I wish I did.\\n\r\nThanks for getting to the bottom of this essay (review) and have a good Thanksgiving!\\n\\n",

Though, from the moment we become friends, we'll never speak to each other again.\" -Touma Kazusa \r\nAs I've watched the whole 13 episodes of White Album 2 written by Masaya Tsukishima, I've experienced strong burst of emotions. The value of selecting between love over friendship, and what comes after; betrayal and regrets.\r\nThe story starts with Haruki Kitahara who's a member of the light music club that lacks members. Everyday as he play  \"White Album\" by Yuki Morikawa  with his guitar in MusicRoom 1, there was always a pianist who plays across the adjacent room at Music Room 2 who play along with him. As days passed by, playing together from both rooms Haruki hears someone is singing from the roof top along their melody. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the he attempts to revive the light music club to recruit some new members to play for their school festival. As the story progresses they will be able realize feelings, value their friendship and comes betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have distinctive elements where it shall leave you a huge impression. Where both female characters have massive uniqueness and differences. Where-in you'll be able to learn who'd to hate and  ship through out the entire series. All of the characters may have flaws, but that's what makes them realistic in some way.                          \\n\\n\r\nThe music was spectacular and played an absolutely huge role. I've been very keen with the music through out series, and it bought the series to another level as it exploits all of the essential emotions that need to be portrayed within each scene. \\n\\n\r\nChoosing love over friendship where this is what makes White Album 2 so realistic and impacting, since it would be normal to hide your  feelings away and not confess, since it could ruin a friendship and you are too scared of what might happen.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I've really enjoyed the emotional roller coaster and being hit hard by the feels train. I could say that While Album 2 really left a hole but it's so astounding with it's well made characters, gorgeous music and a meticulously written\\n\\n\r\nI would give White Album 2  10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Robert's Too Late Reviews is here to, well, talk about this anime. This is another series I think I just stumbled across, and I'm so very glad I did so, as it was a stirring and wonderful experience. Of note, I have not experienced the visual novel, and am coming in without having seen the first White Album either. This is purely based off the anime alone. If you have an eye (or heart) for romance and love triangles, this is the stop for you! Will the feels train stop to deposit a post on the RTLR wall of tsundere girls? All signs point toyes, but let's break this thing down and see for sure. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story deals a light music club basically falling apart leaving only a pair of guitarists, one of them really new to playing. This beginner is our male lead, who dreams of playing in the school festival, and particularly dreams of playing an original piece on stage. One day while practicing by an open window in the club room, he hears a pianist fall in and accompany him perfectly. This mystery pianist is in the locked 'elite' music room 2. He enjoys his little sessions with the pianist, until one afternoon he hears a heavenly voice singing with the duo. The voice belongs to one of the most popular girls in the school, standing on the roof. The guy sees a chance to possibly make his dream of playing on stage come true, and he immediately moves to recruit first the beautiful singer, and then the mysterious pianist. This is the beginning of a love story filled with emotion, heartbreak, and dreams. \\n\\n\r\nThe story moves along some familiar lines, and is for the most part very well done, with scenes that are cut in such a way to make us think we understand what is going on, only later to flash back and show even more of the conversation/event, where we gain new insight. This directorial direction is masterfully done, giving us what we need as we move through the story, holding back various parts in such a manner as to heighten the drama and bring us to the edge of our seats. The love triangle that develops seems one way at first, only later do we find the honest truth about it as the characters grow and struggle in their positions. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this section didn't score higher is  that the tsundere girl gets really close to overdoing it some of the time. I adore those kinds of characters, and she does have a human side that is shown in her actions and words, but she's so stubbornly rough on the guy that it was sometimes frustrating. The other big knock for me, oddly enough, is that the pacing is a little slow in the beginning, before picking up very nicely at the conclusion. I don't mind slow (say it with me yall: Maria-sama ga Miteru) but I prefer for a steadier pace, instead of a slower walk turning into a run at the end. It's not even close to a deal breaker for me, but just one of those things that caught my attention. \\n\\n\r\nWe'll get more into detail regarding this later in the character section, so I'll see you guys there. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI ADORE the look this show has. To me, this is what I think of when I think 'anime'. I'm a fan of how the characters look, with their expressions, and the general appearance, especially the two girls. The instruments look good, and the eyes are expressive enough where looks, glances, and facial expressions are used to convey messages and story progression. \\n\\n\r\nThe complaint I felt about the art was a design decision. I don't like the way the tsundere girl dresses in the festival concert, it just seems too revealing for her to have gone along with. She seems more conservative, and even though she makes a biting comment about her displeasure with the outfit, it just wasn't enough. I think her character would have rejected wearing it. Or at least that's what I expected. Other than that kind of thing, I didn't find much to criticize personally. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music is very well done, with only a single issue that irked me. The piano pieces are beautiful, and the theme music is pretty enough. The song that repeats throughout the series is appropriate and fits the theme of the show very well. They do drop the themes more often that most series, mainly it appears to fit in more character time, as they often have speaking scenes throughout the time usually reserved for the ending theme, or even a time or two for the opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue I had was with the guitarist. He plays simply for the most part, as is fitting since he's new to the guitar. The tsundere girl demands he practice a great deal, several hours a day, and while he makes progress as expected, he sometimes makes too much progress. They show him learning a fairly complicated solo in only a manner of days, something that in my experience as a musician, seemed to be a bit unlikely. The singing girl sounds wonderful, and the piano matches well. The tsundere girl also plays other songs when she's thinking or just practicing and they are all very interesting, musically speaking and nice to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where things get interesting. The trio of guy, tsudere girl, and popular girl all have motivations and realistic reactions to events around them. This is very much a character driven show, and they do not disappoint. The guy is presented as diligent, and hard working. He is classmates with tsundere girl, and reaches out to her to help her even with her treating him badly. He is bright, and doesn't give up on her, taking her insults in stride. This is important to the tsundere girl's motivations later on. His kindness and warmth is not lost on tsundere girl, even if it seems like it at first. \\n\\n\r\nThe popular girl has motivations that seem very innocent and normal at first, but she harbors a secret as well, a reason for doing what she does that turns out to be far more than just simple feelings that we see at first. The reasons for each person to act the way they do fits into a realistic situation. They do not seem forced by any means, and they are not cookie cutters made to fit a single role. They express a complexity that is often difficult to properly portray in stories like this. The only thing is the tsundere girl clinging so hard to her defenses and walls to keep the others out, even as they imprint deeper and deeper into her heart. This is especially true for the guy, who the more she seems to come to feel for him, the meaner she seems to get. \\n\\n\r\nThe tsundere girl is quicker to admit the popular girl is her friend, and her only friend, but that is even a strain for her. She has a good motivation, having suffered trauma at her mother's treatment of her through her childhood, which explains well why she's the rough girl she is. Inside however, her defenses aren't as strong as she wants everyone to think. \\n\\n\r\nThe popular girl seems innocent and somewhat predictable, yet they give her motivations for her actions that are a little surprising, though they make perfect sense once they are revealed. She's not as sweet and innocent as she first appears, though in the end she shows a level of love that is admirable. \\n\\n\r\nThe guy, as we discussed, is true blue, a good guy through the heart of him, even though he gets into some difficult situations as the end comes around. He tries his best to not hurt anyone, though the situation isn't that easy to escape, and hearts are involved, massively complicating the whole thing. He tries to tread lightly, but it's just not a situation where there's a 'right' way out of. He deals with what happens in a manner that speaks of his wounded heart, as he struggles to not only honor the girls, but also stay true to himself. He's a satisfying male lead, something that can be a bit hard to find in some of these romantic triangle type stories. Even though he does some things that clearly hurt the girls, he is not a player nor is he looking to juggle the girls, or have his cake and eat it too. He's trying to navigate the minefield that is love, and stumbles here and there, as we all do. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really loved my time with White Album 2, with one reservation, that being the ending. It is not a bad ending by any means, but if you've ever seen any of my other reviews you might be aware of my love of grand endings. This one does not go out the way I would have it do. It's heartbreaking, yet at the same time, the ending is also immensely heartwarming and beautiful. Even though I would have made it a 'Western' styled ending for the tsundere girl, it admittedly not cap the story off in a way that gave any true resolution. Though I'm loathe to admit it, they really did a good job wrapping the story up. So I had my expectations, and I still wanted it to happen that way, I can't deny they masterfully brought it all to a close and in a manner that is hopeful for the trio. It was a heartwarming tale from beginning to end, with only a small bit of pacing issues, and as the end steamed into the station, I found myself mesmerized and anxious to continue watching as each episode ended, which to me speaks to how much I enjoyed the series. \\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Touma Kazusa. The tsundere girl wins hands down. The popular girl is cute and played well, but nothing beats a mean girl, ever. I love the way Kazusa was drawn, her voice, and her demeanor. She might have been close to too mean at times, but I guess I like the abuse. Mean girls forever!\\n\\n\r\nIn closing I would heartily recommend giving White Album 2 a chance, especially if you like drama and romance, as this has both in spades. There were times I felt the agony the characters were going through, times when my heart soared and I was giddy when a good development happened, and smiled like a fool every time tsundere girl dropped her attitude for a moment and showed she was actually a caring person, no matter what kind of mask she wore. As for the RTLR wall of romance, Kazusa and Setsuna bumped off a pic of Black Widow from the wall, taking the spot instead. All thumbs up!",

I'm not too sure what it was about this show that clicked with me in such a way. If you enjoy lighthearted or comedic shows, or cannot deal with or do not enjoy emotional turmoil this show is not foryou. But if you want characters you can connect with, real characters with flaws, balancing selfishness and selflessness, this show may be for you. Although you may not have even remotely the same experience I did when watching, and I certainly did not expect I would, I would say give it a shot, and it may affect you.",

            "content": "I've never written a review for an anime despite the many times when I've felt compelled to, but this ends here. White Album 2 is something truly special - a beautiful romance driven by subtlety, with some of the most honest-to-life and endearing characters I've ever seen. Now, for those of you with worries that a visual novel-based anime like WA2 is going to absolutely blow, fear not. WA2 is, in its own right, just as well-written as any romance anime out there. \r\nThe plot revolves around three characters: Kitahara Haruki, the former class rep and top-scorer, Ogiso Setsuna, the winner of Miss Houjou Preptwo years in a row, and Touma Kazusa, the cool and collected genius pianist who can't seem to stay awake in class. WA2 is a love triangle - let's get that out of the way - and as such, wouldn't seem to be completely original. But the show takes a simple premise and transforms it into a rare breed of anime: a realistic portrayal of love complicated. While the story is nothing new, the way the content is executed turns WA2 into a masterful piece of storytelling which tugs at the heartstrings and left me awestruck after its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, events to come are hinted at in the very introduction to WA2. This in no way detracts from the experience, but rather serves as an effective form of foreshadowing that heightens the sense of unease, the sense of impending conflict. However, unlike love triangle romance anime of the same ilk, WA2's characters share a genuine bond. Their friendship is what makes the show so painful but powerful. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, there's not much to be said. Sound is often an appropriate accompaniment for your standard fare anime, but here, it serves a deeper purpose. Not only does the narrative utilize the creation of music as a backdrop for the romance, but certain songs hold great significance that can only be understood after watching. In fact, WA2 is riddled with symbolism - picking on said subtleties is one of the most rewarding aspects of the show, and makes earlier events all the more important.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you've read other reviews here, you'll know that there's a sex scene. As offputting as it sounds, it actually fits perfectly in context and was executed appropriately - to reuse my own diction, it adds without detracting.\\n\\n\r\nI won't go into further detail because WA2 is an anime best experienced by oneself (without spoilers, of course). The characters are relatable, lovable despite the mistakes they make, and above all else, painfully human. Please do yourself a favor and watch the show - if you're like me and the many other MAL users who have been touched by WA2, you'll love it as well.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*As a side note, White Album 2 is in no way directly related to the original White Album. The only semblances it bears are the use of the song \"White Album\" and the overarching theme of music. \\n\\n",

Setsuna is the beauty queen of the campus. Kazusa is the type of student with an aura of unfriendliness. \r\nWhat I like in WA2 is the unexpected plots and the chosen beautiful words which is strikingly direct hit to my heart.Please watch I do not want to spoil the grace of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Touma was exceptionally beautiful, well animated.

I don't have still gotten moved emotionally where White Album 2 touched me inside.  Without going into spoilers its one of the ONLY kind of romance anime i've loved deeply despite how it all ended. Its characters are interesting, ALL of them and the emotionalrides you go through are one of a kind, atleast they were for me and thus this is a MASTERPIECE! I implore you to check the Visual Novel since this anime ONLY covers the Introductory Chapter of it. Without a shadow of a doubt its a 10 for me and my all-time favourite romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy only dislike would be how it made me feel empty but well thats how its INTENDED to be i guess!",

Being loved for nothing hurts the most. Seeing your girlfriend crying because she loves someone other than me. That's the reason why I liked and disliked this anime :) \r\nIf you experience this kind of relationship then this is the anime that suits for you. I liked this anime because it resembles my bittersweet memories of my girlfriend in my High school days. The anime was entirely great especially the story itself. I disliked thisanime because it made me remember the times that I was left behind. Suffering from pain and being alone. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is entirely great. Making a love story anime is not that great but this anime deserves the spot. Getting strucked by the love triangle in the story and how they will solve their problems together. Practicing their music notes and arrangements in the house of their friend and aiming to pursue themselves to their respective goals. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art makes this anime feel the essence of the story. The season is somewhat connecting to the route of the story. Being lonely at winter and happy in Fall. White Album 2 is the color of snow and snow is use to symbolize being cold to others and alone.  Although the art is not unique but the art itself is the resemblance of this Anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons that I have watched this anime is because of the sounds that are used and composed mostly by instruments(piano, electric guitar, saxophone, keyboard) The background music fits the story and every part of the anime. The music that are used is sad but encouraging me to feel more what love is and what part of love is hurting the most. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are 3 main characters in the story. 1 boy and 2 girls that wants to perform in their school festival. They used their music capabilities to fulfill their goals in life and make these 3 characters to be together forever. They are being loved and love and that's love triangle will happen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime from the first episode up to the last. What I enjoyed the most is how they will manage their relationship to each other. Not every anime is like this and that's why enjoyed this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhite Album is your romance and drama anime. For me, this anime defines what \"love\" really is. How can we manage ourselves when it comes to love. Are we giving-up for our loved ones or are we fighting to show our love for them? If you feel what I feel then this is the anime for you",

            "content": "I'm not one for long reviews, so I'll do my best do keep this as brief as possible.\r\nWhite Album 2 is a prime example of a hidden gem. As of 05/02/2018, it's ranked #641 on MAL's popularity list - not much of a surprise, but...come on, it deserves a lot more credit. To be honest, I was skeptical when I first looked into this show. I heard White Album, an anime that is almost completely unrelated to this \"sequel\", got a bad rap. Knowing this, I was cautious towards watching it at first, but then I said: \"fuck it\". And boy, oh boy - Iwas not disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime did something that I've never seen done before: make me care about the characters involved in a love triangle. To be frank, I've never been a fan of love triangles - in fact I hate them, even now. I've always seen them as meaningless plot devices that often force awful sequences of melodrama. I didn't even realize that this show involved one after a couple of episodes. However, what other stories involving love triangles tend to forget that White Album 2 in contrast, does very well, is convey sincerity. Sure, these  three main characters may seem typical: a cute idol worshipped by the entire school, a cold and mysterious black-haired musician, and some generic looking guy (...that's really all I can describe how he looks...). What separates them from anime's plethora of shitty characters were their unexpected authenticity. I was surprised at how genuine they felt - showing both the good and bad in being human, while even reaching towards extremes. With a slight touch of moral ambiguity, I got hooked.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, I can say that all of these characters were horrible people. Saying otherwise would be completely false. At their very core, they were \"good\" people, but with layers upon layers of depth added on, that initial image of \"good\" character seems to fade, and an unpleasant reality begins to take shape. Selfishness, greed, manipulation, betrayal, irrationality, temptation, deception, jealousy - all of these words can be applied these main characters. And despite all of these god-awful traits that everybody should gravitate away from, you can empathize with them. It's commonplace. White Album 2 grabs you by the throat and MAKES you feel for these characters. It manages to make immoral decisions seem somewhat justified. You'll likely experience the pain, the heartbreak, the wrath. You'll hear the gears turning in their heads as they question their own morality and that of others. On top of that, don't expect satisfaction when it's all over. If you do, all I can say is play the visual novel or read a summary like I did. It's still gonna fuck with you no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters, I'll talk about the other stuff, but like I said - briefly.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the story more or less seems like a regular Slice of Life series. The Light Music Association is about to crumble! Where have I seen that before? While not being the most original start to a series, it successfully overwrites the fact by excellently involving you with the characters and providing a smooth flow of progression. There are times here and there where the story may be dragging on, but honestly it's fairly rare and not much to worry about. Things don't get REALLY interesting until the second half, however. Not to say that the first wasn't a lot to care about, but you'll see what I mean when you watch it. Hitting the second half of the series is like accidentally spilling a fuck ton of spice into your soup. Shit doesn't immediately hit the fan, but it'll get there the more you mix the pot. By the way, this series should definitely be raised to R+. I wasn't prepared.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the music, not much to say except there were surprisingly a lot of memorable tracks. This show has a Music tag for a reason, apparently. Not going into details, but many of the songs sung in this series provides deeper insight into their respective characters, as well as improve the effectiveness of some emotional scenes. Shit hits hard. Add a couple of catchy tunes and the beautiful voice of a lead singer and that's an easy 10. Other than than, artwork's not astounding, but nice to look at nonetheless. I'm not an expert when it comes to critiquing animation and stuff like that, but if it's pretty and doesn't bother me, I'll roll with it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, this series was incredibly enjoyable, especially towards the second half. It's hard to talk about this show without spoiling even a little bit. While it surely hit like a truck and ruthlessly stomped on my chest a couple of times, I loved it anyway. If this anime doesn't seem like your thing, I highly encourage you to give it a shot anyway. I'm certainly glad that I did. With all taken into consideration, White Album 2 brilliantly showcases a harsh reality. It doesn't bullshit with a predictable story or one-sided characters. It doesn't hesitate to bring one's morality into question. It doesn't sugarcoat the cruelty that comes with life. I'll leave you with this quote that I pulled out of my ass, which I believe pretty much summarizes the themes of White Album 2:\\n\\n\r\nFrom sacrifice comes sorrow. From sorrow comes suffering. From suffering comes pain. Fight through pain and find happiness - a happiness that lasts until the inevitable cycle continues.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Now that I finished the whole series, I feel totally wrecked, and there is no other ending that I would have preferred. I feel that the author did all 3 characters justice by ending the way he did. This story is the truest  representation of A Love Triangle. If you ever felt frustrated at the denseness of Raku in Nisekoi, the complete inability of Onodera, Chitoge and Raku to take any actions or express themselves; or if you wished Oregairu had taken a different turn if 8man was not as jaded as he was of the world, and that perhaps Yukino and Yui wasmore willing to take things into their own hands and not be as hampered by their own images of how they should act or by their feelings for one another; then WA2 completely\\n\r\nwent ahead to finish the race and left both of them in the dust. WA2 was where each character did what they believed in the most and to the truest of their feelings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna - At first glance, one may harbour hatred towards Setsuna for what she did - knowingly and purposefully stepping in between Touma and Haruki to be the 3rd party, but in realityn would you really condemn what she did? All she wanted was for the 3 of them to be together forever and in order not to be left behind, she did the only thing she believed was possible. And that is to tie down Haruki while forcing Touma to be together too because she knew neither Haruki nor Touma would be able to reject her. Both of them would willing put her feelings before their own, because that's the kind of people they are. Of course she could have just let them be and it was only a matter of time before Touma and Haruki got together since both of them had feelings for each other, but where would she be in that picture? No where, and so she chose the path which would bring her the most happiness. You could call her selfish or evil for stepping in, but if you were in her shoes, would you have done it otherwise and let her love go? Would you not applaud her courage for going after what she wanted?\\n\\n\\n\r\nTouma - For being the Ice Queen and supposedly cold, she did a terrible job of hiding her true feelings. For Haruki to not notice was entirely reasonable, since Haruki was THE person she was trying to hide her feelings from, but Setsuna, standing at the side could see everything clear as day. There were multiple instances throughout the story where Setsuna would \\n\r\nmutter things under her breath like 'yeah, right' when Haruki would describe her as cold and not expressing herself, because all Setsuna could see was Touma placing herself where Haruki would be. Be it noticing where he went, to his terrible guitar playing, to helping him get better, all Touma did was literally 'all action no talk'. Seeing Setsuna confess to Haruki, yet \\n\r\nalso knowing how kind Haruki was, and unable to reject Setsuna, she did all she could to act aloof and as if she didn't care at all. Multiple times she denied knowing what Setsuna was talking about when she apologised, but in her heart she never forgave Setsuna did she? For her to do that with Haruki, she was in her own words, 'the worse betrayer'\\n\\n\r\nHaruki -As the supposedly smartest person in the school for acing subjects, he was led in circles by both Setsuna and Touma. Unable to reject Setsuna, unable to see through what Touma was going through. Not that I blame him though. He was just trying to be kind to the people around him - by accepting Setsuna, and trying to be true to himself - never really letting go of Touma. Could you really blame him for his persistence in going after Touma? Afterall, that is who he truly loved. You could say he was a two-timer, but he could never bring himself to reject Setsuna, neither could he bring himself to forget Touma. Love never had a black or white answer, it all depends on where you stood. And where Haruki stood was at a pitchblack concrete\\n\r\ncrossroad with snow falling all around him.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u5c4a\u304b\u306a\u3044\u604b - Todokanai Koi, or A Love That Cannot Be - The last song the trio sang together might be the best one-liner summary of WA2. All 3 did what was in their mind the best course of action, but yet that resulted in an ending where none of them could be happy. A love that cannot be. Wonderful series. Half way through I was pretty doubtful if WA2 could be a 10 in my heart. But how the author masterfully concluded the series made it a 10 for me. Never mind it was not a happy ending, never mind that it was not entirely conclusive; because isn't that the most realistic representation of real life too?",

The \" TRUE \"  ending . Here is the link: http://mdzanime.me/2013/12/29/white-album-2-concluding-chapter-coda-rough-summary/\r\nI was so relieved and so happy that it ended well.

I think this is the reason why I love this anime. There is this episode when a flashback from one of the main character that captured my heart.

            "content": "Love is probably the most difficult emotion for us as individuals to properly comprehend. Sometimes it can blossom out of friendship and bring people closer together while other times it can tear people apart. And it's because there are so many ways in which this emotion can be portrayed that romances are my favorite genre in the animated medium. Don't get me wrong, sometimes they can be done poorly to the point where I can't even find myself entertained (Cough* TWILIGHT *Cough). However, sometimes, much like right now, I stumble across something great completely by accident. Something that makes be board the feel train, onlyto get off with a void in my heart. \\n\\n\r\nCase Open\\n\\n\r\nCase Summary + Witnesses:\\n\r\n(Before you say anything, no you do not need to watch the first season to appreciate this one)\\n\\n\r\nThe story of WA2 focuses on the life of three students in their final year of high school. We have Haruki Kitahara, the male lead who is overly helpful when it comes to his friends (which is his greatest asset as well as greatest fault). We have Setsuna Ogiso, the shy and quite popular girl who learns to come out of her shell. And finally we have Kazusa Touma, the quite musical genius who never had anyone look after her before. \\n\\n\r\nIt is the relationship between these three that drives the story of WA2, coming together as the light music club in order to perform before their graduation. Music will be played, strong bonds will be formed, and friendships will be tested. However, even without a nice boat in sight, this series is far from a fluffy one. \\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\nWA2 is a story that sticks very close to your standard music anime formula and because of this, a good portion of the story was predictable. However, through careful pacing and well executed flashbacks, WA2 knows when to show us what needs to be shown and did an excellent job of building tension without treading to deeply into melodramatic territory.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves might appear to be nothing more then the standard troupes that we have seen before in the past, but it was their interactions that lead to them to be so interesting. Throughout the story you feel how close the three were becoming whether it was out of respect or admiration. The chemistry and dynamics felt real which of course was essential in making such a love triangle work as the closer they becoming, the harder it was to maintain their friendship. There was no \"bad guy\" between them, no single character that caused problems for others. Rather the real enemy in the story was the love they all harbored. By the end of the story, choices needed to be made and if you're expecting a happy ending then you will be disappointed. For when it come to love and friendship, sometimes it's impossible to walk away completely intact. \\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\r\nBeing produced by studio satellite, WA2 features very fluid and decently polished animation. This especially becomes apparent during the concert scenes which were some of the more pleasurable moments to remember. Character designs and backgrounds stick very close to the visual novel with my only complaint being that Haruki bears a disturbingly strong resemblance to that A-hole from school days. But I digress. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that the series aesthetics just get the job done are an understatement to say the least as even the pallet stuck very close to the shows namesake. Soft colors were used with certain sheens and well placed lighting allowed everything to mesh together well without it looking bland or plain. The series gave off a very gentle, yet bittersweet atmosphere which reflected the seasons that were being portrayed to an exceptional degree. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, being a music anime as well as a romance, WA2 delivers when it needs too with splendid combinations of vocals, piano and guitar that will hit you right in the Kokoro. While much of the music was taken from the original visual novel, it was still cleverly executed without sounding generic or overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nClosing Statements:\\n\r\nOverall, WA2 is a very emotional romance that will make you feel attached with its visuals, aesthetic and music while at the same time slowly reach within your chest, grab that blood pumping organ that you thought was incapable of feeling, and tug on it nice and slowly. You ever come across one of those shows that you think isn't going to be all that great but then becomes one of the best that season? No? Then maybe you should give this a try. Just tread with caution because, believe me, just like real love, it isn't always sunshine and rainbows. \\n",

            "content": "First things first, if you haven't seen WA don't fret. This sequel only makes a few references to the original (namely the songs that get played) but ultimately is a stand-alone title. Now that's out of the way. \r\nIf your asking how is this adaption compared to the VN. It's fine, don't worry about it. \r\nStory\r\nThere really isn't much in the way of story for the first season. On the surface it's simply a story about 3 students trying to prepare for the school festival. However, being a romance/drama, there's of course more to it then that. It's mainly about all the emotional shifts thatour protagonist experience as they grow closer to each other. This is not a story where the characters make the most ideal of decisions, but rather take things in a more realistic albeit flawed fashion. Fair warning, this show may anger you with some of the decisions that get made, and it's intent is probably to do so. However if you carefully analyze why the characters make the decisions they do, you may find them more understandable. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said it is a rather slow story, slow as in it takes awhile for any \"real\" drama to hit. Though don't get me wrong it's paced that way intentionally and has a lot of thought put into it. Just fair warning if you prefer things to get rolling right away as most of the series is spent on the build up to the climatic finish. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThere is a handful of side characters but our main focus is on the three protagonists. Haruki is a busybody whose main drive in life is to lecture people. Kazusa is an extreme introvert with a talent for playing almost any instrument. And Setsuna is the school idol who seems suspiciously too nice for her own good. All three are deconstructions of archetypes you normally see in other anime. In that \"hey what would it be like if a kuudere if she existed in real life?\", and the answer would be she would have no friends and be incredibly lame to other people. Like said before they all have their positives and negatives for a fairly well balanced love triangle. Unfortunately the anime was playing favorites a little too much and gave Kazusa a little too much love in comparison to Setsuna (not a factor in the VN) but still nothing that should detract from the audiences enjoyment too much. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any flaw, I will say that sometimes the characters got a little too overdramatic when it wasn't fully necessary. Considering the show is relatively realistic, resorting to melodrama that is otherwise present in more over-the-top shows seems a little out of place. Not that it's done especially poorly, but that it makes the characters come across a little silly at times. It becomes difficult to take them seriously at the end especially. Now I understand that sometimes when a persons feelings explode it will be handled in a melodramatic fashion. However WA2 takes things a little too far. I understand that many people feel like \"the more dramatic the more entertaining\" but that really doesn't work with this kind of show I feel. Sometimes less is more and more subtle handling of the drama could have really made this series a lot stronger.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the friendship between Kazusa and Setsuna is developed too fast to be really believable. Even in the VN this was the case. Quite honestly I could just never buy they were good friends and really cared about one another. Unfortunately this really works against the drama as it becomes even harder to take seriously then it already was. But I will say the moments when feelings are being discovered or hidden...those moments are well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\\n\r\nPassable on both fronts but nothing more. There's some nice vocal songs but the background music is completely forgettable much like the game itself. Art and animation is roughly the same. But hey its a drama, I bet no one was expecting epic animation in this kind of show. \\n\\n\r\nActors play their roles well, nothing to complain about. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nFairly enjoyable overall. The flashbacks in one particular part though were excessive and drained the tension completely out of one scene (which in fact was the most important scene to get right, so yeah not too pleased about that). But otherwise its a nice watch at only 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't like this part, don't even bother checking out if this show gets a second season. This is actually the strongest part of the story anyway, so hey you might not like the second part either way. \\n\\n\r\nWA2 is how to do a proper romance love triangle. Make sure all 3 characters are given proper development and character and your gold. \\n",

            "content": "In the beginning, I looked over it. At first, I thought, \"Hmm, I dunno. I'm rather skeptical about it. Looks alright but...\"\r\nSuch thoughts appeared in my mind after I scrounged around this website for reviews on the previous 2 iterations of the series. And, judging from what I bore witness to, well, let's just say that I became decidedly put off by the series as a whole. I've heard of it many years ago, but I was confused then as to which is the first in the chronological order of events.\r\nUNTIL late last year... After a Japanese correspondent of mine Tweeted to me on whatshows he'll be watching for the Fall 2013 anime season, in which he said that he'd give the VN adaptations a try. (And a big etchi lover this guy was, sigh...) One such anime that he mentioned was this anime right here, White Album 2. And so, in keeping together with the Japanese injunction to \"relate to one another in a spirit of 'similarity'\", I decided to give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nIf only I knew what I was getting into... OH-MAI-KAMISAMA!!!\\n\\n\r\nImmediately after I went through this existentially scathing emotional-wringer of a romantic drama, I started to question my own relationships (not the romantic ones for I've no such thing) to that of other people- in a way.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the plot of White Album 2 is rather straightforward in what it aspires to present: it is by all accounts, a story of a young man who wishes to end his final days of high school leaving behind good, fond memories. However, he happens to chance upon two beautiful young women, each with their own distinct set of personality traits and histories, and goes through the motions of becoming closer to them as friends. UNTIL... *Spoilers*\\n\\n\r\nNow, the strength of the series's plot isn't in its 'astoundingly original' premise, but in the execution and emotional depth of it. All too often do we see aggressively optimistic, comically pessimistic, melodramatically sappy, maniacally nonsensical depiction of romances being bitterly regarded as the standard staples of fictional narratives, but few are truly a force to be reckoned with in its depiction of the subject matter. Never once did I feel that everything that ever was presented before me was needlessly amped-up or dumbed down so that they can elicit a reaction from me. No, not once at all. The key to their presentation of the three protagonists' struggles in love and friendship lie in the subtle cues and psychological subtext that are carefully spread out throughout the plot. Though there were instances of heated verbal fights and emotional reticence, such things do not come by without the plot's masterful handling of back story exposition, character personality traits and character motivations, all of which are utterly decisive in heightening the emotional impact of scenes while driving the messages that the plot attempts to convey. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, though there are quite a few occasions of rather sub-par animation, it for the most part succeeds in setting the overall tone of the series. The artwork is deep, vibrant, subdued, perfect for the series's intention to properly convey its narrative and accompanying themes. I'll also have you know that the opening sequence to the show is very impactful and will, if nothing else, leave a deep impression upon you, particularly as the plot progresses- both in terms of content and music.\\n\\n\r\nNo profound romantic drama can ever succeed without superb voice acting on the VA's end, for they have truly brought these characters to life in their stellar depiction of the characters' emotions during a particular scene. Sadness, anger, resentment, joy, all of it were properly executed. None felt that they were overacted or underacted in attempts to compensate due to atrocious directing or lack of skill. Musically speaking, the series's soundtrack is greatly fitting as it succeeds in conveying all manner of emotions to the audience, just like the voice acting. The lyrics to some of the songs are also rich in meaning and will leave you thinking when the series concludes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to the characters, considering that this is a heavily-character driven narrative, let's just say that they were unmistakably well-written and that their overall interactions and responses to one another's actions is within the realm of plausibility and possibility. However, if you are looking for tremendously complex characters with an immense amount of variance and depth within them, then this series will not be able to suffice your desires for they are very much portrayed as ordinary Janes n' Joes, save for one who stands out rather considerably. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I did not expect such a narrative to be so impactful once experienced, but the fact that it was left a profound impression upon me, and by the end, I am left ever more wondering if in the future we will be able to encounter such rare, underrated gems in storytelling. However, I could hardly say that I 'enjoyed' this in the most technical sense for there is no pleasure in witnessing hardship and sadness- unless if one was emotionally sado-masochistic towards oneself, I know I was.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes my first full review of an anime series. I hope you found it helpful in some way or another in clarifying your thoughts of whether you should take a gander at the show- or not. Till next time then.\\n\\n\r\n[Personal Rating: 9]\\n\r\n[Critical Rating: 9]\\n\\n\r\n{NISHIZAWA APPROVED}",

I ended up sitting through all thirteen episodes until it was five in the morning and I was crying my eyes out.\r\nThe characters, while driven by relatable, easy to understand motives really bring this show together. Even the side characters contribute to how the plot moves along. Every piece of dialogue and every emotion seems to have its place cemented inside the characters themselves. Never have I felt more conflicted about the \"antagonist\" within the show. Setsuna steals Haruki in a believable and humanway. That is the key to White Album 2, everyone is an actual person and if you dig down far enough you can really enrapture yourself in what each person is after.\\n\\n\r\nThe shot for shot mirroring from beginning, middle and end reflecting the lyrics within Love Beyond Reach really demonstrates the small things that envelope the viewer inside this wonderfully confusing world. Just when you think you've figured things out, it becomes a little more complicated. To top it off, it's portrayed in such a way that you're only discovering information as the characters do. Sure, you can easily see that Kazusa has feelings for Haruki during the beginning, but you never know the full extent of it until he does. And it's too late. White Album 2 holds your hand on a journy of discovery, one that leads through the snowy forest that melts your heart away as soon as you let it.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this show to anyone wishing to spend some time remembering what it's like to be alive. It's an emotional roller coaster that I never wanted to step off of until the very end.",

            "content": "Have you ever missed an opportunity to tell someone how you really feel? Have you ever thought that maybe the person you are with is not the right one for you? Well, the anime I am going to be talking about now revolves around both those questions and more.\r\nWhite Album 2, or Hwhite Album as the characters say it, is not a sequel to the original White Album, nor does it have anything to do with the original besides having a song called White Album play a big part in the first half of the story.\r\nThe anime begins introducing us to our selfless main protagonist,Haruki, who is one of the last members of the dying Light Music Club. His character is that of an everyman, the anime tries to make him as boring as humanly possible, probably to make it easier for the audience to relate to him. That is not to say he doesn't have any defining characteristics, he does, he just doesn't have anything that makes him stand out too much. Even his character design is rather boring compared to the other male characters in the show.\\n\r\nHis guitar playing is one of the main catalysts for the plot of the show and is what brings him and the two girls closer.\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna is our second main character she is one of the two romantic interests for Haruki. It is made clear from the very first episode that she is the star of the high school, she is every boy's dream winning the school's Miss contest for the last two years. Regarding her character development the anime pulls a KareKano on us and reveals that she is in fact a nerdy girl who wears glasses. There is more to her than that, she is energetic, upbeat and a klutz, as she was built to basically be the polar opposite of the other love interest, Touma Kazusa.\\n\\n\r\nTouma is, of course, best girl but also the one who provides a counter-point to both Setsuna's overly energetic personality and Haruki's overly dull personality. She is the daughter of a world renowned pianist and also an aspiring Hachiman when we meet her in the beginning of the anime. Her character, is arguably the one that changes the most, and I think she would have been better suited to be the MC of this anime, and the anime agrees with me because she has more than an entire episode dedicated to viewing the story through her eyes. Touma starts out as a cold and calculated music genius delinquent who because of the other two charactes influence grows a tiny bit more affectionate. Not too much though, wouldn't want to ruin her bad girl image.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the friendship these three create and the infinite amounts of sexual tension between them. As you may have already guessed having two characters of one gender and another of the opposite gender can only mean that we are going to have a love triangle. But rather than having the entire anime focus on the love triangle, the anime only uses its latter half to do this. The first half is more focused on how the characters got to like each other and, of course, the central event in the entire anime: the school fair concert. Honestly, I enjoyed the fist part of the anime mainly because it was light-hearted and more preoccupied with the music part of the anime. Not that I disliked the almost soap opera levels of drama in the second half, in fact, I would say it's the better part of the anime. Why do I say that? Well, probably because I like romance anime in general, I can see how some people might find the confusion, shouting and tears to be irritating but for me it was done well enough that I never felt irritated in the slightest.\\n\r\nI would also talk about the ending of Hwhite Album 2 a but I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just gonna say that while I appreciate what it was trying to do, that is, leave a bittersweet taste in the audience's mouth, I don't like how it did it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty standard TV anime fare. Nothing really stands out most of the time, except for a few scenes where it seems like they might have used more of their budget like the concert scene. I really don't have much to say about this point, if you've seen almost any other anime set in a high school then just take that and add and orange tint to it since a lot of scenes take place at dusk and you have Hwhite Album 2.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't speak of the sound design without talking about the music. The songs in the anime, have a mellow feel to them and, since the anime likes its winter symbolism, they are \"colder\" love songs. And not just the vocals tracks either even the instrumental insert songs have this feeling of melancholy and coldness to them. The eponymous White Album is probably my favourite song out of the multitude of EDs, the OP and the songs sung on stage by our three protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final verdict, Hwhite Album 2 is a very drama heavy anime that uses music as a central plot element. Some might like it because of the romance, some might like it because of the music, for a 13 episode anime there are enough elements in it for most people to find something they like about it. I liked it because of the characters and their relantionships and interactions, there is a lot that I didn't go over in this short review, so if it seems like you may be interested in White Album 2 then I suggest you watch it because there is a lot to like here.",

            "content": "First of all, english isn't my native language, so sorry for the mistakes I could make.\r\nSaid this, let us begin.\r\n(This review may contain some spoilers)\r\nStory( 8/10): The concept of the story is simple, but they manage to get an interesting love triangle, if it wasn't for the characters ( I'll speak of them later). The pacing was correct, even though some things doesn't seem really neccesary to the story or are a little boring. The ending was pretty good and full of feels (sad, yes, but that doesn't make it bad).\r\nArt(7/10): This section bothers me a little. Sometimes the characters are really well designed withreally good colors. Very well made. But other times they aren't that well made. Not bad, but not outstanding. That bothers me, because they've already shown us that they can make things correctly. That's why I'm not giving this section more than a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10): As it is an anime based on a little group of music, the ost is really good. The bgm music go with the events correctly and the three main song (White Album, Sound of Destiny, Todokanai koi) are incredible (Todokanai Koi in the end of the last chapter really hit my kokoro).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(6/10): This is what really fucks me up. The characters sometimes act really stupidly. For example, when Kitahara was staying in Touma's house. Why kept it a secret? Why make things more confusing? And why did Setsuna get angry when she saw Kitahara's toothbrush in Touma's house? Like you are not the man's girlfriend yet, You've no right to get angry.\\n\r\nKitahara sometimes doesn't seem to have any kind of personality, he just do what others tell him to do. Other times he act in an exaggerated manner. Like wtf man, relax your tits. At least, he isn't all the time  like this. He has his good moments as well.\\n\r\nThen there's Touma. I know you're meant to be proud and cool. But you've been in love with the man all the time and you don't move a single finger to do something, even when Setsuna was taking advantage. Like if you want him, go for him, don't cry later like you did.\\n\r\nAnd finally there's Setsuna, I dont really dislike Setsuna, only the fact that she got in the middle of those two. It isn't bad what she made, I mean she got in love with the man and she went for him (learn Touma). But it doesn't make a lot of sense since she knew that Kitahara had been in love with Touma all the time.\\n\r\nI've only  written about them in general, but they've all made a lot of dumb things that got me nervious a couple of times.\\n\r\nI liked as well Kitahara's friend (not even remember his name lol), but he didn't appear too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): As a matter of fact, I had already watched this show when it was being aired, so this has been my second time wacthing it, That's why there were some things I already knew about the show (I didn't remember a lot of other ones tho). There were points that got me a little bored, but I really enjoyed the ending and a lot of other moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10): I'll recommend this show? Of course. It has his good moments and the feeling it lets you with is really good and nostalgic .",

            "content": "First: keep in mind that the last romance anime I've seen (sans the Yuasa ones) was some 5 years ago, I'm not very keen on the genre as you can see. I've watched this anime because some guy said that this was the best romance anime he've ever seen, I hope I don't live enough to watch the worst.\r\nLike every other VN adapted anime, White Album 2 suffers from some pacing problems, especially towards the end, but I don't blame the anime for it.\r\nThe story until the last episodes is your everyday happy-go-round highschool romcom, they tried introducing some musical drama to the plot butfailed miserably, I mean: a rookie in guitar playing that after a week of training is soloing like a God? A prodigy multi-instrumentist that plays mediocre piano at best? And last but not least let's not forget the oh-so-natural talent for Setsuna to sing in autotune. C'mon production guys, you could've done it better.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really bland, really really bland. They only showed some backstory for one of the main heroines (and they've done it only on the last episodes), the other one was a literal selfish moeblob. The main character is the classic clich\u00e9 VN harem protag: a righteous, earnest, honest boy but with average looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is repetitive and mediocre, there are some moments that the anime tries really hard to get emotional by putting some sad music (with violins and piano obviously) and some character crying/angry, it doesn't work for me at least, and I cry very easily.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't bother to watch White Album 1 so I don't know the context of some songs featured here (like the so called White Album song) but the music played on the anime was pretty bad. The melody was weak, lyrics were nonsense (yeah, I know they played a part on the plot, still bad though) and the singer is mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu work here is plain bad, the serious tsundere has a serious tsundere voice and the moeblob has moeblob voice, what a surprise. I don't know why but it feels like a really cheap production anime hearing the character voices, the overly dramatic screams and the EEEEHHHHH contribute to this impression I had.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is good though, but nothing to write home about. The direction and animation per se were plain and mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: The story is not good, characters are bland, OST is forgettable when not annoying, seiyuu work is plain bad, art is decent. Would not recommend.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's the kind of show which makes you shout \"Why not threesome?\" throughout the entirety of it. There is one absolutely marvelous thing about this anime - it focuses solely on the main trio of characters, which means there is constant development. And yet, it somehow manages to suffer from the \"Sunohara syndrome\". Shame.\r\nIt is impressive beyond belief for a visual novel adaptation to be so coherent with its storytelling, though. I would guess the source material is linear. If not, that's some black magic right there.\r\nStory setting is \"meh\" at best, buch of kids with interest in music restart a failing music club. andprepare for their final school performance while they happen to develop an internal love triangle. That's all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt is quite average, although I have to say that facial expressions were often very cute and fitting. Sound-wise this show doesn't stand out from the rest of romance dramas, which is quite a huge con for an anime set in musical environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows strong point is it's main cast.\\n\r\nCharacters have quite complex personalities, being both caring and selfish, appreciative and greedy, humble and arrogant...\\n\r\nThe realistic girlish act of both of the female leads is adorable and works well with the density of the MC. Also, the glares of Kazusa and the femininity of Setsuna made me feel hot inside on multiple occasions. Well, you see, I use the word realistic, but I guess some degree of melodrama can't be avoided in this genre. If it wasn't for the constant pressure to squeeze some kind of emotional response from me, I would go higher with the score.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I have to give some credit to the final conclusion, which was incredibly well executed.\\n\r\nA good watch overall.\\n\\n\r\nStory          4/10\\n\r\nArt              6/10\\n\r\nSound         4/10\\n\r\nCharacters   8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment   9/10\\n\r\nOverall        7/10",

            "content": "After finishing White Album 2 I wasn't sure whether to feel offended or bemused. The show is a fairly straight-forward high school romance drama which follows Kitahara, Ogiso and Touma. These three are the main characters in the show and they receive all the attention. This is both good and bad as it means that we get to focus on their relationships with each other and their struggles in the more mundane life of high school. On the other hand the supporting cast receives almost no attention at all, and mostly serve as sounding boards when the main characters are in trouble.\r\nThe story is simple;Kitahara, our male hero, must convince Ogiso the school idol and Touma the enigmatic delinquent to join his k-on band. The goal of this is to perform in the school fair which is fast approaching. The relationships that evolve out of this simple premise is the main focus of the series. While it is a generic-sounding story-line, it remains interesting due to the fact that the fair does not happen at the end of the series, rather it happens somewhere in the middle. This gives us the chance to look at what happens both before, during and after. The chronological order of the series isn't entirely straight-forward either . All in all this gives a sense of forward motion, in other words the show doesn't really drag that much.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are nothing noteworthy, but the soundtrack has at least one track which caught my ear (White Album, as the series title). The voice acting didn't really stand out to me apart from Nabatame Hitomi who voiced Touma, she did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nThe art suffered at times, still shots were used when there was no real reason to use them, and it seemed as though there were problems in production. This was far more noteworthy in some of the middle episodes. Character designs didn't really stand out, and I actively disliked the design on Ogiso Setsuna. She's supposed to be a school idol but seemed far too generic for my taste. Touma was more interesting visually (which might very well be on purpose) while Kitahara is as generic as male protagonists go design wise.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing feels very focused on drawing out an emotional response from the viewer, yet I never felt as though I was closely connected to any of the characters, and at no point did I emphasize with them. Granted I'm a fair bit older than the characters, but that won't stop me from connecting with them if they're well-made. This made the not-so-subtle moments in the story stand out, and not in the way that the studio had intended.\\n\\n\r\nYet in the end I found quite a bit of enjoyment from the series. It's pacing, structure, and willingness to depart from a chronological timeline all worked in the show's favor. The characters were quite well written, and manage to hold up the story with believable actions. The ending, while definitely not perfect, tied the plot together well enough. If you like shows with a heavy focus on romance and drama then this is your cup of tea. If not then you might still get some enjoyment out of some of the more bizarre situations that arise.\\n\\n\r\nA well-deserved 7/10.",

Not that it's relatable to my circumstance or past history of relationships but because it's just a well produced work. Recommended to all who enjoy the romance/drama genre of anime. Typical high school love triangle, yet it's much more. The art, sound, and pace makes this anime into something words could never describe. It has a type of nostalgic atmosphere that really draws you to it and you feel apart of this complicated triangle. Simple enough as it is, the story isn't compelling enough to write a standard review about . Character personalities, dialogue,expressions, and actions with the colors/scenery leave an impact on you visually. I still see images in my head of the snow and the song the three perform on stage. The show moves slow and calmly until the end but that's what makes it great. It feels realistic and natural all the way through and as sad as the story is in itself, I like to remember the postive instances as the characters develop into close friends.",

            "content": "I almost didn't watch White Album 2. I was under the presumption that White Album 2 would be a continuation of the original White Album series. I was very put off by White Album 1, so I was hesitant to jump into this show. However, once I learned that White Album 2 was in no way related to White Album 1 (different characters, separate plots, etc.) I decided to give it a try. Boy, am I glad that I did. \r\nThis was the most emotionally impactful show I've watched in the past year. That is a really bold statement when you include shows like GoldenTime and 5 cm/s (and others of their ilk) in the list of things I've seen in the past year. If I rated this show on it's emotional impact alone, I would give it a 10/10. This show had me thinking about it for days after I finished watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters seem to be somewhat typical for an anime of this genre on the surface, but as the show progresses the depth of the story and characters becomes very apparent. This isn't a show that spoon feeds you plot points through dialogue though. You are expected to pay attention and take note of the characters' non-verbal cues as well in order to understand the depth of what is happening. I actually had to re-watch a couple episodes because I took a break mid-way through the series and forgot a few important details (that were very quick in terms of the screen time) that really impacted the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound are well produced and typical of a major anime studio. Nothing particularly special stands out about the art. It is very average for this genre. However, many people will mention the music--and the songs are well sung and somewhat catchy--but this isn't an anime about music. Music is more of plot device that brings the characters together and helps to drive their initial interactions. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, I felt the music choices were appropriate and helped amp up the emotions to 11. One quick note I have to sneak in is I really enjoyed that the sound director knew when SILENCE was actually the most effective tool. It was extremely powerful every time the music cut. I was happy to see a sound director who didn't create an overly dramatic scene with maudlin music and instead let the actions and atmospheric sounds create their own drama.\\n\\n\r\nI have minor complaints regarding the characters and the plot, but I don't feel they are significant enough that they should discourage or encourage someone to watch the show. Ultimately, this is a story of consummate love and the strife that often follows it. Many things that the characters do will be loved by some and hated by others. I try to analyze the characters from their point of view and decide for myself what I felt was appropriate or not, so I'll allow any potential viewers to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, those small flaws and the average art bring the series down to an 9/10 for me. Even so, I can't express how much I enjoyed this series. It is insanely close to being a 10/10, but I simply don't believe the animation quality and the other minor flaws allow me to give it full marks. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch for any fan of anime.",

            "content": "White Album 2 is certainly one of the better romances I've encountered on the anime spectrum, although it might not be for everyone. \r\nThe story of WA2 isn't too complicated; assuming you can read the decription above, you might think the story doesn't sound too complicated, or not very original. And you may be right, but what stood out to me was the execution. The story takes its time, focusing on the characters and relationships. I thought this was handled very well, but some people might not like the slow pacing. I won't go too in depth, since I want to avoid spoilers, but Iwill say that most tropes are absent or presented in a way that feels refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe three main characters-Haruki, Setsuna, and Touma-really drive the story with their actions and interactions with each other. They may not seem very interesting at first, but as the story progresses and the show examines their characters, it becomes clear that they are realistic and relatable with insecurities and passions of their own. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for WA2 are by no means bad, but they aren't much to write home about. The anime uses a somewhat muted color palette wuth focus on the scenery-such as the music room, the falling snow, the setting sun. It isn't stunning, but it still looks very nice and fits the mood of the anime well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundrack is probably one of the best parts of the anime-it's very nice and builds the atmosphere, and the opening is probably one of favorites. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is a mature romance that uses beautiful music and nice animation to tell a moving story and build realistic characters. If you're not a fan of slow-paced anime, this isn't for you. But the beautiful romance and story are most certainly worth watching, and I would definitely recommend it. \\n\\n\r\n8/10",

Then you've even got Starchild Studios, Producers of Toradora! A highley rated romance anime.\r\nMix together good ratings, and good romance you've got yourself white album 2. \r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\nThere was a problem brewing, the bullshit, lies and clich\u00e9\u2019s of anime have been used all up. Everyone turned their heads and said fuck it; we'll wait till we've got some more. \r\nStatelight, and Starchild Studios ran up to this accumulation of Truth, grabbed a handful and made a run for it. This handful they had randomly grabbed fromthis pile needed a name to go by. They gave it the alias, White Album 2.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance though, it\u2019s just as another screw up- visual novel adaption. It\u2019s cast away as another Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito fuck up of an anime, simply made for fan-service and Mountain dew sipping, 50 year old children living in their parents basements and surviving on dog food.\\n\\n\r\nYet, White Album 2 is the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth hurts. Whether your girlfriend is cheating on you, you've lost a close one or just the man down the street has just written \"Truth\" On his penis again, everyone has different ways of taking, solving, and living through the problem. It's because of this that White Album 2 brings to us a new \"Type\" of anime. Though it has been done before, I'm not sure (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) it's been done this well. What I\u2019m talking about is the sheer amount of reality there is in this anime. It's so real, I even answered one of the characters questions because I got mixed up between real life and this anime, and believed it was directed at me. That's why; at the end of the anime I shed man tears. (Not to be confused with regular tears). The anime shows the \u201cTruth\u201d of romance. It\u2019s not all pretty; it\u2019s not all flowers it\u2019s not all birds and doves, and it\u2019s not Pink Blossom. Love is painful.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has everything that a romance, slice of life and music anime needs. An interesting love trio, a realistic an entertaining plotline and good music. This show wasn\u2019t your typical slice of life \u201cK-ON, Fill them up so much you can fill a canyon filler\u201d anime, it was plot, development and enjoyment. In fact, it was so unflawed I could use this anime as a shield and sit through an entire episode of mars of destruction, though I might have had to skip the opening and ending (lets not get crazy here, I still have a good 80 years ahead of me).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really touched upon some pretty deep subjects such as Trust and Responsibility, showing how a deeper connection is needed, and more communication is also needed for a relationship to take place. For instance, the main character had no idea that the Touma was interested in him. Touma, the typical \u201cTsundere\u201d type of character. her personality made all advances impossible for Kitahara, leading to a sad ending where they both knew they initially loved each other, but their personalities got in front of that. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion there are two ways you can go about watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\n1.\tThe most typical way, watch it and enjoy it throughout.\\n\r\n2.\tWatch it, and learn from it.\\n\\n\r\nI took the second rout; I\u2019ve learned two main things:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tCommunication is the most important thing in any relationship; Friendship or Dating.\\n\r\n2.\tThe Truth hurts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd some scores for those who wanted some:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nHate music and wondering whether to go for the watch or not? Well lets put it this way. It\u2019s better than the god-awful attempt of a love story some call Twilight, so it\u2019s worth a shot.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "White Album 2 Review\r\nThere are certain anime which leave a certain impression on you after you finish watching it. It\u2019s a feels like a void, that after watching this you won\u2019t be able to find anything to fill the emptiness that this show leaves on an emotional level. White Album 2 is a rollercoaster ride of emotion, and trust me it is one hell of a ride.\r\nWhite Album 2 was done by Satelight who have done a wide range of anime from Noein to Fairy Tail.  \r\nThe story follows Haruki Kitahara and the light music club in his high school. It takes place inthe last half of his final year in high school. The light music club is disbanding and the only thing that can save it is if Haruki gets the mysterious piano player from the room across from where he practices and finds a replacement singer before the school festival. Now White Album is a sequel but a standalone sequel, you don\u2019t need to see White Album to understand what is going on in White Album 2. The story itself is what White Album 2 does very well. It is a drama, romance, slice of life anime and from the anime from the same genres I have seen White Album 2 is a great one, it does have its flaws but so does every anime. The story is set in two arcs: before the festival and the aftermath of the festival. The first focuses on character development and showing us the personality of the characters setting up the second half of the show. The second arc presents us with the development of the characters relationships with each other and expands upon their already developed characters. The story is tear jerking and wonderful and fills you with so many emotions through the course of thirteen episodes. To me it is a good love story with many twist and turns from, illness to love triangles.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very well crafted. To start things off you have our main lead Haruki Kitahara, he is a smart, preachy, meddlesome and caring boy who would do anything to help his friends. He is your typical male lead from a slice of life show. Haruki is also a member of the light music club and he plays the guitar. There is also the dual female lead: Setsuna Ogiso and Kazuki Touma. Setsuna is the school idol who everyone adores, with a beautiful voive. Kazuki is the mysterious student transferred from the elite music department. Both characters like Haruki\u2019s are very well fleshed out, they both add something different to the drama aspect of the show. Setsuna is the happy go lucky girl of the group who is near enough perfect, whilst Kazuki is your typical quiet tsundere character who at first doesn\u2019t say much but you have a deep feeling she wants to say more than she does. In anime I usually don\u2019t like the tsundere characters but Kazuki Touma is the exception. Her character is so well developed and her interactions with the other characters so well done that I couldn\u2019t help but love her as a character. There are a few side charcaters like Haruki\u2019s friends and Kazuki\u2019s mother and they fill their roles perfectly. The only character I actually had a problem with was Haruki himself just for the fact that he was a little bit dense when it came to women but I suppose it was kind of a character trait as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite good. It\u2019s not Kill La Kill or Gurren Lagann quality but it\u2019s very pretty and works well with the show. The animation was at its best during the musical performances especially at the festival performance episode. They used great use of lighting in the show which helped the moods of the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. Its musical score fits the show so well. The songs used in the performance scenes are well written and catchy as well as the opening and ending songs. The music in most places was light and peaceful and added a sense of magic to the show. The voice actors do a great job making their character\u2019s come to life. Hitomi Nabatame did a great job voicing Kazuki Touma. She has appeared in a wide variety of anime like Oreimo voicing Saori. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have gave my praises I should probably let you in on the flaws of the show. To me they are pretty minor, the biggest of these minor flaws being how abruptly the show ends. It just stops. However it could be argued that this is to show reality and that even though the characters want one thing doesn\u2019t mean they will always get it.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently I White Album 2 hasn\u2019t been licensed outside of Japan. I searched for a while and I couldn\u2019t find any details on if it was licensed or not. However fear not if you want to watch this anime then you can do so on Crunchyroll, I will leave a link and you can go watch it and if you want to enjoy White Album 2 to the fullest you can sign up for the 2 week free membership and try out their premium services. Thank you for reading my review and till next time sayonara\\n",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nEvery season, despite my best efforts, there is a great anime that slips beneath my radar. Last fall, that anime was White Album 2\u2014an excellently told romantic drama that isn\u2019t afraid to stab you right in the emotions and then twist the knife just to be sure. \r\n*Note: Despite being \u201cWhite Album 2,\u201d this is not a sequel as a much as it is a second anime set in the same world. While characters and events of White Album are mentioned, they have no impact on the story.\r\nA Solid, Serious Love Story\r\nIn these days where the amount of rom-coms vastly outnumber serious romantic dramas, WhiteAlbum 2 is a bit of a rarity. It is the tale of three seniors in a high-end college prep school: Haruki, an excellent student learning to play the guitar, Kazusa the \u201cbad-girl\u201d (and secret musical savant of the class), and Setsuna, the school idol. The three form a band and, as the story progresses, form a deep friendship that eventually turns into a love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a great example of a group of people struggling to keep both the friendships they have and yet get the romance they want as well. Moreover, it is not simply two girls fighting over the boy they want; it is a true love triangle where the friendship between the two girls is on the same level of importance as the romance each desires with Haruki. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it\u2019s one of those shows that will put your emotions through the wringer several times before it is done. \\n\\n\r\nHuman, Though Not Always Likeable\\n\r\nHaruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna are all well-rounded characters. They have their own goals, backstories, and motivations. Moreover, they develop as the story goes on. But what makes them human are the dumb and/or downright terrible things they do/inadvertently do to one another. No one is evil: They always have the best of intentions, but sometimes letting feelings rule over logic is the surest recipe for disaster. \\n\\n\r\nSelective Directing\\n\r\nFor the most part, the story of White Album 2 is told from Haruki\u2019s point of view. Occasionally we see Setsuna or Kazusa\u2019s actions without Haruki present, but these scenes tend to be short and/or serve to set the stage for Haruki\u2019s next entrance. While watching, it is something you probably won\u2019t notice nor think about\u2014until secrets start being revealed as the anime nears its end. While feeling like you are getting the complete story as you watch, the selective viewpoint serves to blind both Haruki and you to all that is happening behind the scenes\u2014especially in the case of Setsuna. \\n\\n\r\nA Villain in Her Own Love Story\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Setsuna is the deepest character in White Album 2. On one hand, she is beautiful and talented. On the other hand, she is emotionally scarred by rejection from her friends years before\u2014making her now keep everyone at a distance. Yet, her backstory is just the tip of her development. As the series goes on, we see her gain friends and even enter into her first romantic relationship. But what\u2019s most interesting is how she views herself in this whole situation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is one of those works that showcases one of life's simple truths: Love is messy. Three good people with all the best of intentions heading in can easily find themselves tangled in a mess of emotions where there is no right answer; someone, potentially everyone, is going to get hurt. If you need a serious romantic drama in your life, there are few better emotional rollercoasters in recent anime than White Album 2. Just don\u2019t expect to come out of it feeling happy and fulfilled. \\n",

            "content": "STORY\r\nI found the story of White Album 2 to be a rather simple, but mature one. It's rare that I'd find a romance this mature. What makes this show different from let's say Clannad is that while the focus is the romance; it covers other themes as well. The themes of betrayal is real heavy, as well as the theme of selfish love. But when it's not deep into drama, White Album 2 is an enjoyable story about three people in a band. The problems the band go through to get things done before the festival, and the bond of the Haruki, Setsuna, and Kazusais very strong. The only thing that might bother others, is the very slow, but subtle pacing. Some may feel not much was done in the episode, but something was done; that may come into focus later. But, really this isn't a problem for me. As, I enjoyed the interaction of the character a lot. \\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nThe characters are what really made the show for me. Well, three characters. Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna. They really do seem like the typical anime characters, at first. Haruki, is your harem main character, Setsuna is your misunderstood idol, and Kazusa is the silent expert. But as the series goes on, they turn out to be all very flawed characters, in a good way that makes everyone give off a very human vibe. They are all selfish in one way or the other, and it really makes the relationship between them really interesting, and heart breaking to watch. Setsuna is notable for this. Her actions weren't always likable, but I understood them, and she didn't come off as a character of malice. But as a rather humane-like character. Same thing with Haruki and Kazusa. They both come off as humane. But, I found  Setsuna the most easy to relate to, because of her overall character theme of her character arc. Which I would not dare spoil. \\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\n The animation is actually nothing too special, it works,and that's it. While White Album 2, does not excel in the actual animation, it does do some excellent shading and lighting. Every character in the show has some shiny appeal to them, and it makes the character designs look more pretty than it should. The lighting is very pretty. During the night is particular good looking. The night just gives off a cold tone to me, and when it's after school, the sky just looks like how I'd like after school in real life to be. (Instead we get hot sun...)\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n The music of  White Album 2 is kind of underwhelming , but at the same time I it supports the scenes they were used in greatly. I notice the music and at the same time I don't. I don't remember most songs, but the moment I hear them; memories flood in. But what really made me like the music, is  the insert songs. I usually don't go for the 90's pop, but I really like the insert songs. One of my favorites is the song, \"White Album\", really is a great song, that connects the characters. Overall, while the soundtracks mostly just support the anime greatly, the insert songs, are very effective.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n I found White Album not to be the best or original romance ever, but really this shows has some of the most complex characters in a romance I have ever seen. While anime like Nagi no asukara, do indeed show that being in love means possibly hurting someone else. White Album 2 shows us that being in love really makes us monsters, selfish, and sometimes it can make us do irrational things. Overall, White Album 2 has to be one of the best shows that aired in 2013. And, I kinda regret passing it off as a shit harem. Man, as much I would like the rest of the story animated, I don't think it will.  With the low sales in Japan, but for what we have, I'm satisfied.\\n",

The drama wasn't very well done because of many cliche events. The ending was just poorly done. While it is supposed to be a sad drama, I didn't really feel for it. The romance was super cliche.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nNot the best, not Gakuen Handsome.\r\nSound 8/10\r\nFor a music anime, it had some good tracks, but they were overplayed.\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nThe character developments were really well done up until halfway through the story when they became cliche and irritable, their personalitiesand actions became superficial and just didn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThe ending ruined it for me, I probably gave my enjoyment an 8/10 up until the last few episodes when everything mixed together and became a mess. Character interactions as well as story events were poorly done towards the end ruining my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't watch it again. It started out strong but didn't quite reach my expectations. Just a typical cliche drama about love and friendship. Overall, decent characters, terrible execution of drama. I would give my overall rating a 6.7 if decimals were involved. However, this is just my opinion, many people seemed to like it, I personally didn't. Watch it if you're into Korean Dramas because they have a few things in common, long drama with decent characters and bad endings. Don't watch it if you're into lighthearted or slice of life anime. This anime is not laid back nor does it have relatable elements.",

This might be weird to say about a high school romance anime, but it felt more mature than a normal show of the genre. This maturity made the relationships in the show feel more realistic. \r\nI usually don't talk about or think about themes when reviewing shows, as it usually isn't pertinent enough to my rating to bother mentioning, but I loved the theme of White Album 2. The messiness, and non-optimal scenarios that is love. That things don't workout for the best just because its fated that way but because of decisions we make, and that sometimes even if the right thing is the right thing, for ouselves it can be the wrong thing. And similarly, sometimes doing the wrong thing is right for us. *Minor Spoilers* It also had what I would rate as the most tastefully done, best sex scene in an anime. I wholeheartedly believe that scene was actually important in making WA2 what it is and would hurt my rating of the shows plot and story progression had it been left out. *Spoiler end*\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a great 8.5, which makes is a top 10 show on my list. It is fantastic. Definitely a great watch. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a side note, I absolutely loved the music in this series. It was great.",

            "content": "I really wish there were more anime like White Album 2. Nothing about it is overly complex or ambiguous, and it makes for a relaxing show. My favorite genre is slice-of-life, and I tend to watch one whenever I finish an anime that is very mentally strenuous. White Album 2 made for a very pleasant experience in a very short period of time. \r\nStarting with the story of White Album 2, we find our characters in generic Japanese high school #1978650. The main male protagonist is Haruki Kitahara, a kind and responsible young man with a passion for music. His wish is to revive theLight Music Club after its disbandment and play in an upcoming school festival. In my opinion, Haruki is somewhat generic. His design is lacking of any distinct characteristics, and he really is just a normal guy with a normal life and normal goals. That's not always bad however, as it is more realistic than a main who is overly bombastic, perverted or lazy. He's just average is all, but that is ok for this kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nVery quickly we see a simple love triangle form between Haruki and the other main characters. The first of which is Setsuna Ogiso, a kind girl who is a talented singer, as well as the idol of her school for winning the Miss Houjou Academy pageant. The second is Kazusa Touma, a very reclusive girl who is also a talented pianist. Haruki finds himself between these two ladies as he needs both of their support to revive the Light Music Club. Conveniently, Haruki is the guitarist, so the singing of Setsuna and the piano playing of Kazusa is the perfect fit. \\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with White Album 2 is the cast. It\u2019s not that they are bad characters, but rather that the anime kind of \"plays it safe,\" so to speak. The supporting cast is very small, and they get very limited screen time. Like Haruki, they lack defining characteristics, and their development is little to none. The only characters that I feel stick out are the two female leads. This is partly due to them being the only characters with backstory that isn't directly related to the plot. However, the lack of character development is not a hindrance, as the story is not so complex as to require such depth.     \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes White Album 2 better than other love triangle stories is the music. I don't necessarily mean the soundtrack, however. It\u2019s just that for the majority of the show, music is what drove our characters. Music is what brought them together in the first place. And yes, the soundtrack is quite good. Although a bit overplayed, there is one song that appears several times during the anime that is especially good. Appropriately, it is called \"White Album.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, I did lose a little interest in the latter portion of the show. I did just say that the music is the most special thing about White Album 2, and the second half was primarily about the romance between our main characters. This makes sense of course, but it is saddening when your favorite thing about an anime takes the back seat for something else. Still, nothing about the second half is bad. In fact, it\u2019s fantastic. The story is paced very well and it leads up to a satisfying conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Album 2 is not a masterpiece, but it is certainly well done. Being able to watch a good story in such a small amount of time was very refreshing. If you are not a big slice-of-life fan like myself, there are certainly better anime out there for you to watch. But if your tastes are similar to mine, you should put this anime on your list.\\n",

I think it was a trainwreck kind of show, but surprisingly it was the good kind of trainwreck. \r\nI liked how it ended. It felt natural. Because life isn`t always about dream-like encounters and never ending hapiness. I could see that ending coming right from the very beginning but it was still really enjoyable. \r\nI`m not gonna lie, before watching episode 1, i thought \"this will be a freaking disaster and i know i`ll drop it right in the first three episodes\".\r\nBut guess what? I ended up liking it alot.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, the thing with certain anime series is that sometimes they try too hard to portray a realistic story. And they often fail (hard) in doing that. But then you have shows like White Album 2, that actually succeed in creating a serious and mature atmosphere. The characters here are human and naturally have flaws. And that`s a good thing. It makes them more likable that way. And harder to blame for what they do during the series. \\n\r\nBesides, it has an outstanding soundtrack, a very, very good one. \\n\r\nSure, i don`t think this is the kind of story that can blow you away, far from it, but it`s definitely one of the best romance stories of 2013, so you shoul give it a try!",

            "content": "{edit: And now I find out this was 1/3 of the whole story. I demand big red letter warnings for this stuff! Note that this could still potentially be in 9/10 range if we consider this was just a third of the story, and the rest of the story holds up to expectations.}\r\nWatching original White Album anime is not required at all. This is a separate story. Interesting production values, environments and everything except characters and animation are great, and characters aren't bad at all either. But sometimes there are noticeable inconsistencies between scenes, and character animation that feels a bit static and not livelyenough. But it's definitely passable and doesn't detract too much from the experience. First half was pretty great, it made me expect at least 9/10 and a potential 10/10. It's one of those shows that's hard to stop watching as you really wanna know what happens next. There's some great music, great romance and solid writing. I especially loved how it was actually about music, unlike 90% of the so called music themed shows out there,*khm*K-On!*khm*. Another obvious plus is that it takes itself seriously, so it's pretty much completely free of romcom anime logic and animeisms. Despite not being a comedy, it often made me laugh or chuckle out loud using rather tasteful and subtle humor. \\n\\n\r\nThen in second half it loses its momentum, for a couple of episodes, and then goes on to become sort of a semi-beautiful trainwreck till the end. It has a couple of moments where strange character actions get perfectly rationalised a bit later and you just wanna hit yourself for doubting the writer. Don't doubt this writer, and you won't semi-ruin a couple of great scenes for yourself. But then there are some other such moments where things are just supposed to be just taken at face value. So does the whole story structure work in the end? I honestly can't say for sure, but if it does, then it's stretched to the near breaking point all over the place. In a way that I feel justified in saying it definitely should have handled the whole thing differently, regarding the second half. But it's hard to point at any single thing and say it's completely unbelievable or uncalled for. It feels like a story that's barely holding itself together and remaining coherent. Unfortunately, for me it caused emotional detachment for the bigger part of the second half, even though not all of it is bad, and some parts on their own are pretty good and effective in surprising the viewer and delivering emotion. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself didn't have enough resolution, again, it had barely enough resolution in order for it to legitimately be an ending. Another downside was that it was a bit too predictable after a certain reveal, whereas before said reveal it's nearly impossible to guess where the story is heading. It makes the first half better at the expense of the second half. The only thing in the said predictability that was intriguing was wondering how the hell is writer going to get out of this mess in a decent way. And then it turns out it gets out of it in a pretty lame messy way. Enough ambiguity time for spoilers: \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD: \\n\\n\r\nOne major problem I had was the implication that Setsuna was to blame for pursuing Haruki, and that her suffering is kind of a karmic punishment for it? That's bullshit reasoning and I'm not buying it. It only works in characterisation of what a saint Setsuna really is, and that's only aspect of it I can accept. Having ending rely on that made it feel cheap and incomplete to me. Too bad inserting school days ending would have been too much of a ripoff for it to be viable here. The ''I obviously lied'' twist near the end and the scene it leads into was the most effective scene in the whole show. It pretty much made me want to scream ''Somebody give this girl a bloody chainsaw!!!''. But unfortunately this anime just didn't set up such an ending so it was pretty obviously not what was up. I was still hoping for some miraculous satisfactory ending that I didn't see coming, but we kinda get ''and that's it folks''. I guess the absolute superhuman unbelievably mega awesome kindness and tolerance that best girl displays in the end is meant as a final resolution of some sort? She's not giving up on him after he gave her the reason enough to literally chainsaw him. But what's with his feelings? So are they good now? I doubt it? I guess one of my biggest issues was seeing this level of moegirl suffering end up unavenged. I need my vengeance damnit! She's too good for that jerk! I need to see her happy aaargh! And no, clinging to that jerk doesn't count as happy. Damnit emotional investment! Spinoff! NOW! \\n\\n\r\nedit: Or as I later found out, two more seasons, NOW!",

            "content": "Firstly, thank you White album 2 for making me cry like a bitch. You are the second anime to do that to me after Anohana. \r\nI believe White Album 2 is something what all romance lovers seek and want to watch.\r\nLets take a look at its different aspects.\r\nStory: I give the story a 10. It revolves around three people Kitahara Haruki, Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. As you might have guessed with 2 female characters and 1 male it is bound to be a love triangle. And here it is your guess is correct. Is this series generic? At one part I would say yes(won'tgive you the spoilers though). The three main characters somehow come together in the Light Music Association with a lot of effort but up by Kitahara. The heart breaking tale of the three then begin which is sure to touch your hearts.\\n\r\nArt: Giving it a 9. Only one word \"beautiful\".\\n\r\nSound: Well the anime has a musical setting. Obviously the sound quality is something it should be praised for. The voice actors are in perfect sync with the Characters. Also I must say the songs in the anime are just wonderful. I hardly felt like skipping them(and here I am who doesn't even understand the songs but still want to listen to them).\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development is slow and steady and yeah you get attached to the characters of the story. At one scene I was like please don't cry Kazusa, I can't see you cry.(Yea that kind of a feeling comes every now and then).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Sure the series is enjoyable. If it wasn't I wouldn't have bothered to write a review. The twists and turns in the story you getting totally immersed in the story. What is it if not enjoyment?\\n\r\nOverall the series is a 10 for me. \\n\r\nP.S. Give it a try its lovely.",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE and R-RATED REVIEW:\r\nHere are some things you MUST know before watching this anime:\r\n - This anime is only 1/3 of the entire story. I would recommend Googling a summary of the follow-up chapters from the visual novel or game, called the CC and the Coda. These are a real doozy; keep this in mind when the plot becomes absolute raw emotion and just generally crazy as hell.\r\n - This anime is based off of eroge visual novels. And it definitely plays like one. The pacing is very similar to what you would expect from a visual novel. Although the VN's are pretty sexual, thisanime is definitely toned down from that. Probably appropriate for anyone 13+.\\n\r\n - The beginning is EXTREMELY slow. Like, I almost stopped watching after episode 6 because I felt like nothing was really progressing. There I was, in bed with the flu, and I was STILL bored watching this... and I literally had nothing else to do. But hey, that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had an extremely hard time developing an opinion of this anime, but I feel as though I have reached my \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10 - 3 of the most unlikely of friends come together to form a small band to play for the school's upcoming fair. Nothing special, until later, where the REAL plot starts to kick in. However, as mentioned before, I still felt the introduction was WAY too long and slow for my tastes.\\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10 - I thought the art in this anime was completely run-of-the-mill. If you like that KyotoAni art style then you will probably enjoy the looks of this, but I found it average at best. Also, that animation of Haruki's guitar playing, besides the intro, is laughable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10 - Obviously if you're making an anime about a band of musicians, there's gotta be music. That White Album song is super awesome, even if it sounds like something straight out of 90's pornography. I appreciated the background piano tracks; they were pretty nice but not spectacular or anything I would listen to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10 - The one thing I thought was the most unique about this anime is that the characters are very human like, especially near the conclusion. This anime isn't always lovey dovey. It can be ruthless at times - to each other, and to the audience.  Besides this, I won't go in detail of the characters in general for 2 reasons: First of all because the side characters are mainly useless and rigid. Secondly because this is a spoiler-free review and the two female leads are very complex, so it's better left unsaid for the sake of this review.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10 - As I said before, this anime is incomplete plot-wise and the beginning is very slow. I liked the show at times, but I mostly found myself bored, as terrible as that sounds. The drama in this show can be a little absurd at times too, with characters being in places they have no right to be just for the sake of them seeing or hearing specific events. The ending was pretty tense, but I was left unsatisfied by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10 - This score is found by taking the scores of all categories and finding the average. And a 6 it shall be, which I find appropriate for this.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Only in niche cases, if you are looking for a heavy drama with some music. Otherwise I would tell you to pass.",

            "content": "There's no doubt that White Album 2 will be different from other romance anime you watch. Instead of taking an easy way out with the ending as so many romance shows do nowadays, you'll actually get a conclusion, even if it is somewhat disappointing to be honest. \r\nThe story follows Haruki, Setsuna, and Kazusa as the three form a band for their school's festival. As expected, a love triangle begins, but unlike most love triangle scenarios, this one actually does an incredible job developing each character's emotions and really showing you that everyone loses in a love triangle and that no one really is thebad guy. This is pretty difficult to pull off since it's so easy to just pile the blame onto one character who just breaks everyone's heart. But because the inner workings of the triangle don't really get revealed until halfway through the show, the first half will probably be boring if you're not a fan of watching concerts, because after all it is categorized as a music anime. After episode 6 or so, a lot of plot and character development happens as you begin to learn that because love in itself is a selfish thing (you want that person for yourself and vice versa), a love triangle cannot satisfy everyone, but the key like I said before is that because each character doesn't want to hurt anyone else, they lie both to each other and to themselves about how they really feel. This is probably the strongest aspect of the show. However, the ending definitely is disappointing. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be satisfied with it, but in the end you realize it's realistic; a love triangle could end no other way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay, but like what a lot of other reviews have said, the way they animated their movements when playing instruments was a little bland and not expressive.\\n\\n\r\nSince it is a music anime, you're going to be hearing a ton of it, and honestly the music is fantastic. It would've been difficult to watch it through if the music had been bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really well developed too, but you might not get that feeling at first. They might seem pretty cliche in the beginning: a nice guy, an outgoing popular girl, and a talented tsundere. But soon you'll realize that they're both immature and mature in their own ways. They all want to preserve their friendships with each other, so they think lying and burying their feelings is the best option, but alas a love triangle never works out that way. By the end you'll be sympathizing with all the characters, discovering that given the position they were in, they probably did make the best choice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought this was a fantastic anime that was well executed. It's not easy to make a love triangle situation where no one is the bad guy, but they pulled it off with White Album 2. If you're in the mood for a romance anime with an actual ending and not some weird harem conclusion, then this is the show for you.",

            "content": "I originally gave this anime a ten, but after a few days of thinking and rumination, I finally settled down with what I think is a fair score of 8. Why? Well...\r\nWhite Album 2, for me, is very good. Each aspect of this anime is done very well. The story is fantastic. It is very believable, and you will get invested to the plot and the characters. Speaking of characters, that for me is another strong point of White Album. Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna are all very likable, and you could easily emphatize with all 3. They are all three dimensional, with motivations, goals, andflaws. Another strength of this anime is the sound. Though the BGM doesn't exactly stand out, the music that the characters perform are actually very good, and you would fall in love with 'White Album' by episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have to state any weaknesses to this show, it would have to be the animation. Stills appear numerous times. The one that particularly irks me is the concert one, where instead of showing us, say, the atmosphere within the gymnasium, or the audience just rocking out to the music, we get a montage recycled animation from the last episodes. A bit lazy there, I think. It didn't actually affect my experience much, though, since I'm more of a story guy than an art guy.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you could see where I'm coming from when I gave this anime an initial 10. So why did I take it back? Well, in my personal opinion, there isn't what I'd call an 'x-factor' to it. Even though White Album 2 is great in pretty much all aspects, there's really nothing that stands out from it. I noticed that those animes that are 10-worthy really has aspects that make it stand out from the usual crowd, i.e. Steins;Gate with its stellar storytelling and character development, or Clannad A.S. with its heart wrenching scenes. \\n\\n\r\nBut for what it is, White Album 2 is a really damn good romance. It's very well made, and I highly recommend that you pick it up if you have the time.\\n\\n\r\n(Note that this is my first review, so apologies.)",

            "content": "This anime has two distinct phases. The first is where they're preparing for the concert. This focus on establishing each of the three main characters and developing the relationship between all three of them. This part is good because each of these three characters is interesting. The protagonist being someone that is blatantly honest and quite competent was actually pretty refreshing considering how these usually go. Touma too was interesting, in that she was a tsundere, but definitely felt like one with a lot more depth than a standard one, and came across as a lot more genuine.\u00a0Kazusa too had depth in regards to howshe portrays herself and her past. Because the characters are interesting and likable, seeing them give it their all and managing to acheive what they're working hard for was quite satisfying as well, and hence this portion came across rather well. However, this is all just a build up to the next phase, which is the true core of the story. The relationship between all three is developed quite well and the viewer is very invested in it, but once the concert is over, the relationship immediately begins to come apart, with the three desperately attempting to hold it together. While the first half developed the characters well, it focused mostly on their good aspects and how those helped make the relationship between them stronger and gained happiness as a result. In the next phase, their worst traits and weaknesses come out, we see them suffer for it. The show very much conveys that relationships can become incredibly complex and tremendously painful. And as the show approaches the end, and the attempt at holding things together completely falls apart, it gets incredibly intense. Touma's story especially hit really hard and had the strongest emotional impact on me. All of this comes to an end that while not happy in the slightest, felt true to the direction things were going, and while not satisfying exactly, it felt right. The choice to skip the final concert song, and then play it at the end was strange, but ultimately I would have to say it worked very well in hitting the emotional beat it needed to.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation, it was really good. In terms of music, it was good but not as good as it should have been. Music is a major aspect of this show, as it was with the first White Album. However, here the best tracks were those taken straight out of the first show, and while those were chosen and used incredibly well, it didn't feel that great when it comes to new tracks, or mainly track really. The OP track was great, but it also being the main final track felt somewhat weak. The soundtrack too, would be good for a non music related show, but here it felt weak, relying too much on repeating old tracks. \\n\\n\r\nI should also note that the ending was mostly judged from the perspective that the story isn't anywhere near over, because it really isn't. The majority of the story is yet to take place from the perspective of the VN. Though as I can't get to the rest of the story now, possibly never, that does sour me a bit.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: An incredibly impactful anime centered around music and relationships.",

The story goes from mediocre to fantastic as you insight to each side of the characters. Also, without any spoilers of the story, the ending was extremely emotional.\r\nArt\r\nThe art of the show was great it was nothing unheard of but it did look fantastic. Also, the characters were all pretty and nice to look at.\r\nSound\r\nThis was a big part as the show did involve songs sung from characters. The songs chosen were excellent to match the mood of thestory as it progressed. Not only the song that were sung were good but songs played beneath conversation were fantastic, all adding lots of emotion to each and every seen which it was added too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nI think all the characters were beautiful and fun to learn about. Not much else to say but there was lots of depth and build up that allowed the show to have the impact it wanted from emotions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI truly had an up and down adventure with this show as I would hope one would win over but the mixes of events swung me back and forth. This watch was definitely emotional as I could most definitely sympathize with the emotion the characters felt.",

            "content": "White Album, 2 a anime that started off great potential but is squandered with bad writing, horrible storytelling and a idiotic conclusion. Its pretty disappointing and frustrating because w.a.2 could really have been amazing. After reading some of the glowing reviews and seeing it scored so highly, I went in with hopeful expectations but ended up severely disappointed. \r\nArt: \r\nGreat Artwork all around. The character models and backgrounds are well detailed. The more crucial emotional scenes were especially impressive and beautiful with the snow,lighting and coloring.\r\nSound:\r\n With a title white album comes with expectations in this department an  it did not disappoint. The scorewas somber and beautiful throughout the story and conveyed the mood of the scenes perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Story: (I put this category together as my opinion coincides and pertains greatly with both)\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes left me hopeful and excited how the characters and their relationships would develop and how the story would unfold but instead of leading into something great... it falls flat.  I can't go into details without giving MAJOR spoilers and my review won't much sense without revealing them but i'll do my best. \\n\r\nAs a story themed around Love and Friendship its done horribly. The romantic feelings and love the mc's has toward one of female's mc's is severely underdeveloped and doesn't even make sense, it basically comes out of nowhere. The story/flashbacks only portrays his kindness and friendship never love and so when he reveals his love to her its unbelieveable, totally spoiling the main conflict! Setsuna's troubled past with friends in middle school that shape her thinking and motivations is also laughably underdeveloped, its shown/talked about very lighty for 3 minutes! Its just plain written poorly and a super weak motivation overall why she is crazily obsessed with holding the 3 mc's friendship forever.  Even the conclusion's reveal that shows the main twist and main motivating decision and logic of one the mc's is just baffling and implausible , making you question and think  \"really....that was the whole point behind that mc's actions and decisions... how nonsensical and moronic\".\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAs I cannot give any proper review why i scored white album 2 a \"5\"  without giving spoilers I apologize. While i don't think its the worst romance anime ive seen, its average at best. Maybe watch it on rainy day if you got nothing to watch and bored, is the only way i can recommend it.  \\n\\n",

Even though the ending broke my heart a little I think they should of not made it go that way but what can we do for that now?.. Please come back for a season 2 I beg you ;( SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 10/10: I absolutely loved the story to this! I've never watch a romantic, music type anime and this has set the bar high for any others types that come by.. I kind of hate how the ending turned out on the 13th episode because none of the main characters got what theywant and that's what kind of sucks about it.. Haruki was left with someone he didn't love, Setsuna is left with someone who doesn't love her and Kazusa flew away leaving behind her lover and best friend betraying both of them! God it's just so hard! Back to the review.. \\n\r\nThe story line was amazing, how it brought all the characters together was incredible.. I really don't have anything that really stuck a thorn in my side (apart from the ending) that's going to bother me that much.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I really liked the art style for this anime.. I'm really attracted to this type of anime style and won't settle from any unrealistic type of anime so it was nice to see this type again!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Sound for this series was amazing, I'm a big fan of the White album song and have fallen in love with it! The songs and music they used for some of the scenes aswell were quite amazing!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: It was a good twist towards the end seeing how they would try to stay separate but it didn't end up that way. Each character progressed very well in the series and we got to saw how each of them came out of their shells and it was really well made characters.. I felt like we were made to hate each of them in their own ways aswell which was really good..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Would highlight recommend this to someone but don't expect to get your hopes up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nA little rant: It really annoyed me seeing how people would post about how bad they felt for Setsuna in the end, but yet she basically caused all of this.. She knew how the girl felt and how it was going to go but yet she wanted him all her self..",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nNow that I've watched it for the 3rd time, decide to make a quick \"review\"\r\n\u2726Story\r\nDarker drama/romance. Not sure what else to say without spoiling. All I can say this is my \"close to heart\" Anime, was story had lot of elements that felt personal and somewhat (potentially) similar to own events. Same for the characters, saw in some fair amount of self and some others. Seen this anime 3 times and every time ended up depressed/crying. Think it's going to be my yearly Christmas re-watch.\r\nPoint being, storyis serious drama between the cast, main issue being inability of being true to self or self-sacrifice. Their great relationship, their breakage, their doom, their happiness, their issues and solutions. I found it deeply relatable and depressing. Probably one of the best drama/romance Anime and the most real (for me) than most of the romance/drama tropes or moronic causes/reasons. Considering it even had aspect I hate regarding relationships/drama/romance, I just couldn't hate the characters because of their reasoning or inability to be true to self.. thus ending up in such predicament. \\n\\n\r\nOnly reason I couldn't give it 10, even though purely on personal/emotional side I gave/wanted (changed back to 9) it 10. Would be that I was not satisfied the way it ended. And a bit of a bummer was as well that the story presentation felt sometimes slow, but the event rich story felt a too bit fast. Meaning that they story conveyance felt a bit incorrect for me.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Superb more serious and darker drama/romance.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nFound art the most beautiful looking standard art-style Visual Novel I've seen. It felt fitting, great and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was absolutely superb, superb vocal tracks, superb piano tracks. Probably only part I didn't like were the guitar solos (don't like guitars).\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nGrowth and depth were great. Love absolutely Touma, would love her being my real waifu. Did love her for another reason as well, but that won't bother with.\\n\\n\r\nMain guy, is student president stereotype with a weakness to own emotions or others. Then we have Setsuna, the idol-like persona with actually snobby/needy personal side. And Touma, silent, asocial, tries to be strong yet actually is really fragile, caring and weak. Of course each character had a lot more to them, but those aspects you will learn by watching the Anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nDid probably already sum it up mostly in the story section. But I can add, that even though I absolutely enjoyed this Anime, even though it made me absolutely depressed, and all the 3 times made me cry and being especially personal, it was  step away from perfection to my taste. And yeah, as mentioned, the issue was way it wrapped up. I probably will have to eventually  play the Visual Novel.. which I'm not sure if my heart can take it. Because supposedly VN is even more depressing and darker.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, superb Anime in almost every aspect.",

There are many moments where you think \"He shouldn't choose this way\"(Well this is what i think).\r\nMany people were refering to School days but it ended quite differently though i didn't like theending so much, it began Amazing and ended amazing\\n\r\nIt's not like it's a bad ending or something like that but i am not satisfied with it, i don't like with who he ended with, he just dropped the other without even thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is not bad, although not really original but yeah no one cares about it anymore. What i like the most is that the characters feel about what they have done, which many anime's dont have and i think it's something special about it.\\n\r\nIt was one of the most realistic anime i've watched in a long time around the Romance Genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not very different from some other anime's but there wasn't a moment where it was Bad, Some scenes was done great/Amazing and some of them were moderate but not bad enough to call it bad or mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound, i don't really care about it but well let's review something about it, i don't really care if it's wonderfull or just moderate, The OP & ED enjoyable, that's enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt was great done overall especially the story i liked the most without the ending though, i don't know why i don't like the ending because it's something like \"I'm Done with you, There is a another\" i don't like these animes where the main character makes too fast decisions but yeah nothing to do about it, the story itself continues with these moments.\\n\r\nI prefered it ended otherwise though.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime \"White album 2\" Really much, it's a romance anime like you never saw before, Amazing done, great story etc.\\n",

(also there might be minor spoilers though but I'll try to keep it as little)\r\nStory\r\nIt's simple basically, Haruki wants to save the light music club and meets Setusna an Idol and Touma a somewhat delinquent but great musician, and after they joined they started hanging out and of course the two falling in love with Haruki.\r\nIt seems commonat first but what I like is how the romance was portrayed, and I actually thought that this is one of the best love triangles that I saw in an anime and I'll explain it furthermore in the characters why, regarding their music life, well I there is less music although It was an Improtant part as well especially for Touma.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation\\n\\n\r\nI do admit Haruki's design is pretty boring and for setsuna I guess the reason why I sort of not ship him with Haruki is I guess due to her design being generic as well, her design reminds me of Orihime a character that I really hate.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding Touma  her design is okay, but I do think she voice is too low, for the sound, and and I think overall WA2 has a pretty generic designs of characters although It's good for the winter themed anime I guess I think they got a great OST's I enjoyed White album and Sound of Destiny although the opening and ending was pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nnow I'll try to explain  my thoughts as much as I can since I'm basically a lazy typer\\n\\n\r\nHaruki- I got mixed emotions from the guy, first let me say that he's somewhat forgettable considering his design and despite his attitude as a smart guy I think that didn't make him remembering enough, and I also thinks that he has lack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nStill though despite that his love troubles is something that is realistic, because sometimes we are confused whether we should date someone who confessed to us out of guilt knowing that we'll hurt him or her, and if we got caught in a really complicated situation how will we face it, I'm glad that Haruki manages to pull that off.\\n\\n\r\nand despite him being smart I think he's dumb when it comes to love stuffs I mean he realizes who he truly loves when things got really complicated.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really like is his relationship with Touma, like in Mashiro Iro Symphony which is one of my favorite Romance Anime's of All time, I like that he has to work hard just to win Touma for her to join his club and teach him about music.\\n\\n\r\nTouma- My Favorite Character of the series and I think has decent character development , she came from a hot head to someone who opens up to a friend, although she still ignores a lot of people, I would love her though to talk to other people, I do criticize her to having an NTR scene with Haruki, (although I still enjoy it),, still I like her for how she handles Heartbreak and her realtionship with Setsuna is great as well, knowing that the girl is the one whose causing her heartbreak she still manages to stay friends with her.\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna- perosnally she's not enjoying to watch but I would say that she has the greates character developement among three, she knew that she's tearing up Touma's heart but she still tries her best to be friends with her and she worries about her, she doesn't go beserk whenever Haruki and Touma we're together, what's more she even cried when Touma made a decision regarding her future (I wont spoil it)\\n\\n\r\nwhat's more she knew about the consequences that she felt for falling in love with Haruki and what she should do, and overall I think she's a strong person, but still I won't ship with with the guy, since Haruki x Touma has more chemistry and has a deeper relationship, but still she's still a good character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- well yeah I did enjoy the series as a whole, though they seem to be forgetabble but they did great in portraying their roles",

            "content": "A REVIEWTIME REVIEW!\r\nWhite album 2 just hits so many soft spots. It in my eyes is one of the best romantic anime's, especially if you're into pop music.\r\nPROS\r\nWhite album 2 just has so many pros. Firstly the music is impeccable, I even attempted to learn the melody on the piano after watching it. The romance it archives is astounding, it without a doubt rivals that of \"Your lie in April\" and \"Golden time\", that's saying a lot, coming from me. It's just such a well rounded anime, it knows what it is and what its not which is becoming less and less common to see.What it does do is what it sets out to achieve, ultimately it's a hall of fame piece that portrays love and music without doing too little or too much.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\nThere is little i can say that's bad about White album 2. It in many ways does lack true and meaningful themes like the other anime's above however this isn't what this anime's about and it knows it.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\nIt's a pretty obvious YES. if anime's like \"Your lie in April\" drew you in however you found the music to not be your style then you probably are more suited to white album two. It does everything a good romantic anime should with some damn good music along with it. White album two isn't just an experience for the eyes it's for the ears as well. Just get a box of tissues ready!",

            "content": "Sometimes love and friendship just cannnot be together...\r\nWhite Album 2 is one of those rare works that manage to reach you deep inside. Not many anime deserve to get a 10 score and sure not make me write a review about it, however, i truly desire that anyone reading this has the chance to enjoy this as much as i did. So... read carefully.\r\nStory (10): Nowadays it's hard to find good romance anime and maybe it's because they are too predictable and most of them follow a much well know pattern. White Album 2 throws that scheme through the window and gives you a wellstructured story that perfectly combines the correct amount of build-up, drama and a fitting conclusion. I must admit it starts pretty confusing with a lot going on by the first 10 minutes and you might feel a bit overwhelmed but, keep watching. The story gives you a refreshing plot  that doesn't fall flat in any moment or starts giving you cliche scenes to keep you interested, instead it gives you reasons to stay put and keep watching until the very end. When i said that it reached me deep inside i mean it! The story feels life-like and you are able to truly undersatand and feel for everything that happens through it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7): I am no expert in art for anime but i also don't give 10 scores just because it \"looks pretty\". The art in WA 2 fits just fine with the atmosphere and the tone of the scenes; however a bit more of detail and dedication would've captivated me much more; still, it was exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): I want to get both OP and ED out of the way by saying that both are pretty good to my ears and that now i listen to them in my phone. But regarding the soundtrack present at all times, it was sophisticated and appropiate for every scene. The sound of piano and soothing notes let you get inmersed in the scenes making you feel what the characters truly feel. And talking about characters...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): No tsundere or shy-klutz waifu here my friends, and no generic and average dense fuck MC. Haruki, kazusa and Setsuna, the three pillars of the story each have qualities and  flaws that shine and hurt them across the story. The way you see them grow as friends is actually cute and heart-smoothing because the frindship they manage to form is one many people would kill for. The various obstacles they face make them fall and stand back up and at some point you even feel for them, it does not matter who you like the most, by the end you will love the three of them. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when i say that this is not enough to show my love for  this anime but still i think that it's the correct amount of insight to make at least one good otaku enjoy this trip as much as i did... Thanks for reading, and enjoy White Album 2.",

            "content": "I maybe totally wrong with this one but i think an anime that is music orianted should have delicate characters not characters especially MCs that are inconsistant and not sure off their way of life. Let me make myself a little more clear a love triangle is a emotional tearjerker ride but all 3 of them are in love, it isn't something that makes you want to cry and puke at the male the same time it is more like nisekoi where you sometimes cry and always support sometimes get angry for their sacrifice (not their stupid honor or selfishness)\r\nLets sum it up the first6 episodes was for the music and i would have given it a solid 8 or maybe 9 but the other 7 episodes was for cheap adolecence mixed poor and tasteless loveish triangle kind of stupidity (Ok not everone will think this way but it was for me), i will give this episodes a 4 maybe a 3 even so overall a 6 is enough.\\n\r\nFor the final sentence should you watch it.... i think yes but not with an expectation for a masterpiece. If this show gets a 7.8 overall in total pool then shigatsu wa kimi no uso should have gotten a solid 700 over the charts kind of point go watch it instead",

The story is generic and executed relatively poorly. Kazusa's character development is just for the sake of fulfilling the kuudere archetype. Nothing is shown that makes me buy it. \r\nThe setting feels more like an abandoned warehouse than a school and the lifeless generic animation makes it worse. Voice acting is average and generic. They all have the stereotypical voice for their archetype, nothing more, nothing less. The music is decent except for a scene at the end where it is incrediblymelodramatic. Second half devolves into a melodramatic love traingle which ends in the worst way possible. Has nothing to do with music either. \\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n",
