            "content": "One word that keeps propelling itself to the forefront of my head when I go to describe this show is: &lsquo;refreshing&rsquo;. Generally, I tend to avoid those anime which are blatantly action-oriented, because an action anime series so often means that it will be generically shounen, or be some kind of absurd mecha-combat series; very rarely can I find an action series which does not fall to those and other traps, and Black Lagoon is one of them. From its premise to its execution, the show provides thrilling action sequences, from boat and car chases, to messy fisticuffs and bullet-spamming gunfights, the show covers alltypical action bases you could expect from hollywood, but which, for one reason or another, anime rarely delivers. Although its depiction of battle features the usual problems of character shielding and the Stormtrooper effect, overall the show is very much grounded in reality, with no magic or science-fiction elements whatsoever. I found this refreshing because, typically, the only anime you are likely to find set in present-time reality are slice-of-life, revolving around dramatic or romantic themes. So Black Lagoon was a great change of pace; a hollywood style action/adventure shoot &lsquo;em up but with a darker and more thoughtful approach to themes and characters (as is often found in mature anime) - it&rsquo;s a splendid mix.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for the show are certainly excellent, some of the best to have come out of 2006. It shines during the action scenes, which are very fluid and detailed, but overall has no real flaws other than the occasional lapse in consistency. The character designs are all attractive and original. The music is not something that impressed me; there isn&rsquo;t a lot of score music in the show (which is slightly refreshing given anime&rsquo;s habbit of blasting violin and choir over every scene), and what it has is fitting, but not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well defined, although I felt the focus given to the characters was rather strangely distributed; Revy and Rock (the two main characters) aside, the rest of the Black Lagoon barely garnered any attention, and their involvement was so greatly reduced by the end of the series that you had to wonder why the show was even named after the group. I am not kidding that the majority of the villains the group encountered received considerably more character exploration than either Benny or Dutch (the other two Black Lagoon members). I understand the importance of giving depth to the antagonist perspective, but I got the feeling that the original creator just kept falling in love with the antagonists he introduced, and neglected the protagonists in order to delve indulgently into the villain&rsquo;s pasts and characters. The best example would be Hanzel and Gretel, the goth-loli twins and their arc. They were given so much background, and such a poignant send-off yet had so little effect on any continuing plot, or on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRevy was certainly an interesting character. I&rsquo;ve seen the hardened, indifferent criminal stereotype before, but Black Lagoon takes Revy to the next level and actually glorifies her as colourfully maniacal. It makes the show fun to watch because you never know how to feel about Revy; sometimes you&rsquo;ll side with her and cheer her on, or feel sorry for her, but then the next moment she&rsquo;s slaughtering innocent people for enjoyment. Essentially she&rsquo;s a juxtaposition of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and &lsquo;reprehensible&rsquo;. Rock is a character who is much easier to make a connection with, in fact I like to see him as being the representative for the audiences perspective on the show as it traverses the challenging lands of immorality. He is described in the show as being &lsquo;in the twilight&rsquo;, neither living under explicitly righteous terms, nor wholly endorsing the injustice of the underworld. This allows him to be constantly critical of the actions of those around him, but from an intelligent objective position (ie he does not decry their actions through blind morality). His criticisms of the actions Revy and others around him take make for the most profound and thematically crucial dialogue in the show, and despite his outwardly plain personality, also make him a fascinating and important presence in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the real crux of the matter: the show is really about the criminal mind, and the life of crime in all its forms. It paints an alluring portrait of the attraction to such a life, but never forgets to challenge that attraction by showing the kind of sacrifices one has to make of their humanity. It shows crime as a dangerously beautiful thing, and also shows it at its most sickening. All the exciting action is secondary to this. In conclusion, Black Lagoon should be watched by all action fans, but is a step above most shounen series due to its challenging and, at times, risqu&eacute; foray into the heart of the criminal world. It is for mature audiences, because, despite having such character and being so colourful about murder, it is also very dark at times. There are flaws in the way it is paced, and the way some of the characters are neglected, but it has some very sharp dialogue, and is regardlessly entertaining thrill",

            "content": "\"This is way more entertaining than Hollywood is ever going going to be!\" truer words like that have barely been spoken in anime in my opinion, and with the shit that's out now, I'm inclined to believe them.\r\nSTORY: Enter Rokuro Okajima, a typical meek japanese office worker of a large corperation who's the epitome of ordinary with a life so boring, bland, and not so envious with complains such as his boss kicking his ass, but his bleak life style comes to an end when a business trip cruise to South East Asia turns into hell as a group of modern day pirates take himhostage and gives him much more to complain about than just a kick to the bum.\\n\r\nAfter a wild couple of bullet-filled days with said pirates, he decides to join up out of the feeling of excitement he experienced and the way his company has treated him like a worthless throw away and takes up the name, \"Rock\".\\n\\n\r\nRock's fellow crewmates include Benny the mechanic, computer specialist, and researcher, Dutch the calm, easygoing leader, and Revy the merciless, sadistic, foul mouthed gunner who's skill is almost unparalleled, she also goes by the name of \"Two hands\" cause of how she normally uses two guns in gun fights, heck any kind of fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Black Lagoon is mostly episodic with a few arcs that normally last about three to four episodes, but the lack of on ongoing plot continues on towards the second season, yet it's no problem at all, though it would've been nice if there were some that involved more development of the main characters (Besides just Revy and Rock).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows the gang as they try to complete jobs so they can earn a living, just like the main cast in Cowboy Bebop except these outlaws usually get their jobs done.\\n\r\nAnd during their jobs they face against a wide array of foes including gangs, nazis, and several eccentric foes such as a nearly unstoppable maid, and allies like a taiwanese assassin, with the main cast in nearly endless gun fights. With most of their requests coming from Balalaika, a leader of a russian crime syndicate \"Hotel Moscow.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a some what crude and black sense of humor, with mostly excessive cursing and yells and screams such as \"I'll rip you a new asshole!\" \\n\r\nBut probably the funniest stuff is the insults, especially when Revy meets a certain assassin near the end of the anime, the insults bounce back at each other like a well written conversation.\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully the anime might have ended up becoming a mindless bullet hungry action anime, and ultimately making it another waste of potential along with many others that have stacked up in the pile, if not for the characters, specificly the interaction between them.\\n\r\nEspecially between Rock and Revy, through the daily dangers and learning about Revy's past that was full of unbearable hardships that bulids up to her character, Rock learns that his partners are almost the complete opposite of him, especially during one episode where the tension between he and Revy becomes so deadly guns are involved.\\n\r\nThese interactions are tense, nerve wrecking, and may just be much more entertaining to watch than the fights, which is unique for a heavy action such as this.\\n\r\nBut slowly and surely, Rock starts to become used to this new way of life he chose, and begins to fit in, yet still is faced with his decision, and is constantly asked, Is this world right for him? or is he simply just an outsider and nothing more?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Great animation, displaying exciting gun fights, and little still frames with an overall dark feel to the series.\\n\r\nGood character designs being very diversed. The anime sometimes uses CG animation. but only during chase scenes in the vehicles, which thankfully doesn't look out of place that only the whiniest of nit pickers would complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Noticeable background music that fits in with most of what's going on at the moment, especially with the ending theme which starts playing during the anime and it helps to indicate whenever an episode comes to an end, and really feels a perfect song that will make you think back to the episode you've watched, and it has like a mysterious yet calm feeling to it, then ending with a rock conclusion that reminds you what the anime is (mostly) about.\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Red faction, is an awesome theme, despite it being in engrish.\\n\r\nThe english dub is by Ocean (Known for the dub of Death Note and Inuyasha), and is a one of a kind dub where it would feel weird to listen to in japanese, all due to the overall setting of the series. \\n\r\nBut the stand out performance (Among a cast of great voice actors) is the voice actor of Revy, giving that crude attitude of Revy a great convincing performance and just makes every scene with her just entertaining to even just listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Excellent characters and character interaction.\\n\r\n+ An incredible english dub that even makes the japanese audio seem out of place.\\n\r\n+ Good opening and ending theme music, good back ground music.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Very violent and action oriented. / May be too violent for some.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Lack of a continuing plot.\\n\r\n- Not too much of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime just barely shy's away from getting a nine overall.\\n\r\nEach form of media entertainment has their crap, with more so than others, but it's anime like this is the reason way I choose to stick with this media.\\n\r\nAnd I guarantee you'll feel like a pansy if you watch something moe or fluffy after leaving the lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n*Quick word on season two*\\n\\n\r\nSeason two is pretty much what I feared what Black Lagoon would mostly be about, absurdness with a penchant for wasting so many bullets that I'd feel sorry for the janitor who would try to clean it all up, but ends up getting killed by a stray bullet fired for no reason.\\n\r\nNot that I'm trying to say that it isn't entertaining, but just not more of the same gun and smoke. 7/10 for season two.",

            "content": "- - - - - [ Black Lagoon Season 1 :: Ep-12 ] - - - - -\r\n- [ Intro ] -\r\nBlack Lagoon. That's a name that easily caught my eye. After reading the brief review, I said \"why not?\". And so I found a great anime that would get me hooked for quite a long time! And it definitely deserves rewatch! On with the review!\r\n- [ Animation: Good quality and well-detailed -> 9 ] -\r\nLet's set things clear now. Black Lagoon (BL) has one of the best animations i've ever seen! If you pay attention to details, you will like BL. The animators haveinvested great effort in creating detailed backgrounds and characters. OMG! You can even see the demin texture on Revy's short sometimes! Now, another thing that amazed me is that both the characters and background are animated at the same time. I know, this sounds simple but no! These two are almost independent of each other but even them, you will see the characters interacting with the backgrounds in a number of ways. When the characters are being shot at, notice the number of bullet-holes on the walls increasing. Notice the gun smoke that dissipates when the characters walk. All these details make BL's animation great and lively.\\n\\n\r\nThe character motions are smooth and natural, even during the very fast-paced action scenes. Even then, the background does not lose its details. On one scene on a ship, you can see the rivets as Revy is fighting! Quite a number of details to watch out for. The play on lights and atmosphere renders a great effect too. The animators definitely knew what they were doing.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound: Suits situations and fast-paced -> 9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, I don't pay much attention to sound. NOPE! Here, it got my full attention! The Opening (OP) and Ending (ED) credits music is very good, specially the OP. It really suits the mood of the series in my opinion. Now for the ending, you will notice that the music starts within the episode, starting at a very low hum to gradually attain its normal level as the episode ends. It's a superb blend. It's the first anime I know that uses this technique and I can say I'm impressed. It was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the in-series music is nonetheless amazing! It really enlivens the scenes to their respective paces. In dramatic situations, you will get the appropriate music. In fast-paced scenes, expect hard rock or similar. It was a good choice of music for the series. For once, the sound of an anime caught my attention. I am looking foreward to a Black Lagoon OST.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story: No real plotline ->7 ] -\\n\\n\r\nStory? Don't expect any in BL! There is none. BL is a collection of short stories, pieced together to show you the lives of the characters at a point in time. There is no plot, not even in the second season (Second Barrage) of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the short stories are very good and definitely deserves watching if you enjoy action and gun-fights. They place the main characters in a variety of situations in which their work places them.\\n\\n\r\nI have not introduced the story yet! Sorry. So, Black Lagoon is about a man, Okajima Rokuro, who is entrusted the mission of delivering a data disk to some people by his company. The man is travelling on a ship when the latter is attacked by pirates (not really pirates but anyway..). After some time, we are told that the pirates are after the data disk carried by Rokuro. The pirates, a man-and-woman team will eventually get the disk, but also take Rokuro as hostage to get some ransom from his company. However, the data disk contains sensitive data about the company, and merceneries are sent after the pirates to destroy them. The demand for ransom is immediately ignored and Rokuro is considered dead. Here begins the life of Rock, formerly Rokuro, as a delivery agent on the Black Lagoon speedboat, together with gun-slinger Revy, captain Dutch and computer whiz Benny.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the plot is fairly interesting. You will soon see that delivering goods, specially illegal stuff, is not a safe business. Often, the characters are put in life-threatening situations and major gunfights resulting, specially with battle-maniac Revy around. Rock is sort of the negociator for Black Lagoon Company, negociating terms of business and often toning down conflicts. We are also presented with the clients of BLC, namely the Russian Mafia boss Miss Balalaika and Mr Chan, leader of the triads or even the Church of Violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe short stories are definitely worth watching, and seldom offers time for boredom. Watch if you need something fast-paced and energetic. There were no nudity, although some exposure was shown. Violence? BL is filled of it. Bad language? Same. Humour? Yes. Crude jokes and black humour is there for you. So, it's not an anime for young people.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Characters: Development & Variety ->9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the fun lies in BL, the characters. Each of them is so very unique in their own way that you feel that they really possess emotions. They fight for their own causes, have their own motivations which sound very heroic or plausible. They have their own strengths and weaknesses and can each be liked or hated by the viewer. The main characters of BL are each well-developed, this being one of the great parts of BL. The main characters are:\\n\\n\r\nRevy: She is the gun of Lagoon Company who gets everybody out of trouble. Apparently she does not like Rock, but what she hates is his attitude. In fact, she will often go out of her way to help others and specially Rock. She is an expert when it comes to fighting techniques, who can single-handedly eliminate every enemy, armed with her twin-guns, Cutlass. Sometimes, she is so addicted to fights that she would go berserk. No one is spared then, not even her crew, as Rock saw for himself in an episode.\\n\\n\r\nDutch: He is the captain of the Lagoon speedboat. Tactial, he never does things rashly. He seems to be African, something rare in Japanese animes. He is equally talented when it comes to guns. However, he prefers to avoid fights when possible.\\n\\n\r\nBenny: The computer genius of Lagoon. Not much is known about him. He never fights but is an expert getaway driver.\\n\\n\r\nRock: The newest member of Lagoon. Although he never fights, he is an expert in negotiations and at pacifying Revy, often at the cost of blows! He always try to hold back Revy and has a strong sense of justice. He will try to protect anyone and everyone, something which exasperates Revy.\\n\\n\r\nBalalaika: The woman who controls Hotel Moscow. She was an ex-millitary and is very proficient when it comes to wars of any sort. She also commands a small army which often comes in play in BL.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the characters of BL are varied. You have to see for yourself to enjoy BL. I can't say more.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Value and Enjoyment: Very good -> 9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nIf you want action, and specially fast-paced action, BL is for you. But since there is no real plot, many viewers will be turned away. I, for my part, really enjoyed BL and even rewatched the whole series a couple of times, just for the action and butt-kicking. It kinda pumps up the adrenalin, if you see what I mean. The series, being short, is easy to rewatch without severe boredom. The small stories furthur eliminate boredom, and plotholes.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Conclusion ] -\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something good to watch, check out Black Lagoon. If you like it, there is a second season with 12 episodes called Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage. The situation is nearly same for Second Barrage. It's not really a continuation but just more short stories. There is no ending to BL, and I don't even know if there would be a real story. Some people have been speculating that the real Black Lagoon has not yet started and that we were merely watching the prequel. That would be the longest prequel I've ever seen, with 24 episodes! :S\\n\\n\r\nI've got nothing more to say. Just go watch BL. The lack of a plotline made me give BL an overall 8. Apart from that, there are no major flaws. You won't regret it, in my opinion. And thanks for reading!",

            "content": "With a genre that deals with a lot of action set-pieces, a show of this specific genre is usually bogged down into mindless entertainment territory with absolutely no substance to it at all. There have been in the past many action films, and TV shows that have shown to become competent in the history of film-making, examples in mind are the works of John Woo, Michael Mann, and Quentin Tarantino. But what if I told you that there is an anime show that encompasses everything that is great about those three directors and succeeds on every possible level? The show in question is Black Lagoon,a show that showcases a blend of mindless Hollywood action and juvenile humor in the best possible sense of the word juvenile.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's story is mainly focused on our four main characters and their adventures together through plot arcs that tie in together through the chemistry that helps make them grow with each other. There isn't much of a deep, complex plot to behold in the show; it's about as clich\u00e9 as any Seinen action show in the past decade. That may seem like a negative when you put it that way, but sometimes clich\u00e9s are used to good effect when you have competent writing to flesh out your characters and set-pieces. Black Lagoon is a definite exception to this rule; it manages to pull off even the most ridiculous plot arcs that could easily be looked at with eye rolls and as a laughable premise. One glorious example is just how dark and witty the dialogue writing is that it hits the mark on every scene it creates within the framework of the show. It gives Black Lagoon a spark of creativity in its witty black humor that creates its unique personality to deviate itself from other shows like it, in terms of writing. It never gets old because it's not repetitive in how it's delivered by the characters sparingly and not done on almost every scene in each episode, it makes the jokes work more effectively with clarity and sensibility.\\n\\n\r\nNow when you talk about the characters in Black Lagoon, the one character you must acknowledge the most is the one and only Revy. She's the prototypical \"girl with guns\" character that spouts off adolescent language and a dark past that shadows over the overall tone of the show to not only to become a dark comedy but a dark one altogether. So how is Revy different from any other female character in a \"girls with guns\" show? She does have similar characteristics that could be pointed out as being standard or generic from other characters like her. But it's because Revy is Black Lagoon. Her presence in the world of the show is very charismatic and alluring that demands your attention by not only her design, which is by far one of the sexiest I've seen in a long time, but by her character background and her hilarious dialogue. As I said before about the writing, the writers give Revy a ton of material for her to shine on-screen when she is either going into these well put together action scenes and her funny, snarky remarks at any of the characters. There is even a Tarantino kind of quality to her where she is this sick woman who only cares for money and violence, but she's also portrayed in a sympathetic light when she explains why her mentality is the way it is from her troubled past. They don't necessarily go in too much further in this season, but regardless it is a high starting point to a fantastic character.\\n\\n\r\nWith Revy out-of-the-way, the other characters may not have as much depth or even characterization as our larger than life heroine, but that certainly does not mean that they are wrong in any way shape or form. Our main hero, nicknamed Rock, does have some of the same levels of charisma as Revy and how he doesn't come across as a weak-willed character as most characters of his archetype typically are. It isn't as if Revy's presence overshadows his own because he doesn't have much of a personality, Rock carries the show by himself quite well and even together with Revy. The chemistry between the two is pretty unique in how they always are at odds with each other because of how different they follow life, but in the end, they still view each as part of a team whether they want to or not. No scene involves them immediately becoming friends overnight, the show takes it's time to build them up as a team that has to trust each other, or they might end up in a bad situation, and it's written intelligently by this very fact. The two other people in the group named Dutch and Benny aren't given much to go around as complex characters, but this does not automatically make them evil characters, what little background they bring on the table for them is still much appreciated in how they even offer some great scenes with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are hit and miss in how little depth some of them have when they seem. One, in particular, involves an army of Aryan neo-nazis that look more like just fodder characters that don't get a lot of deep characterization that, while I can forgive it, given how it's portrayed in an action show,  it would've been more than what it already was. For the one that does hit the mark is oddly enough a Roberta maid who is given some context for her intentions on being who she is. The show handles it very well despite her strange terminator-like persona that wasn't given much explanation. Then again the show is nutty enough to let it pass as just another Black Lagoon style of logic put in for good measure.\\n\\n\r\nFor the style of animation that Madhouse put together back their swell days, it still definitely holds up as a great visual treat. The action scenes are done with absolutely great visual flair and technicality that are inspired by the works of John Woo, as I've mentioned in the beginning. Although not perfectly seamless in how slick the characters move, it is nonetheless spectacular to see how the animators put their hearts and souls to not cut any corners whatsoever in detailing every aspect of Revy and the rest of the environment on the sights of her gun. The violence and carnage in Black Lagoon are not necessarily as gory or blood-splattering as many would argue; there is no question that it celebrates its carnage, but it's not done in a way that is so blatant or in-your-face where it gets tedious or loses its momentum in how effective each shot counts. There are some that do fit in that class, but for the most part, it handles its violence with nice precision and intelligence that make every scene brimming with fascinating acts of carnage that is more exciting to watch than just rolling your eyes in boredom. There are even some elements of neo-noir in the case of how it handles the violence how it cuts immediately away from Revy shooting a man in the head at close range; not to mention the show has some great camera angles that make the scenes have some profound impact to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is about what you would expect out of an action show like Black Lagoon. Standard rock and metal music that isn't very memorable to even try to buy an album for since it's just there to fill up the show's audio production and nothing more, not to mention the shooting and the characters shouting over the music doesn't help either. It does its job well to create a fun dark humorous vibe to the action scenes. The voice acting, however, is what makes the dialogue spice up to new heights. I've only listened to the Japanese voice actors in Black Lagoon, and they all own their roles. The one to mention out the rest is Megumi Toyoguchi who does a helluva performance as Revy by giving her a tremendous sarcastic essence to her voice that makes her so alluring and almost sexual. It fits the design of Revy so perfectly that Megumi almost becomes Revy just through her voice alone. Daisuke Namikawa, as usual, does an excellent job voicing Rock and doesn't seem like a novice compared to Megumi's performance, as do the rest of the cast members with some that aren't noteworthy to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Black Lagoon is about as silly and stupid as one could get out of an action show that would even make Steven Seagal blush, not that Black Lagoon quality-wise is comparable to his films, just from a contextual point-of-view. Stupid is usually used to describe something without context or substance when relating a story or character in any medium, but if the show is self-aware of the fact that it is and takes advantage of this aspect. It is clear that there are some genuinely serious moments found in Black Lagoon, even though they are effective in achieving the dark tone that it is known for. Even with that said, it doesn't seem out-of-place or distracting from the humor of the show because of how greatly paced the narrative of all the arcs. All of these are what make Black Lagoon easily one of the most entertaining and hard-hitting action shows that treats its audience as grown adults and creates some of the most well-choreographed action courtesy of Madhouse; one terrible aiming bad guy at a time.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A\\n",

It's not better than me, because it does have some flaws, but then again, nothing is really better than I am. \r\nThe story follows some pirates (not the \"Argh, mateys!\" kind) who do all sorts of crazy shady jobs for MONEY. Yeah, it's original that these people are motivated by cash and not by personal beefs. Makes itrealer. Most of the anime has a realistic storyline, except for the unrealistic parts like killer twins and fighting maids and whatever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were seriously good. Character design was really damn good. Music was always interesting to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nRevy has to be the best anime character in this show. She can kick your ass right off your body and make you wipe your tears with it. Then there's the wet blanket Rock, but unlike most wet blankets, I don't want to hang him out to dry (or die) since he's actually just being a realistic character i.e. a wimp. Then, to spice it up, since you don't only want Asians, there's a Jew and a black dude. Way to spice it up, Japan!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want to be amazed by cool gun fights and pirates and boats, this is the anime for you. If you haven't seen it as yet, stop washing your undies for a minute, get some bladder control, and sit back and enjoy one of the coolest anime ever.",

            "content": "One of the darkest animes I've seen in my life, Black Lagoon portrays quite brilliantly the gritty and obscene lives of mercenaries for hire and the underworld of crime. Casting an academic and otherwise completely innocent person as the protagonist just makes this anime even more explicit and realistic than any other. \r\nThe story follows a team of mercenaries known as Lagoon Company, who smuggle goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia. Their base of operations is located in the fictional city of Roanapur in Thailand, and they transport goods in the PT boat Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients,but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions - which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles - in various Southeast Asian locations and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime stay in the mind long after the anime is over. The story follows the plotline of Rock, a Japanese salaryman kidnapped in the early episodes by the crew of Black Lagoon which provided the various main characters of Revy, Dutch, and Benny. Rock of course is the gentlelest of the crew as he gradually assimilates after the various bloody mercenary jobs he undertakes. Using reasoned arguments and persuasion, he's the counterpoint to the jaded and oftentimes brutal teammates.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last point, specifically to Revy a hardened Chinese lady mercenary whose looks hide a merciless and cold exterior. She likes to systematically take apart the enemy and relishes gunfights. However, later she develops feelings for Rock.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point of this anime lies in the fact that the world is cruel, and dark. Throughout the series, Black Lagoon crew takes pay for various dangerous and very gruesome jobs, often paid for by Balalaika, the cynical lady boss of the elite Russian Mafia whose members consisted of basically &quot;Russian SWAT&quot;. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are usually gritty and dark with plenty of disturbing themes and pulse pounding action. In this aspect, the gunfights are simply spectacular and perhaps the best in anime. It is definitely something worth seeing.\\n",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an action fan's dream come true, but those looking for characters and plot might be a bit turned off.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nI avoided this anime for the longest time, since I am generally not a fan of this kind of action series. After a year or so of procrastination, I finally got around to watching it. Here are my thoughts on the series as a whole (including Second Barrage and Roberta's Blood Trail OVAs, but not the odd Omake Spin off).\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nMake no mistake about it: Black Lagoon is an action series through and through. It's gunfights galore,with some explosions and hand-to-hand combat thrown in to spice things up. All this action comes at the expense of an intricate and well thought out plot. I can forgive the show for this, however, since story telling is not its goal. The story of Black Lagoon (and sequel/OVAs) has two good things going for it, though.\\n\\n\r\n1. The story may be simple, but it is still coherent. There are no huge gaps that you are expected to just accept.\\n\r\n2. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, despite having no intellectual value whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, come for the action, not the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon does not have particularly great animation, but it doesn't really detract from the show. Colors are bland, character models are a bit simple while managing to be inconsistently drawn at points, and the gun models were often cringe-worthy. With that said, character movements are fluid throughout the action scenes (so most of the show), so I will give it a little extra credit there. Roberta's Blood Trail is slightly better done, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening, Engrish and all. The gunfire was good as well, and the backing soundtrack matched it well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another area that had to be sacrificed to make room for action. Few characters other than Rock, Revy, and Balalaika get more than a minute or two of development. Another contributing factor may be the large cast of characters that make up the show, not allowing any particular one to get much time on screen. This results in characters being pretty one dimensional, with the exception of the three mentioned above. Rock's character develops a bit over the series, but it is nothing to write home about. Revy and Balalaika have their pasts explained, which helps the viewer to better understand their actions, but neither develop at all over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable characters are the Vampire Twins of Second Barrage. While I won't go into spoilers, they were some of the most interesting and tragic villains I've seen in a series of this nature.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't normally enjoy plotless action series, Black Lagoon was an exception. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time, and watched episode after episode soaking up the shear fun and absurdity of it all. If I enjoyed it, it would be any true action fan's dream come true. If someone did not care as much for plot and characters as I do, this show could be much higher ranked for them.\\n\\n\r\nAny fan of action series should not hesitate to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nWhile I nearly always prefer watching a show raw or subbed, I can assure you that the dub for this series is superb (after the first few episodes, while the characters get into their roles).\\n\r\nWhile the show has a lot of violence, it is seldom very graphic (there are a few exceptions). However, the profanity in the English dub is harsh and frequent.\\n\\n\r\nOmake has absolutely nothing to do with the series, and you can skip it without missing anything.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWe have seen countless struggles in anime between good and evil, but what about a struggle between grey vs. grey or evil vs. evil? There are actually a few anime that fit that description, but few quite as celebrated as Black Lagoon. Lets go into the depths of the criminal underworld and look at one of the darker anime ever to reach mainstream popularity. What you want to know is, \"Is it any good?\" Well...sort of.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story can be broken down into arcs, but there is no real overall progressive plot. Just more dirty jobs that need to get done. \"Its like wagon train,it's a great show but they never really get anywhere, they just keep wagontraining\" -Stand By Me. The main character is a quirky Japanese businessman who is captured by a modern day pirate crew. They hold him for ransom, but his company refuses to offer a dime to save his life. Rather than killing him, the crew make him a member after he has the admittedly awesome idea of launching torpedoes at a helicopter while jumping their boat through the air. Together, our modern pirate crew  take on Nazis, homicidal twins that were previously stars of a series of pedophile snuff films, and other bad guys. All the while, our \"heroes\" or more accurately protagonists since they aren't really heroes, are working for a Russian mob division called Hotel Moscow. \\n\\n\r\nOne reason Black Lagoon is praised is for the sheer amount of melodramatic, dark and depressing shit that happens. Seriously, critics who attack other anime for trying to be \"dark and edgy\" praise Black Lagoon for doing the same thing! In reality, Black Lagoon is a poorly written melodrama with mediocre action scenes. It is an absurdly overrated anime both here on MAL and over on 4chan. If the series wanted to be dark because it was bringing attention to real world issues or was a well written tragedy, that would be one thing, but Black Lagoon is dark for the sake of being dark and violent for the sake of being violent. Black Lagoon has no morals or messages to teach. I would also be fine if Black Lagoon were a pure, fun action series. However, as previously mentioned the action is too sparse and is mostly rather unsatisfying. Black Lagoon goes halfway between being the dark, bloody insanity of Hellsing Ultimate and the thought provoking darkness of Berserk. By not settling on just one, Black Lagoon ultimately fails at both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is a wide cast of characters, but most of them are either unlikable bastards or just not that interesting. A lot of people like Revi and say she is the most badass chick in anime. This is pure bullshit She comes across to me more as a loud, obnoxious, ceaselessly strutting bravado whose skill doesn't live up to her ego. She is great at slaughtering weak opponents, but can only beat the few quality opponents she faces in ridiculously cheap fashion. She also cries like a bitch and passes out after getting stabbed in the leg, which isn't very badass. She's less Alucard and more Luke Valentine. She has the cliche' tragic past, but we can't really empathize because she feels no remorse for her misdeeds. She grew up slaughtering families to stay in their houses much like Lucy from Elfen Lied, but whereas Lucy actually has a conscience, Revy is a complete sociopath. She is less Lucy and more of a lame version of Captain Hans from Hellsing. She is a seemingly nihilistic monster that has a few moments where she seems to still possess a human soul, but not enough to make us actually root for her. However, she isn't nearly as cool as Captain Hans, so if he fought Revy, I would root for the SS Werewolf all the way! It is a bad sign for a character's likeablility when the audience would rather cheer for an SS member. Dutch could have been an interesting character if he was developed more, but most all of the development and back story goes to Rock and Revy, who are probably my 2 least favorite characters in the show. The 2 best characters in the whole show are the Incredible Mr. Chang and Balalaika. Guess which 2 characters have the least screen time? Yep, unfortunately it's those 2. If they made a spinoff series with just Chang and Balaika, it would actually be a substantial improvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is honestly pretty damn good. I don't really have much more to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is best described as weak and utterly forgettable\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say I enjoyed this series very much. There is no single category where this show really shined. It was decent as an action, but not truly outstanding. It was bogged down by needlessly depressing melodrama for no reason as explained above. If young otaku want a \"dark and mature\" anime to feel like men, why not watch Berserk or Monster? Those are plenty dark and a SHIT load better than Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon isn't a horrible series, but it isn't really a good series. The best characters are wasted, and it isn't as entertaining as it could have been. If it had focused more on longer, higher quality gunfights and less on needlessly depressing bullshit where our \"heroes\" must help the Russian mob ship children into slavery before vivisecting some puppies and burning down an orphanage on Christmas Eve, maybe it could have been a good series.",

            "content": "In many respects, Black Lagoon is difficult series to review. At its core it is a show which takes what is an essentially interesting and engaging story and then promptly covers it with a rather thick layer of absurdity and an aesthetic love of violence for its own sake. That is to say, for a series which outwardly claims to be \"mature\" and \"realistic,\" in one sense it succeeds, and in another it fails. [It should also be mentioned beforehand that this will be a review of the first 12-episode installment of the series only, and not the Second Barrage]\r\nBeginning with the positive side, BlackLagoon can be seen first and foremost as story of transformation, namely, a transformation of two of its main characters, Rock and Revy, during the course of the narrative. What the series does particularly well is illustrate how these two individuals are changed for the better not only through their respective circumstances, but through their interactions with one another. \\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, Rock goes from being a whiny, non-confrontational sycophant who has spent his entire adult life working for nothing but a comfortable mid-level position in the  business hierarchy to someone who is not only courageous and willing to stand up for himself, but also someone with an unapologetic sense of virtue and ethical character (denounced by Revy as mere residue of his pampered upbringing); in fact, his later insistence on keeping his shirt and tie in a way symbolizes how he has not left the beliefs of his old life behind completely, but rather has managed to strike a kind of sensible medium. The rather dire nature of his initial circumstances (that is, unexpectedly joining a crew of pirates) slowly forces him to realize that there are fundamentally better things in life than climbing the corporate ladder and sucking up to others in a value system of decadence and wealth. Shortly after becoming a hostage on the Lagoon, he himself states that \"I guess this must be what they call the Stockholm Syndrome,\" suggesting that, already at the first episode, he indeed feels more liberated being surrounded by pirates on a ship than pirates in an office. Throughout the series, Rock realizes more and more how hollow and meaningless his former life was and how strangely pleased he is with his new line of work. This does not seem to necessarily be praise of piracy, but rather more simply a love of adventure and, at the same time, a denouncement of the phony smiles and hypocrisy of modern Japanese bourgeoisie culture. \\n\\n\r\nRevy, on the other hand, of course begins her transformation from the complete opposite end of the spectrum. That is, she starts off as a trigger-happy loose cannon with poor judgement, someone who believes that might automatically equals right and that all problems can be solved by threats of physical violence--which is, after all, how she manages to keep Rock under her thumb for the better part of the series. She also exhibits a kind of adolescent pseudo-nihilism, thumbing her nose at compassion and believing that monetary gain is the highest good and the only law. However, through her experiences with Rock she begins to exhibit a more human emotional side, and perhaps begins to realize that she is not as nihilistic as she would have others believe; this is demonstrated particularly well in the final arc, but even more so in her verbal/physical confrontation with Rock in episode 7, which arguably comprises the best and most thematically significant scene of the entire show. It is here that Rock finally stands up for himself, and Revy's full hatred for him is revealed: she hates him not only because he has just shown her that \"you can't solve everything with a gun,\" but also that it is possible for one to be steadfast and virtuous at the same time, even in the face of death. It is here that he points out that she has merely been hiding behind a complex of presumptuous self-victimization and pretentious nihilism and that a person's origins (either privileged or impoverished) cannot act as a surrogate for personal responsibility. It is also here that Rock informs Revy that she was the one who \"shook me awake,\" thereby illustrating that he is indeed conscious of her instrumentality in his own transformation. Thus if the show has a point, and I believe it does, it can all be summed up in this relatively brief, five-minute altercation. Also, notice that it is only after this scene that Revy even begins to treat Rock like a true comrade.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that Black Lagoon's semi-episodic narrative style actually serves this thematic touch rather well. When I first watched it about a year ago, I was disappointed that the given premise of the series (a naive businessman flees his corrupt superiors who attempt to hunt him down) was only carried through the first two episodes. On second viewing however, I realize the importance of having a variation of story arcs, which allows one to focus more on character study than on a linear story, and certainly in this respect marks out the series as a deservedly more mature, seinen title. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is where my praise must end.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, it is important to keep in mind that Black Lagoon is of course still essentially a gun-slinging action series, and in this respect is falters somewhat drastically. That is, for a series which markets itself as something \"mature\" and \"realistic,\" there is a very noticeable lack of either of these qualities in the bulk of the action-oriented scenes. Firstly, in nearly every hostile encounter, it appears as though Revy is of basically superhuman power and speed, as well as being somehow impervious to physical harm. In episode 1, she takes out an entire squad of trained mercenaries armed with automatic weapons using only two 9mm pistols; she jumps into their midst, kills all of them will relative ease, escaping without a scratch. In episode 3, when the Lagoon is being chased by Chinese mafia, she destroys five boats of men (again, armed with automatics rifles) singlehandedly, again, and does so without a scratch, again. Not only that, she accomplishes all this while leaping from boat to boat, apparently immune to all incoming gunfire. Again in episode 5, when the crew must retrieve a painting from a group of neo-Nazis, Revy is shown casually strolling from one room of their ship to another, killing everyone execution-style, and meeting little to no resistance, despite the fact that they were heavily armed. There are several other examples later on as well, particularly episode 12 where Revy and Shenhua play \"tag team\" in killing hordes of nameless enemies from the back of a jeep, being sure to make it look as \"cool\" as possible, regardless of the inherent absurdity. In fact, the only time Revy is even injured is during the fight between her and Roberta the maid-- someone equally as overpowered to superhuman degrees.\\n\\n\r\nIn perspective, all of this seems rather half-baked and juvenile. The \"maturity\" of this kind is simply the maturity of any run-of-the-mill \"M\"-rated shooting game: plenty of blood and gore, but little necessary attention to how even semi-realistic gunfights might actually take place, even between very skilled opponents. It is almost as if Black Lagoon is uncomfortably stuck somewhere between the lighthearted (and completely unrealistic) bullet-dodging of a Trigun and the brutality and blood-soaked sadism of a Higurashi. There is something very reminiscent of Kill Bill in the grotesqueness and ease with which the blood so freely flows, and despite its more mature side, there is a very strong and unexamined suggestion that violence for the sake of violence is inherently appreciable and makes for quality entertainment by itself. Normally this would be less of an issue, but in a supposedly \"realistic\" setting where there are no superpowers or cybernetic implants, in practice Black Lagoon seems to take great pride in throwing many such suppositions to the wind. Granted, while some of the show's \"stunts\" can be amusing in their inherent ludicrousness (e.g. destroying an assault helicopter with a torpedo), most of the time these willy-nilly takes on violence and death simply feel unpleasant and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as technical merits go, this being a Madhouse production there is little that needs to be said. The animation overall is rather excellent and well detailed, although perhaps there is an overly liberal use of CGI, particularly when it comes to animating cars and other distant moving objects. The character designs are Death Note-esque with an obvious tendency towards the cartoony and exaggerated, particularly during comedic moments. For an action series, there is a very effective contrast between the grit and smoke of urban warfare and the beautifully drawn tropical waters and open spaces of the less-inhabited parts of Southeast Asia (particularly the underwater scenes). The soundtrack complements this contrast well by providing a mix of hard rock/metal during most of the gunfight sequences and soft, acoustic guitars and droning ambient during the quiet and contemplative moments, which are surprisingly numerous. A big deal has been made about the English dub, and for the most part, this would be well-deserved. Being an Ocean Group production, the casting and performances are all of the highest quality, particularly when it comes to voicing all manner of distinct accents (Chinese, Scotts-Irish, Spanish). My only complaint about the dub is Maryke Hendrikse's rendition of Revy, which I felt had a kind of unnatural roughness and sounded rather forced and uneven, as opposed to the original Megumi Toyoguchi, who hit a much more convincing medium between gruff and feminine.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, while Black Lagoon certainly deserves to be praised for what it does well (as seen in its insightful story of personal development, realization, and transformation as well as its social criticism), it is difficult to consider it masterpiece-level work given its obvious penchant for over-the-top absurdity, particularly in its B-level portrayal of violence. It is well paced, looks great, and is sure to entertain all diehard Quentin Tarantino fans, but is not quite consistent enough in either its realism or maturity level to really be considered a work of genuine excellence.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an Anime that centers around a group of modern pirates who call themselves the 'Lagoon Delivery Company'. They operate in Southeast Asia, and they basically deliver anything at all as long as the price is right.\r\nStory wise, the episodes are a collection of completely unrelated short stories, showing the different jobs that the Lagoon Delivery Company takes on. The storylines are fairly unique, ranging from a run in with a bunch of wannabe Nazis to delivering papers for a Chinese Triad. Each short story is packed with action and superb gunfights, and the plot speeds along, leaving no time to be bored.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't an 'actual plot' to link the whole series together, but with all the fast-paced action, you don't really miss it. However, there are some recurring elements that ties the series together, such as the belief that there is no such thing as right or wrong, it just depends on how something is justified.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Black Lagoon is amazing, especially during the gunfights. The overall animation is extremely smooth and character movement is fluid, without annoying jerks in the animation. Also I love the angles that are chosen, as well as how they frame certain scenes, as it increases the impact that the animation gives.\\n\\n\r\nThe images are also well rendered and extremely detailed, especially the guns. Black Lagoon is rather more realistic than other Animes, and features very few exaggerated facial expressions and the like. Heavy attention is paid to details, especially in the rendering of the backgrounds. The animators also play around with dramatic lighting a lot, and this helps to create extremely outstanding scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the upbeat OP fits the show extremely well, while the ED is a quiet enigmatic piece. A unique feature of the ED is that unlike most other Animes, there is no clean break between the episode and the ED. The ED starts softly when the episode ends, and blends in very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the in-episode music for Black Lagoon is fast and upbeat, and it fits the situation extremely well, and at times, it helps to create a very tense and dramatic atmosphere, which is very fitting for Black Lagoon, considering the nature of this Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters may seem to be somewhat stereotypical at first, but as the series progresses, we discover the many different aspects of each character's personality. Black Lagoon places a lot more emphasis on character development than most gunfighting Animes, and the interactions between characters are interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are very diverse, each of them having a different set of beliefs and their own strengths and weaknesses. There are no perfect characters in Black Lagoon, every one of them has some kind of fault, and that makes them all the more human, allowing viewers to empathise with them more.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, many minor characters are also thrown into the mix, each of them unique in their own special way. While some stereotypes may be present in Black Lagoon, the characters are still sure to surprise you in some way or another.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI gave this series an overall 10, but I will be the first to admit that it may have been a little biased because I love action. But still, Black Lagoon is an amazing Anime, with high quality animation and a fitting soundtrack. If you are the type who cannot stand long, drawn out stories, then Black Lagoon is the Anime for you. With the fast-paced and epic butt-kicking action, Black Lagoon promises not to disappoint.",

            "content": "It's was really hard for me at first to actually give my honest opinion on Black Lagoon because the show itself is really good and I don't want to be biased. However I' have finally made up my mind to give my thoughts and review. Black Lagoon, in terms of a more \"realistic\" action adventure anime is highly acceptable. What I mean by that  is the events that took place during Black Lagoon are like real events that we see or hear about happen in our world everyday. Black Lagoon gives you a sort of up close and personal experience on what the charactersgo through everyday in our favorite messed up place called Roanapur. What I loved most about the series of course were the unforgettable characters, action and adventure that was given to us. I really loved how each of the characters had some sort of terrible backstory of bad history, and when the character moved or stayed in Roanapur the bad influence of other people rub of on them and mold them into something.... \"new.\" My best example of this is of course our main character Rock who we see goes from a typical Japanese businessman who after staying in Roanapur becomes... well no spoilers. The action of Black Lagoon is intense. It was like a \"sitting at the edge of your seat\" experience for me. That is how engaging it was to me! especially during scenes like one on one gun fights!! I strongly felt that the amount of action made up for what Black Lagoon lacked in story telling. That is because the story isn't really, or well I felt that  Black Lagoon doesn't really need like a complicated story or much of a background story at all.  Overall Black lagoon is a very enjoyable show that I would highly recommend for anyone who wants pure action with little story, yet provides easy to like and memorable characters, functioning story, decent soundtrack and art. 8/10 for me mates.",

            "content": "Firstly, let me state this review may come off as sexist but I am indeed not a sexist. Now,\r\nI'm ok with a typical tough anime girl. I'm ok with a tough anime girl with a gun. I am not ok with a tough anime girl with a gun killing dozens of enemies at a time. Black Lagoon attempts to come of as a realistic anime about mercenaries, but many things in the anime detract from this attempt.\r\nBut before I rant, I'll talk a little about the 4 man crew. \r\nWe have Rock (protagonist): Japanese business man who is tired of being pushed around and sobecomes a mercenary. \\n\\n\r\nDutch: Strong black guy with a deep voice. (Pretty much everything you'd expect from a black guy in an anime so no need to go into detail)\\n\\n\r\nBenny: The blonde haired wiz with glasses (again no need to describe since he fits the sterotype)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Revy: You're typical tough girl with a bandanna who \"takes shit from no one\". She is very fond of vulgar language and likes to shoot people more than anything else it seems. However, her constant drivel became annoying and boring amazingly fast and I couldn't help but hate her.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's man problem is its storyline because there basically isn't one. It just shows the crew doing a job, shooting people, and then relaxing with a cigaratte. The character development is poor and Black Lagoon fails miserably in making you feel anything for them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to the realism aspect. Since I do not wish to spoil anything, though you can pretty much play this anime in its entirety out in your head without watching it, I'll give to examples of how unrealistic this anime is at times.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Revy cartwheeling and leaping ship to ship, massacring the entire crew of the ships methodically. If this scene appeals to you, then well, ... I really don't know what to say.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we have the most hilarious scene of all. Imagine the huge, muscular, and tough black man stereotype mentioned above. And now imagine that black man being overpowered by a woman in a maid's outfit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nyea.....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was actually a struggle to watch, but I gave it a 6 because the music and art are both incredible and I like the vulgarism and bloodiness at times.\\n",

            "content": "\"Look, everyone in here is carrying a gun! It's like we're in a parallel universe where everyone is Clint Eastwood.\" - Rock\r\n[Viewer Discretion is advised, review contains profanity, just like the show it's written for.]\r\nIf the everyday, ubiquitous, slice of life anime is a Toyota Prius... environmentally conscious, economical, quiet, and serene, then Black Lagoon is like a 1970 El Camino with a 572, two 4 barrel carbs, straight headers and a supercharger with a bugcatcher on top so big you can't see anything but dotted lines turning solid.\r\nBut that's okay, because the only thing you're gonna see is the other suckers in your mirrors.It's big, it's loud, it's fast, it's rough, it's tough, and it's got a mean bite. Black Lagoon is this machine from hell of an anime that's just way, way too much, but you can't help but want to floor it every time you get in... because it's just too much fun. You gotta respect it though, because you don't take it for a ride, it takes YOU for a ride.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the essence of Black Lagoon. It's like 24 episodes of nonstop Mad Max Fury Road. Unrelenting, punishing, deadly action. Don't f*ck with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\n\"So I guess you'd probably have a hard time believing I watch Oprah instead: \"the result of the extreme makeover, right after the GUNSHOT!\" - Revy\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nEven though Black Lagoon is almost 10 years old now, it still holds up excellently. It's yet another awesome title from the Madhouse dominant era of the mid 2000s to sit with Death Note, Hellsing, Paprika, and others. The attention to detail, particularly with the guns and vehicles, is striking. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of just having generic pistols and rifles, they went the extra mile fleshing out the detailing that make individual and branded weapons unique. Real life brand names are mentioned, and the weaponry are identical replicas. Famous pistols like the Beretta 92F (Revy's signature), Tokarev TT-33s, Colt 1911s, Lugers, and the fan favorite gold plated Desert Eagle make appearances, along with tons of other revolvers, autos, and even cap and lock pistols. A dizzying array of rifles, launchers, and mounted weapons are used throughout the series, all direct copies of real life weapons. No made up stuff here. The weapons themselves are nearly characters, and I had a lot of fun picking out which ones were which. All told, there are 81 different weapons either seen or used throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are drawn excellently and consistently too. From Revy's signature tank top, jorts and dual Berettas, Rock's stuffy businessman look, cross dressing twins, gangster suits, Nuns With Guns\u2122, military fatigues, and Nazi uniforms to Roberta's crazy French Maid getup, there is a wildly varied cast of characters and looks. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\n\"Man, that's f*cking pathetic. Only some tit sucking mama's boy would come up with that bullsh*t conversation you're enjoying.\" - Revy\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"You whiny bitch, you're lucky I was around to save you from having your f*cking balls shot off by those guys from Hotel Moscow!\"\\n\r\nEda: \"Last time I checked, I didn't have a set, but maybe you do you nasty she-male!\"\\n\r\nRevy: \"ALL RIGHT YOU ASKED FOR IT BITCH!\"\\n\r\nEda:\"WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK WHICH ASSHOLE YOU WANT TO SH*T THROUGH!\" \\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"HEY YOU OLD BITCH! It's Rebecca! from Lagoon Company, open the f*cking door you old skank!\"\\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"You don't want to charge in with this piece of sh*t, especially not with a crackhead at the wheel\"\\n\r\nLeigharch: \"F*ck you! I'll have you know this is the world's greatest offroad vehicle you heartless bitch!\"\\n\r\nRevy: \"This piss tank is getting on my last nerve. Listen up you f*cking leprechaun, you're gonna wait here until you get our signal. If you run away, I'll hunt you down and castrate you!\"\\n\r\nShenhua: \"My, she say good thing, I agree very much!\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm with Shenhua. Everything that comes out of Revy's mouth is gold. This is a must watch in English. While the Japanese has some profanity, this one takes it BEYOND filthy, and with that comes so many laughs at the horrible things the characters threaten and say to each other. Panty and Stocking is really the only comparable dub, and the banter between Eda and Revy is like Panty and Stocking awesome, but better. Think Tarantino movie language- it flows really well, and sounds realistic. It's not overly pretentious or stuffy, it's just rough and raw. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nLet's hear it for cultural diversity! MADhouse in tha house!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if there's ever been an anime out there that's covered as many different enthic groups, religions, creeds, cults, groups, countries, races, and who even knows what other kind of label, it's Black Lagoon. All right, a show about pirates with cultural diversity, sounds freaking great right??\\n\\n\r\nWell get this:\\n\r\nYou've got the military, crooked cops, Yakuza, and the Triads, and the Russian Mafiya... yeah those are pretty run of the mill type stuff. Then you've got a little bit more out there stuff like Nuns With Guns\u2122, cowboy bounty hunters, a mute chainsaw wielding girl, and a Hank Hill inspired flamethrower wielding middle aged fat man. Then you get on up in to the upper echelon of crazy sh*t with crossdressing murder twin child soldiers, a Terminator French Maid, Neo Nazis (with full dress uniform), and one Shenhua, the sexy Taiwanese chinglish spewing, Enep knife wielding assassin. There's even a schoolgirl Yakuza boss, and Mr Chang, the Chinese Triad John Woo movie clone!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as main characters go, though, Revy is one of most outstanding and instantly recognizable characters out there, with her untied boots, jorts, tattoos, tank top, and signature double shoulder holsters. She's almost always smoking a cigarette, and trailing a stream of profanity and insults so rough it'd make Gordon Ramsay piss his pink panties.\\n\r\nSexy, tough and with a temper like Christian Bale and Mel Gibson combined times two, Revy exists to smoke, f*ck sh*t up, get paid, and drink straight liquor- in that order. She's corrupt and violent to the core, no whiny, needy clingy woman tropes here. Nothing gets her off more than getting lit and shooting shit up. \\n\\n\r\nShe's the quintessential badass, and she don't take shit from nobody. \\n\\n\r\nRock, on the other hand, is a guy stuck in the middle. When his dead end corporate grind job lands him in the middle of the South China Sea amongst a hive of scum and villainy, his outlook on life really changes- from bad to worse. As a guy who has been on both sides of the fence, he has a pretty unique perspective to the seedy gangster's paradise of Roanapur. His skills as a businessman do end up coming in handy when the all guns blazing route fails, but more often than not, he finds himself a spectator to the violent brutality of the city and its denizens.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn this criminal underworld, anything goes. Cops on the make, thugs on the take, and shootouts over dinner are the norm. Get f*cked up every night, drive it like you stole it, and crash only to repeat it the next day. If you're lucky, you might get some kind of job from the mafia. If not, you just had your last shot of rum- forever.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's story takes us on arc based tales straight out of an action movie. Every 2 or 3 episodes, the real life pirate crew of Dutch, Revy, Benny, and Rock take on some new job from the Russian mob and whatever crazy adventure it entails. They aren't some 16th century sailboat crew with tricorns and peglegs though- they're straight off the mean streets of Compton, I mean Roanapur. Armed with a stolen military torpedo boat and a million dollars' worth of military grade weaponry, a cunning captain and Revy's famous temper, they take on a variety of different missions. The episodes featuring Roberta, a Colombian terrorist turned maid, the twisted, murderous twin children Hansel and Gretel, and the Greenback Jane saga are highlights of the series in the insane, over the top, brutal, and hilarious elements respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the realism in this show. So often, action shows have to do with the supernatural or occult, and it was incredibly refreshing to see something that was grounded in realism, used real life guns, vehicles, and kept the story within the realm of gritty action movie. The hilarious dialogue was delivered perfectly, and the voice actors sounded great. While it was very over the top at times, this show watches like a John Woo movie mixed with Tarantino. It's just a heck of a lot of fun. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a real shame Mar\u00ffke Hendrikse didn't do many other voice roles. Revy will live the f*ck on forever though, because like she gives a sh*t. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Awesome characters that kick a lot of ass\\n\r\n+ Dialogue that will make you sh*t your pants, then kick you in the face for laughing\\n\r\n+ Excellent arc based story\\n\r\n+ Great animation and attention to detail\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nOf course. If you don't watch this, Revy is going to come shove her boot up your ass and make you lick your own crap off of it before busting a cap in your sniveling dome! \\n\r\nSeriously, if you like rough and tough with dark comedy- this is not to be missed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Roanapur is the kind of place where violent jokes come true.\" - Benny",

            "content": "Anime seems to be very tame these days. If it isn't about whiny high school kids living their boring ass lives, it's about overachieving, insane kids with magical notebooks (cough Deathnote). I like these kinds of animes as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel like doing nothing more than bathe in my own testosterone and achieve a massive erection looking at either tits, guns, or cars. Enter, Black Lagoon. An anime with tits, guns, AND cars. Expect testosterone, and lot's of it.\r\nStory-\r\nThe story is as generic as it can get. Some pussy ass bitch decides to change his life and he startsto do dangerous and badass things. Rock, the main character, is a brown nosing Japanese business man who is sent on a business trip to South Asia or somewhere around there. He is then kidnapped by a group of pirates/mercenaries called the Lagoon Company. Rock then has an epiphany or something and decides to live the hazardous life of a mercenary. This story has definitely been used multiple times in countless action movies. However, I never saw recycled action movie plots as a bad thing. It seems to attract the majority of males, so why not? The story itself is very cliche and overused, but since I am a healthy man, I loved it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nAt first glance the cast may seem to have generic written all over it, but it is special in it's own sense. The Lagoon Company consists of a pussy, a white computer guy, a buff black guy, and an insane triggerhappy monster of a woman. There's not much character development besides Rock, but you will find at least one character you will like. There is a rather large variety of characters and each one has a dark past of some sort. One of the aspects I liked about the characters was that almost everyone was interesting. In fact, my favorite character was Balalaika, who is a supporting character. All of the characters are very realistic and each one has his/her own unique personality and mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nI could tell that Black Lagoon had a rather high animation budget. All the explosions and battles were animated smoothly. I felt like I was watching Die Hard or something. The art is nothing new or innovative, but all the characters and backgrounds are drawn superbly. The colors are quite vivid and contribute to the overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound- \\n\r\nI feel like mentioning the opening is a must. The opening is a J-Rock song and it fits perfectly with the series. From the moment I heard it I knew this was going to be an intense anime with lots of violence. Not to my surprise, I was right. The BGM is also very good and contributes to the mood of the current scene. The ending was the only dissapointment in the soundtrack department. I expected another hardcore rock song, but all I got was a depressing, quiet melody.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a series any MAN can enjoy. Some women might like it too but men will enjoy it more. I feel like this anime was made by a group of muscular men drinking beer and lifting weights. Almost every part of this anime is action packed and there are so many gunfights and shit that I turned into a brainless neandrathal for a whole week. Watch this anime with lots of action and violence in mind and you will no doubt enjoy it. This series is a must watch for any action fan. Thanks for reading yo.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon- 9/10",

            "content": "wow.. this anime is shit!\r\nBecause of its non existing storyline and its uninteresting and stupid character the only thing this anime got left, being worthy to watch, would be its action scenes... and they sucked. They were complete unrealistic and stupid. (I am not agains unrealism in anime at all, but this action scenes were like a fist of \"unrealism\" punshing into my face. I will come to the action scenes later on)\r\nWell lets start off with the character (cuz i cant tell you much about the story):\r\nYou got rather 2 dominant main protagonists: Revy and Rock. I call them the dominant one because theblack guy Dutch and the computer freak Benny werent much included in the show at all (a bit in the beginning but they disapeared more and more later on). \\n\\n\r\nSo Revy: Many people refer to her as an example for badass female protagonists, because she curses a lot and is good at shooting people... Well besides the fact that she looks like an 14 year old highschoolgirl (you saw that at many moments) dressed up like a hooker( and even sits down like a hooker (fanservice) most of the time) I am really interested why she has to curse all the time. Its like noone would believe she is an badass without her insulting her oponent (and all her allies) all the time. I mean, when you look at Balalaika: her cursing is nearly nothing compared to Revys and she is still 100 times more badass than her. \\n\r\nSo we got a cute looking woman who curses all the time so you believe she is badass and who kills bad people in unrealistic gunbattles (kinda like an american version of a tsundere charactere... and everyone knows tsundere==shit)\\n\\n\r\nRock: Well Rock is the pussy of the anime (a bit cliche), who shows you the real power of gunfighting.. just kidding. WTF is the meaning behind a character who never uses a gun and who whines all the time about his situation (well at least he stopped that later on), being in a pure action gunfighting-anime???? Are u kidding me????? And the fact that in the second epiosde (or so )Balalaika seriously said to him what a tough guy he is made him even a bigger pussy than shinji was in the NGE anime. \\n\\n\r\nI have to mention that Black Lagoon at least was able to introduce some interesting characters, like Balalaika...and i guess thats the only one.\\n\\n\r\nTo the action scenes:This anime is one of these were you know from the start who is going to win the fight( that is kinda stupid in the first place) and besides that fact, you only watch how much unrealistic stuff was put into these fights. I want to give you some examples for my statment: \\n\r\nWell there was this scene were their ship was chased by 4 others or so (episode3) where Revy jumped about 5 meters with an rocked lancher on her back then survives the rocked explosion right next to her with no scratch and could dodge (or whatever) the bullets from 2 guys fireing at her, who were both right infront of her... ofc.  But the inability to aim or to pull the trigger bothers me a lot of this anime (do the enemey have some kind of fingere arthritic or something?) The enemies rather tell you their life story than shooting at you so that you could create the best plan for killing them (or whatever). Thats just retarded and the amount of facepalms in this anime was very high. (If you need some more examples for how stupid the action scenes are just message me)\\n\r\nI also have to mention that they actually did 1 good episode (EP15) where they finally didnt tell their life story to each other before the were going to fight. \\n\\n\r\nThere is much more that bothers me about this series and i cant tell you about all of them (mostly because i would have to rewatch the anime).\\n\r\nIf you think I spoilered too much of the series then i have to tell you: If you havent watched this series yet i hope my review prevent you from doing so. You can thank me for this. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall it gets a well deserved 1/10 (could have been worse)",

            "content": "\u201cThis is more entertaining than Hollywood is ever going to be!\u201d - Revy\r\nBlack Lagoon is one of Madhouse\u2019s greatest works. In terms of action and seinen, we no longer have to frustratingly listen to long speeches before gunshots fire. Black Lagoon is well-known for its nonstop action and features one of the most memorable and merciless women in the anime industry: Revy (famously known as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d), who is noted for her \u201ckill first, ask questions later\u201d style. Its depiction of Hollywood action films with the explosions, car chases, and gun-fighting at sea makes this entertaining to watch, especially with its mature dialogue and darkhumor.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon\u2019s cast makes up the entire story alone. The story follows the Lagoon Company as they take on paid missions and kill anyone who interferes. The dark humor and foul language are hilarious and bring out maturity. This brings along a fine set of characters, including mafias, Nazis, and war veterans for the fast and the furious. The four members of the Black Lagoon cast are unique amongst themselves: Revy; Dutch, the serious yet chill guy; Benny, the tech geek; and Rock, the Japanese guy who is trying to get used to the pirate lifestyle. Black Lagoon is mostly popular for their memorable and merciless female characters, including a Russian boss and killer maid, who shows no hesitation in fulfilling threats. The tragic and violent pasts of the female characters give them an ideal role for Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of character development, I wouldn\u2019t consider Black Lagoon to be episodic. New to the game, Rock started out unreasonably annoying, suddenly contributed clever schemes, and later went back to being a wimp again. He unchangeably grew some balls midway in the series, but his behavior seemed illogical how his personality kept going from scared to fearless back and forth in the beginning. Because of her rough background, Revy\u2019s cold-heartedness made her appear childish and selfish as she uses torture and violence as her therapy. Her attitude lessens a bit as she balanced the ability to know right from wrong. Revy and Rock's relationship undergoes the most development, since they both come from completely opposite background. \\n\\n\r\nOne downside is the failure to follow up on deceased supporting characters' past. Black Lagoon also ends incompletely with a lack of explanation about some of the characters\u2019 pasts and last minute questions presented in the last few episodes. As someone who watched all three seasons, I can confirm that the plotholes receive explanations within the two sequels. However, it would be better if it ended with some kind of conclusion. Since it continues with Episode 13 in the 2nd season, I found it useless to have Black Lagoon and Second Barrage separated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were very distinct. Revy is popular for her daisies, but it\u2019s honestly a turnoff. It\u2019s possible to fight and jump long distances with short daisies. The background design and settings were realistic with the lights and character interactions, especially in a bar. The blood splattering was not exaggerated or excessive, so it is easily tolerable for one who is not a fan of gore. There were a few stills, but the visual effects were really good, especially the fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is one of the few anime meant to be watched in English, because it sounds more natural than the Japanese. The seiyuu do not nearly fit the character\u2019s personalities as the English VA. Mar\u00ffke Hendrikse portrayed Revy\u2019s tomboy personality perfectly. I\u2019m glad Funimation chose Dean Redman to voice Dutch for his deep yet laidback voice. It was hard to hear Brad Swaile (voice of Light from Light Note) play a less villainous character, but he did a great job switching to Rock\u2019s attitude changes throughout the series. Also, the seiyuu sound horrible when a certain scene to be in English. Their English sounds broken and slow, interrupting and slowing the action of that scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is wonderful, and both the OP and ED centers on Revy. The English OP \u201cRed Fraction\u201d by Mell sung has lyrics that fits the hardcore action. The scores, usually instrumental rock music, suits the fighting scenes, too. The ED \u201cDon\u2019t Look Behind\u201d by Edison is fully instrumental. Although it's seen as a disadvantage with its slow tone after a hardcore episode, it actually has a smooth transition by not immediately jumping to the song. A calm setting moves away from the action and presents right before the ED.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a dream come true for one who craves a sense of maturity in an action anime. The pacing is good and doesn\u2019t waste time with lengthy dialogue like other seinen. The dark humor and action mixes well together, and the characters are unique and memorable. I highly recommend checking out Black Lagoon if you\u2019re into Hollywood films or just looking for a change of pace in terms of action. It was a wonderful experience for me, because every episode had nonstop action to look forward to.",

Not knowing what to make of the title or the poster, I was very surprised at what this anime turned out to be. Often criticized for copying \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019, I was a little concerned at first but this anime distinguishes itself with its world building and characters. Set to a dark yet realistic, cruel, cold, violentand brutal crime infested town that perfectly captures the last place you want to be in this R-rated world. This anime superbly holds nothing back and you get a load of hot girls wielding big guns and firing at everything and everyone! In fact, this anime is all about tits, ass, guns, explosions, cursing and badass chicks! You start with Okajima, leading a boring life who then gets kidnapped by the Lagoon company on a business trip. Upon realizing he\u2019s been abandoned by his own company, he decides to join this group of renegades and gets the nickname \u2018Rock\u2019. Even though the anime lacks in story and the plot is pretty much the group doing different missions, it never bothers anyone since what you get is very entertaining to watch! This has some of the best Action scenes, so good that you can\u2019t take your eyes off them! I mean why would I care about Story when I can get Revy killing a bunch of Nazi\u2019s on a ship! The anime also doesn\u2019t shy away from clich\u00e9s like generic character traits or plot armour for the main characters during battle but it doesn\u2019t matter! \u2018Black Lagoon\u2019 totally owns it by delivering non-stop Awesome Action and helps you forget the unrealism of it all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also one of those rare shows where the Female characters not only KICK ASS but completely steal the show! You get a little bit of everything from the characters, with the weak MC who later grow balls to a Computer Geek, Samurai, Mafia, Cartels, Russians, Nazis, Crazy maids and nuns! I had a lot of fun with most of the characters but the Stand out is Revy by a large margin. This foul mouthed, gun blazing, sexy yet deadly Chinese version of Lara Croft is the most interesting character on the show. She\u2019s the kind of woman who will kill anyone that gets in her way and then later drink at a bar as if nothing happened! Her use of the word \u2018F***\u2019 was always fun to hear and her \u2018No Shit Given\u2019 attitude propels her to the top of many people\u2019s list of Badass female characters. Revy also comes across very sexy regardless of displaying no forms of seductiveness, I mean she rarely shows any sort of attraction to anyone! But those poses she takes while shooting just makes her unbelievably attractive and I for one couldn\u2019t get her out of my head for a while! She\u2019s also involved in a lively relationship with Rock that\u2019s never clearly defined yet both display great chemistry with one another. In fact, Rock becomes more interesting after his interactions with Revy cause otherwise he\u2019s the one who holds back, being the one with morals and integrity. He\u2019s heavily overshadowed by Revy but I enjoyed him a lot too cause he showed tons of resilience for an amateur and even stared down the badass Revy by speaking his mind. Even under the threat of a gun, he was able to hold his ground. We even later see him starting to fit in with the rest of the group which was also to my liking. There are so many great supporting characters here so it\u2019s hard to pick a favourite! You get the nuns from the church, Eda stands out due to her relationship with Revy. Then you have the freaking female terminator maid Roberta who\u2019s insanely good with killing and tracking! Balalaika was another stand out female character, with her connections to the Russian military and the cold and smart demeanour with which she ran the place. She and her crew are responsible for some cool action scenes and I thoroughly enjoyed her arc in S2. Let\u2019s not forget about Chang who\u2019s a male badass in the show but unfortunately, we get very little of him. One nit-pick from my side is that the ladies go through their own tragic backstories, further developing their characters while guys were put to the side. The OVA even shed a glimpse into the past of Revy and you can then understand why she is the way she is but we get nothing for Dutch or Benny.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is as badass as the anime itself, perfectly setting the mood for some hardcore action. For such a standard track, it doesn't warrant you singing along or anything but it definitely gets its job done by pumping up the action scenes. The good use of sound effects for the car chases and explosions further improved the overall effect of those set pieces. And then the dubbing, which is some top-notch stuff. I loved, loved and loved Hendrikse\u2019s portrayal of Revy!!! She so perfectly embodied Revy\u2019s voice with her masterful give and take choice of words and tone that puts the subs to shame! Plus, the characters of the show themselves aren\u2019t Asian so the dubs gave an International feeling to the show which was required. Aside from great characters, we were also nursed with great dialogues, uncensored with profanity and energy! Finally, the animation here is excellent in both the character design and art work. The characters all have a uniqueness to them which\u2019s strongly displayed throughout the show. I never felt like I was watching a generic villain of the week with a different hairstyle or clothing, they really felt different from one another. The highly-distinguished artwork on Revy mannerisms, movements and expressions is further proof of the amount of quality work that went into this anime. And let\u2019s not forget about those action scenes! We have tons of them, ranging from fights on boats to ships to underwater submarine, car chases, bomb blasts and tons of gun battles! Despite so much variety of action, you are never bored with any of them for they are well choregraphed no matter how long they get! \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s any anime that can easily be turned into a live action movie, it\u2019s this one! And Quentin Tarantino should direct it if the casting is well done. S1 focuses on the entire team doing many jobs, basically an intro to all characters while S2 dives deep into the politics and power play of the city and its players. Not a bad direction to venture off to but it came at the expense of the Lagoon team for we only get Rock and Revy. Also in S2 I didn\u2019t like the changes with Revy at first. She\u2019s a total badass in S1 but then she changes in S2, showing a cuter side of herself. She lost that edge of gun blazing insanity streak to her and started smiling more, she even started wearing a skirt and i felt like it was just fan service! I was also afraid they were going to just stick her into a girlfriend role with Rock in S2 but thankfully they further played upon the platonic relationship between those two. You could clearly see a more humane side to Revy, realizing theirs\u2019s a sensitive side deep inside her despite all her ruthlessness. It\u2019s also totally believable since Rock is slowly wearing her defences down and Revy is finding herself more relaxed and comfortable around Rock. \\n\r\nIn conclusion, the anime has an unsatisfying ending! The story conveniently wraps up but we get NO Resolution from the characters which really pissed me off! I still enjoyed this violent and gritty take on crime mafia and the badass characters that run this city though I would have wished for a more complete ending. It\u2019s still worth your time so check it out!",

            "content": "One word that keeps propelling itself to the forefront of my head when I go to describe this show is: &lsquo;refreshing&rsquo;. Generally, I tend to avoid those anime which are blatantly action-oriented, because an action anime series so often means that it will be generically shounen, or be some kind of absurd mecha-combat series; very rarely can I find an action series which does not fall to those and other traps, and Black Lagoon is one of them. From its premise to its execution, the show provides thrilling action sequences, from boat and car chases, to messy fisticuffs and bullet-spamming gunfights, the show covers alltypical action bases you could expect from hollywood, but which, for one reason or another, anime rarely delivers. Although its depiction of battle features the usual problems of character shielding and the Stormtrooper effect, overall the show is very much grounded in reality, with no magic or science-fiction elements whatsoever. I found this refreshing because, typically, the only anime you are likely to find set in present-time reality are slice-of-life, revolving around dramatic or romantic themes. So Black Lagoon was a great change of pace; a hollywood style action/adventure shoot &lsquo;em up but with a darker and more thoughtful approach to themes and characters (as is often found in mature anime) - it&rsquo;s a splendid mix.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for the show are certainly excellent, some of the best to have come out of 2006. It shines during the action scenes, which are very fluid and detailed, but overall has no real flaws other than the occasional lapse in consistency. The character designs are all attractive and original. The music is not something that impressed me; there isn&rsquo;t a lot of score music in the show (which is slightly refreshing given anime&rsquo;s habbit of blasting violin and choir over every scene), and what it has is fitting, but not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well defined, although I felt the focus given to the characters was rather strangely distributed; Revy and Rock (the two main characters) aside, the rest of the Black Lagoon barely garnered any attention, and their involvement was so greatly reduced by the end of the series that you had to wonder why the show was even named after the group. I am not kidding that the majority of the villains the group encountered received considerably more character exploration than either Benny or Dutch (the other two Black Lagoon members). I understand the importance of giving depth to the antagonist perspective, but I got the feeling that the original creator just kept falling in love with the antagonists he introduced, and neglected the protagonists in order to delve indulgently into the villain&rsquo;s pasts and characters. The best example would be Hanzel and Gretel, the goth-loli twins and their arc. They were given so much background, and such a poignant send-off yet had so little effect on any continuing plot, or on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRevy was certainly an interesting character. I&rsquo;ve seen the hardened, indifferent criminal stereotype before, but Black Lagoon takes Revy to the next level and actually glorifies her as colourfully maniacal. It makes the show fun to watch because you never know how to feel about Revy; sometimes you&rsquo;ll side with her and cheer her on, or feel sorry for her, but then the next moment she&rsquo;s slaughtering innocent people for enjoyment. Essentially she&rsquo;s a juxtaposition of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and &lsquo;reprehensible&rsquo;. Rock is a character who is much easier to make a connection with, in fact I like to see him as being the representative for the audiences perspective on the show as it traverses the challenging lands of immorality. He is described in the show as being &lsquo;in the twilight&rsquo;, neither living under explicitly righteous terms, nor wholly endorsing the injustice of the underworld. This allows him to be constantly critical of the actions of those around him, but from an intelligent objective position (ie he does not decry their actions through blind morality). His criticisms of the actions Revy and others around him take make for the most profound and thematically crucial dialogue in the show, and despite his outwardly plain personality, also make him a fascinating and important presence in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the real crux of the matter: the show is really about the criminal mind, and the life of crime in all its forms. It paints an alluring portrait of the attraction to such a life, but never forgets to challenge that attraction by showing the kind of sacrifices one has to make of their humanity. It shows crime as a dangerously beautiful thing, and also shows it at its most sickening. All the exciting action is secondary to this. In conclusion, Black Lagoon should be watched by all action fans, but is a step above most shounen series due to its challenging and, at times, risqu&eacute; foray into the heart of the criminal world. It is for mature audiences, because, despite having such character and being so colourful about murder, it is also very dark at times. There are flaws in the way it is paced, and the way some of the characters are neglected, but it has some very sharp dialogue, and is regardlessly entertaining thrill",

            "content": "\"This is way more entertaining than Hollywood is ever going going to be!\" truer words like that have barely been spoken in anime in my opinion, and with the shit that's out now, I'm inclined to believe them.\r\nSTORY: Enter Rokuro Okajima, a typical meek japanese office worker of a large corperation who's the epitome of ordinary with a life so boring, bland, and not so envious with complains such as his boss kicking his ass, but his bleak life style comes to an end when a business trip cruise to South East Asia turns into hell as a group of modern day pirates take himhostage and gives him much more to complain about than just a kick to the bum.\\n\r\nAfter a wild couple of bullet-filled days with said pirates, he decides to join up out of the feeling of excitement he experienced and the way his company has treated him like a worthless throw away and takes up the name, \"Rock\".\\n\\n\r\nRock's fellow crewmates include Benny the mechanic, computer specialist, and researcher, Dutch the calm, easygoing leader, and Revy the merciless, sadistic, foul mouthed gunner who's skill is almost unparalleled, she also goes by the name of \"Two hands\" cause of how she normally uses two guns in gun fights, heck any kind of fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Black Lagoon is mostly episodic with a few arcs that normally last about three to four episodes, but the lack of on ongoing plot continues on towards the second season, yet it's no problem at all, though it would've been nice if there were some that involved more development of the main characters (Besides just Revy and Rock).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows the gang as they try to complete jobs so they can earn a living, just like the main cast in Cowboy Bebop except these outlaws usually get their jobs done.\\n\r\nAnd during their jobs they face against a wide array of foes including gangs, nazis, and several eccentric foes such as a nearly unstoppable maid, and allies like a taiwanese assassin, with the main cast in nearly endless gun fights. With most of their requests coming from Balalaika, a leader of a russian crime syndicate \"Hotel Moscow.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a some what crude and black sense of humor, with mostly excessive cursing and yells and screams such as \"I'll rip you a new asshole!\" \\n\r\nBut probably the funniest stuff is the insults, especially when Revy meets a certain assassin near the end of the anime, the insults bounce back at each other like a well written conversation.\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully the anime might have ended up becoming a mindless bullet hungry action anime, and ultimately making it another waste of potential along with many others that have stacked up in the pile, if not for the characters, specificly the interaction between them.\\n\r\nEspecially between Rock and Revy, through the daily dangers and learning about Revy's past that was full of unbearable hardships that bulids up to her character, Rock learns that his partners are almost the complete opposite of him, especially during one episode where the tension between he and Revy becomes so deadly guns are involved.\\n\r\nThese interactions are tense, nerve wrecking, and may just be much more entertaining to watch than the fights, which is unique for a heavy action such as this.\\n\r\nBut slowly and surely, Rock starts to become used to this new way of life he chose, and begins to fit in, yet still is faced with his decision, and is constantly asked, Is this world right for him? or is he simply just an outsider and nothing more?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Great animation, displaying exciting gun fights, and little still frames with an overall dark feel to the series.\\n\r\nGood character designs being very diversed. The anime sometimes uses CG animation. but only during chase scenes in the vehicles, which thankfully doesn't look out of place that only the whiniest of nit pickers would complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Noticeable background music that fits in with most of what's going on at the moment, especially with the ending theme which starts playing during the anime and it helps to indicate whenever an episode comes to an end, and really feels a perfect song that will make you think back to the episode you've watched, and it has like a mysterious yet calm feeling to it, then ending with a rock conclusion that reminds you what the anime is (mostly) about.\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Red faction, is an awesome theme, despite it being in engrish.\\n\r\nThe english dub is by Ocean (Known for the dub of Death Note and Inuyasha), and is a one of a kind dub where it would feel weird to listen to in japanese, all due to the overall setting of the series. \\n\r\nBut the stand out performance (Among a cast of great voice actors) is the voice actor of Revy, giving that crude attitude of Revy a great convincing performance and just makes every scene with her just entertaining to even just listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Excellent characters and character interaction.\\n\r\n+ An incredible english dub that even makes the japanese audio seem out of place.\\n\r\n+ Good opening and ending theme music, good back ground music.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Very violent and action oriented. / May be too violent for some.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Lack of a continuing plot.\\n\r\n- Not too much of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime just barely shy's away from getting a nine overall.\\n\r\nEach form of media entertainment has their crap, with more so than others, but it's anime like this is the reason way I choose to stick with this media.\\n\r\nAnd I guarantee you'll feel like a pansy if you watch something moe or fluffy after leaving the lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n*Quick word on season two*\\n\\n\r\nSeason two is pretty much what I feared what Black Lagoon would mostly be about, absurdness with a penchant for wasting so many bullets that I'd feel sorry for the janitor who would try to clean it all up, but ends up getting killed by a stray bullet fired for no reason.\\n\r\nNot that I'm trying to say that it isn't entertaining, but just not more of the same gun and smoke. 7/10 for season two.",

            "content": "- - - - - [ Black Lagoon Season 1 :: Ep-12 ] - - - - -\r\n- [ Intro ] -\r\nBlack Lagoon. That's a name that easily caught my eye. After reading the brief review, I said \"why not?\". And so I found a great anime that would get me hooked for quite a long time! And it definitely deserves rewatch! On with the review!\r\n- [ Animation: Good quality and well-detailed -> 9 ] -\r\nLet's set things clear now. Black Lagoon (BL) has one of the best animations i've ever seen! If you pay attention to details, you will like BL. The animators haveinvested great effort in creating detailed backgrounds and characters. OMG! You can even see the demin texture on Revy's short sometimes! Now, another thing that amazed me is that both the characters and background are animated at the same time. I know, this sounds simple but no! These two are almost independent of each other but even them, you will see the characters interacting with the backgrounds in a number of ways. When the characters are being shot at, notice the number of bullet-holes on the walls increasing. Notice the gun smoke that dissipates when the characters walk. All these details make BL's animation great and lively.\\n\\n\r\nThe character motions are smooth and natural, even during the very fast-paced action scenes. Even then, the background does not lose its details. On one scene on a ship, you can see the rivets as Revy is fighting! Quite a number of details to watch out for. The play on lights and atmosphere renders a great effect too. The animators definitely knew what they were doing.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound: Suits situations and fast-paced -> 9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, I don't pay much attention to sound. NOPE! Here, it got my full attention! The Opening (OP) and Ending (ED) credits music is very good, specially the OP. It really suits the mood of the series in my opinion. Now for the ending, you will notice that the music starts within the episode, starting at a very low hum to gradually attain its normal level as the episode ends. It's a superb blend. It's the first anime I know that uses this technique and I can say I'm impressed. It was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the in-series music is nonetheless amazing! It really enlivens the scenes to their respective paces. In dramatic situations, you will get the appropriate music. In fast-paced scenes, expect hard rock or similar. It was a good choice of music for the series. For once, the sound of an anime caught my attention. I am looking foreward to a Black Lagoon OST.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story: No real plotline ->7 ] -\\n\\n\r\nStory? Don't expect any in BL! There is none. BL is a collection of short stories, pieced together to show you the lives of the characters at a point in time. There is no plot, not even in the second season (Second Barrage) of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the short stories are very good and definitely deserves watching if you enjoy action and gun-fights. They place the main characters in a variety of situations in which their work places them.\\n\\n\r\nI have not introduced the story yet! Sorry. So, Black Lagoon is about a man, Okajima Rokuro, who is entrusted the mission of delivering a data disk to some people by his company. The man is travelling on a ship when the latter is attacked by pirates (not really pirates but anyway..). After some time, we are told that the pirates are after the data disk carried by Rokuro. The pirates, a man-and-woman team will eventually get the disk, but also take Rokuro as hostage to get some ransom from his company. However, the data disk contains sensitive data about the company, and merceneries are sent after the pirates to destroy them. The demand for ransom is immediately ignored and Rokuro is considered dead. Here begins the life of Rock, formerly Rokuro, as a delivery agent on the Black Lagoon speedboat, together with gun-slinger Revy, captain Dutch and computer whiz Benny.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the plot is fairly interesting. You will soon see that delivering goods, specially illegal stuff, is not a safe business. Often, the characters are put in life-threatening situations and major gunfights resulting, specially with battle-maniac Revy around. Rock is sort of the negociator for Black Lagoon Company, negociating terms of business and often toning down conflicts. We are also presented with the clients of BLC, namely the Russian Mafia boss Miss Balalaika and Mr Chan, leader of the triads or even the Church of Violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe short stories are definitely worth watching, and seldom offers time for boredom. Watch if you need something fast-paced and energetic. There were no nudity, although some exposure was shown. Violence? BL is filled of it. Bad language? Same. Humour? Yes. Crude jokes and black humour is there for you. So, it's not an anime for young people.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Characters: Development & Variety ->9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the fun lies in BL, the characters. Each of them is so very unique in their own way that you feel that they really possess emotions. They fight for their own causes, have their own motivations which sound very heroic or plausible. They have their own strengths and weaknesses and can each be liked or hated by the viewer. The main characters of BL are each well-developed, this being one of the great parts of BL. The main characters are:\\n\\n\r\nRevy: She is the gun of Lagoon Company who gets everybody out of trouble. Apparently she does not like Rock, but what she hates is his attitude. In fact, she will often go out of her way to help others and specially Rock. She is an expert when it comes to fighting techniques, who can single-handedly eliminate every enemy, armed with her twin-guns, Cutlass. Sometimes, she is so addicted to fights that she would go berserk. No one is spared then, not even her crew, as Rock saw for himself in an episode.\\n\\n\r\nDutch: He is the captain of the Lagoon speedboat. Tactial, he never does things rashly. He seems to be African, something rare in Japanese animes. He is equally talented when it comes to guns. However, he prefers to avoid fights when possible.\\n\\n\r\nBenny: The computer genius of Lagoon. Not much is known about him. He never fights but is an expert getaway driver.\\n\\n\r\nRock: The newest member of Lagoon. Although he never fights, he is an expert in negotiations and at pacifying Revy, often at the cost of blows! He always try to hold back Revy and has a strong sense of justice. He will try to protect anyone and everyone, something which exasperates Revy.\\n\\n\r\nBalalaika: The woman who controls Hotel Moscow. She was an ex-millitary and is very proficient when it comes to wars of any sort. She also commands a small army which often comes in play in BL.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the characters of BL are varied. You have to see for yourself to enjoy BL. I can't say more.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Value and Enjoyment: Very good -> 9 ] -\\n\\n\r\nIf you want action, and specially fast-paced action, BL is for you. But since there is no real plot, many viewers will be turned away. I, for my part, really enjoyed BL and even rewatched the whole series a couple of times, just for the action and butt-kicking. It kinda pumps up the adrenalin, if you see what I mean. The series, being short, is easy to rewatch without severe boredom. The small stories furthur eliminate boredom, and plotholes.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Conclusion ] -\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something good to watch, check out Black Lagoon. If you like it, there is a second season with 12 episodes called Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage. The situation is nearly same for Second Barrage. It's not really a continuation but just more short stories. There is no ending to BL, and I don't even know if there would be a real story. Some people have been speculating that the real Black Lagoon has not yet started and that we were merely watching the prequel. That would be the longest prequel I've ever seen, with 24 episodes! :S\\n\\n\r\nI've got nothing more to say. Just go watch BL. The lack of a plotline made me give BL an overall 8. Apart from that, there are no major flaws. You won't regret it, in my opinion. And thanks for reading!",

            "content": "With a genre that deals with a lot of action set-pieces, a show of this specific genre is usually bogged down into mindless entertainment territory with absolutely no substance to it at all. There have been in the past many action films, and TV shows that have shown to become competent in the history of film-making, examples in mind are the works of John Woo, Michael Mann, and Quentin Tarantino. But what if I told you that there is an anime show that encompasses everything that is great about those three directors and succeeds on every possible level? The show in question is Black Lagoon,a show that showcases a blend of mindless Hollywood action and juvenile humor in the best possible sense of the word juvenile.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's story is mainly focused on our four main characters and their adventures together through plot arcs that tie in together through the chemistry that helps make them grow with each other. There isn't much of a deep, complex plot to behold in the show; it's about as clich\u00e9 as any Seinen action show in the past decade. That may seem like a negative when you put it that way, but sometimes clich\u00e9s are used to good effect when you have competent writing to flesh out your characters and set-pieces. Black Lagoon is a definite exception to this rule; it manages to pull off even the most ridiculous plot arcs that could easily be looked at with eye rolls and as a laughable premise. One glorious example is just how dark and witty the dialogue writing is that it hits the mark on every scene it creates within the framework of the show. It gives Black Lagoon a spark of creativity in its witty black humor that creates its unique personality to deviate itself from other shows like it, in terms of writing. It never gets old because it's not repetitive in how it's delivered by the characters sparingly and not done on almost every scene in each episode, it makes the jokes work more effectively with clarity and sensibility.\\n\\n\r\nNow when you talk about the characters in Black Lagoon, the one character you must acknowledge the most is the one and only Revy. She's the prototypical \"girl with guns\" character that spouts off adolescent language and a dark past that shadows over the overall tone of the show to not only to become a dark comedy but a dark one altogether. So how is Revy different from any other female character in a \"girls with guns\" show? She does have similar characteristics that could be pointed out as being standard or generic from other characters like her. But it's because Revy is Black Lagoon. Her presence in the world of the show is very charismatic and alluring that demands your attention by not only her design, which is by far one of the sexiest I've seen in a long time, but by her character background and her hilarious dialogue. As I said before about the writing, the writers give Revy a ton of material for her to shine on-screen when she is either going into these well put together action scenes and her funny, snarky remarks at any of the characters. There is even a Tarantino kind of quality to her where she is this sick woman who only cares for money and violence, but she's also portrayed in a sympathetic light when she explains why her mentality is the way it is from her troubled past. They don't necessarily go in too much further in this season, but regardless it is a high starting point to a fantastic character.\\n\\n\r\nWith Revy out-of-the-way, the other characters may not have as much depth or even characterization as our larger than life heroine, but that certainly does not mean that they are wrong in any way shape or form. Our main hero, nicknamed Rock, does have some of the same levels of charisma as Revy and how he doesn't come across as a weak-willed character as most characters of his archetype typically are. It isn't as if Revy's presence overshadows his own because he doesn't have much of a personality, Rock carries the show by himself quite well and even together with Revy. The chemistry between the two is pretty unique in how they always are at odds with each other because of how different they follow life, but in the end, they still view each as part of a team whether they want to or not. No scene involves them immediately becoming friends overnight, the show takes it's time to build them up as a team that has to trust each other, or they might end up in a bad situation, and it's written intelligently by this very fact. The two other people in the group named Dutch and Benny aren't given much to go around as complex characters, but this does not automatically make them evil characters, what little background they bring on the table for them is still much appreciated in how they even offer some great scenes with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are hit and miss in how little depth some of them have when they seem. One, in particular, involves an army of Aryan neo-nazis that look more like just fodder characters that don't get a lot of deep characterization that, while I can forgive it, given how it's portrayed in an action show,  it would've been more than what it already was. For the one that does hit the mark is oddly enough a Roberta maid who is given some context for her intentions on being who she is. The show handles it very well despite her strange terminator-like persona that wasn't given much explanation. Then again the show is nutty enough to let it pass as just another Black Lagoon style of logic put in for good measure.\\n\\n\r\nFor the style of animation that Madhouse put together back their swell days, it still definitely holds up as a great visual treat. The action scenes are done with absolutely great visual flair and technicality that are inspired by the works of John Woo, as I've mentioned in the beginning. Although not perfectly seamless in how slick the characters move, it is nonetheless spectacular to see how the animators put their hearts and souls to not cut any corners whatsoever in detailing every aspect of Revy and the rest of the environment on the sights of her gun. The violence and carnage in Black Lagoon are not necessarily as gory or blood-splattering as many would argue; there is no question that it celebrates its carnage, but it's not done in a way that is so blatant or in-your-face where it gets tedious or loses its momentum in how effective each shot counts. There are some that do fit in that class, but for the most part, it handles its violence with nice precision and intelligence that make every scene brimming with fascinating acts of carnage that is more exciting to watch than just rolling your eyes in boredom. There are even some elements of neo-noir in the case of how it handles the violence how it cuts immediately away from Revy shooting a man in the head at close range; not to mention the show has some great camera angles that make the scenes have some profound impact to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is about what you would expect out of an action show like Black Lagoon. Standard rock and metal music that isn't very memorable to even try to buy an album for since it's just there to fill up the show's audio production and nothing more, not to mention the shooting and the characters shouting over the music doesn't help either. It does its job well to create a fun dark humorous vibe to the action scenes. The voice acting, however, is what makes the dialogue spice up to new heights. I've only listened to the Japanese voice actors in Black Lagoon, and they all own their roles. The one to mention out the rest is Megumi Toyoguchi who does a helluva performance as Revy by giving her a tremendous sarcastic essence to her voice that makes her so alluring and almost sexual. It fits the design of Revy so perfectly that Megumi almost becomes Revy just through her voice alone. Daisuke Namikawa, as usual, does an excellent job voicing Rock and doesn't seem like a novice compared to Megumi's performance, as do the rest of the cast members with some that aren't noteworthy to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Black Lagoon is about as silly and stupid as one could get out of an action show that would even make Steven Seagal blush, not that Black Lagoon quality-wise is comparable to his films, just from a contextual point-of-view. Stupid is usually used to describe something without context or substance when relating a story or character in any medium, but if the show is self-aware of the fact that it is and takes advantage of this aspect. It is clear that there are some genuinely serious moments found in Black Lagoon, even though they are effective in achieving the dark tone that it is known for. Even with that said, it doesn't seem out-of-place or distracting from the humor of the show because of how greatly paced the narrative of all the arcs. All of these are what make Black Lagoon easily one of the most entertaining and hard-hitting action shows that treats its audience as grown adults and creates some of the most well-choreographed action courtesy of Madhouse; one terrible aiming bad guy at a time.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A\\n",

It's not better than me, because it does have some flaws, but then again, nothing is really better than I am. \r\nThe story follows some pirates (not the \"Argh, mateys!\" kind) who do all sorts of crazy shady jobs for MONEY. Yeah, it's original that these people are motivated by cash and not by personal beefs. Makes itrealer. Most of the anime has a realistic storyline, except for the unrealistic parts like killer twins and fighting maids and whatever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were seriously good. Character design was really damn good. Music was always interesting to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nRevy has to be the best anime character in this show. She can kick your ass right off your body and make you wipe your tears with it. Then there's the wet blanket Rock, but unlike most wet blankets, I don't want to hang him out to dry (or die) since he's actually just being a realistic character i.e. a wimp. Then, to spice it up, since you don't only want Asians, there's a Jew and a black dude. Way to spice it up, Japan!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want to be amazed by cool gun fights and pirates and boats, this is the anime for you. If you haven't seen it as yet, stop washing your undies for a minute, get some bladder control, and sit back and enjoy one of the coolest anime ever.",

            "content": "One of the darkest animes I've seen in my life, Black Lagoon portrays quite brilliantly the gritty and obscene lives of mercenaries for hire and the underworld of crime. Casting an academic and otherwise completely innocent person as the protagonist just makes this anime even more explicit and realistic than any other. \r\nThe story follows a team of mercenaries known as Lagoon Company, who smuggle goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia. Their base of operations is located in the fictional city of Roanapur in Thailand, and they transport goods in the PT boat Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients,but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions - which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles - in various Southeast Asian locations and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime stay in the mind long after the anime is over. The story follows the plotline of Rock, a Japanese salaryman kidnapped in the early episodes by the crew of Black Lagoon which provided the various main characters of Revy, Dutch, and Benny. Rock of course is the gentlelest of the crew as he gradually assimilates after the various bloody mercenary jobs he undertakes. Using reasoned arguments and persuasion, he's the counterpoint to the jaded and oftentimes brutal teammates.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last point, specifically to Revy a hardened Chinese lady mercenary whose looks hide a merciless and cold exterior. She likes to systematically take apart the enemy and relishes gunfights. However, later she develops feelings for Rock.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point of this anime lies in the fact that the world is cruel, and dark. Throughout the series, Black Lagoon crew takes pay for various dangerous and very gruesome jobs, often paid for by Balalaika, the cynical lady boss of the elite Russian Mafia whose members consisted of basically &quot;Russian SWAT&quot;. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are usually gritty and dark with plenty of disturbing themes and pulse pounding action. In this aspect, the gunfights are simply spectacular and perhaps the best in anime. It is definitely something worth seeing.\\n",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an action fan's dream come true, but those looking for characters and plot might be a bit turned off.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nI avoided this anime for the longest time, since I am generally not a fan of this kind of action series. After a year or so of procrastination, I finally got around to watching it. Here are my thoughts on the series as a whole (including Second Barrage and Roberta's Blood Trail OVAs, but not the odd Omake Spin off).\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nMake no mistake about it: Black Lagoon is an action series through and through. It's gunfights galore,with some explosions and hand-to-hand combat thrown in to spice things up. All this action comes at the expense of an intricate and well thought out plot. I can forgive the show for this, however, since story telling is not its goal. The story of Black Lagoon (and sequel/OVAs) has two good things going for it, though.\\n\\n\r\n1. The story may be simple, but it is still coherent. There are no huge gaps that you are expected to just accept.\\n\r\n2. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, despite having no intellectual value whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, come for the action, not the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon does not have particularly great animation, but it doesn't really detract from the show. Colors are bland, character models are a bit simple while managing to be inconsistently drawn at points, and the gun models were often cringe-worthy. With that said, character movements are fluid throughout the action scenes (so most of the show), so I will give it a little extra credit there. Roberta's Blood Trail is slightly better done, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening, Engrish and all. The gunfire was good as well, and the backing soundtrack matched it well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another area that had to be sacrificed to make room for action. Few characters other than Rock, Revy, and Balalaika get more than a minute or two of development. Another contributing factor may be the large cast of characters that make up the show, not allowing any particular one to get much time on screen. This results in characters being pretty one dimensional, with the exception of the three mentioned above. Rock's character develops a bit over the series, but it is nothing to write home about. Revy and Balalaika have their pasts explained, which helps the viewer to better understand their actions, but neither develop at all over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable characters are the Vampire Twins of Second Barrage. While I won't go into spoilers, they were some of the most interesting and tragic villains I've seen in a series of this nature.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't normally enjoy plotless action series, Black Lagoon was an exception. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time, and watched episode after episode soaking up the shear fun and absurdity of it all. If I enjoyed it, it would be any true action fan's dream come true. If someone did not care as much for plot and characters as I do, this show could be much higher ranked for them.\\n\\n\r\nAny fan of action series should not hesitate to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nWhile I nearly always prefer watching a show raw or subbed, I can assure you that the dub for this series is superb (after the first few episodes, while the characters get into their roles).\\n\r\nWhile the show has a lot of violence, it is seldom very graphic (there are a few exceptions). However, the profanity in the English dub is harsh and frequent.\\n\\n\r\nOmake has absolutely nothing to do with the series, and you can skip it without missing anything.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWe have seen countless struggles in anime between good and evil, but what about a struggle between grey vs. grey or evil vs. evil? There are actually a few anime that fit that description, but few quite as celebrated as Black Lagoon. Lets go into the depths of the criminal underworld and look at one of the darker anime ever to reach mainstream popularity. What you want to know is, \"Is it any good?\" Well...sort of.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story can be broken down into arcs, but there is no real overall progressive plot. Just more dirty jobs that need to get done. \"Its like wagon train,it's a great show but they never really get anywhere, they just keep wagontraining\" -Stand By Me. The main character is a quirky Japanese businessman who is captured by a modern day pirate crew. They hold him for ransom, but his company refuses to offer a dime to save his life. Rather than killing him, the crew make him a member after he has the admittedly awesome idea of launching torpedoes at a helicopter while jumping their boat through the air. Together, our modern pirate crew  take on Nazis, homicidal twins that were previously stars of a series of pedophile snuff films, and other bad guys. All the while, our \"heroes\" or more accurately protagonists since they aren't really heroes, are working for a Russian mob division called Hotel Moscow. \\n\\n\r\nOne reason Black Lagoon is praised is for the sheer amount of melodramatic, dark and depressing shit that happens. Seriously, critics who attack other anime for trying to be \"dark and edgy\" praise Black Lagoon for doing the same thing! In reality, Black Lagoon is a poorly written melodrama with mediocre action scenes. It is an absurdly overrated anime both here on MAL and over on 4chan. If the series wanted to be dark because it was bringing attention to real world issues or was a well written tragedy, that would be one thing, but Black Lagoon is dark for the sake of being dark and violent for the sake of being violent. Black Lagoon has no morals or messages to teach. I would also be fine if Black Lagoon were a pure, fun action series. However, as previously mentioned the action is too sparse and is mostly rather unsatisfying. Black Lagoon goes halfway between being the dark, bloody insanity of Hellsing Ultimate and the thought provoking darkness of Berserk. By not settling on just one, Black Lagoon ultimately fails at both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is a wide cast of characters, but most of them are either unlikable bastards or just not that interesting. A lot of people like Revi and say she is the most badass chick in anime. This is pure bullshit She comes across to me more as a loud, obnoxious, ceaselessly strutting bravado whose skill doesn't live up to her ego. She is great at slaughtering weak opponents, but can only beat the few quality opponents she faces in ridiculously cheap fashion. She also cries like a bitch and passes out after getting stabbed in the leg, which isn't very badass. She's less Alucard and more Luke Valentine. She has the cliche' tragic past, but we can't really empathize because she feels no remorse for her misdeeds. She grew up slaughtering families to stay in their houses much like Lucy from Elfen Lied, but whereas Lucy actually has a conscience, Revy is a complete sociopath. She is less Lucy and more of a lame version of Captain Hans from Hellsing. She is a seemingly nihilistic monster that has a few moments where she seems to still possess a human soul, but not enough to make us actually root for her. However, she isn't nearly as cool as Captain Hans, so if he fought Revy, I would root for the SS Werewolf all the way! It is a bad sign for a character's likeablility when the audience would rather cheer for an SS member. Dutch could have been an interesting character if he was developed more, but most all of the development and back story goes to Rock and Revy, who are probably my 2 least favorite characters in the show. The 2 best characters in the whole show are the Incredible Mr. Chang and Balalaika. Guess which 2 characters have the least screen time? Yep, unfortunately it's those 2. If they made a spinoff series with just Chang and Balaika, it would actually be a substantial improvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is honestly pretty damn good. I don't really have much more to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is best described as weak and utterly forgettable\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say I enjoyed this series very much. There is no single category where this show really shined. It was decent as an action, but not truly outstanding. It was bogged down by needlessly depressing melodrama for no reason as explained above. If young otaku want a \"dark and mature\" anime to feel like men, why not watch Berserk or Monster? Those are plenty dark and a SHIT load better than Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon isn't a horrible series, but it isn't really a good series. The best characters are wasted, and it isn't as entertaining as it could have been. If it had focused more on longer, higher quality gunfights and less on needlessly depressing bullshit where our \"heroes\" must help the Russian mob ship children into slavery before vivisecting some puppies and burning down an orphanage on Christmas Eve, maybe it could have been a good series.",

Cowboy Bebop had many, but they were fun and still had meaning behindthem. Black Lagoon on the other hand had no point. Then there was the final episodes.

            "content": "In many respects, Black Lagoon is difficult series to review. At its core it is a show which takes what is an essentially interesting and engaging story and then promptly covers it with a rather thick layer of absurdity and an aesthetic love of violence for its own sake. That is to say, for a series which outwardly claims to be \"mature\" and \"realistic,\" in one sense it succeeds, and in another it fails. [It should also be mentioned beforehand that this will be a review of the first 12-episode installment of the series only, and not the Second Barrage]\r\nBeginning with the positive side, BlackLagoon can be seen first and foremost as story of transformation, namely, a transformation of two of its main characters, Rock and Revy, during the course of the narrative. What the series does particularly well is illustrate how these two individuals are changed for the better not only through their respective circumstances, but through their interactions with one another. \\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, Rock goes from being a whiny, non-confrontational sycophant who has spent his entire adult life working for nothing but a comfortable mid-level position in the  business hierarchy to someone who is not only courageous and willing to stand up for himself, but also someone with an unapologetic sense of virtue and ethical character (denounced by Revy as mere residue of his pampered upbringing); in fact, his later insistence on keeping his shirt and tie in a way symbolizes how he has not left the beliefs of his old life behind completely, but rather has managed to strike a kind of sensible medium. The rather dire nature of his initial circumstances (that is, unexpectedly joining a crew of pirates) slowly forces him to realize that there are fundamentally better things in life than climbing the corporate ladder and sucking up to others in a value system of decadence and wealth. Shortly after becoming a hostage on the Lagoon, he himself states that \"I guess this must be what they call the Stockholm Syndrome,\" suggesting that, already at the first episode, he indeed feels more liberated being surrounded by pirates on a ship than pirates in an office. Throughout the series, Rock realizes more and more how hollow and meaningless his former life was and how strangely pleased he is with his new line of work. This does not seem to necessarily be praise of piracy, but rather more simply a love of adventure and, at the same time, a denouncement of the phony smiles and hypocrisy of modern Japanese bourgeoisie culture. \\n\\n\r\nRevy, on the other hand, of course begins her transformation from the complete opposite end of the spectrum. That is, she starts off as a trigger-happy loose cannon with poor judgement, someone who believes that might automatically equals right and that all problems can be solved by threats of physical violence--which is, after all, how she manages to keep Rock under her thumb for the better part of the series. She also exhibits a kind of adolescent pseudo-nihilism, thumbing her nose at compassion and believing that monetary gain is the highest good and the only law. However, through her experiences with Rock she begins to exhibit a more human emotional side, and perhaps begins to realize that she is not as nihilistic as she would have others believe; this is demonstrated particularly well in the final arc, but even more so in her verbal/physical confrontation with Rock in episode 7, which arguably comprises the best and most thematically significant scene of the entire show. It is here that Rock finally stands up for himself, and Revy's full hatred for him is revealed: she hates him not only because he has just shown her that \"you can't solve everything with a gun,\" but also that it is possible for one to be steadfast and virtuous at the same time, even in the face of death. It is here that he points out that she has merely been hiding behind a complex of presumptuous self-victimization and pretentious nihilism and that a person's origins (either privileged or impoverished) cannot act as a surrogate for personal responsibility. It is also here that Rock informs Revy that she was the one who \"shook me awake,\" thereby illustrating that he is indeed conscious of her instrumentality in his own transformation. Thus if the show has a point, and I believe it does, it can all be summed up in this relatively brief, five-minute altercation. Also, notice that it is only after this scene that Revy even begins to treat Rock like a true comrade.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that Black Lagoon's semi-episodic narrative style actually serves this thematic touch rather well. When I first watched it about a year ago, I was disappointed that the given premise of the series (a naive businessman flees his corrupt superiors who attempt to hunt him down) was only carried through the first two episodes. On second viewing however, I realize the importance of having a variation of story arcs, which allows one to focus more on character study than on a linear story, and certainly in this respect marks out the series as a deservedly more mature, seinen title. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is where my praise must end.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, it is important to keep in mind that Black Lagoon is of course still essentially a gun-slinging action series, and in this respect is falters somewhat drastically. That is, for a series which markets itself as something \"mature\" and \"realistic,\" there is a very noticeable lack of either of these qualities in the bulk of the action-oriented scenes. Firstly, in nearly every hostile encounter, it appears as though Revy is of basically superhuman power and speed, as well as being somehow impervious to physical harm. In episode 1, she takes out an entire squad of trained mercenaries armed with automatic weapons using only two 9mm pistols; she jumps into their midst, kills all of them will relative ease, escaping without a scratch. In episode 3, when the Lagoon is being chased by Chinese mafia, she destroys five boats of men (again, armed with automatics rifles) singlehandedly, again, and does so without a scratch, again. Not only that, she accomplishes all this while leaping from boat to boat, apparently immune to all incoming gunfire. Again in episode 5, when the crew must retrieve a painting from a group of neo-Nazis, Revy is shown casually strolling from one room of their ship to another, killing everyone execution-style, and meeting little to no resistance, despite the fact that they were heavily armed. There are several other examples later on as well, particularly episode 12 where Revy and Shenhua play \"tag team\" in killing hordes of nameless enemies from the back of a jeep, being sure to make it look as \"cool\" as possible, regardless of the inherent absurdity. In fact, the only time Revy is even injured is during the fight between her and Roberta the maid-- someone equally as overpowered to superhuman degrees.\\n\\n\r\nIn perspective, all of this seems rather half-baked and juvenile. The \"maturity\" of this kind is simply the maturity of any run-of-the-mill \"M\"-rated shooting game: plenty of blood and gore, but little necessary attention to how even semi-realistic gunfights might actually take place, even between very skilled opponents. It is almost as if Black Lagoon is uncomfortably stuck somewhere between the lighthearted (and completely unrealistic) bullet-dodging of a Trigun and the brutality and blood-soaked sadism of a Higurashi. There is something very reminiscent of Kill Bill in the grotesqueness and ease with which the blood so freely flows, and despite its more mature side, there is a very strong and unexamined suggestion that violence for the sake of violence is inherently appreciable and makes for quality entertainment by itself. Normally this would be less of an issue, but in a supposedly \"realistic\" setting where there are no superpowers or cybernetic implants, in practice Black Lagoon seems to take great pride in throwing many such suppositions to the wind. Granted, while some of the show's \"stunts\" can be amusing in their inherent ludicrousness (e.g. destroying an assault helicopter with a torpedo), most of the time these willy-nilly takes on violence and death simply feel unpleasant and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as technical merits go, this being a Madhouse production there is little that needs to be said. The animation overall is rather excellent and well detailed, although perhaps there is an overly liberal use of CGI, particularly when it comes to animating cars and other distant moving objects. The character designs are Death Note-esque with an obvious tendency towards the cartoony and exaggerated, particularly during comedic moments. For an action series, there is a very effective contrast between the grit and smoke of urban warfare and the beautifully drawn tropical waters and open spaces of the less-inhabited parts of Southeast Asia (particularly the underwater scenes). The soundtrack complements this contrast well by providing a mix of hard rock/metal during most of the gunfight sequences and soft, acoustic guitars and droning ambient during the quiet and contemplative moments, which are surprisingly numerous. A big deal has been made about the English dub, and for the most part, this would be well-deserved. Being an Ocean Group production, the casting and performances are all of the highest quality, particularly when it comes to voicing all manner of distinct accents (Chinese, Scotts-Irish, Spanish). My only complaint about the dub is Maryke Hendrikse's rendition of Revy, which I felt had a kind of unnatural roughness and sounded rather forced and uneven, as opposed to the original Megumi Toyoguchi, who hit a much more convincing medium between gruff and feminine.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, while Black Lagoon certainly deserves to be praised for what it does well (as seen in its insightful story of personal development, realization, and transformation as well as its social criticism), it is difficult to consider it masterpiece-level work given its obvious penchant for over-the-top absurdity, particularly in its B-level portrayal of violence. It is well paced, looks great, and is sure to entertain all diehard Quentin Tarantino fans, but is not quite consistent enough in either its realism or maturity level to really be considered a work of genuine excellence.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an Anime that centers around a group of modern pirates who call themselves the 'Lagoon Delivery Company'. They operate in Southeast Asia, and they basically deliver anything at all as long as the price is right.\r\nStory wise, the episodes are a collection of completely unrelated short stories, showing the different jobs that the Lagoon Delivery Company takes on. The storylines are fairly unique, ranging from a run in with a bunch of wannabe Nazis to delivering papers for a Chinese Triad. Each short story is packed with action and superb gunfights, and the plot speeds along, leaving no time to be bored.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't an 'actual plot' to link the whole series together, but with all the fast-paced action, you don't really miss it. However, there are some recurring elements that ties the series together, such as the belief that there is no such thing as right or wrong, it just depends on how something is justified.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Black Lagoon is amazing, especially during the gunfights. The overall animation is extremely smooth and character movement is fluid, without annoying jerks in the animation. Also I love the angles that are chosen, as well as how they frame certain scenes, as it increases the impact that the animation gives.\\n\\n\r\nThe images are also well rendered and extremely detailed, especially the guns. Black Lagoon is rather more realistic than other Animes, and features very few exaggerated facial expressions and the like. Heavy attention is paid to details, especially in the rendering of the backgrounds. The animators also play around with dramatic lighting a lot, and this helps to create extremely outstanding scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the upbeat OP fits the show extremely well, while the ED is a quiet enigmatic piece. A unique feature of the ED is that unlike most other Animes, there is no clean break between the episode and the ED. The ED starts softly when the episode ends, and blends in very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the in-episode music for Black Lagoon is fast and upbeat, and it fits the situation extremely well, and at times, it helps to create a very tense and dramatic atmosphere, which is very fitting for Black Lagoon, considering the nature of this Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters may seem to be somewhat stereotypical at first, but as the series progresses, we discover the many different aspects of each character's personality. Black Lagoon places a lot more emphasis on character development than most gunfighting Animes, and the interactions between characters are interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are very diverse, each of them having a different set of beliefs and their own strengths and weaknesses. There are no perfect characters in Black Lagoon, every one of them has some kind of fault, and that makes them all the more human, allowing viewers to empathise with them more.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, many minor characters are also thrown into the mix, each of them unique in their own special way. While some stereotypes may be present in Black Lagoon, the characters are still sure to surprise you in some way or another.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI gave this series an overall 10, but I will be the first to admit that it may have been a little biased because I love action. But still, Black Lagoon is an amazing Anime, with high quality animation and a fitting soundtrack. If you are the type who cannot stand long, drawn out stories, then Black Lagoon is the Anime for you. With the fast-paced and epic butt-kicking action, Black Lagoon promises not to disappoint.",

            "content": "It's was really hard for me at first to actually give my honest opinion on Black Lagoon because the show itself is really good and I don't want to be biased. However I' have finally made up my mind to give my thoughts and review. Black Lagoon, in terms of a more \"realistic\" action adventure anime is highly acceptable. What I mean by that  is the events that took place during Black Lagoon are like real events that we see or hear about happen in our world everyday. Black Lagoon gives you a sort of up close and personal experience on what the charactersgo through everyday in our favorite messed up place called Roanapur. What I loved most about the series of course were the unforgettable characters, action and adventure that was given to us. I really loved how each of the characters had some sort of terrible backstory of bad history, and when the character moved or stayed in Roanapur the bad influence of other people rub of on them and mold them into something.... \"new.\" My best example of this is of course our main character Rock who we see goes from a typical Japanese businessman who after staying in Roanapur becomes... well no spoilers. The action of Black Lagoon is intense. It was like a \"sitting at the edge of your seat\" experience for me. That is how engaging it was to me! especially during scenes like one on one gun fights!! I strongly felt that the amount of action made up for what Black Lagoon lacked in story telling. That is because the story isn't really, or well I felt that  Black Lagoon doesn't really need like a complicated story or much of a background story at all.  Overall Black lagoon is a very enjoyable show that I would highly recommend for anyone who wants pure action with little story, yet provides easy to like and memorable characters, functioning story, decent soundtrack and art. 8/10 for me mates.",

I'm ok with a tough anime girl with a gun. I am not ok with a tough anime girl with a gun killing dozens of enemies at a time. Black Lagoon attempts to come of as a realistic anime about mercenaries, but many things in the anime detract from this attempt.\r\nBut before I rant, I'll talk a little about the 4 man crew. \r\nWe have Rock (protagonist): Japanese business man who is tired of being pushed around and sobecomes a mercenary. \\n\\n\r\nDutch: Strong black guy with a deep voice. (Pretty much everything you'd expect from a black guy in an anime so no need to go into detail)\\n\\n\r\nBenny: The blonde haired wiz with glasses (again no need to describe since he fits the sterotype)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Revy: You're typical tough girl with a bandanna who \"takes shit from no one\". She is very fond of vulgar language and likes to shoot people more than anything else it seems. However, her constant drivel became annoying and boring amazingly fast and I couldn't help but hate her.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's man problem is its storyline because there basically isn't one. It just shows the crew doing a job, shooting people, and then relaxing with a cigaratte. The character development is poor and Black Lagoon fails miserably in making you feel anything for them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to the realism aspect. Since I do not wish to spoil anything, though you can pretty much play this anime in its entirety out in your head without watching it, I'll give to examples of how unrealistic this anime is at times.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Revy cartwheeling and leaping ship to ship, massacring the entire crew of the ships methodically. If this scene appeals to you, then well, ... I really don't know what to say.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we have the most hilarious scene of all. Imagine the huge, muscular, and tough black man stereotype mentioned above. And now imagine that black man being overpowered by a woman in a maid's outfit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nyea.....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was actually a struggle to watch, but I gave it a 6 because the music and art are both incredible and I like the vulgarism and bloodiness at times.\\n",

It's like we're in a parallel universe where everyone is Clint Eastwood.\" - Rock\r\n[Viewer Discretion is advised, review contains profanity, just like the show it's written for.]\r\nIf the everyday, ubiquitous, slice of life anime is a Toyota Prius... environmentally conscious, economical, quiet, and serene, then Black Lagoon is like a 1970 El Camino with a 572, two 4 barrel carbs, straight headers and a supercharger with a bugcatcher on top so big you can't see anything but dotted lines turning solid.\r\nBut that's okay, because the only thing you're gonna see is the other suckers in your mirrors.It's big, it's loud, it's fast, it's rough, it's tough, and it's got a mean bite. Black Lagoon is this machine from hell of an anime that's just way, way too much, but you can't help but want to floor it every time you get in... because it's just too much fun. You gotta respect it though, because you don't take it for a ride, it takes YOU for a ride.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the essence of Black Lagoon. It's like 24 episodes of nonstop Mad Max Fury Road. Unrelenting, punishing, deadly action. Don't f*ck with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\n\"So I guess you'd probably have a hard time believing I watch Oprah instead: \"the result of the extreme makeover, right after the GUNSHOT!\" - Revy\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nEven though Black Lagoon is almost 10 years old now, it still holds up excellently. It's yet another awesome title from the Madhouse dominant era of the mid 2000s to sit with Death Note, Hellsing, Paprika, and others. The attention to detail, particularly with the guns and vehicles, is striking. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of just having generic pistols and rifles, they went the extra mile fleshing out the detailing that make individual and branded weapons unique. Real life brand names are mentioned, and the weaponry are identical replicas. Famous pistols like the Beretta 92F (Revy's signature), Tokarev TT-33s, Colt 1911s, Lugers, and the fan favorite gold plated Desert Eagle make appearances, along with tons of other revolvers, autos, and even cap and lock pistols. A dizzying array of rifles, launchers, and mounted weapons are used throughout the series, all direct copies of real life weapons. No made up stuff here. The weapons themselves are nearly characters, and I had a lot of fun picking out which ones were which. All told, there are 81 different weapons either seen or used throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are drawn excellently and consistently too. From Revy's signature tank top, jorts and dual Berettas, Rock's stuffy businessman look, cross dressing twins, gangster suits, Nuns With Guns\u2122, military fatigues, and Nazi uniforms to Roberta's crazy French Maid getup, there is a wildly varied cast of characters and looks. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\n\"Man, that's f*cking pathetic. Only some tit sucking mama's boy would come up with that bullsh*t conversation you're enjoying.\" - Revy\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"You whiny bitch, you're lucky I was around to save you from having your f*cking balls shot off by those guys from Hotel Moscow!\"\\n\r\nEda: \"Last time I checked, I didn't have a set, but maybe you do you nasty she-male!\"\\n\r\nRevy: \"ALL RIGHT YOU ASKED FOR IT BITCH!\"\\n\r\nEda:\"WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK WHICH ASSHOLE YOU WANT TO SH*T THROUGH!\" \\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"HEY YOU OLD BITCH! It's Rebecca! from Lagoon Company, open the f*cking door you old skank!\"\\n\\n\r\nRevy: \"You don't want to charge in with this piece of sh*t, especially not with a crackhead at the wheel\"\\n\r\nLeigharch: \"F*ck you! I'll have you know this is the world's greatest offroad vehicle you heartless bitch!\"\\n\r\nRevy: \"This piss tank is getting on my last nerve. Listen up you f*cking leprechaun, you're gonna wait here until you get our signal. If you run away, I'll hunt you down and castrate you!\"\\n\r\nShenhua: \"My, she say good thing, I agree very much!\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm with Shenhua. Everything that comes out of Revy's mouth is gold. This is a must watch in English. While the Japanese has some profanity, this one takes it BEYOND filthy, and with that comes so many laughs at the horrible things the characters threaten and say to each other. Panty and Stocking is really the only comparable dub, and the banter between Eda and Revy is like Panty and Stocking awesome, but better. Think Tarantino movie language- it flows really well, and sounds realistic. It's not overly pretentious or stuffy, it's just rough and raw. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nLet's hear it for cultural diversity! MADhouse in tha house!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if there's ever been an anime out there that's covered as many different enthic groups, religions, creeds, cults, groups, countries, races, and who even knows what other kind of label, it's Black Lagoon. All right, a show about pirates with cultural diversity, sounds freaking great right??\\n\\n\r\nWell get this:\\n\r\nYou've got the military, crooked cops, Yakuza, and the Triads, and the Russian Mafiya... yeah those are pretty run of the mill type stuff. Then you've got a little bit more out there stuff like Nuns With Guns\u2122, cowboy bounty hunters, a mute chainsaw wielding girl, and a Hank Hill inspired flamethrower wielding middle aged fat man. Then you get on up in to the upper echelon of crazy sh*t with crossdressing murder twin child soldiers, a Terminator French Maid, Neo Nazis (with full dress uniform), and one Shenhua, the sexy Taiwanese chinglish spewing, Enep knife wielding assassin. There's even a schoolgirl Yakuza boss, and Mr Chang, the Chinese Triad John Woo movie clone!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as main characters go, though, Revy is one of most outstanding and instantly recognizable characters out there, with her untied boots, jorts, tattoos, tank top, and signature double shoulder holsters. She's almost always smoking a cigarette, and trailing a stream of profanity and insults so rough it'd make Gordon Ramsay piss his pink panties.\\n\r\nSexy, tough and with a temper like Christian Bale and Mel Gibson combined times two, Revy exists to smoke, f*ck sh*t up, get paid, and drink straight liquor- in that order. She's corrupt and violent to the core, no whiny, needy clingy woman tropes here. Nothing gets her off more than getting lit and shooting shit up. \\n\\n\r\nShe's the quintessential badass, and she don't take shit from nobody. \\n\\n\r\nRock, on the other hand, is a guy stuck in the middle. When his dead end corporate grind job lands him in the middle of the South China Sea amongst a hive of scum and villainy, his outlook on life really changes- from bad to worse. As a guy who has been on both sides of the fence, he has a pretty unique perspective to the seedy gangster's paradise of Roanapur. His skills as a businessman do end up coming in handy when the all guns blazing route fails, but more often than not, he finds himself a spectator to the violent brutality of the city and its denizens.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn this criminal underworld, anything goes. Cops on the make, thugs on the take, and shootouts over dinner are the norm. Get f*cked up every night, drive it like you stole it, and crash only to repeat it the next day. If you're lucky, you might get some kind of job from the mafia. If not, you just had your last shot of rum- forever.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's story takes us on arc based tales straight out of an action movie. Every 2 or 3 episodes, the real life pirate crew of Dutch, Revy, Benny, and Rock take on some new job from the Russian mob and whatever crazy adventure it entails. They aren't some 16th century sailboat crew with tricorns and peglegs though- they're straight off the mean streets of Compton, I mean Roanapur. Armed with a stolen military torpedo boat and a million dollars' worth of military grade weaponry, a cunning captain and Revy's famous temper, they take on a variety of different missions. The episodes featuring Roberta, a Colombian terrorist turned maid, the twisted, murderous twin children Hansel and Gretel, and the Greenback Jane saga are highlights of the series in the insane, over the top, brutal, and hilarious elements respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the realism in this show. So often, action shows have to do with the supernatural or occult, and it was incredibly refreshing to see something that was grounded in realism, used real life guns, vehicles, and kept the story within the realm of gritty action movie. The hilarious dialogue was delivered perfectly, and the voice actors sounded great. While it was very over the top at times, this show watches like a John Woo movie mixed with Tarantino. It's just a heck of a lot of fun. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a real shame Mar\u00ffke Hendrikse didn't do many other voice roles. Revy will live the f*ck on forever though, because like she gives a sh*t. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Awesome characters that kick a lot of ass\\n\r\n+ Dialogue that will make you sh*t your pants, then kick you in the face for laughing\\n\r\n+ Excellent arc based story\\n\r\n+ Great animation and attention to detail\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nOf course. If you don't watch this, Revy is going to come shove her boot up your ass and make you lick your own crap off of it before busting a cap in your sniveling dome! \\n\r\nSeriously, if you like rough and tough with dark comedy- this is not to be missed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Roanapur is the kind of place where violent jokes come true.\" - Benny",

            "content": "Anime seems to be very tame these days. If it isn't about whiny high school kids living their boring ass lives, it's about overachieving, insane kids with magical notebooks (cough Deathnote). I like these kinds of animes as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel like doing nothing more than bathe in my own testosterone and achieve a massive erection looking at either tits, guns, or cars. Enter, Black Lagoon. An anime with tits, guns, AND cars. Expect testosterone, and lot's of it.\r\nStory-\r\nThe story is as generic as it can get. Some pussy ass bitch decides to change his life and he startsto do dangerous and badass things. Rock, the main character, is a brown nosing Japanese business man who is sent on a business trip to South Asia or somewhere around there. He is then kidnapped by a group of pirates/mercenaries called the Lagoon Company. Rock then has an epiphany or something and decides to live the hazardous life of a mercenary. This story has definitely been used multiple times in countless action movies. However, I never saw recycled action movie plots as a bad thing. It seems to attract the majority of males, so why not? The story itself is very cliche and overused, but since I am a healthy man, I loved it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nAt first glance the cast may seem to have generic written all over it, but it is special in it's own sense. The Lagoon Company consists of a pussy, a white computer guy, a buff black guy, and an insane triggerhappy monster of a woman. There's not much character development besides Rock, but you will find at least one character you will like. There is a rather large variety of characters and each one has a dark past of some sort. One of the aspects I liked about the characters was that almost everyone was interesting. In fact, my favorite character was Balalaika, who is a supporting character. All of the characters are very realistic and each one has his/her own unique personality and mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nI could tell that Black Lagoon had a rather high animation budget. All the explosions and battles were animated smoothly. I felt like I was watching Die Hard or something. The art is nothing new or innovative, but all the characters and backgrounds are drawn superbly. The colors are quite vivid and contribute to the overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound- \\n\r\nI feel like mentioning the opening is a must. The opening is a J-Rock song and it fits perfectly with the series. From the moment I heard it I knew this was going to be an intense anime with lots of violence. Not to my surprise, I was right. The BGM is also very good and contributes to the mood of the current scene. The ending was the only dissapointment in the soundtrack department. I expected another hardcore rock song, but all I got was a depressing, quiet melody.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a series any MAN can enjoy. Some women might like it too but men will enjoy it more. I feel like this anime was made by a group of muscular men drinking beer and lifting weights. Almost every part of this anime is action packed and there are so many gunfights and shit that I turned into a brainless neandrathal for a whole week. Watch this anime with lots of action and violence in mind and you will no doubt enjoy it. This series is a must watch for any action fan. Thanks for reading yo.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon- 9/10",

            "content": "wow.. this anime is shit!\r\nBecause of its non existing storyline and its uninteresting and stupid character the only thing this anime got left, being worthy to watch, would be its action scenes... and they sucked. They were complete unrealistic and stupid. (I am not agains unrealism in anime at all, but this action scenes were like a fist of \"unrealism\" punshing into my face. I will come to the action scenes later on)\r\nWell lets start off with the character (cuz i cant tell you much about the story):\r\nYou got rather 2 dominant main protagonists: Revy and Rock. I call them the dominant one because theblack guy Dutch and the computer freak Benny werent much included in the show at all (a bit in the beginning but they disapeared more and more later on). \\n\\n\r\nSo Revy: Many people refer to her as an example for badass female protagonists, because she curses a lot and is good at shooting people... Well besides the fact that she looks like an 14 year old highschoolgirl (you saw that at many moments) dressed up like a hooker( and even sits down like a hooker (fanservice) most of the time) I am really interested why she has to curse all the time. Its like noone would believe she is an badass without her insulting her oponent (and all her allies) all the time. I mean, when you look at Balalaika: her cursing is nearly nothing compared to Revys and she is still 100 times more badass than her. \\n\r\nSo we got a cute looking woman who curses all the time so you believe she is badass and who kills bad people in unrealistic gunbattles (kinda like an american version of a tsundere charactere... and everyone knows tsundere==shit)\\n\\n\r\nRock: Well Rock is the pussy of the anime (a bit cliche), who shows you the real power of gunfighting.. just kidding. WTF is the meaning behind a character who never uses a gun and who whines all the time about his situation (well at least he stopped that later on), being in a pure action gunfighting-anime???? Are u kidding me????? And the fact that in the second epiosde (or so )Balalaika seriously said to him what a tough guy he is made him even a bigger pussy than shinji was in the NGE anime. \\n\\n\r\nI have to mention that Black Lagoon at least was able to introduce some interesting characters, like Balalaika...and i guess thats the only one.\\n\\n\r\nTo the action scenes:This anime is one of these were you know from the start who is going to win the fight( that is kinda stupid in the first place) and besides that fact, you only watch how much unrealistic stuff was put into these fights. I want to give you some examples for my statment: \\n\r\nWell there was this scene were their ship was chased by 4 others or so (episode3) where Revy jumped about 5 meters with an rocked lancher on her back then survives the rocked explosion right next to her with no scratch and could dodge (or whatever) the bullets from 2 guys fireing at her, who were both right infront of her... ofc.  But the inability to aim or to pull the trigger bothers me a lot of this anime (do the enemey have some kind of fingere arthritic or something?) The enemies rather tell you their life story than shooting at you so that you could create the best plan for killing them (or whatever). Thats just retarded and the amount of facepalms in this anime was very high. (If you need some more examples for how stupid the action scenes are just message me)\\n\r\nI also have to mention that they actually did 1 good episode (EP15) where they finally didnt tell their life story to each other before the were going to fight. \\n\\n\r\nThere is much more that bothers me about this series and i cant tell you about all of them (mostly because i would have to rewatch the anime).\\n\r\nIf you think I spoilered too much of the series then i have to tell you: If you havent watched this series yet i hope my review prevent you from doing so. You can thank me for this. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall it gets a well deserved 1/10 (could have been worse)",

            "content": "\u201cThis is more entertaining than Hollywood is ever going to be!\u201d - Revy\r\nBlack Lagoon is one of Madhouse\u2019s greatest works. In terms of action and seinen, we no longer have to frustratingly listen to long speeches before gunshots fire. Black Lagoon is well-known for its nonstop action and features one of the most memorable and merciless women in the anime industry: Revy (famously known as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d), who is noted for her \u201ckill first, ask questions later\u201d style. Its depiction of Hollywood action films with the explosions, car chases, and gun-fighting at sea makes this entertaining to watch, especially with its mature dialogue and darkhumor.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon\u2019s cast makes up the entire story alone. The story follows the Lagoon Company as they take on paid missions and kill anyone who interferes. The dark humor and foul language are hilarious and bring out maturity. This brings along a fine set of characters, including mafias, Nazis, and war veterans for the fast and the furious. The four members of the Black Lagoon cast are unique amongst themselves: Revy; Dutch, the serious yet chill guy; Benny, the tech geek; and Rock, the Japanese guy who is trying to get used to the pirate lifestyle. Black Lagoon is mostly popular for their memorable and merciless female characters, including a Russian boss and killer maid, who shows no hesitation in fulfilling threats. The tragic and violent pasts of the female characters give them an ideal role for Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of character development, I wouldn\u2019t consider Black Lagoon to be episodic. New to the game, Rock started out unreasonably annoying, suddenly contributed clever schemes, and later went back to being a wimp again. He unchangeably grew some balls midway in the series, but his behavior seemed illogical how his personality kept going from scared to fearless back and forth in the beginning. Because of her rough background, Revy\u2019s cold-heartedness made her appear childish and selfish as she uses torture and violence as her therapy. Her attitude lessens a bit as she balanced the ability to know right from wrong. Revy and Rock's relationship undergoes the most development, since they both come from completely opposite background. \\n\\n\r\nOne downside is the failure to follow up on deceased supporting characters' past. Black Lagoon also ends incompletely with a lack of explanation about some of the characters\u2019 pasts and last minute questions presented in the last few episodes. As someone who watched all three seasons, I can confirm that the plotholes receive explanations within the two sequels. However, it would be better if it ended with some kind of conclusion. Since it continues with Episode 13 in the 2nd season, I found it useless to have Black Lagoon and Second Barrage separated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were very distinct. Revy is popular for her daisies, but it\u2019s honestly a turnoff. It\u2019s possible to fight and jump long distances with short daisies. The background design and settings were realistic with the lights and character interactions, especially in a bar. The blood splattering was not exaggerated or excessive, so it is easily tolerable for one who is not a fan of gore. There were a few stills, but the visual effects were really good, especially the fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is one of the few anime meant to be watched in English, because it sounds more natural than the Japanese. The seiyuu do not nearly fit the character\u2019s personalities as the English VA. Mar\u00ffke Hendrikse portrayed Revy\u2019s tomboy personality perfectly. I\u2019m glad Funimation chose Dean Redman to voice Dutch for his deep yet laidback voice. It was hard to hear Brad Swaile (voice of Light from Light Note) play a less villainous character, but he did a great job switching to Rock\u2019s attitude changes throughout the series. Also, the seiyuu sound horrible when a certain scene to be in English. Their English sounds broken and slow, interrupting and slowing the action of that scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is wonderful, and both the OP and ED centers on Revy. The English OP \u201cRed Fraction\u201d by Mell sung has lyrics that fits the hardcore action. The scores, usually instrumental rock music, suits the fighting scenes, too. The ED \u201cDon\u2019t Look Behind\u201d by Edison is fully instrumental. Although it's seen as a disadvantage with its slow tone after a hardcore episode, it actually has a smooth transition by not immediately jumping to the song. A calm setting moves away from the action and presents right before the ED.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a dream come true for one who craves a sense of maturity in an action anime. The pacing is good and doesn\u2019t waste time with lengthy dialogue like other seinen. The dark humor and action mixes well together, and the characters are unique and memorable. I highly recommend checking out Black Lagoon if you\u2019re into Hollywood films or just looking for a change of pace in terms of action. It was a wonderful experience for me, because every episode had nonstop action to look forward to.",

Not knowing what to make of the title or the poster, I was very surprised at what this anime turned out to be. Often criticized for copying \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019, I was a little concerned at first but this anime distinguishes itself with its world building and characters. Set to a dark yet realistic, cruel, cold, violentand brutal crime infested town that perfectly captures the last place you want to be in this R-rated world. This anime superbly holds nothing back and you get a load of hot girls wielding big guns and firing at everything and everyone! In fact, this anime is all about tits, ass, guns, explosions, cursing and badass chicks! You start with Okajima, leading a boring life who then gets kidnapped by the Lagoon company on a business trip. Upon realizing he\u2019s been abandoned by his own company, he decides to join this group of renegades and gets the nickname \u2018Rock\u2019. Even though the anime lacks in story and the plot is pretty much the group doing different missions, it never bothers anyone since what you get is very entertaining to watch! This has some of the best Action scenes, so good that you can\u2019t take your eyes off them! I mean why would I care about Story when I can get Revy killing a bunch of Nazi\u2019s on a ship! The anime also doesn\u2019t shy away from clich\u00e9s like generic character traits or plot armour for the main characters during battle but it doesn\u2019t matter! \u2018Black Lagoon\u2019 totally owns it by delivering non-stop Awesome Action and helps you forget the unrealism of it all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also one of those rare shows where the Female characters not only KICK ASS but completely steal the show! You get a little bit of everything from the characters, with the weak MC who later grow balls to a Computer Geek, Samurai, Mafia, Cartels, Russians, Nazis, Crazy maids and nuns! I had a lot of fun with most of the characters but the Stand out is Revy by a large margin. This foul mouthed, gun blazing, sexy yet deadly Chinese version of Lara Croft is the most interesting character on the show. She\u2019s the kind of woman who will kill anyone that gets in her way and then later drink at a bar as if nothing happened! Her use of the word \u2018F***\u2019 was always fun to hear and her \u2018No Shit Given\u2019 attitude propels her to the top of many people\u2019s list of Badass female characters. Revy also comes across very sexy regardless of displaying no forms of seductiveness, I mean she rarely shows any sort of attraction to anyone! But those poses she takes while shooting just makes her unbelievably attractive and I for one couldn\u2019t get her out of my head for a while! She\u2019s also involved in a lively relationship with Rock that\u2019s never clearly defined yet both display great chemistry with one another. In fact, Rock becomes more interesting after his interactions with Revy cause otherwise he\u2019s the one who holds back, being the one with morals and integrity. He\u2019s heavily overshadowed by Revy but I enjoyed him a lot too cause he showed tons of resilience for an amateur and even stared down the badass Revy by speaking his mind. Even under the threat of a gun, he was able to hold his ground. We even later see him starting to fit in with the rest of the group which was also to my liking. There are so many great supporting characters here so it\u2019s hard to pick a favourite! You get the nuns from the church, Eda stands out due to her relationship with Revy. Then you have the freaking female terminator maid Roberta who\u2019s insanely good with killing and tracking! Balalaika was another stand out female character, with her connections to the Russian military and the cold and smart demeanour with which she ran the place. She and her crew are responsible for some cool action scenes and I thoroughly enjoyed her arc in S2. Let\u2019s not forget about Chang who\u2019s a male badass in the show but unfortunately, we get very little of him. One nit-pick from my side is that the ladies go through their own tragic backstories, further developing their characters while guys were put to the side. The OVA even shed a glimpse into the past of Revy and you can then understand why she is the way she is but we get nothing for Dutch or Benny.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is as badass as the anime itself, perfectly setting the mood for some hardcore action. For such a standard track, it doesn't warrant you singing along or anything but it definitely gets its job done by pumping up the action scenes. The good use of sound effects for the car chases and explosions further improved the overall effect of those set pieces. And then the dubbing, which is some top-notch stuff. I loved, loved and loved Hendrikse\u2019s portrayal of Revy!!! She so perfectly embodied Revy\u2019s voice with her masterful give and take choice of words and tone that puts the subs to shame! Plus, the characters of the show themselves aren\u2019t Asian so the dubs gave an International feeling to the show which was required. Aside from great characters, we were also nursed with great dialogues, uncensored with profanity and energy! Finally, the animation here is excellent in both the character design and art work. The characters all have a uniqueness to them which\u2019s strongly displayed throughout the show. I never felt like I was watching a generic villain of the week with a different hairstyle or clothing, they really felt different from one another. The highly-distinguished artwork on Revy mannerisms, movements and expressions is further proof of the amount of quality work that went into this anime. And let\u2019s not forget about those action scenes! We have tons of them, ranging from fights on boats to ships to underwater submarine, car chases, bomb blasts and tons of gun battles! Despite so much variety of action, you are never bored with any of them for they are well choregraphed no matter how long they get! \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s any anime that can easily be turned into a live action movie, it\u2019s this one! And Quentin Tarantino should direct it if the casting is well done. S1 focuses on the entire team doing many jobs, basically an intro to all characters while S2 dives deep into the politics and power play of the city and its players. Not a bad direction to venture off to but it came at the expense of the Lagoon team for we only get Rock and Revy. Also in S2 I didn\u2019t like the changes with Revy at first. She\u2019s a total badass in S1 but then she changes in S2, showing a cuter side of herself. She lost that edge of gun blazing insanity streak to her and started smiling more, she even started wearing a skirt and i felt like it was just fan service! I was also afraid they were going to just stick her into a girlfriend role with Rock in S2 but thankfully they further played upon the platonic relationship between those two. You could clearly see a more humane side to Revy, realizing theirs\u2019s a sensitive side deep inside her despite all her ruthlessness. It\u2019s also totally believable since Rock is slowly wearing her defences down and Revy is finding herself more relaxed and comfortable around Rock. \\n\r\nIn conclusion, the anime has an unsatisfying ending! The story conveniently wraps up but we get NO Resolution from the characters which really pissed me off! I still enjoyed this violent and gritty take on crime mafia and the badass characters that run this city though I would have wished for a more complete ending. It\u2019s still worth your time so check it out!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS**\r\nUsually, anime whose only two genre classifications are \"action\" and \"seinen\" are pretty open-and-shut. The vast majority of them are mindless action scenes with cardboard cut-out characters at best and unwatchable nonsense at worst. Black Lagoon, however, is different. Don't get me wrong, it's undoubtedly an action-first show with little  plot substance, but Black Lagoon stands out among the rest thanks to its awesome characters and stellar animation that make the show an absolute blast to watch. This anime knows how balance itself between hardcore action and lighthearted comedy just as well as other action animes like Fullmetal Alchemistand Darker than Black, and those shows are VERY good at finding that balance. Black Lagoon is one of those pure-fun, turn-your-brain off anime that everyone needs to watch every once in a while, and a very good one at that.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\r\nAll you need to know about the plot is that it follows a small underground transport company stationed in the dangerous city of Roanapur, Thailand named Black Lagoon and the various hijinks they get into in their line of work.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there really isn't much substance to the plot, seeing as the plot isn't the reason you should watch this kind of anime. There is not a single cohesive storyline, but rather a series of separate and largely unrelated story arcs that last about 4 episodes each. Some of the arcs are relatively interesting, some of them average, and the vast majority of them are generic. The plot to Black Lagoon serves as more of a set-up to the driving forces of the show instead being a driving force itself. There isn't much else to say about it; it's just classic over-the-top action with the exception of one or two unique and original arcs.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAnyone who likes to pay attention to detail will love Black Lagoon's animation. The backgrounds and settings are animated with outstanding detail that creates an awesome atmosphere. It also has some of my favorite character designs in anime. Black Lagoon's animation is fluent, detailed, visually appealing, and simply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's OST is about what you would expect from an action-seinen; standard metal and rock music for the actions scenes; nothing special. The reason it gets such a high score is for two reasons; one is the awesome opening, and the other is the stellar voice acting. It doesn't matter if you watch the dub or the sub; the voice actors absolutely KILLED their roles. As someone who prefers dubs to subs when they are done well, Funimation really has outdone themselves as Black Lagoon is one of the best English dubs in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said before; the characters of Black Lagoon ARE Black Lagoon. They are what make this anime worth watching. The characters all have distinctive and/or likeable personalities, and unlike the vast majority of action-seinens, the characters actually receive a fair amount of development that make them more likeable and realteable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the most well-known character in the show: Revy. Revy, in my opinion, is the best character in the entire action-seinen genre. She is a delight to watch every second she is on screen, whether it be her hilarious humor, her over-the-top action scenes, or occasionally, her tragic backstory. I never got tired of her, and her character design is among the best (and sexiest) I've seen to date. If you've seen Black Lagoon, you love Revy. Period. End of story.\\n\\n\r\nRock, who comes across as a generic protagonist at first, turns out to be not generic at all. He doesn't do much fighting, but he is a very likeable character with a relatable personality and he receives quite a bit of character development. I could watch the scene where he gets into fight with Revy in episode 7 all day; Rock doesn't get mad often, but when he does, he is an absolute badass. The chemistry between him and Revy is one of the driving forces of the show. I like Rock quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThere are way too many notable side characters to go over; from the other two members of Lagoon (Dutch and Benny) to some of the more episodic characters (my favorite being \"Chinglish\", who is laugh-out-loud HILLARIOUS if you are watching the dub), the side characters in Black Lagoon can be funny, badass, unique, or any combination of the three. The vast majority of them are brilliantly written.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a good action-seinen, put Black Lagoon at the top of your list. The plot is relatively standard, but the combination of the amazing characters, stellar animation, and fantastic voice acting create an awesome experience that is definitely worth watching. If you are a fan of the genre, you have no excuse for not watching Black Lagoon. If you are not a fan of the genre, it's still worth a watch in my opinion; everyone can use a mindless action show every now and then.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon as a whole was pure entertainment and is one show that most viewers could  keep on going back to for more. This is one show that after concluding its first and second season i could only think when will there be more. \r\nSTORY:8/10\r\nBlack  Lagoon lacked any long term story arc and was basically a very long but strong intro to the series. By the end of the first season you get to know the entire lagoon squad, and all the other characters within the supporting cast along with some short but strong story arcs as the lagoon crew went threw theirjobs. Even though it was there was not really an overlying plot to the shows first season i don't really think that they needed one based on the content we were given within a 12 episode season.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:9/10\\n\r\nThe Characters in Black Lagoon were easily the shows strong point. There are not many characters within this show that i found dull or boring in any way. The characters of Black Lagoon were so great because we got some back story for almost every character. This helps us understand how they developed to where they are when the story begins. Whats really special about the characters within the show isn't the characters themselves but how they act together. The interaction really drives the entertainment and conflict within the show. The only problem was there was not much development. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION:8/10\\n\r\nThe art within was quite good but the animation was where this section shined. This show is pretty much built around gun fights, conflict, and violence. Which means this show required a lot of animation and the show puts out, i could not find one dull moment were its quality even sank to average.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:9/10\\n\r\nThe variety of sound effects presented in Black Lagoon were amazing. Anything from gun shots to explosions were high quality. I can also speak for the English dub which i found great. It was not great just because of the voice actors performance but also because they did not provide any censorship which allowed a lot of swearing and i mean a lot. Giving the characters this extra freedom provides a stronger form of expression that helps define the characters even further.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:9/10\\n\r\nThis was a strong character driven show that had good back story, and great dubs. With only the lack of a strong story arc holding it back.",

            "content": "I really can't come up with the words to convince you to watch this anime, but if I wanted to describe my first reaction to it with two words, I think I would choose: \"Holy %@$%\". I think you get the picture. Absolutely amazing! From the first episode I was hooked, and it only gets more incredible as you continue. \r\nThis series sets itself apart from every action based anime I've ever seen, with incredibly detailed animation to support every fight scene. They are not afraid to use crude language or display gory violence, and it's one of the most refreshing things about this series- a great change of pace. The anime itself doesn't really have a plot, but rather each episode is a short story in itself, that feels like its moving in the right direction. Basically, if your a fan of Cowboy Bebop, then this series will make you think less of it :P It is generally played out in the same manner, but I found Lagoon to be a lot more intense. The fight scenes do not fail to impress. Whats even more impressive, is their use of humor in a lot of moments you wouldn't expect any.  \\n\\n\r\nEach of the main characters are given good character development, but most of the focus lies on Revy and Rock. If you like the bad boy types, like Spike Spiegel, then you haven't met his evil twin sister, Revy. She makes other villains look like fairy's frollicking in the grassy meadows. Her personality is dominitive, crude, brash, violent, and just downright scary, but she does show a softer side - roughly 15 seconds per episode! She can go from the cute girl you want to get to know, to the nightmare you wish did not exist in the blink of an eye. Revy  makes this series what it is and then some. \\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't a big fan of gunfights, I think this series would change your attitude towards them. Each scene is brilliantly animated, with a large attention to detail. Despite its lack of a real plot, they do an excellent job with each episode in terms of their story. Although it is heavy on the action scenes, they do an excellent job of giving you plenty of interesting conversations, and oh so much humor in a one of a kind form. Hope you enjoy japanese curse words, because you will surely pick them up after this series! \\n\\n\r\nI found the music in this series to be a great fit for each scene, keeping the momentum high  - especially the opening and ending themes, which compliment the feel of the series well. The cuing of the soft music at the end of each episode, rolling into the credits, seemed like something simple, but it really brought out an interesting feel that I haven't seen used anywhere else. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I was simply blown away. If you want something to wake you out of the normal tear jerking, emotion filled anime, this one will propel you onto the battlefield in style. As mentioned, if you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop, I can guarantee your attachment to this series. I think the only thing I didn't enjoy about this series was the number next to the word &quot;Episodes&quot;. Good old number twelve, inferior to thirteen, superior to eleven, just wasn't enough in my book. Even with a series devoted to no real plot, you can't help but demand more out of it - the episodes are too damn interesting. \\n",

            "content": "To start off, I will warn you that this is by far my favourite anime of all time. Thus, a little bit of bias is to be expected. However, I'm going to try my hand at writing this as objectively as possible. Here goes!\r\nStory: Black Lagoon is an action packed, character driven anime following a group of multi-national pirates (in this context, mercenaries who take jobs from criminals based around the use of their boat and combat prowess). Taking place in the South East Asian Sea, the key setting is Roanapur, a fictional city which is best described as a 'hive of scum and villainry'.Against this backdrop, the anime explores many facets of modern crime - ranging from Neo Nazism to people trafficking.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the occasional absurdity, the anime attempts a very realistic representation of criminal activity. In fact, the context is usually brutally (term not used lightly) real up until the point one of the more 'personable' characters is introduced (for example, maids/nuns with guns).\\n\\n\r\nPast the often-crazy action sequences, the story is remarkabley deep. Existentialism is a constant theme, and the anime has a lot to say about morals or ethics, always giving each side of a story and questioning the viewer's idea of what right or wrong is. This is expertly handled by the inclusion of Rock, who is given an outsider's view into the world of crime. Importantly, crime is rarely glorified in this anime; the characters are no Robin Hoods (and don't they know it), and their is a large focus on their pscyhological issues and physical weaknesses (drugs, greed).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can understand why some people may find fault in Black Lagoon's story; action sequences are sometimes given a higher priority, meaning story arcs may become underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation in Black Lagoon is generally flawless. Overall, everything is fluid and smooth, which is especially important for the action sequences, which are a joy to watch. Compounding this is a heavy attention to detail. Weapons mechanically discharge their cartrigdes with small plumes of smoke in split seconds, buildings explode sending pieces of identifiable shrapnel spinning out, and gunmen distort their faces in the intensity of battle - these details and so many others join together to create some seminal scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very realistic, with little distortion of the characters. Character design also manages to create distinctive people without going overboard - you can tell Benny apart from every other guy in Roanapur, but he wears a fairly average shirt and slacks, with ponytail. Even the show's most distinctive character, Revy, manages to fit in realistically.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally, the animation will drop slightly - some details will be ommited to keep the action fluid, but compared to other anime, this is hardly an issue.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No issues in terms of sound effects - guns bang, boats vroom and stuff blows up convincingly. Music during the anime is fine as well, meditative when dealing with the heavy themes, and pumping when the action gears up.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening credits are accompanied by an upbeat tune that suits the tone of the anime perfectly - pulse pounding, with a subtle, underlying layer of something like lonliness or depression. However, the ending credits fail to deliver appropriatley, with a quiet reflective piece. This works in a couple of episodes; one example that comes to mind is after Revy lights her cigarette off Rock's, and the subdued tone works wonderfully. In general, a better suit may have been something more upbeat. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is Black Lagoon is especially important, considering the wealth of nationalities and the inevitable accents that come with them. The Japanese version generally delivers in this department, with Balalaika sounding convincingly Russian and Dutch sounding like the American he is. Each character also gets the voice they deserve; credit goes to Revy's voice actress who is honestly perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the English version, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. While Dutch and Benny were voiced well, Revy's voice actress hardly captured her tense, often psychotic articulation. Worse was Rock, who hardly sounded Asian at all. Even Balalaika sounded less Russian, which is very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The cast of Black Lagoon is one of its biggest draws. Not only are they interesting, flawed character studies, but they are hugely entertaining, with distinctive personalities. More than most anime, viewers are drawn to the supporting characters (Balalaika, Shenhua, Mr Chang), in a way not dissimilar to a movie following many characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll characters manage to be distinctive without being unoriginal. Revy takes the 'badass' girl one step further with some truly questionable (violent) tendencies, and Dutch exudes a sense of power and control, without being omnipotent (his profanities and occasional loss of temper are testaments to this). \\n\\n\r\nSome viewers may be unimpressed by Rock (who shares the main character slot with Revy), but often it is for want of further investigation. While an outsider in the crazy world of crime, Rock develops a real strength of character that reflects a determined attitude, and our own desire for a life out of the oridinary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Black Lagoon will not appeal to the average anime viewer - this is fact. Its Western influenced storytelling is far removed from your typical anime. It lacks story arcs that last for more than a couple of episodes. Even the most popular characters do reprehensible things that can leave the viewer feeling a little sick. So, in terms of universal appeal, Black Lagoon loses a point.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Black Lagoon satisfies those looking for an action fix, or those looking for numerous action fixes tied together with well thought out plot lines, or those looking for a gritty character driven piece. If you like style, violence, and don't mind the sometimes heavy themes, Black Lagoon's 'slice of (criminal) life' will be just the thing for you.",

            "content": "If there's one way to describe Black Lagoon it would that it's a exhilarating ride with surprisingly smart moments. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is surprisingly well-developed with a nice sense of pacing that manages to have both slow-down philosophical chats mixed with visceral action. The dialogue is fantastic with a real sense of sardonic wit that would seem like something created by Tarantino. In a weird way, Black Lagoon can function as a social commentary given how major characters like Rock, Balalaika, and Roberta have backstories that aren't too dissimilar from those of non-Western citizens from the 90s. Japan was languishing from a financial depression, the SovietUnion has collapsed, Vietnam War vets were disavowed, and Cold War militants are struggling to find purpose. If anything, the cynical tone of the series really reflects on the social anxieties and uncertainties in the tumultuous post-cold war scenario.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation is fantastic and channels a strong sense of atmosphere. The whole city has a really eerie and gritty feel to it whether it be day or night. Not only that, the weapons, character models, and vehicles appear very accurate to the time period.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis series just sounds exhilarating from the music to the sound effects to the voice acting. The heavy metal rock pumps one up for the action while the more somber tunes make one ponder about the morality and future of being a gangster. All the gunfire and explosions sound so realistic and heavy-hitting. As for subbing vs dubbing, the English dub is probably better for this show if anything because it feels natural. In the English dub, Revy actually comes off as more aggressive and emotive. Likewise Dutch sounds more like an African American while also more distinctly expresses anger and friendliness even when speaking in the same monotone. Plus the English dubbing has more profanity which really enhances the whole black comedy aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are rather well-developed and likable even though nearly everyone is more or less a gangster. Rock works very well as voice of reason and as an audience surrogate. While he does start out as a terrified coward, he does man up and bests his opponents with his wits even though he isn't a fighter. Revy's also a surprisingly admirable female character given how her tragic past is well articulated and isn't just slapped on as a weak excuse for her sociopathy. Even though Black Lagoon can be considered a \"guy show\", it does a good job of portraying female characters by giving them fleshed-out backstories and agency.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's a blast with characters, story, and action straight out of a Tarantino/John Woo flick. It's really worth your time.",

The perfect balance between anime lookand realism. The background look so real! the characters are very well made.Heck Revy herself is a babe! XD The real masterpiece of the series is the way the transportations and WEAPONS (especially the weapons/guns!) were drawn. If you look at the guns of the characters closely, they are detailed right to the smallest part. And they looks like they're real life counterpart. How you see the real thing is how the gun was drawn. Animation is superb as well and very real. When the characters fire a gun, you'll see the bullets bounce on the ground. And they reload after a number of shots....and probably the best thing I like about this anime is the characters facial expressions. Take Revy for example, when she's curious you could really see how curious she is same is when she's angry and serious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSame with the art. The sound is top notch as well. The voice acting is awesome...the characters voice fit them very well. Oh i'm talking about the Japanese dub, I haven't heard the english dub yet.  The Opening song is good. I was actually shocked, I didn't expect the Opening song to be an English song. You really can't tell coz of the singers accent...hehe...the Ending song is slow and mellow but it's good. It gives a calming feeling after all the gunfire, action and excitement...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nDespite the story not being that great, the characters here more than make up for it. The thing that makes thins series great is the character development. You can see as you continue with the series, how the characters change. How each one became stronger with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAn awesome anime for those who love girls, guns, and lots of action. \\n\r\nIt's a great show, the only downside about this is that it's very short, only twelve episodes but there's a second season!

            "content": "There are times when I am hard pressed to find an anime to watch I know I will like. Most likely this is due to indecisiveness, which admittedly is my problem more often than I would like. However, I also believe my struggles can be attributed to a major point: I know myself well enough to know that no matter how highly praised, artfully executed, or original a series is, if I'm not feeling it when I start watching, then It's probably not going to work out, which brings me to Black Lagoon. \r\nFrankly, there is nothing that I could write in this review thathas not been said by the other reviewers thus far, and at the end of the day my comments would be more or less the same. So, instead I would like to give you a few reasons why Black Lagoon IS WORTH YOUR TIME.\\n\\n\r\nStory - Black Lagoon is a refreshing series. The story portrays a world of modern day pirating, crime, and underworld activity that the majority of people have never seen or know anything about outside their favorite forms of media, yet it all seems eerily familiar. There are also not any points where the story gets ahead of itself, or wrapped up in the \"epic\", which is very satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - excellent for many reasons, but what I found so great about them is that they are realistic. Unlike many animes, Black Lagoon's characters are representative of people that actually exist in our world in all their different forms. The best example of this is Revy, who has a mouth a sailor would find offensive, enough attitude to go around, and a bite that is worse than the bark. She is completely lovable, despicable, and absurd all at the same time. It makes you wonder - what other kind of girl would be a pirate/mercenary in the crime ridden South China seas? \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, character development is done at a reasonable pace, and not every character changes in some way or another - some people stay just the way they are, and who said that was a bad thing? The viewer is not burdened with the often time consuming task of learning every single detail of a character's personality, inner thoughts and struggles, their entire life stories, etc...This does not mean that there is not depth or complexity in each character, in fact, the case is exactly the opposite. It was nice to be able to simply watch the characters interact with each other and their environments.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Really great all the way around. The South China seas is a setting not often explored, and the tropical climate allowed for a color palate that is vibrant, warm, and rich. Animation is fluid, realistic, and really pops. The action scenes are particularly visceral and engaging\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I loved watching Black Lagoon. From the very first minute I was grabbed by the quality animation, unique characters, and impressive action. This anime is great for anyone who wants a mature show that is truly engaging. Fast-paced action and characters that would scare the shit out of you, but would still be great to go shot-for-shot with define much of Black Lagoon. It was refreshing to be able to watch a show that gives you snapshots of a way of life instead of an epic save the universe and change into the person you should be kind of narrative.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is without a doubt worth your time, even if for an episode or two.",

            "content": "For every two things I liked about this series, there was one thing I didn't like. That's a compliment; for the most part, I found \"Black Lagoon\" very refreshing.\r\n\"Black Lagoon\" is a story about an ordinary, boring Japanese businessman named Rokuro who is kidnapped by pirates, and, realizing his previous life existed at the mercy of cold, impersonal business executives, decides to change his life path. He joins the pirates.\r\nWhile most series would take at least five episodes to explain this, without even diving into the main part of the story, \"Black Lagoon\" takes just two. From the very instant one begins watching the series,there is no waste of time, and the episodes have a maniac, crazy energy and pace to them.\\n\\n\r\nRarely is there a second wasted, as every moment of the series is devoted to either character or plot development. Combined with the ridiculously cool, sexy intro, and some amazing gunplay and action scenes, the anime built up a lot of goodwill with me already.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it gets better; there is a subtle undertone of comedy, with all the dangerous, powerful characters being women in ridiculous costumes, whether it be traditional Chinese dress, a nun's habit, a chambermaid's clothes, or the attire of a secretary/businesswoman.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, \"Rock\", is both relatable and interesting. The temptation to turn him into a gun-wielding badass as soon as he joins the crew would be too easy, and is a trap the director avoids. Instead, he gradually becomes a tougher and more impressive individual throughout the twelve episodes, but never competently handles any weaponry.\\n\\n\r\nThe captain of the ship, \"Dutch\", is another character type I'd like to see more of in action animes; calm, funny, great at his job, and tough, who, just when you think you have him figured out, does something unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only three reasons why I give this legitimately excellent anime an 8 instead of a 10;\\n\\n\r\n1. The character of Revy. This is the biggest one to me. There are two problems with her; the first being that she is entirely unsympathetic. There is just nothing likable about her. She is a crazy, hysterical maniac who kills innocent people, including women and children with no mercy, and likes it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's fine. Mugen from \"Samurai Champloo\", one of my favorite anime characters ever, was similar.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the reason why I like Mugen and hate Revy; there is nothing funny, interesting, or even REAL about Revy.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, she is humorless, boring, and predictable. She gets angry at criticism. She goes on psychotic killing sprees for no apparent reason. She kills innocent people. She talks a lot of shit. She enjoys it.\\n\\n\r\nA cold-blooded, ruthless killer needs something to make them engaging, whether it be humor, or a viewer's ability to relate to their emotions. Otherwise, what's the point?\\n\\n\r\nAt least make them unpredictable, as Mugen was. At least don't make them talk stupid shit all the time. As Mugen would say after his opponent gave a long speech, \"I didn't understand a word of that. You talk too fucking much. Let's fight!\" Revy, meanwhile, loves spewing dumb quotes which, instead of making her look tough, make her look weak and foolish.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is her lack of reality. I can relate to Benny. I can relate to Rock. I can relate to Dutch. I can even relate to Balalaika, the Russian crime boss who aids the pirates.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot relate to Revy, nor have I ever known anyone remotely similar to her. If she were interesting or funny, that would be excused. Since she's nothing but a loud-mouthed bitch, it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nIt almost feels like the director wasn't quite sure what to do with the character of Revy. At times she's strong. At others she's weak. Sometimes, she talks like an idiot. Other times, she finally shuts the hell up. Too bad she's an annoying character ALL the time.\\n\\n\r\n2. Repetition and an underwhelming ending. I only really felt this during the last two episodes of the series, but it seemed like the writers wasted too many of the cool ideas early on. Without giving anything away, the story with the Fake Nazis, the killer maid Roberta, and even their initial predicament are all a lot more exciting and inventive than their race against the terrorists.\\n\\n\r\n3. The contradictions. While all anime series blend fantasy and reality, the universe they create should try to remain as internally consistent as possible. Unfortunately, that's not always the case in \"Black Lagoon\".\\n\\n\r\nA particularly head-scratching moment was Revy's showdown with Roberta. Roberta is seen as practically invincible, easily handling Dutch, all the pirates, and even an entire Colombian drug cartel.\\n\\n\r\nRevy, meanwhile, was shown as being physically weaker than Dutch, not much stronger than Rock, fails to kill Rock at a key moment, and not vastly overwhelming against Dutch even with guns.\\n\\n\r\nYet, her fight with Roberta is mostly equal, with perhaps a small edge to the latter. There are several other instances of this in the series, and in each case, they draw the viewer out of the exciting world of \"Black Lagoon\" to a large extent.\\n\\n\r\nMy nit-picking and criticism aside (the only reason this series isn't a 10 for me), the 12 episodes were still incredibly enjoyable, and I recommend the show to anyone, even for those who aren't action fans.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is a action thriller that doesn't really have a storyline but does have enough action and character development to keep a person interested.\r\nThe story is the weakest point in Black Lagoon. To put it simply, there is no story. The Lagoon Company is a group of thugs that went into piracy because there isn't anything else in life that they accept as a job or that will accept them. So the Lagoon Company undertakes missions for various bosses. And that's just what every episode entails. It's either a continuation of the previous mission because it wasn't able to fit in with the firstepisode or the episode is a introduction to a new mission. The pacing of an episode could hurt or help this anime. For example the pacing for most episodes is very fast. To a person that likes a lot of fast action this is great news. But for a person that likes an anime that takes its time the fast pace could make this anime less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful. This is where Black Lagoon shines. Everything, and I really mean everything, is drawn so cleanly it's like you can reach out and touch the characters. The water was my favorite thing about the art. The animals in the water were animated like they were real and the look of it is incredible. It's just amazing how well the animation for this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you can have the opening song get on my iPod, you got something going on. I really mean it. I added the OP to my music. It's that great. The gunfights sounded like they were happening outside of my house. Everything felt really real about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters, mainly Revy and Rock, is pretty good for a 12 episode anime. In the beginning Rock was absolutely nothing much to the series, but after a couple of episodes, his whole character seemed to have changed. I mean, he was even able to stand up to Revy. And don't even get me started on Revy. She changed so much throughout the show, it was just amazing. The only bad thing is that we didn't see enough of Dutch or the computer techie, Benny. Other than that the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. There were a lot of good action spots. I think my favorite episode was episode 9, when the maid that kills a lot was chasing the Lagoon Company through the streets. I just thought that was really well done and it kept me tuned in. This was a very good anime. I think if there was a story behind it and a couple more episodes I would have liked this anime more. Other than that it was really good and deserves a look.",

            "content": "Madhouse is a pretty unpredictable studio. For me, they've always been pretty hit or miss. Sometimes I really enjoy the anime they produce, other times I can't stand it. Some of the best and worst anime I've reviewed have been from them. I'm not even kidding, I've given anime from their studio everything from 1-10. Most of the time when I get a request to review one of their works I have no idea what to expect. Today is an exception since I've actually seen the anime before. So re-watching it for a review didn't leave me questioning whether or not it was going tobe one of their good ones. You may wonder why I even bothered re-watching it. Well, the answer is obvious. So that I could more effectively talk about it. Let's look at Black Lagoon. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't an under-lying story in Black Lagoon. There's just a situation. A Japanese businessman named Rock gets kidnapped by a group of mercenaries while carrying classified data. His company abandons him and he ends up joining up with the mercenaries. Why? Because... he had nothing better to do? Yeah, that aspect is a little strange. Anyway, the anime follows Rock and the three mercenaries, Dutch, Revy and Benny as they take on missions for profit. The missions follow a basic pattern. The Lagoon company goes somewhere to retrieve/deliver something, someone tries to stop them, action ensues. One thing I will say about the anime is that there are some strange characters that they run into during missions like gun-toting nuns and Roberta, a killer housemaid in traditional maid attire who carries an umbrella that fires high calibre bullets. These are both things that are pretty stupid when you think about it, but that are also awesome. It's stupidly awesome. One issue I do have is that it ends on kind of a weak note. The strongest mission story takes place before the very final mission and it makes the last mission arc seem kind of anti-climactic by comparison. The worst part is that there's not really a reason for it. They could've easily reversed the order and it would've made just as much sense both for this season and the second barrage.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime would be pretty unbearable if it had weak characters. Fortunately, it has a great cast. Most of the main protagonists are scoundrels, but also have good qualities that make them sympathetic and well-rounded. Revy is a badass who carries a lot of hatred and pain but also cares a great deal for her friends and will go to great lengths to protect them. She's a very intense character and that makes her really interesting. Dutch is more laid back, but he's still a great character. He's got a lot of really good leadership traits. He can keep his cool in any situation, he's cunning, manipulative and he has a pretty strong sense of honour, even if he is a scoundrel. Benny is less interesting that the others. He's pretty laid back and highly intelligent, but you don't really learn anything else about him, not in this season anyway. You don't know why he's there or what his goals are. He's just kind of there. I poked fun at Rock's joining the group earlier, but it actually does make sense when you consider his personality. He's a man leading a life of quiet desperation. He does what's expected of him, but it doesn't bring him any happiness. When he joins with Lagoon it's a way of breaking away from the expectations that he's always lived with and finding his own path. I like the way he's obviously in over his head but still manages to contribute. One thing that does annoy me about his character is that he whines quite a bit, especially in the beginning. Yeah, it's understandable and pretty realistic, but it's still kind of grating. All of the major side characters get fleshed out decently. There isn't a huge amount of time dedicated to them, but there's enough to make them seem like real people and a lot of them seem really interesting which makes you curious about them. Especially the gun-toting nuns, Roberta and Balalaika, which is a pretty strong indication that Hiroe Rei knows how to construct characters really well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is another aspect that really works. In a work like this there's a temptation to make everything dark and have copious amounts of gore, but Black Lagoon doesn't do that. The lighting is always perfect for the situation, sometimes dark and sometimes bright, but it's never excessive with either so it's always easy to see what's happening. There is blood when people get shot/stabbed/punched really hard, but it's not like Blood-C where they just spurt out ridiculous amounts, it's always pretty realistic. Honestly, I find that refreshing. The backgrounds are really vivid and detailed, as are the weapons and various objects. Then there are the fight scenes. Black Lagoon has some of the greatest fight sequences you've ever seen. There's a lot of movement, but it's never so hectic that you can't figure out what's going on. It's very fluid and graceful. They also get pretty creative at times, especially the battle with Roberta. Some of the stunts are kind of over the top, but never to the extent that they feel jarring or completely out of place. I also love how expressive the eyes are in this anime. There are some great shots where you can just tell how a character's feeling just because of the look in their eyes. They especially do it with Revy's scenes. The only real problem I have with the art is that Revy's outfit is ridiculous. She wears shorts that are so short you can see her buttocks. It's probably for fan-service, but if it is it's pretty subdued since they don't focus on it or draw shots so that you can get a view of them. They just gave her a stupid outfit and, in terms of fan-service, that's really subdued. One small issue I have is that Dutch always wears sunglasses, day or night. It doesn't make sense and it kind of drives me crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good in this. Toyoguchi Megumi gives a spectacular performance as Revy. Namikawa Daisuke and Isobe Tsutomu both do really well too. The music is well suited for the scenes. One thing I do have to mention about the music is the opening theme, Red Fraction. It's one of those aspects that's really stupid, but also really awesome. The whole thing is in bad \"Engrish\" and it's hilarious. Just read the first few lines and try to keep a straight face: \"I have a big gun, I took it from my lord. Sick with justice, I just wanna feel you. I'm your angel, only a ring away. You make me violate you no matter who you are.\" I honestly haven't heard Engrish that funny in an anime since... Star Gentle Uterus.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There's not any yuri in this. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Black Lagoon is a series with virtually no story, spectacular characters, gorgeous artwork, intense action and some awesomely stupid aspects. I think it's pretty glorious. I enjoy the character building moments and I really like how complex they all are, especially given how easily this could've just been a mindless action series. It's nice to look at and the goofier aspects actually serve to make it a lot of fun. I have to give Black Lagoon an 8/10.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an action series, people have guns, people use guns, people die, pretty standard sounding, but everything about it works and creates a truly brilliant experience thanks to it's memorable cast of characters.\r\nThe setting focuses on Southeast Asia where the Lagoon Company who are a team of mercenaries that specialise in smuggling goods. A lot of the time is spent in a fictional town in Tailand which is very run down and gangster run, it actually give a bit of a break from the almost perfect cities a lot of series are based in.\r\nThe actual story is divided into small arcs made upof two or three episodes, they start with the introduction arc where we get to find out about the characters then goes onto various others where we get to see characters from all over the world including Russia, Germany, Columbia and Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very basic and not too much detail is drawn and some of the characters got slightly disformed in certain scenes but it never ditracts from the show, saying that the backgrounds were really nice, the animation is top notch and every scene is animated nicely, it even shows the slightest amounto of movement when a cigerette is burning and the motion of boats.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this show is sensational it really fits the setting, the opening is a great techno song with rather vulgar/agressive lyrics which adds to the flavor of the Anime, the ending is a slow sad feeling song, now it may seem weird after the opoening song comments but this also gives a great meaning to the show, although the opening shows whats on the outside and in the present of the show, the ending gives a feeling of what the main characters pasts were like and maybe gives the true feel.\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon along with shows like Cowboy Bebop and baccano give us one of the best English dubs out there, every actor gives a great performance and we are treated to a variety of accents including those mentioned earlier we also have Chinese and Irish and they make the show even more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show are what drives this show, they make everything fun as there is not one bad character, Revy is a foul mouthed girl-with-guns trigger happy type with a harsh past and Rock is a white collar type and doesn't like to get mixed up with the action but has a good mind and fights with words, these two really bounce off each other and make up for what the other lacks. One thing i noticed is most of the action comes from females, it seems that if you are female you are most likely more badass than all the guys. Dutch, Benny and Balalaika are fun and each have their own style as well as all the antagonists and minor characters\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is one of those shows that you can easily sit back and just enjoy, your not going to get any heavy drama here, your also not going to get a huge complex plot thats hard to keep up with, the cast of characters, the setting and the incredible voice acting make it one of the most enjoyable action shows.\\n",

            "content": "You watch the way Revy handles her two, Beretta 92FS pistols with a 5.9 inch barrel and you say to yourself: \u201cthose jeans are way too suggestive for me not to imagine her holding my pistol.\u201d  But then you remember the talk you had with HR regarding this matter, and wisely choose not to watch bawdy anime at work.  Let alone masturbate to it.  Resulting in numerous complaints from fellow coworkers who can\u2019t keep their damn mouths shut.  \r\nPrudish bourgeoisie mores aside, Black Lagoon is an exhilarating show.  One that all too often becomes ridiculously absurd.  Like when theLagoon Company hurtled their boat into the air to jettison their torpedo (underwater missile, my ass) to pulverize a helicopter.  Or when Revy leaped from boat to boat \u2014 at full speed, mind you \u2014 to defeat a bunch of incompetent gangsters.  But if the viewer is willing to lift their suspension of disbelief, then there are fun times to be had.  Unlike a preponderance of action-oriented shows that are rather dull these days.\\n\\n\r\nIn opposition to the diverting action sequences, the characters are written rather poorly.  Rock is a spineless schlub who grows hair on his testicles when the situation demands it to circumvent impossible odds.  In addition, he often finds himself on the receiving end of a considerable amount of luck.  To the point that even Frane Selak would blush in envy (YouTube that mofo, shit\u2019s crazy!).  Rock also serves as the moral voice of reason.  Often questioning the sensibilities of the other crew members as they commit numerous abhorrent acts.  This dichotomy of view points aims to juxtapose the \u201cevil\u201d intentions of the pirate mercenaries (Revy, Dutch, and Benny) with the sensibilities of a \u201cnormal\u201d person.  That being said, however, long expositions concerning morality often become simulated philosophical lectures to feign intellectual depth.\\n\\n\r\nDutch and Benny, the token black guy and computer geek (respectively), are hardly fleshed out.  Dutch is the casual, pragmatic captain who maintains a level head despite the chaotic profession he has adopted.  Also, he looks like he hits the gym a lot.  The aforementioned computer genius, Benny, is a computer genius, of sorts.  I\u2019m not entirely sure what other personality traits he brings to the table, but the glasses and Hawaiian shirt paint a picture of genuine nerd.  Both of their characters leave much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the skank tats, Revy is a boner-fide sex-bomb.  Explosion!\u2014in my pants.  Her choleric, nihilistic personality serves as an effective lure for the viewer to become absorbed by her cryptic past.  The scattered, bread crumb insights, slowly paint a larger narrative about her impecunious upbringing that involved physical, verbal, and sexual abuses.  Accordingly, her addiction to power is reasonable, given the harsh environmental factors she endured; thus, making her a complex character with various layers of depth.  Despite this, she frequently acts like an edge-lord to appeal to teenagers with Tyler Durden infatuations.  Her speech in the Nazi U-boat regarding \u201cthings\u201d is vaguely reminiscent of the \u201call singing, all dancing crap of this world\u201d assertion.  Consequently, her candid declarations are vacuous.  Perhaps if I were younger, and more impressionable, I would have found her cynicism to be quite refreshing.  But  not at this stage in my life.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the OST, the contrast between the energetic, rock-based OP and the somber, melancholic ED accentuate the themes of the series quite nicely.  The rule-of-cool atmosphere, along with the beautiful aesthetics of Madhouse, give the viewer plenty of eye-candy to ogle over.  And the character designs are relatively distinct, except for Rock (who looked like any other male protagonist).  So if the viewer can appreciate Black Lagoon for what it is, rather than holding it up to a high cinematic standard, then it\u2019s a pleasurable experience.  Just make sure to watch this one half-drunk.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m feeling quite charitable today.  6/10",

But instead of doing stupid things like singing sea shanties and making people walk the plank he's fighting neo nazis and getting into gunfights against other smugglers . Despite having no formal training with a firearm of any kind and having a gigantic gaping cunt where his balls should be Rokurou isn't immdietly gunned down during the first-fire fight that happens in the anime. And that's going to bring me to my next point.\r\nEarly on Black lagoon stabs to death any sense oftension by establishing that the main cast is unkillable because of plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nRarely does a main character take cover during a fire fight. Luckily they don't have to because their wizard magic causes bullets to fly harmlessly past them instead of through them. Regardless if said bullets are coming from a turret on a boat when said cast member is water bound or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem if the show didn't take itself so seriously. but because it does its one of the biggest problems with the show.\\n\\n\r\nSince the main cast is considered untouchable there's really no conflict in the show that feels meaningful, leaving everything in it feeling kinda pointless and empty. \\n\\n\r\nThe main-cast would have been able to save this if all of them weren't puddle deep cliches that a six year old scribbled together in their basement. \\n\\n\r\nRokurou aka rock: The Underdog \\n\r\nDutch: The brains\\n\r\nRevy: Loose cannon that gets shit done.\\n\r\nBenny: Charismatic vet that mentors the underdog.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters rarely act outside of their designated roles ^\\n\\n\r\nRevy is rarely cool headed and almost always rushes into danger headfirst , Rokurou is almost always an oversensitive wimp, benny is almost always there to offer advice, And Dutch is more often than not the voice of reason that links everyone together. \\n\\n\r\nBut since I have to say why I don't like the anime I guess I should end this review by doing that.\\n\\n\r\nRevy is a bitch who abrasive to pretty much everyone she meets for no reason at all. The anime justifies her anti-social and sadistic tendencies by giving her a tragic backstory filled with daddy issues..This happens with every single morally questionable character in the anime. And it's a disgusting attempt to get the viewer to bond with a previously unlikable character via the use of shock.",

            "content": "I consider Black Lagoon and Black Lagoon: The second Barrage as one, so this review will cover both seasons.  Also, the modular structure of Black Lagoon does lend to adding more kours.  Oh, I refuse to shorten Black Lagoon to BL&hellip;  Anyway, on to the review&hellip;\r\nThe first thing that came to mind when watching Black Lagoon what how it was quite different than your typical action anime.  Instead it reminded me more of the over-the-top action flicks by John Woo or Hollywood summer blockbusters.  It has crazy gun fights and insane car chases, things you find in many action flicks.Watching this in this form is quite refreshing than your typical shounen or mecha anime.  As I mentioned Black Lagoon has a modular structure or arcs.  Each arc can be seen as a movie in itself however, at the same time develop the characters and keep continuity.  By this I mean that the events of the previous arc are not forgotten but still affect the main characters.  There are many examples but I won&rsquo;t bother going into that as it could get spoilerish.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile I did compare Black Lagoon to Hollywood blockbusters, the stories are far more compelling.  Black Lagoon uses many mature and serious themes only found in more adult anime.  In addition, the level of ambiguity in Black Lagoon is extremely high, there are no &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; only people on opposing sides.  For example, the twin&rsquo;s arcs, the antagonist (the twins) as well as Balalika, the one pursuing them are made extremely sympathetic.  I am reminded of the time I went to Anime Central and the director and producer of Black Lagoon were there.  One person asked &ldquo;who were your favorite villains?&rdquo; and the directors responded &ldquo;huh, they&rsquo;re all villains.&rdquo;  In addition, Black Lagoon never idealizes the criminal/pirate life, as there is an over arcing sense of sadness and tragedy in Black Lagoon.  This is made obvious by the ED sequence.    \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that surprised me about Black Lagoon is the almost slice-of-life feel.  In between major actions scenes and arcs we get to know a bit about the characters, in particular Rock and Revy.  There is a depth to both those characters are comparable to more character driven anime titles.  This brings up one of my main complaints, the lack of development for Dutch and Benny.  I really wish they added more to them, instead they feel like side characters instead of main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, the designs are consistent and well animated, Madhouse is in their element.  The OP and ED are also well done and really show the 2 sides of Black Lagoon, the fast paced action and the more serious/dramatic side.  I can&rsquo;t really say much about the music as only 3 pieces stuck out for me, &ldquo;Red Faction&rdquo;, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Look behind&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the world of midnight.&rdquo;  Oh, one cannot review Black Lagoon without mentioning the awesome Engirsh, they are some of the most unintentionally hilarious things I have ever heard.    \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a refreshing action anime when compared to your typical shounen and mecha anime.  For most this is the main draw, I&rsquo;ll admit, sometimes you just need some over-the-top action, and Black Lagoon has plenty.  However, there is more to Black Lagoon than that as they use more mature themes.  This combined with over-the-top action creates quite a unique series.  Black Lagoon is rated mature, not only for the extreme violence but for the challenging themes they employ.",

            "content": "The Lagoon Company is a \"delivery\" company that operates in the South China Sea. While they do in fact deliver cargo to and from destinations, the business is as legitimate as Al Capone going to the bank to \"make a transaction\". They are made up of their leader Dutch, a black ex-U.S. Vietnam veteran, and Captain of the PT boat Black Lagoon; Revy, a Chinese-American sharpshooter from New York; and Benny, a Florida post-grad electronics expert.\r\nOur main character is Rokuro Okajima, a mild mannered Japanese office worker still very low on the totem pole at his employer. His company is smuggling information on nuclear weaponsand Rokuro is unwittingly given the job on holding the discs with the information for the trip. The boat he is on is captured and Okajima is taken hostage by Lagoon. His employer decides not to pay a ransom to get him back and hangs him out to dry as part of their cover up. He is declared dead by his employer, and they send mercernaries to kill him and the Lagoon company. Rokuro's quick thinking saves them from the trap. His employer buys the disc back from Lagoon but when they offer to take him back Rokuro decides to stay abroad having had his life back home destroyed. The Lagoon Company feels sorry for his plight after he saved them, and take him on as a sailor-in-training/gopher employee. The first half dozen episodes have the classic fish-out-of-water premise as Rokuro (who now goes under the name &quot;Rock&quot; with his new employer) tries to prove his worth in a career field he doesn't always agree with morally.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is slightly above average for the most part, and occasionally the show did surprise me with a different visual styles for a fight or flashback scene. The music wasn't fabulous, but it wasn't bad either. I've heard the complete soundtrack and it had a couple gems on it, but they get used a little too often in the show itself. That's nothing I haven't come to expect after watching Full Metal Alchemist and Bleach, though. Voice acting was fine, too. I've heard the dub and it's not terrible but I felt Dutch's English VA sounds too young and lacks the deep gruffness the original did, among other little tweaks. This remains a show I prefer to watch subbed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're read the Wikipedia entry for Black Lagoon, it goes on for awhile about Existentialism philosophy used in the show. I'm sure this is true, but it really wasn't much of the focus as far as I could see. Black Lagoon was a classic action/adventure. Lots of guns and swearing and pretty girls and evil men. In fact, I think it was a slight parody of the genre. The violence was seemed to be a little bit over the top (in a Sin City sort of way) and the characters made references several times to Hollywood movies. Revy usually wears a pair of Daisy Dukes and tank top while doing acrobatic flips and shooting wildly, or lounging around in unladylike poses. With a couple other ruthless female characters you get a &quot;girls with guns&quot; sort of vibe from the show at times, but overall it was more a trash-talking, ass-kicking good time. The story arcs (each 2-3 episodes long) aren't very deep in their plot but are given a light coat of real-world politics and history.\\n\\n\r\nFor a summer-blockbuster popcorn-film experience: I recommended it.",

            "content": "Opening Thoughts : Black Lagoon is about a japanese businessman taken hostage by the Lagoon Company, a mercenary pirate group sailing around Roanpur,Thailand. He was taken hostage because of a disk that contained important data from the company he had worked for and later realized his life in Japan was thrown away from his boss to as a cover up. Sick and tired of his old businessman life, he ends up joining Lagoon Company on an epic adventure in the criminal underworld. The crew of the Lagoon Company is Dutch, a black man that seems to be in charge of the entire crew, Benny, theintelligence guy. Not very combatant but is good for information, Revy (a.k.a) Two Hands, a chinese woman who has a dark past but one of the best sexy gunslingers you will ever see. And Rock. The name of that Japanese businessman who used to be known as Rokuro Okajima.\\n\\n\r\nPlot : Is the plot any good? Hell yes! Many animes usually take place around Japan or some fictional land. Black Lagoon is not. I am amazed at the writers of this anime and manga where it originated from. The world in Black Lagoon is portrayed very realistically. I'm sure the creators have took the time to study how different cultures are in the several locations and characters of the series. The plot mainly revolves around the many jobs and missions Lagoon Company operates. Each of their tasks aren't very straightforward. They usually go out of hand because of some trouble or they were lied upon. /10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Very well-crafted set of characters. Some of them have deep backstories such as Revy but we pretty much know the race and location of each character. Not all of them are asians and stereotypical white guys. We got columbians, russians, germans, each with their own accents. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dub : As I mentioned above, many characters have their own unique accent depending where they are from. Many anime fans probably think english dubs are inferior to the regular japanese cast. But for Black Lagoon, that is a different story because the characters are multi-racial and are from different countries. Revy is chinese, but was born in the Manhatten area of New York. Benny is from Florida. One character is from a Cartel in South America and speaks in his native accent. There is also flashbacks for a small side plot portraying nazis back in the 40's. The voice actors for those back story characters did an. excellent performance portraying genuine german accents. Another character who is taiwanese speaks \"chinglish\" which is basically a broken english dialect. This just shows how great the dub is and isn't just some english voices slapped on great anime.  Rock and some of the minor japanese characters however sound like the typical english dub voices.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art : Very well done. A ton of things are in details such as the many weapons in featured in the anime.  Everything looks beautiful especially since many of the scenes take place in the middle of the ocean. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound : (Read English Dub section of review for voices). The sound for the guns are just great. Everything feels believable. Not much I can say about background sounds but everything feels like the anime is real. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts : If you love guns, actions, a sexy strong female character, and tons of profanity, then Black Lagoon is for you. There isn't really anything bad about Black Lagoon. It's just perfect. The English dub alone just tells me that the actors took great effort to make their voices be part of this great anime. It's just totally entertaining including the gun fights. The action scenes aren't overly cartoony but feels more like typical american action flicks. The series does take place around the 90's after all. One freaking great anime!!!!\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Black lagoon was my second anime and even though i have seen plenty anime it remains one of my  favorites in the action gender anime category. I will keep this as short as i can but i will also try to explain the reasons this anime is one of those few hidden gems out there.\r\nAs we all know anime about pirates do not come by so often other than the neverending One Piece, and one that puts the cutthroat and ruthless life of a pirate under the magnifying glass is even rarer, if not, nonexistent. Black Lagoon is an exception that vividly exemplifies thisperspective and it presents in raw fashion a lawless world full of people in their most depraved state. Violence and bloodshed mostly in the form of gunfights are plentiful in this show, and they are executed with style that is reminiscent to action films of the 90\u2032s. At the same time, the show adeptly juxtaposes sleek action sequences with moments of deliberate character development, an aspect commonly neglected in most action shows. The balance of action and drama makes itself one of Madhouse\u2018s modern classics and perhaps a common reference of its respective genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be fair enough to say that Black Lagoon\u2018s most conspicuous trait is its action sequences. The show is heavily featured with scenes of flying bullets, blood splatting and stuff being blown up, all of which are fast and furious. They may be gratuitous occasionally, but for most of the times, these scenes serve an important purpose: apart from them being riveting and exhilarating to watch, they also illustrate how brutal the world is and explicitly show how the corruption of the human psyche drives people towards resorting to morally questionable actions. For one, Revy\u2019s penchant for killing people coldbloodedly and out of delight is the outcome of her tragic childhood, and the same goes for the rest of the cast, their actions being the consequence of their motivations and not-so-pleasant personal stories.\\n\r\nWhile many of the audience would remember this show for the action, what\u2019s more fundamental is the core, which is the motley cast. Black Lagoon is a carnival of badass cast with unique traits: there are the gunslingers, the mafia, the triads, the war veterans, the government agents, the Nazis and others with their deadly weapon of choice. And of course, the beauty of the show is at its peak when they all come together and let their weapons do the talking. However, underneath all that lies in-depth character development and chemistry; in particular, the relationship between Revy and Rock takes center stage continually as the Lagoon company takes on various jobs. The two characters experience friction between them from time to time because of their polar differences, but ironically their differences are what keeps each other\u2019s sanity intact and bring them closer. This invisible bond between them is what makes a normal scene such as sharing a lighted cigarette special.\\n\\n\r\nBetween One Piece and Black Lagoon, the latter is like this more adult, more cynical and more in-your-face big brother of the former; if One Piece reitinerates the power of friendship to overcome all odds, Black Lagoon begs to differ by saying that friendship means nothing in the face of vice and gore. Madhouse shows how an action series is done by presenting to the audience one of the most daring seinen productions in its r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nStory: well to be honest the story wasnt really special. Almost all the time you will see the lagoon company accepting some kind of work which always leads to violence or revy saving rocks ass. Nether the less i liked it so i give it a 8\\n\\n\r\nArt: For anime made almost 10 years ago the animation is great. All the characters are well drawn and unique and all the fighting scenes were nicely detailed. I give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The oppening was amazing and i am glad that the kept it in the second one as well. The battle music was also excellent especially when revy draw her bad boys out and hell was about to rain down it was hard to focus on the fight while headbanging to that music. I give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Arguably the strongest part in black lagoon. Every single one of the characters in this anime were freaking bad asses (yes rock too in his own way). I mean look at revy, balalaika, Roberta etc. 10 without a doudt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A crap ton of gun fighting through out the anime from the first episode to the last. A crap ton of bad ass characters. If you like guns you will definetely love this. 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime was very enjoyable due to the endless action it has, but thats it. If you are a person that likes good plots and an actual story i am sorry my friend but this anime is not for you. All the other people who like hot chicks gun fighting in every freaking episode, who like blood violence gore and endless calibers and mags, well what are you waiting for?  9",

            "content": "I just could not stand this anime. I first, and last saw this anime a good maybe four or five years ago. I just recently remembered it now... I would not consider that a good thing. I remember more about NARUTO than this and I saw Naruto last about... 8-9 years ago? Sit back people, this is an angry rant about to happen...\r\nI don't remember ANY of the characters' names except for Rock's, and that's only because of \"The Rock\". I almost remembered Revy's, but I called her Remi first... Rock starts as this boring, do good civilian type guy and \"transforms\" into a \"badass\"...Or at least I think that was the intention? If anything he just seemed to somehow get blander. Revy just seems try-hard as a character. Her entire character is \"I'm a money and bloodthirsty psychopath\" or something like that. Seriously. What is the gamut of Revy's emotions? There's: angry, emotionless, uhh... Sarcastic (I know it's a stretch)? Yeah, that's all I got. It's boring. She's boring. I get it, she's supposed to have only two emotions, but it doesn't forgive how boring she is. All Revy does is yell profane and explicit things, and blow shit up. I don't even remember what the other characters even look like. I'M AN ARTIST, I USUALLY REMEMBER THAT CRAP. \\n\\n\r\nI can't even remember the premise of the story anymore. I can remember more about the premise of Final Fantasy: Advent Children more, and I could barely understand what the premise of that movie even was outside of some dumbshits kidnapping children to bring back Sephiroth or something dumb like that. What about Black Lagoon? Something about a disc in Rock's briefcase? Sure, I could go look up the premise, but my point is that I could remember the story of movie I watched when I was  a freshman in high school that I could barely understand (because that one's story was poorly told as well), but can't even remember what this show's one was. Hell, I remember the premise of the Pokemon movies I watched back in elementary school sooner than Black Lagoon's!\\n\\n\r\nI think the show's only real saving grace was the art. The animation was fluid, and the colors matched the show's tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme was lame. This is a nitpick, but if there was one thing I actually did remember well about the show, it's that every time the ending theme started to play, it always felt out of place. That's the main reason I rated sound so low. It's just so jarring to hear this calming song come out of nowhere. The song seems like it's going to pick up and when you think it will, it just ends... This show is utter chaos with it's action scenes, but then you hear this soft song start playing... Ugh, it just ruins the mood of the last scene sometimes, or just plain misleads you until you remember that it's just the boring ending. Especially since they play the song a little early BEFORE the credits. At least the voice acting wasn't too bad, though not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I only remember two big things about this show: gratuitous violence and tits. I'm not against violence in an anime, in fact I quite enjoy it, and I don't care about tits either way, but it feels like there's no real purpose for either of those things except to draw in that kind of audience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like this show, good, but this is my opinion on a show that I feel just really isn't that memorable from my perspective. \"Memorability\" is something I like, and this show just didn't seem to have it. Who knows? Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this show. Then again, I also enjoyed the game \"No More Heroes\" and that has the same kind of vulgarity and violence... I'll leave it up to you...",

            "content": "Another show that makes me want to smoke cigarettes.\r\nBlack Lagoon is a show in the same vein as  a Hollywood action flick. The series mimics one in many ways, most notably in the way real-world brands are used and become a backdrop for the impossible and over-the-top action that takes place throughout Black Lagoon. A few times I really did feel as if I could have been watching a high-budget action film.\r\nThe story of Black Lagoon is simple. Besides what is set up in the first episode there is no continuous story arc. However, it isn't quite episodic either, it is split up intofour or five arcs, with each of these arcs lasting a few episodes. In the end you may have watched twelve episodes but you only recall  four important things happening, but it gets the job done and allows more detail to be placed into what is going on. Which is good to have, because they go up against some very odd people. Neo Nazi's trying to restore power to the Reich and an ex-assassin house-maid both make an appearance.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon's art is phenomenal. It has crisp and clean designs for the characters, with varying density outlines which I like, and detailed environments which do seem out of place at times since they lack much outline and look more like paintings than an animation but it looks great nonetheless. I especially like the choice of colors for the show, everything looks great whether it is day or night. Nothing looks too dark or too light, a great amount of detail is payed to where light should be. It should be noted that Black Lagoon also takes advantage of computer effects to amplify its lighting effects. Bloom effects are used occasionally on the reflection of glasses or the sun setting over the ocean. CG is also used as well ,mainly on cars but also on butterflies, and fits the shows aesthetic very well and does not look out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the soundtrack in Black Lagoon doesn't stand up to the more 'epic' sound tracks of other anime, the music played was the correct choice for the situation. The only fault I am able to find with it is that it isn't my favorite style. The voice acting is very good as well. I watched it dubbed, which I recommend unless you have to watch it subbed. In English everyone sounds great with the exception of a few minor characters, usually members of gangs, and all characters have convincing accents from where they are supposed to be from.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my favorite part of Black Lagoon. Every character has a different personality and the characters stick to their personalities and take actions you would suspect them to make. Two of the best characters are women named Revy and Balalaika. Revy  who killed as a child to survive and is    great with a weapon has earned the nickname \"two hands\" by the people that know her because of her skills with using two pistols at once. Balalaika was a captain for the soviet union before it disbanded. After the soviet union fell she and her subordinates headed a group called Hotel Moscow, a branch of the Russian Mafia. Balalaika is one of the most cunning characters on the show and watching her and her men is very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon was a very enjoyable experience. The violence in this show will keep your attention for quite a while. I can't recall an episode where someone doesn't shoot something or something doesn't get blown up, it's great. I also had fun watching some of the characters' banter with the other characters. I may have even laughed a few times. It should be noted that Black Lagoon doesn't always take itself seriously and will put the characters into certain positions that will entertain its audience, something they really had fun with in the show's off-shoot, Black Lagoon Omake.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstand that this is only the first half of Black Lagoon. The second season is titled Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage. Everything Black Lagoon does, Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage does better.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is a unique little anime, stuffed to the core with heart pounding action, crazy shootouts, insane characters, knee-slapping black humor, and enough f-bombs to make your grandmother's ears bleed with rage. \r\n[Story]\r\nThe episodes of Black Lagoon consist of the Lagoon crew's various jobs as mercenaries/pirates. These jobs are never peaceful and simple. They all usually end in dramatic shootouts. There isn't exactly an overarching storyline, you just see the Lagoon crew take on their jobs. Occasionally we get a little backstory on the characters, but this anime mostly uses over the top action and dark humor to keep the audience hooked. Its muchmore interesting than it sounds though. The style of this anime is reminiscent of action films, the kind that awe you with its actions, guns, and violence, not so much with its deep storyline and character development. Its fine though, because although Black Lagoon isn't big on its storyline or characters, it still manages to play out well and keep you hooked. 8/10\\n\\n\r\n[Art and Sound]\\n\\n\r\nAs a 6 year old anime, it holds up well in the art and sound department. The english dub in particular is what shines about this anime. Its excellent, and every bit as entertaining as the original audio. Revy takes some getting used to, but everyone else is mostly excellent. This is probably one of the best dubs I've heard. Its also a nice touch to hear all the different accents. You'll hear everything from Russian to Spanish to Chinese accents.  The gratuitous swearing is hilarious to me, but I can see some people seeing the foul language as unnecessary. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, the characters. Being primarily focused on action, Black Lagoon is chock full of badass characters. The Lagoon crew dukes it out with everyone from maids with umbrella guns to Neo Nazis. Each new enemy always manages to be interesting, brutal, and unforgiving, carrying their own arsenal of unique and odd weapons. The only real complaint I have is how little development and backstory we get. Revy and Rock get a little backstory and development, while Dutch and Benny get almost none. This doesn't mean they are bad characters. Their personalities and interactions are all interesting, especially when you see how city boy bussinessman Rock's ideals clash with his ruthless Lagoon crewmates. But you also have to consider what Black Lagoon was trying to do. It takes a leaf out of the book of western action movies, and in those types of movies, characters tend to be sort of static, getting little to no development. But the saving grace of these characters is that they are cool, powerful, and interesting. Looking at it this way, the characters are all great, and succeed at entertaining the audience. 8/10\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Black Lagoon. It made me laugh, it made me sigh, it made me go DAMN, it had me on the edge of my seat. This is probably one of the coolest action anime out there. Its definetly an anime that no hardcore action fan would want to pass up. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nOverall Black Lagoon is a great anime. Its foul, its funny, and it oozes action from its veins. I'd highly recommend this to any fan of action anime. I'd even go as far as to recommend it to someone who hasn't watched anime. Its got a sort of western appeal and vibe to it, sort of like Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop. The kind that draws in fans and non fans of anime alike. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The criminal world that they work in is displayed in way that you can see the mindset of the people through a series of adventures with the characters. I especially liked how Rock and Revy have contrasting views on morality and human aspects. It gave the story line some depth, and although I didn't see a concrete plot (maybe seeing how Rock has to adjust to a whole new set of rules and thinking), I would say this is for those without the expectation of seeing a grand plot unfold, butseeing the development of Rock and his crew.",

            "content": "I find that the story of Black Lagoon is very attractive and quite original with this omnipresence of what is good or what is bad. The city of roanapur is always evolving durng the anime and we can discover more and more about it and about what the differents characters thnk about it and the way they see and interact with that environnement. The main character is more like what most of common poeple are and he is describing this world with eyes that I find pretty close to what i would imagine most of us would see and that is one of the mostinteresting fact about the story.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the characters, we don't have all the strereotypical characters that we can see in a lots of anime, I found them really interesting we can discover bright or dark side of them and most of all the mysterious side that nearly forces us to want tot know more. Moreover we can see the evolution of the main character that isn't used to this world and who is trying to adapt.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is quite attractive too and know how to stay close to what is more common in japanese animation, but can also stay original, mostly in the way it shows the events and the ways they affects characters. It is not always written who's good and who's bad on the first appearance. The universe where these persons are evolving is really bautiful and little details give a sensation of realism, whether in the mood/ambience or simply in the action.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon OST are simply beautiful, the calm parts have a music that is perfectly, i can even listen to them in the streets or when i'm studying. The nervousness of actions musics can get you in stress nearly making you forget your surroundings, and the music when showing the city or dialogues is very relaxing and isn't too present.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching it and was disappointed when i had to go to sleep because I was getting so involved in this anime, I would recommend it to everyone who's searching for a seinein in a realistic setting even if you're not going to study your physics in front of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I actually stumbled onto this show by accident, I forgot the name of what I wanted but remembered \"black\" was in the title somewhere. Definitely one of my better mistakes, because this show blew me out of the water.\r\nIt's an easy enough story to get your head around. A business man gets mixed up with international pirates, and decides to join them because his life is awful. These are your modern day type pirates, with torpedoes instead of parrots. Some episodes are stand alone, others flow into small arcs, but each time there is a mission that the Lagoon Company have to complete - thinkgun running, smuggling people...  That kind of stuff. All the motivation feels quite accessible, who doesn't need to make money to eat? Backstories are explored but not shoved down your throat. Everything feels very balanced and well polished.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in this show is cranked up waaay high, and the animation couldn't possibly fit better. It's very unique, there's no silly \"anime stretch arm\" or mystery tentacle because the budget craps out. The action scenes have more empty bullet casings than Robocop, and even the slower scenes keep you interested by sheer strength of the characters. Visually, this is a feast.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame the soundtrack is so small, but luckily what few tracks exist are all fairly good. You've got action scenes, tense music, the usual round up. Some of these tracks pull a heavy rotation, which gets a little tiring, but it's not grating.\\n\r\nThe voice acting on the otherhand is phenomenal. The English dialogue adaptation is some of the best I've ever heard, up there with Steins;Gate for believability. You can tell a lot of work went into recording, and it shines through so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Oh man, I could write a small essay on this! Each crew member is so distinguishable from the others, their own personalities are well laid out and their motivations are explained and advanced with the story. You're going to want to know more about the interesting characters because they're well designed, balanced, flawed, and very human. Even the escalation is at a reasonable level, the jobs get bigger and more difficult but the pay goes up. One of my favourite strong female leads ever is in this show, she'll probably be one of yours too by the time you're finished.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as I stumbled into this show by accident, I expected nothing at the start. Black Lagoon gave me so much back in return. Each mission is different and challenging in it's own way, the conflict between crewmates and enemies alike is gripping and fun to watch, and the way they really grill the new guy is painfully relatable (Thanks work). This is up there as one of my favourite shows, even if they break it into two 12 episode chunks for some reason. If you haven't seen this, stumble into the first episode and give it a chance, you won't regret a second of it.",

The ending was great settling the on-going dispute throughout the series between Rock and Revy. \r\nThe only short coming to this series is its episodic nature. This show would have really benefited with another overarching story that super cedes these missions the Black Lagoon goes on.

            "content": "Major disappointment. This show was recommended to me by a friend under the promise it would be a gritty dark and dramatic, and while yes, the show tries its hardest to be these things, it felt hollow and inconsequential. \r\nFirstly, the writing is poor, there are too many corny and unnatural dialogue choices, making the characters feel more or less like a parody of the western action antiheroes. The profanity is gratuitous and really cringeworthy, reminiscent of a person trying way to hard to act tough. The shows basic setup is weak, however early on I felt like there was going to be some realcharacter development between the two leads Revy and Rock. \\n\\n\r\nNow other than the Tokyo arc, the two characters do not evolve whatsoever. Revy starts out as an angry asshole, and by the very end of the show, is still exactly that, in fact growing even less likeable as during the OVA Rock and Revy become even more emotionally dissonant, barely interacting. Not to mention Revy is essentially a second rate Fay Valentine, what with the whole childhood sob story, but hard and inaccessible exterior. \\n\\n\r\nThe other surrounding characters have historically interesting backgrounds, however I noticed a lot of them fell into the same category, where we sort of sympathise with them, considering the exceptional circumstances surrounding their lives, but their personalities are too blank-faced or formulaic: \"Roberta, the quiet but calculated killer\" or \"Benny, the computer guy\", speaking of whitch: what happened to Benny, besides one attempt to establish his character early on, he fades away so hard after say the 7th episode. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think the biggest problem with the show was the action: super excessive, to the point where there are no stakes. The episode where Revy and Dutch take out a boat of Nazis without batting an eye was especially boring. The main characters have such ridiculous plot armour, that throughout all of the show, there was not a single moment where the stakes felt high, and not a single major character death occurred throughout the entire show (unless one would the one in the Tokyo arc).\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, boring, gratuitous repetitive action with no stakes, character arcs that seem to stop dead in their tracks after the Tokyo arc, and cheesy one liners. Would not recommend.",

I really liked it when i first watched it but i absolutly loved it when i came back to it. \r\n ~Story~\r\n The story is bad ass, excuse my french but thats really the only was to describe its awesomeness. It not only has Nuns with guns, Hilarious comedy, Kick ass main characters, Fight scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat but it also has a plot that doesnt overwhelm you. Actually it had multiple plots within the first season,if i remember correctly there are 3 main ones and smaller ones along the way. \\n\r\n The synopsis for this anime really didn't give you a very good idea about the show so ill do a short one that actually goes more into it without giving spoilers. So a buisness guy's ship is taken by pirates who want a disk hes carrying (All stated in the anime's synopsis) but heres what it didn't mention. He joins the pirates and leaves his good old boring perfect life behind for a dangerous one that gives him the thrill he needs.\\n\r\n The anime's first season is pretty much about them doing jobs for some serious cash and how the main character fits in to all of this. To make it short and sweet, they are a new age of pirates that use guns and gernades rather than muskits and swords. \\n\r\n ~Art~\\n\r\n What can you say about the art for this one...Well its certainly one of the better animations i have seen. The fight scenes are pretty realistic and the characters are all well animated. I have nothing to complain about art wise, it made the anime very intresting. \\n\r\n ~Charater~\\n\r\n There are a lot of side characters so i wont do a whole paragraph on each character because that would be a waste of both of our times. So ill go by gender. The male roles are all cool except the main guy who annoys at times but hes not that bad. The female roles are far more violent than the company they travel with in most cases and i adored every female role.\\n\r\n ~Overall~\\n\r\n Overall i would say this anime got a 10 all around. If your not into Gore i wouldnt watch this, if you like romance stuff and only romance stuff this is not for you. However for every lover of Gore,Action,Comedy and guns this is for you. 10/10",

She doesn't rely on her womanly talents to get what she wants (unlike Faye who I still love) she relies on her gun and her amazing fighting abilities rather which is what makes her so likable. She is solid in her resolve and almost becomes a role model for \"Rock\" as he quits his mundane life to join Levi and Dutch's group of mercenaries. An odd combination of folks, Benny the control room operatorlook more like a surfer from California while Dutch has many similarities again to the big guy on cowboy bebop Jet, a solid guy who stands back and lets his crew do their job because he knows they are good at what they do. A solid action plot with good graphics and good music. I highly recommend this anime.",

So lets start with the characters. Revy now she is one of my all time favorite anime by far. She's just so badass and fearless sort of like the anime version of \"Lara Croft\". (god I'm so getting flamed for saying that). Now Rock. He's sort of useless when it comes to any combat in show. But sometimes useful in situations. Dutch is probably once again one of my favorite anime charactersof all time. I mean he's just so awesome and he's a war vet what more could you want? Ok Benny I feel thats he's sort of left out from the rest of the main cast. But that's just my opinion. Now I loved Black Lagoon because of it's awesome well drawn action scenes, it's story, the characters, and because I love action animes. I highly recommend Black Lagoon to anyone out there who is looking for a badass, hardcore anime and needs a break from all the childish themes in certain animes. All and all I'm giving Black Lagoon a 10/10 stay tuned for more reviews from me Tsukune52!!",

            "content": "The visual quality is incredible and if you are looking for a dark-themed anime this is the one you are looking for. Even though the character development needed further work I still liked this anime. There are a few episodes that are a bit to hard to the eye because of the story itself (it is focused in the worst of human nature, from kidnapping, torture, pornografy, blackmailing and of course killing) but if you have the guts then is a good choice.\r\nThe music is somehow the right choice for this show but I found it repetitive at a long term.\r\nThe best aspect of thisanime is the way it shows the &quot;twisted&quot; nature of human beings. This is the second anime I've seen that focuses on the worst aspects of the human psyche (not a bad thing) and it is that difference which makes you want to see it. As I said before just watch it if you really want to witness the wickedness of the human beings.\\n\\n\r\nEven though theres a lot of action through every episode, the most interesting thing is the relationship between Revy and Rock. Being that Revy has seen a lot of violence in her life (and lived through it) she has a different perspective than an ordinary citizen. On the other side, Rock is your ordinary co-worker, someone bound to do anything to please his boss. This combination of personalities is what really makes the show. While Revy only wants to kill everyone that steps in her way, Rock always tries the less direct approach. Everything to avoid casualties. Obviously this carries its own set of problems for Revy, but with every episode you get to see a change of heart from both of them.\\n\r\nAlmost every other character has less to no importance at the long run, and most characters only make an appearance for a few episodes before being forgotten.",

I don't even know where to start.\r\nTo be frank, I would usually follow the traditional format of Story/Art/Sound/Character/Overall, but... its just so damn good I really don't know where to start.\r\nAs a story, I can just say that it started on a little rough patch, but it paced itself so thoroughly and with such effectiveness that I truly have nothing else to say other than \"I kept watching till the bloody end\". And as a story, it really and truly is well developed - it used in-universe logic and premise rationale throughout and relied entirely on the premise and environment which it hasrichly - and lucidly - kept strong. Not once did I - during my time spent watching this anime - feel that there was a need to consider outerworld aspects (i.e. any aspect outside the Black Lagoon anime universe) or perspectives when watching the story unfold. It is that damn good.\\n\\n\r\nSound was brilliant - the gunshots were real, the minor detailing was real, the characters were handled lucidly and without even a shred of doubt about who they are. Everyone was menacing when they played their scripts, and even the explosions and the music fitted this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of sound, this anime has an addictive opening theme - Its not as upfront or bombastically epic as The Hero (ONE PUNCH!!!!) nor is it as upbeat as Cowboy Bebop's opening theme, but it definitely sets the tone, the pace and the roaring gun filled frenzy of Roanapur. And Roanapur has a presence which - because the overall attention to detail was handled just as brilliantly by the sound as it was in the story - is felt too close to home.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters... is it me, or is every character in this damn anime so badass its a sin to like them? Balalika, Revy, Dutch, Chang (he arrives in Second Barrage, but he's a presence in this anime as well), Roberta the Bloodhound of Florencia... I could go on, but they're all so well developed (and even more interestingly, three dimensional - because they use Roanapur to get by, and are all made better because they add to the environment which is established in Roanapur). I give credit where credit is due, it is this anime's characters who bring the story to life, and in fact made it twice as better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a 2006 classic. I call it a classic - period. This anime has done what a very, very rare number of anime have been able to achieve: remain watchable and still be fresh and involving while being scary and realistic. A definitive addition to any anime roster.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is about a Japanese man who is tired of getting his ass kicked by his own boss at work, and he is kidnapped by a \"pirates\" (though in this case, a small group of badass people who do things just for money). The anime later shows what the Black Lagoon company does for a living such as stealing famous paintings or being involved in kidnappings. \r\nLet's begin with the story.\r\nStory: 6 - What I've said above is pretty much what the storyline of Black Lagoon is all about. There's not much of a \"story\" at all, just a lot of action-packed scenes, cursing,drinking, and most of all: smoking. There are short side-stories, but this anime is not about the story: it's about the action.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - I don't watch anime because of what it looks like, but the art is very well done in this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 - Best opening theme song ever. Well, in my opinion. It's very catchy (I put it on my iPod) and it fits the anime quite well. The ending theme is very mournful and doesn't seem to fit the anime at all. \\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, it's one of the best I've heard so far, both Japanese and English. But I would have to say, and it's very rare, that the English dub is a lot better than the Japanese. Not many anime have English voice actors that are superior to the Japanese dub, but in this anime, it is. There's no wincing when characters talk or yell or cry; it all sounds natural.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 - I love EVERY character in this anime, even the antagonists! Sadly, though, the main character, Rock, is very wimpy and doesn't do any action at all besides this one (funny) part. If you're looking for an anime with a main character that does badass things, then this isn't for you. Even though Rock is a pussy, his character is likable and you can easily relate to him. He's the one who tries to talk things out as opposed to shooting a man in the face. \\n\r\nDutch is the captain of the Black Lagoon. He's only shown in a few episodes, along with his partner, Benny. Dutch is good with a gun (but not as good as Revy) and an awesome character. It's a pity his character isn't shown much as the anime progresses.\\n\r\nBenny is the \"brains\" of the Black Lagoon. He prefers to stay out of violent situations and instead stay at his computer.\\n\r\nAnd finally, probably the most liked character in the whole anime: Revy.\\n\r\nRevy is a badass, short-tempered bitch. She does like all of the action in the anime, AND the cursing. You do NOT want to piss her off. Seriously. She's not nicknamed \"Two Hands\" for nothing: she's a pro when it comes to shooting. She is a little sadistic and bitter (okay, a LOT), but her smart remarks and short temper are what makes the anime enjoyable and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that are so worth mentioning, but I do not want to spoil anything. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I watched both the first season and second in two days. I could've watched it non-stop, but had other things to do. This anime is so fun to watch because there's so much action in it. But if you're someone who is looking for an anime with a complex story, then you probably won't like Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - I would say the lack of a storyline was the only thing that prevented me from giving this anime a 10. It is an excellent anime, though.",

            "content": "First let me say that I don't much like the practice of rating shows by numbers.  I put down a score because I have to, but I'd prefer if you ignored that and read what I have to say and see if any of it resonates with you.\r\nThis show was refreshing to watch in a number of ways.  First, I think the ensemble cast is well designed; the characters are idiosyncratic and lifelike, and the group of them together forms a good balance of conflict and cooperation.  So many ensemble cast shows--both in anime and other television--quickly become stale as the sameaspects of the characters' relationships are rehashed over and over.  That doesn't happen in Black Lagoon, though it is only one season.  (There is The Second Barrage and the Roberta OVAs but the stylistic differences between each of these and the original series make me inclined to discuss each individually.)  The relationships between characters grow, conflicts arise and are overcome, all without wasting the viewer's time with interpersonal drama which would run contrary to the fast-paced, irreverent, action-packed atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an action show, and the action is good.  The animation is slick, the sequences are interesting, especially because it's not just a beat-em-up show.  Often the characters find themselves in a bleak situation and have to overcome their differences amid witty combat banter to triumph.  This is not a show that will use speed lines or pan the camera on still frames or use other techniques that cut down on the amount of actual animation and unique backgrounds that have to be made--it does the thing right.  \\n\\n\r\nOther than the at times hilarious dialogue during fights, though, there's nothing in the action sequences that makes this show stand out among other seinen action shows made with a decent budget in the few years.  What makes this show remarkable to me visually is the facial expressions.  Part of it is the characters' facial structure and the way their features are drawn.  In this respect, the character design is solid--not revolutionary, but not generic either.  It's good enough to carry some of the most dynamic, striking, and articulate facial expression I've ever seen in a cartoon.  It's not lifelike, it is caricatured in a very expressive way.  The same goes for the characters' body language and the way their clothing is drawn and shaded.  In combination with what I thought were stellar voice actors, the characters are vivid and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I enjoy the tone of this show.  It is casually violent, unabashedly irreverent, and cheerfully cynical.  It pokes fun at all manner of topics ranging from the Japanese business world to Hollywood to opera to other anime, even.  The dialogue is witty and profane, matching the slightly over the top world and characters.  This is a show full of moral ambiguities (such as the fact that the main characters are criminals) that are right in the viewer's face, but these issues aren't forcefully driven home.  The characters don't waste much time on moral question, and the viewer is left to do so or not as they please.  The core cast is a genuinely likable bunch of anti-heroes that don't fall into too many overdone anti-hero type clich\u00e9s and archetypes.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I found this show pleasingly iconoclastic and very entertaining.  It is episodic and driven largely by the setting and characters rather than a complex overarching plot, so if you're looking for something full of plot twists and core story, this show probably isn't a good choice.  But if you're looking for a show with good action sequences that's vividly animated and flippantly funny, give it a try.",

He became know as Rock.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the anime will be in accompany Rock, Revy and the Lagoon performing their jobs and engaging with many dangers in their missions in Roanapur.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're too young, you will be prompted to: There is a side of the new anime age that very few have the courage to show, and those who grew up watching Yu Yu Hakusho will remember with nostalgia: Violence debauched.\\n\\n\r\nIn an attempt to show a more naked, violent and gray reality, those animes made use of violence and debauchery to tell us the following: the world is violent, unjust and rotten. So, if you do not like it, fuck you. That's Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nWithout focusing too much showing the past of the characters to compose them, Black Lagoon bet more on the actions and dilemmas of each one present to develop them using Rock and Revy as counterpart. He, an ordinary guy, with nothing more, is now engaging with people living in this world without feelings for a long time, as Revy. It's under Rock's point of view that the anime shows how much the world is violent, and it does not kill you, it's you who dies.\\n\\n\r\nDo not wait here cuddly things, beautiful feelings or 'good overcome evil'. You must be prepared for all those cliches of the genre: the adrenaline, the destruction, the action and exaggeration. Revy and various characters doing everything so well with poses, smoking cigarettes or drinking and destroying everything with that aura of Chuck Norris (the main characters are never shot, but always kill 200 guys with a gun having 7 bullets in the clip).\\n\\n\r\nBut despite the cliches, we are presented with a great opening/ending and with a diversity of amazing characters that makes the show worthy. A round of applause for special women in the plot, as the former russian military Balalaika, the assassin with daggers Shenhua, the nun shooter Eda and the Venezuelan maid Roberta.\\n\\n\r\nViolent, mocking, exaggerated, Black Lagoon presents us with those scenes of explicit action without requiring a lot like those old classics that will never comeback. With an amazing range of great characters, this anime shows that the world is rotten, and that's the world we live in. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nThere's a lot of action.  It's all epic action full of testosterone and bad ass violence.  There's a plot too.  A dime-a-dozen salary man decides to break bad and join the criminal underworld of south east Asia.  It's a simple concept executed very well.  He decides to join the thug life but hasn't really fully committed to the lifestyle.  \r\nAnimation\r\nDid I mention there was a lot of action?  They were also animated very well.  The colors and look of it make it a feast for the eyes.  Being set in a tropical environment, you'd expect itto be colorful and it meets those expectations.  Pretty ironic considering how dark and bleek of an environment they live in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nReality check.  No matter how you look at it, each an every character is a horrible person.  There might be honor among thing but doesn't make them better people.  However, they all accept this and just go along with their lives.  My problem is with Rock.  He's just so condesending and holier-than-though it's annoying.  Everyone else is fine but Rock comes across as whiny and chases fairy-tales too much.  The other characters already accept that they're bad people.  Rock still tries clinging onto his humanity in an environment that has none.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime overall.  If you're looking for a great, fast-paced, ball-to-the wall, action anime then here you go.",

            "content": "This show is brilliant. In short, if you've watched Gurren Lagaan, watch Black Lagoon. If you haven't, watch a trailer for Gurren Lagaan, then watch Black Lagoon. \r\nThe story kicks off with a bang with a businessman, known from the second episode onwards and from here on as Rock, is kidnapped by a mercenary/pirate group known as Black Lagoon, which consists of Dutch, Benny and Revy. Black Lagoon are contracted to do mercenary-like missions, usually by either a russian mafia made of ex russian special forces headed by a woman called Balalaika (which is a kind of russian orchestra, I just found out) or aChinese Triad group. And that's it. Normally, something like this which is just action and violence wouldn't draw me in, stuff like Die Hard, Rambo, Taken, films like that don't interest me, wonton violence doesn't draw me, but Black Lagoon gains merit because of Revy, Dutch, Benny, the chinese triad boss and two characters, an irishman and chinese woman, in the final episode. They are the best part of this show.\\n\r\nAnd why, you may ask? They are simply bad-ass. Dutch, Revy and the triad boss all know how to use a gun, and the camera angles and music just make them seem a one-man army. Words just can't describe the bad-assery these characters emit. However, Revy is above Dutch and the triad boss slightly. She is basically Black Lagoons Yoko Litner (search her up if you don'tknow her!) Sarch Revy in deviantart, you'll see what I mean.\\n\r\nNow, the only bad parts of the show, the Garcia arc and Rock. The Garcia arc basically was the son of a tycoon was kidnapped, these kidnappers were taken over by Black Lagoon, and Garcia was used as a bargaining chip. The thing was, despite Garcias maid being Revy's nemesis (and so you can imagine a fight scne between them, in fact it's probably on youtube. Oh, yeah, garcias maid is an ex-guerilla mercenary), after 7 or so episodes of high-octane action, this arc was SO boring. And Garcia is, personally, one of the most hate-able characters because he is a winy, little kid. Sure, he's been kidnapped, but he says that doesn't fase him, so he's just winy for NO REASON. The other problem is Rock, as a businessman his role was to wipe his boss' ass, and as part of Black Lagoon he's just as unimportant. I wish another Dutch or Revy character would've replaced him\\n\r\nOK, to wrap this up quick, the art is beautiful, both the in-show animation and the opening and ending, and, speaking of the opening and ending, the music goes hand-in-hand with it, and the opening of Black Lagoon, along with Mirai Nikki to name one a very few, is one of my favourites.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering all this, it gives me pleasure to give Black Lagoon a brilliant 8/10, just shy of 9 because of Rock and the Garcia arc. Even if, like me, you're not much of an action/violence person, watch this for the characters!",

            "content": "[This is a review for both the seasons.]\r\nArguably the greatest action anime ever made,Black lagoon is the very definition of badassery.Now it's very hard to review this show because of the fact it's nothing special as an anime.It's story is almost non-existent but it's one of the most entertaining experience anime has to offer.\r\nBlack Lagoon is about a group of mercenary called the Lagoon company living in the criminal shithole known as Roanapur.Okajima is an average japanese person who gets caught with the lagoon company's affair and after being betrayed by his company decided to join them.Honestly that's about it.Just as I've said before thestory is non-existent.Although there are 2 story arcs that shines through.The Incest twin sibling arc and the final arc of Washimine clan.On to the positive note,Black Lagoon has some of the most enjoyable and memorable cast I've seen in an anime.This anime absolutely thrives on it's characters.The main cast includes the Mr.Nice Guy Okajima(rock),The Black Muscle Man Dutch,The Computer Genius Benny and of course the most badass chick in the galaxy Revy the Two Hand.Even outside the main cast the supporting casts are just as memorable and enjoyable as the main one.Balalaika is one of them and she has a very unique and well rounded personality,making her one of the most memorable character in the anime.Not only the people who work as really good cast,this anime uses object or an entire location as it's character as well.Kind of like,The Shining did with the elevator.It creates a very unique and well set up crime underworld called Roanapur.Which serves almost as a character part of this anime.Hoestly,Roanapur might be the best city set up in any anime.Black Lagoon is a very stylistic anime which depends on it's characters.The story just isn't there.So,the characters needed to be spot on and they striked gold on that department.It is hugely considered one of the best action anime ever mad if not the best.Honestly,the standard of action in this series is yet to be matched by any other anime.The action is total in your face badassery.This series is filled with tons of action and blowing shit up.Literally,this series blows up just about everything it sees.If you don't wanna watch a series that is only about action and nothing more than it's not for you.The sound track for the most part isn't anything special but it does it's job.The opening and ending however were great.The ending specially is very well used.My favorite moment in the entire series is the end to the twin incest sibling arc.After that story ends,the show changes it's ending song into a very peaceful track and we see the girl walking beside the shore and meeting with the boy in the end of the darkness.The writer changed their ending song and the video to add a perfect ending to that story arc.I know most of the viewers will never notice it but it's the subtle things that makes this series special.This series has surprising amount of subtle character weighting.The animation is extremely well done.Madhouse have done an excellent job.\\n\r\nIn the end,Black Lagoon is an extremely well done action series.It is filled with cliches and tropes and the story does nothing but create endless amount of chances only to have action and explosions.But that kind of works for this series.You don't always need a great story as long as you have incredible amount of badass characters and action to support your show.",

Honestly, the dub voices are so varied and unique that I find myself revisiting it constantly, standouts are: Revy, Balalaika, Shenhua & Eda. Forget your standard action sequences, this is Studio Madhouse and they know action and they've only improved through the years, but seeing where it fully kicked into overdrive is something else. The music is definitely one of the other highlights to the show, from the upbeat pumped up opening to the calmer tranquil moments, Edison manages to balance the whole shebang. Although this may be a biased review as itwas the second anime I ever watched, it's a DEFINITE watch!",

In short, it's a different beast.  Black Lagoon posits a shadow world of unrestrained vice, where violence is not just essential for survival, but essential for being.  (Dig that title--it's the abyss staring back at us.)  Like Fight Club, Black Lagoon finds existential meaning in violence, and it finds that meaning with great frequency and greatpower.  One never feels pity, sympathy or hollow righteousness in the characters' actions, because there's a necessity to them; it's an oddly liberating feeling not to have to judge homicidal maniacs too harshly.  The characters have created their own morality, and we're just visiting.  It's a perspective that lends Black Lagoon its unique dramatic power, and it's what makes it a heady action experience unlike any other.",

            "content": "As soon as you pop in the disc and watch Black Lagoon\u2019s opening melody of flashy snippets of violence and broken English, one can\u2019t help but feeling this is going to be another mindless shooter anime. However, with its grimy atmosphere, top notch writing, and characters which completely drench with awesome, Black Lagoon will not let itself be written off.\r\nRevy herself basically becomes the poster girl of the series, whose profanity ridden, confident attitude is a very nice change of pace from the damsel in distress/ harem character archetype. When she\u2019s first introduced, one can\u2019t help but feel that there\u2019s not much depth to hergun toting antics. However, as the series progresses and her damaged past reveals itself, it creates a great deal of empathy and depth to a character who just appeared to be a violent bitch. This usually reveals itself through various encounters with Rock, whose suburban and sheltered personality completely contrasts that of Revy. This makes for some very interesting conversations, delving into issues such as survival, existentialism, and environmental perspective. This is when the English dub really shines, pulling no punches when it comes to profanity, and having the voice actors really giving it their all. Needless to say, the script is written incredibly well, with interesting dialogue and unique character development.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the action scenes, this is one part of the series where it\u2019s having a little bit of an identity crisis. It just can\u2019t seem to decide whether it wants over the top shoot \u2018em up (battling with a terminator-esque maid), or realistic gunplay (commandeer defenseless cargo ship). Still, it manages to have more than enough action for any adrenaline junkie without it being absolutely ridiculous. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t gore, however. There is more than enough execution shooting, snitch torturing, and cold blood murdering to go around. Just don\u2019t expect overly flashy scenes to be the staple of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation differs as well, with some shots being absolutely gorgeous and detailed and some seeming almost completely static. It never becomes distracting, but it becomes easy to notice the transition after a beautifully rendered gunfight. There is some CG thrown in as well, and works well in the few instances that it pops up (usually with gun close-ups and shell casings). As a whole, it looks pretty damn good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile not ground-breaking, with its coarse-language, graphic violence, and downright awesome characters, Black Lagoon is certainly something to check out for anyone who wants an action anime with a realistic and gritty atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nFor more reviews on anime, music, and everything inbetween, feel free to visit http://everythingfornobody.blogspot.com/",

Black Lagoon is a anime about a mercenary company that takes on a very unlikely new member and their exploits in the southeast Asia seas. After finally accepting their new partner the team continues work as usual which is anything but usual from stealing, kidnapping, being framed and running for their life.\r\nThe story is very loose and open ended giving the possibly of going anywhere they want. It's unique in that the story you'll be paying attention to isn't necessarily what the Lagoon Company is doing buthow they interact with each other over time. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very sharp and well done, while yes you do get the occasional reused clip there's not many anime's that don't do that. The opening theme is very good at setting the tone off the bat and while there's not much in show music what little there might be is well placed and not overused. The character's are rich and unique. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've looking for a diverse cast of character's this anime will satisfy that very need. From little qwerks to the way they talk, there is a lot to learn about each character as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\nIt's obviously a action packed anime so if you're into gun fights, explosions, car and boat chases basically anything that could get your heart beating and drop your jaw it's in here. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much more other than this anime is well worth the watch. The only warning I can give is to stay away if you are not fond of foul language, this anime is full of it.",

I LOVE this anime because the female lead has been through a rough past and the way her character develops through the anime is quite amazing to watch! \r\nNot to mention the defenseless sidekick \"rock\" who is another great character and he like voices out the opinions and explains the situation and the way it unfolds. There was an initial friction between revy and rock but they make a great partnership. Honestly i wish more people are watching this anime ugh, itsso frigging good GODDAMN IT UGH I WISH THEY'D MAKE MORE SERIES AND OVAS SOON! \\n\r\nIm currently on s2 and i have 1 ova series and the specials to catch up to T_T I DONT WANT IT TO END!!!! Also another great thing is that the episode leads on and you're left wondering how theyre going to sort this mess out and its actually pretty interesting and the by the time i realised it, i finished the first series?!?!?! SIMPLY FANTASTIC JFC",

            "content": "Black Lagoon was really the first of the fringe-y mercenary genre of anime. Or at least, the first to get it right. Combining a likable cast of pirates with an intriguing backdrop and some of the best bang-up fighting you can get, Black Lagoon is a highly watchable, highly entertaining anime.\r\nPros\r\n1) Great Cast-Anime like Black Lagoon tend to treat female characters as either useless or tits with guns. In comparable titles like Jormungand and Phantom, many of the female characters are treated as nothing more than bewbs. While Revy is wearing revealing clothing, she maintains a very unfemale-like character throughout the series and fits rightin with the boys. She has a lot of things going on in her head and very little of her background is known, lending a certain air of mystery. Her relationship with Rock is also very hard to pinpoint. While there might be a tiny bud of something akin to romance, we\u2019re not led to believe either way because the characters hide it so well. The closest we get is sharing the light on the butt of a cigarette, and the emphasis on this is actually very memorable and thought provoking, bringing the audience to question the characters fighting as maybe something more.\\n\\n\r\nRevy is such a great character to get to know and while she can be an overbearing bitch and a complete psychopath, the question of how a person can become like her is in the air and the series seems to want to explore that concept, though Revy\u2019s character won\u2019t let any progress go forward. The fact that Rock is the only character who seems to be able to break into her shell reveals a lot about Rock as a person, as well as his relationship with Revy. He cares about her more than anyone ever has, and neither of them seems able to realize it.\\n\\n\r\nRock himself is a really good character. Usually the outcast is the protagonist who gets shit on and that\u2019s no different in Black Lagoon. But Rock is actually useful and while he\u2019s not the greatest asset to the team, he manages to get them out of some binds. He\u2019s the more human character of the group, disturbed by the killings and especially disturbed by the team taking charge of a kidnapped kid. He\u2019s there to add tension and be a polar opposite, but he doesn\u2019t become so forcefully different that it\u2019s painful to watch. He\u2019s part of this new world, but he\u2019s also civil. A gentleman pirate if you may.\\n\\n\r\nDutch is the apparent leader, though he\u2019s not given a lot of thought. He\u2019s intelligent at times, bloodthirsty at others, but he also seems to hold some compassion. He\u2019s a more violent version of Rock. Benny meanwhile is just there. He\u2019s never given much screen time and serves as the tech guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 emphasis is on Revy and Rock. Halfway through it gives Revy time to especially shine when facing the maid killer Roberta, another tragic anti-hero. Once again, the series treats her as a total badass. The maid outfit gives the outward appearance of prissiness but inside, she\u2019s a murderer, a tragic murderer assimilating into the real world. The series does the same thing with Hotel Moscow\u2019s Balalaika, who is totally badass. It\u2019s nice to see a series where no female character is totally useless and all are\u2026flat out scary.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire cast is well thought out, the bad guys are cool. It\u2019s just a really well thought out series of characters.\\n\\n\r\n2) Stupidity With Limits-Black Lagoon has its dumb moments. The Roberta section is long-winded and completely ridiculous, but at the same time, it\u2019s so freaking cool you don\u2019t care. There are some side characters introduced later on in the series who serve as comic relief, but they all have a purpose and some of the ridiculous things that happen (a European getaway driver smoking pot and driving through the DMZ) are outright hilarious. But the series limits it\u2019s stupidity. There are tons of really great, humorous moments, but not enough to be overbearing. It balances a dark, nihilistic viewpoint and depressing characters with a sense of hilarity. And being able to balance those is really tricky. Look at Jormungand. No balance whatsoever. It has tons of serious moments then a random comedy moment that throws off the audience. Black Lagoon balances it; and damn well.\\n\\n\r\n3) Playing with the Real World-Black Lagoon manages to be a thriller in the real world without using tons of fake places and creating fake tensions. The island of Roanuper is a great idea, a place where all the lowest of the low come together. The Russian mob, the Triads, and random mercenaries all converge here. The series takes place in the Pacific Ocean and uses places in the Philippines and some random islands as the setting. This setting is both beautiful and enjoyable. Scenes of island jungle and beautiful waters keep the show watchable and makes you feel like you\u2019re on a vacation. By playing with real life organizations and throwing in tons of references and historical things, it gives it a sense of realism; almost akin to a Hollywood movie. By doing all these things, the series comes across as so much more enjoyable. Many comics, movies, and anime would rather create tensions and create countries to have these tensions. Black Lagoon knows how to manage the real world with the cartoon world.\\n\\n\r\n4) Killing for Killing\u2019s Sake-The series\u2019 isn\u2019t a ho-hum shoot \u2018em up akin to The Expendables or Commando. It has substance. As I said before, Revy is plagued with all kinds of problems, so is Roberta. The killing and fighting in the series can sometimes be a little over the top and violent but there\u2019s a theme running underneath about why these people kill and what it all means. The series is not completely existential and doesn\u2019t ramble on, but it does acknowledge that there is a certain shame to killing and there are so many circumstances that turn a person into a Revy. Revy is a complete badass on the outside, but on the inside we know she\u2019s an emotional wreck, hiding all kinds of secrets with the blood of her enemies. It\u2019s that kind of writing that creates compelling characters and reason to keep watching. Killers are boring to watch when written as murder machines. The first action scene is cool, the second meh, the third is when an audience wants to walk away. A killer needs a reason to kill. In Commando it was the taking of his daughter. In the Expendables it was about money. But that\u2019s not good enough. They need a reason to kill, they need a reason they can kill, and they need regret. Human characteristics like this help the audience not only sympathize with the character, but also grow to realize why he or she kills. The series delves into these ideas subtly while overtly showing the tragedy that comes about killing, especially in the Roberta story arc. While you may not have thought much about it, there was still a sense of loss of innocence in Roberta. She became a soldier, she gave it all up, she tried to create a new life for herself and be a normal girl, but wound up being thrown right back into killing all over again. There is more to the series than a bunch of badass\u2019s shooting at each other. And that is what makes Black Lagoon different from all its contemporaries.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n1) Nazi Arc-While the Nazi arc was a pretty good throwback to old style exploration movies and Clive Cussler novels, it broke up the story with lots of flashbacks to the submarine\u2019s crew. This was the original reason I quit the series; it just broke things up too much. I can appreciate the attempt to tell a story but the series never relies on flashbacks to tell story again and the story of what happened in the sub is told by Revy very briefly. The entire flashback seems pointless and pads the story out rather than provide any sort of useful content. Some may have enjoyed this arc but I felt it was the weakest in the first season.\\n\\n\r\n2) Opening-The opening sequence is bad. The music isn\u2019t bad but the damn lyrics are so awful I had to skip the opening every time just to keep from laughing. The opening is supposed to be kind of serious and lead you into this hopeless world of killing and finding morality but it instead is broken Engrish with pointless cursing and questionable lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is definitely one of the best adult anime out there. It combines all sorts of good stuff to create a compellingly watchable and entertaining feast. While the Nazi arc failed to deliver much, the rest of the series is a great piece of character development on the part of Revy and Rock while it\u2019s also a beautiful and well written story about a ragtag group of pirates and all their crazy adventures. It\u2019s sometimes off-the-wall, but balances that with ideas on morality and a certain sense of realism many anime lack. It\u2019s fantastic stuff and a must watch.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an action packed thrill ride without a filter.  The action scenes are animated wonderfully and there are very few times when the animation dips under its high standards.  \r\nThe characters are well developed and interesting.  Personally I enjoyed the character that was Balalaika the Russian mafia leader. The show itself is mainly in the episodic format, but with the same characters.  There are a few 2 and 3 episode arcs but there really is no overarching story line.  \r\nEpisodes are hit or miss, with some being amazing, others being creepy as hell and some just kind offalling short.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music was not to my liking, but that was purely based on personal taste.  The music is often quite atmospheric and sets the tone before and during scenes.\\n\\n\r\n                                                  Note:\\n\r\nIf you find that you like the show and are not satisfied with the final arc in the second season, I highly recommend the four part OVA: Roberta's blood trail.  I feel it acts as a better ending to the series than the final arc.\\n\\n\r\nBasic Idea:  We follow the exploits of the Lagoon company, a black market transportation and guns for hire company (close to modern day pirates...kinda).  We see things through the eyes of our main protagonist Rock, a Japanese businessman who is new to this life of action.",

            "content": "Welcome to the city of Roanipur in South-East Asia where the show if predominately based. Be prepared to be hyped by the epic OP and badass duel wielding Two-Hands Revy and when he gets screen time Mr. Chang. Now before I get into the anime WARNING THIS IS A REVIEW OF ALL OF BLACK LAGOON. So this includes Black Lagoon, Black Lagoon: Second Barrage and Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail.\r\nStory (9/10) Great\r\nThe story revolves around the Lagoon Company a transportation company that sometimes do illegal jobs for clients. The story revolves around Lagoon Company members Rock and Revy and the illegal jobs which the undertakesuch as aiding in a kidnapping, fighting Nazi's and hunting down those who are causing trouble for the syndicates of Roanipur in particular Hotel Moscow a group consisting solely of ex-soviet special forces and the Triad who my favourite character Mr. Chang is apart of.\\n\\n\r\nThe series consist of small arc each resembling a different job the Lagoon Company undertook. By a small arc I mean each arc is only 3-5 episodes. My personal favourite being Roberta's Blood Trail as revolves around Roberta's rampage through Roanipur as a Yagami Light vs L type battle between Mr. Chang and Rock. As an overall I was quite satisfied with the story with its mixed of epic action and large number crazy and dangerous women in Roanipur.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) Very Good \\n\r\nThe animation was overall very good, very consistent but didn't standout that much but that being said it was still quite good and isn't by any means unappealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\r\nThe sound was exceptional the music was amazing in particular the OP which got you hyped up for the episode to follow which never disappointed me. Even the Ending OST was very good it didn't have the hype factor which the OP had but it was very eerie and helped show that a lot of epic action which the OP shows but there is also dark psychological side to it as well. The voice acting was solid in both the sub and the dub though I rate sub slightly higher than the dub. There was one scene though which the sound let itself down with and that one the one time they tried to do a slow motion scene when Mr. Chang is giving them a job is the 9th or 10th episode. this being the main reason why it didn't score a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon has a great group of characters. The Lagoon Company consist of 4 members the leader Dutch a decent strategist who knows how to be a badass with a gun when he needs to. Benny the least talked about lagoon member, he is the technical genius of the group not of any help with a gun though. Revy the destructive factor of the group, doing most of the fighting in the group. Being the closest person to rock she gets more screen time than Dutch or Benny and plays as Rocks romantic partner. Sort of. Not really. Revy and Rock are partners. Rock being the brains and Revy being the brawn. Rock who is the protagonist of the show is a former Japanese businessman turned Lagoon Company Sailor. Like Benny he is of no use terms of actual fighting but the most strategic genius of the Lagoon Company and Top 5 in all of Roanipur. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many secondary characters like the twins, the people at the ripoff church, the Lovelace family, Hotel Moscow, the Triad and many more minor characters who you don't need to know about. I'll talk about one secondary character Mr. Chang the head of the Triad. I've said his name a couple of times earlier and that's because he is in my opinion the most powerful and dangerous character in all of Roanipur. Being just as good a fighter as Revy if not better and having the strategic mind similar to that of Rock. He ticks all the boxes needed to make it big in Roanipur and by the end of the series we find out that this ex-cop runs the show in Roanipur. Mr. Chang is that good of a character he deserved more screen than he got and an his own arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) Outstanding \\n\r\nThis series was everything that I wanted in an anime it was action-pact, gory at times, had mental battles as well and had exceptional characters. This anime leaving me wanting more. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes the action genre. If you're looking for other anime similar to this I would recommend Gangsta, it's not as good as Black Lagoon but still will satisfy your action hunger.",

You have a ship, the captain is a wise and strong mechanic-type bald older man and you have a very skilled stubborn not-so-young youngster with a sad background, they take on dangerous and illegal jobs... but it ends there.\r\nThere is nothing special about Black Lagoon plot or characters andthey are very boring. I'm not saying it's all bad, but it's average at best. The story leads nowhere, there is no main plot being connected, no sense of purpose, objective or whatsoever, I just hope the last two episodes connects into something bigger in the next season but I don't really feel like watching it - although I know I will do sooner or later.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is horrible.

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - The art for this nyanime blew me away the first time I saw it, nyan.  Instead of trying to make all the characters look purrfect the art took a more realistic style, nyan.  All of the characters had a distinctly different look to each other, nyan.  Usually i don't get hyped over nyanamation but it was awesome for this nyanime, nyan.  I can happily give a 9 for art becauseof the destination between characters and how awesome the nyanamation was, nyan.\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound - I can listen to the whole OST and that hasn't happened to me in a long time, nyan.  Every part of this snyandtrack did what it was support to do: it boosted the story whenever it was needed and at times it even improved parts of the story, nyan.  The intro was awesome but I didn't dig the ending as much, nyan.  That being said, if you don't wanna listen to the ending then you can just skip it, nyan.  The soundtrack was purrfect so it gets a purrfect 10, nyan.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character-   Like I said, the characters in Black Lagoon are all unique and kick ass, nyan.  They all have different personalities and that gives the show a lot of variety to make scenes off of, nyan.  It goes into the backnyans of some of the characters and it legitimizes the characters so you have no doubt about why the character are the way they are, nyan.  The characters are unique and have very ecstatic, different personalities and that is why I give the characters a 10, nyan.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - The story pretty much consisted of the Lagoon compnyany going around and completing jobs but I would argue that the story is about something other than that, nyan.  I would argue that the story is actually about rock, the main character, finding what role he plays in the messed-up port city of Roanapur, nyan.  So in other words I can't give a perfect score on the story until Rock finds his purpose, nyan.  Story is an 8, nyan.\\n\\n\r\n5.Enjnyanment - I enjoyed this nyanime thoroughly but I can't get over the fact that Rock didn't know what his purpose was, nyan.  Other than that fact I enjnyaned every second of the show, nyan.  I give enjnyanment an 8 because i enjoyed it but some of the story was lacking, though it be not much, nyan.\\n\\n\r\n This nyanime is an overall 8\\n\\n\r\n*I will also recommend that this nyanime is only watched by a matured audience.\\n\\n\r\nCaution:\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has very intense gore.\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has dark subject matter.",

            "content": "Story - 8\r\nThe story in Black Lagoon is about a group of modern day pirates called the Lagoon company (Dutch, Revy, Benny, and Rock) and the misfit citizens of the city of Roanapur, known for its violence and criminal enterprises. The plot line is mostly episodic in nature depending on the specific \u201cjob\u201d the Lagoon crew takes on for the day. Although the story is mainly episodic in nature, there are mini arcs throughout seasons 1 & 2, that encompass 3-5 episodes at a time. The story is honestly unique in that you don\u2019t find one like it very often, and it stands out inits own right. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nI thought the characters and scenery were a good fit for the story and mood. Action sequences were smooth, and blended well together. Character art changed throughout seasons 1&2, but not noticeable enough to effect my enjoyment or opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version of this anime, and I must say, Black Lagoon has one of the best dubs of all time. I would recommend that everyone watch the dubbed version because the translation and accents not only enhances the characters, but it contributes to the overall enjoyment. The only reason I gave it a 9 was because I wasn\u2019t a fan of the opening or endings of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of the anime, and it would not be the same without them. Many of the characters\u2019 background stories are touched on, even briefly, including secondary characters, which allows the viewer to understand their history, motives, and the reasons behind their actions in the present day. Character development occurs only for the two main characters, Rock and Revy, which is appropriate for the story. Rock goes from a Japanese businessman who came from a sheltered, safe, office environment to being thrown into a violent life-and-death career as a calculated negotiator for the Lagoon crew. Rock starts off as a close minded person, who is very rigid in his views of morality, and often pushes those views onto the individuals who go against his moral views. However, after coming to understand the reasons behind the actions of others that go against his moral code, he also starts to reflect on his old life and strives to change. Revy starts off as being impulsive and closed minded in her own way, often using her past as an excuse for her violent and thuggish behaviors. She threatens Rock many times when she feels he is judging her unfairly, and threatens his life frequently. However, Rock starts to grow on her, and even though she never acknowledges it, he is able to provide her with balance and serves somewhat as her conscience for her to think before she acts. Secondary characters are just as loveable, including the badass nun, Eda, of the Rip Off Church, the cool and smooth ruler of Roanapur, Mr. Chang of the Triad, and the cold, cunning, Balalika of Hotel Moscow. Rock is able to make an impression of everyone, and becomes an individual they are able to respect. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThe reason I gave enjoyment a 10 was based on how many times I\u2019ve rewatched his anime, which is 4 times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite animes of all time, and any show I can watch over and over again only to love it even more deserves a 10 in my book. \\n\\n",

            "content": "So, for my 50th review I wanted to do something classic. Something majestic and refined. Something that stands as a fine example of art and story telling not just within the Anime world, but the world of art as well. But, that idea quickly faded as I went with the Anime equivalent of a massive cheeseburger- Studio Madhouse's \"Black Lagoon\".  \r\nForget art. Forget storytelling. Forget all the higher standards that Anime often claims to hold itself to compared to Western products, this is a piece of delicious junk food and made to be mindlessly  entertaining. A show about 4 anti-heroes with guns andtheir own specialties trying to make a buck and facing the standard bunch of bad guys with guns each packaged with their own gimmick. From pirates, to Neo Nazis, to mobsters, militant guerrillas, and even the terminator maid- it's a fun ride that feels like \"Cowboy Bebop\" meets \"The Expendables\".\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect I especially enjoyed about this show was the opening and closing music. The show starts with a stylish montage of color, pictures of the cast, and violence all set to a catchy tune called \"Red Fraction\" by MELL. It gets you pumped up for the bullet-ridden adventure to come and when the episode ends, we're treated to a slow, almost mournful piece called \"Don't Look Behind\" by EDISON featuring the footprints a slow walk down the beach with the evidence of carnage scattered along the way. It's the first show where I didn't skip the credits in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nPurists may argue with me when it comes to the Sub vs. Dub battle, but I really liked the English dub better than the Japanese cast here. The overused voice that is Brad Swaile as Rock does leave some room for improvement, the performances by Dean Redman as Dutch (in to date his ONLY Anime role) and especially Mar\u00ffke Hendrikse as Revy help bring this show to life. An honorable mention goes to Patricia Drake's perfect casting as Balalaika, too. It always helps when you can hear what a voice will sound like without a character opening their mouth and she fits like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nSure, I'm an American who loves shoot 'em ups and 'splosions, but rarely do you get a show that is this level of comfort food enjoyable in Anime while still giving you memorable and colorful characters. This Anime seems destined to be adapted into a Hollywood screenplay, but it's still going to be most enjoyable in it's animated form. The show is a blast. As binge worthy as french fries, I can't wait for \"The Second Barrage\"! Just kick back and enjoy the show, a friendly reminder that Anime can still just be fun like when you were a kid. 7.5/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "Finally, it's been SO long since I wrote a review. So let's start this comeback with the Crime/Action/Black Comedy bullet hell, Black Lagoon.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nYou can't tell because of the eight, but this is the weakest part of the anime. Let's say, you were to split an arc into three. The first is slow and sluggish, and throws some decent amount of exposition. The second part is half the first one, and the second part of it is where they build up the action. And the third part is where the action is, aka the best part. That is basically the entire series. I haveto admit, the story was pretty good, if not for the pattern I mentioned earlier. Honestly, the story does a pretty good job when it comes to character development and showing the dark gritty side of Roanapur, I mean, after all it IS a Crime anime, so I guess that fits well. But if ther's one thing I can clarify, two words-\\n\r\nGUN PORN. As you can tell from said two words, the series glorifies guns, and boy OH BOY, they glorify to the nth degree!\\n\r\nI guess another has to be the narration. The main protagonist does a real good job of describing the world around him in a pretty well-done fashion, like your listening to someone reading a book. Not that modern anime does this anymore...SEE, THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nI have to give it a solid A okay. The environment is very breath-taking, portraying the lush scenery, the deep seas, and the bloody glory of someone's head getting blown up, it does that job pretty well. Roanapur is no stranger to this treatment, by day, it looks like your regular run of the mill market place, with occasional gunshots heard in the distant background. By night, the market closes and the brothels light up to show it's true colors. And did I mention the guns, MAN you gotta love those smooth, sleek details. You can tell from the attention to detail alone, that these people, REALLY love their guns.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nIf you make a trailer, make sure that whatever you show in the trailer is well worth , well executed and well delivered. In the early promotion trailer, Mel's 'Red fraction' was played in the background. No surprise when they made it into an opening. It was awesome, and definitely got you ready for the chaos that will ensue. Even going far as telling the inner workings of Revy's mind. However, the first part of the arc, might bog down that euphoria. The ending was pretty solid. Nothing beats ending an episode like playing some slow melancholic music and then end on a rocking note. That ED I mentioned, was 'Never look back' by EDISON.\\n\r\nNow for this review, I watched it dubbed. And let me tell you, it was BEAUTIFUL! We have Brad Swaile did a really solid job of voice casting as Rock, the main protagonist, who is thrown into the gritty world of crime, of his free will. The same goes for Maryke Hendrikse, who voiced the badass Revy, complete with 'FUNKY FRESH' swears and profanity. but the gold medal goes to Dean Redman as Dutch. DAAAAMN SON! That voice, that authenticity, this is THE ideal voice of a mercenary who will KICK your ass! I mean, we are looking at a Hollywood actor who trained in martial arts and weaponry, thus adding to the authenticity. DAAMN! I haven't listened to a dub this good since 'Cowboy Bebop'. Speaking of which....\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I love about this series, it's the characters. If you liked how the characters were executed in 'Cowboy Bebop', then you'll like the crew of the Lagoon Co. There's Rock, the new recruit of the Lagoon Co., who joined of his own free will, like I mentioned earlier. He is basically the Devil's Advocate of the series, joining the dark side to see their side of the argument, and is loving it! We also have Benny the hacker, whose job is to navigate and crack codes, Dutch, the cool black guy (I'm Sorry, if I insulted any African-American by saying the word black), and then there's Revy. Revy, Revy, Revy. This HAS to be the BEST character in my opinion. She is the foul-mouthed, gun-toting, ass-kicking, Bullet Hell incarnate that acts as the Nuke of the Lagoon Co. Nowhere else will you find a female character portrayed so well in any anime, EVER! The rest of the cast NEVER gets side-tracked. From the leader of Hotel Moscow, Balalaika, to the 'Maid-at-arms' Roberta. Everyone has their time to shine and show their character, no matter how little the time may be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nYOU DARE ASK ME, if I enjoyed this anime? FUCK YEAH, I did!!! The lush scenery, the bloody showdowns, and raining bullets should be enough to tell you, HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS SHOW. Honestly though, this may get 9, but the second season, 'Second Barrage' gets a solid 10. Something tells me that the studio behind the series knew of the weaknesses and leveled up the awesome factor to the 1000*nth dimensional degree.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.25/10\\n\r\nDo I recommend 'Black Lagoon'? HELL YES. Now if you can excuse me, I have to make a phone call.\\n\r\n*********************************************************************************\\n\r\nMe - Yes, is this Lagoon Co.? Hotel Moscow? Oh, looks like I got the wrong number.\\n\\n\r\n- Are you, by chance, looking for someone to deal with your rival problems?\\n\\n\r\n- Oh, don't worry, I'm a professional. I can be a demolition expert as a cover.\\n\\n\r\n- Let's just say, I have a high affinity for guns and explosions.\\n\\n\r\n- Yes, THAT Tim.",

The series is a solid action, and mainly that. The story is fun and entertaining like a movie you can sit and watch 4 or 5 eps without being bored.Overall one of my favorites(not that that counts).",

While I like the female characters that are portray with strong characteristics and think for themselves (I despise them being used as fanservice or their sex appeal used as the \"plot). This anime shows a different aspect, in which many of the them are just as brutal or even worse than the men in theseries.\\n\\n\r\nNote if you watch the dubbed one which more accurately depicts this anime, there will be a lot of non-stop cussing, children will not be spared and the shade of grey area is made even more grey where all sorts of heinous acts occur and its hard to pinpoint who to blame whether its the character for choosing that path or the environment which molded this way. While I was not as emotionally attached to this as other anime, I have my respect for it since it portrays an aspect of life despite how grime it appears.",

Rock to me, he just tags along with Revy. I mean Revy means two-hands, am I correct?\r\nI really just loved to see more badass females which really makes me enjoy watching this anime.\r\nThe anime surely reminds me of Counter-Strike Game whereby the terrorists vs counter-terrorists. The anime alsoconsists of rescuing hostages just like in Counter-Strike whereby the Counter-terrorists rescue hostages from the Terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you that don't know. I used to play Counter-Strike when I was 10 and I really did enjoy playing it.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who want to see badass female characters, do check this anime out. However, if you cannot stand violence and language profanity, I suggest you do not watch it. Nevertheless, I will recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI give it an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first- some of the voice actors/actresses voices were just annoying. They just didn't do that little \"click\" for me. However, it was only some of them- most of them minor characters that only appeared in one or two episodes, never to be heard of again. I also can't stand Garcia. Are you familiar with Vampire Knight? He's kind of like Yuki, and his maid Roberta is kind of like Kaname. Roberta herself is an okay character with a little bit of developement so far, but Garcia. . . he's just the epitome of annoying,and he's so emotional for no reason as far as I can tell. It's like the creators tried to make him like Ciel Phantomhive but failed. Also, they had some good potential ideas for a cliff hanger at the end of each episode, but most of them didn't leave me feeling as hyped up as it shoud've- mostly because of how insensate it was and how the ending song turned out kind of. . . plain, to be honest. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good either.\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon also has lots of cursing and dirty talk, which may also be a downer for some people, but personally, when it's used right (and it is, in my opinion) it's something that that makes me enjoy the anime/manga even more. The \"inappropiate language\" really sets the mood- it can make you laugh, get riled up, or pissed off. One thing to note is that despite the jokes, there are some pretty serious badass scenes, so don't you worry- Black Lagoon isn't some kind of slice of life comedy.\\n\r\n However, that's all the bad things I have to point out- now let's get along with the good aspects of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part might be the sound, despite all the things I just mentioned. While some of the characters just sounded terrible and the cliffhangers weren't really cliffhangers, Revy and Dutch sounded perfect, as well as most of the other characters. Also, the background noise is great- for instance, the fighting scenes, the driving scenes, all of it. I also loved the art- I was stuck between deciding which I liked more. The detail in the surroundings is like a work of art by itself, and as for the character designs, weapons, and etc, I'd say everything was beyond what I was expecting. To be honest, I didn't really like the art from what I saw on the cover- but then I actually saw it in action, and I fell in love. The characters themselves were also great, although some of them still lacked development. I had to make up my own stories for what caused them to do what they did, although I don't really mind doing that. However, Rock, being the main character and all, came along great, and the more I get to know Revy, the better she gets. That goes for most of the other characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as entertaining as it is, isn't really original- however, the way it was brought out was what made Black Lagoon shine. A guy is picked up by a group of people who occasionally brush against the wrong side of the law just to get some food on the table. Nothing special. But then you add in the multiple little arcs that lasts one or two episodes that are all mostly unique and   different and boom, we got ourselves a great plot goin' on. It's kind of like Jormungand- it takes an original plot with action and adventure. . . then twists it like pretzel dough, never forgetting to add the desired toppings. \\n\r\nThe only thing knocking Black Lagoon down from a ten to a nine in terms of enjoyment is the things mentioned way above, but really, Black Lagoon's still worth rewatching. . . although i'll be skipping the episodes with Garcia in it. \\n",

            "content": "Shoot 'em up bang bang is best way for me to describe the theme of this series. I have a hard time digging around to find some gun-slinging anime that I can enjoy. My example of one would be Cowboy Bebop and the like.\r\nNow in terms of the story...the series is pretty episodic but it does seem to progress in the manner that they do recollect to previous events. It's not like they have one episode and everything resets in a different environment with no recollection of the past...and it does build on itself in a way but not in the manner that a seriousplot would. There ARE arcs here and there so that's about to closest thing to an actual plot/story that you get. Shows with solid plots would be like Elfen Lied or CGeass, etc. It may not share the same depth but BL is still incredibly enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the crew we have Dutch, the head of the crew and he treats his 'employees' well. Very admirable character but when the shit hits the fan, he's just as capable of wreaking havoc as Revy. We've got Benny who is the techno-guru information's officer of the crew. We have Balalaika, soviet-russian ex-military who runs hotel-moscow, a russian mafia group that is one of the few, but also one of the most powerful, forces that calls the island of Roanapur home. She's quite the fearsome woman and comes into play quite frequently, even more-so in Season 2. An interesting little piece of information on her name is that it is also the name shared to a Russian guitar-like instrument. It was widely used and supported by the Soviet Union, replacing anything having to do with a Violin (Violas, Cellos, etc.) in their Red Army Choir. Her group, like the instrument, had its place in the soviet russia, but also like the period before where the instrument was banned due to its annoyance to church and state, they were outcast as well. We then have Rock and Revy who I will go into detail...I don't give as much to Dutch, Benny, and Balalaika simply because, even though they are incredibly unique, I didn't feel as impacted by them as I did with the Rock and Revy pair. All the characters are memorable in the end.\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with Rokuru, later dubbed Rock (Rok? Whatever..semantics), the man has it as dull as it can get. Cubicle bound, kissing the dirty underside of his superiors shoes, working in an excruciatingly BORING environment...probably got a nice little 9 to 5 going for him. In short, the man was a white coat, khakis, and tie boring office ant trying to tick his way up the corporate ladder. Great fun right? Whelp, that takes a complete 180 when he's out on an off-shore venture and the ship he's on gets confiscated by the lovable gang that works under the name of Black Lagoon. They're a courier service...your black market mail man, your dark delivery service. After some X, Y, and Z happens, avoiding spoilers, he hitches a ride with the rest of the crew and the story goes from there.\\n\\n\r\nWe've also got Revy, the lovable blood-thirsty, gun-slinging, sewer munchkin that'll chop your balls off and feed 'em to you, wait for them to digest and do it again. She's the muscle of BL, less so with her hands and more so with her supernatural abilities to handle weapons. She's very fun to watch in both the action and social environments and the interactions between her and Rock do affect each other quite seriously, causing changes in views and some personality adjustments. They teach and learn from one another on each extreme of the spectrum. Now, some people may get wrapped up in the fact that she slaughters everything while the ones she's fighting against collectively have the aim of a stormtrooper, but I love the action...don't care. There are very few that can stand up to her but it makes for some pretty nice action scenes when they appear. She and rock develop a pretty interesting relationship...not romantic but I won't say anything more than that. She's got a one of a kind voice....if you're going to watch it in dub, stick with the dub through both Season 1 and 2 simply because if you try to switch over to the subs, her character would feel incredibly different. Something as simple as a pitch change in her voice can give a drastic change in view of her character. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style was excellent. It wasn't \"oooh...shiny\" but it seemed very fitting in a manner that I wish I could explain, can't particularly put it into words. The drawing, nonetheless, was very smooth, fluent, colorful, and in a few instances, beautiful. The sound was well placed, I enjoyed the intro music. The ending music was a little strange, at least in my eyes, but was very well placed when the episode was concluding...its presence gave good indicator that the show was over folks, come again! \\n\\n\r\nIf you like crazy girls with guns, pirates in suits, Hawaiian shirts, and daisy-dukes, all the blood, explosions and shoot-em-up you can handle, then this is definitely for you. Even if your not too sure about all those things, watch it anyway. Its episodic nature is more than made up for in the action scenes, memorable characters, and character development between Rock and Revy. I thoroughly enjoyed this series enough to keep it stored up and will more than likely re-watch both seasons in the near and dear future.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of the series in its entirety, namely both seasons and the OVA.\r\nOverview:\r\n\"Black Lagoon\" is an action anime that seems heavily inspired by the works of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers. Before and while I was watching the series, I found a number of people say it was just too awesome, with some even saying it was better than \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Trigun\". Having watched it myself, my opinion is that, while it's certainly great as an action series, it tries too hard to be more than that, ultimately suffering from a serious identity crisis.\r\nStory & World (6.5/10):\r\n\"Black Lagoon\"is set mainly in the fictional Thai city of Roanapur, a practically lawless wretched hive that has been a haven for criminals for decades. Rokuro Okajima, a salaryman from Japan has been kidnapped by a group of pirates called the Lagoon Company, who just happened to be onboard a ship that they raided. Soon enough, he discovers that he has been abandoned by his boss in Japan, who had him declared dead to cover up a smuggling operation that he was unknowingly a part of. After helping the Lagoon Company out of a tight spot, Rock, as he's now called,  joins them as a member, seeing the life as a pirate as a chance to start fresh, something a guy in his situation sorely needs. The story follows Rock and the other Lagoon members (Revy, Dutch and Benny) as they tackle jobs given to them by various criminal organizations, while at the same time fighting criminals who are much worse than they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic idea of Roanapur is that it's the real world, not only because there's no supernatural elements to speak of (which is very rare for an anime) but everywhere you look, you see things that happen everyday in real life. People take whatever they want at the expense of others, often without consequence. Trying to be the hero fails far more often than not, mentally ill people are sometimes beyond saving and weak teenagers standing up to experienced adults ends only in failure. Despite all of this, the story and world fail to really engage because they're just not believable. Simply put, any chance for realism goes flying out the window by the end of the first episode, in which Revy guns down an entire group of thugs using only a pair of pistols. It reaches new levels in the third episode, in which she kills several ships worth of enemies. Later, we're introduced to a maid who has a gattling gun built into a briefcase and can keep up with a moving car followed by a whole bunch of insane women such as a Taiwanese girl with throwing knives and a mute girl with a chainsaw.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the show is trying to tell two stories at the same time; one an over-the-top action movie from the 90s and the other a brutally honest drama about the horrors of reality, the latter of which seems to there just to try and cover up the fact that the show is anything but realistic. Also, Rock is frequently given lectures by the others about what he needs to do in order to survive, and yet none of the main characters are ever at any risk of being killed off for good, especially not Rock, who despite being one of the weakest members survives so many life-threatening situations it's not even funny. Furthermore, the crappy conditions of Roanapur are shown to us many times throughout the series and, while hints are given, none of the characters really sit down to talk about exactly how it got so messed up. You sometimes get the impression that the show just doesn't know what it wants to be, even though it's obvious that it's trying to be a straight action series.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8/10):\\n\r\n\"Black Lagoon\" looks, for the most part, normal. The animations are very smooth and and the fights are highly chaotic but the art is quite average and not anything special. It is very good-looking overall but there are plenty of better looking anime out there. Considering the first two seasons came out in 2006, this isn't surprising but the OVA came out five years later and doesn't seem to look any better, which is a problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe music of \"Black Lagoon\" is generally good, but not fantastic. Aside from the opening and ending themes and a few tracks here and there, most of it is quite average and just goes unnoticed. The voice acting is solid, delivering a truly fantastic dub with very fitting voices. Considering almost none of the series is set in Japan (aside from an arc that takes up the whole latter half of the second season), it is highly recommended that you watch the series in English. The dialogue is mostly very good, though some may be put off by the excessive amounts of swearing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Rock is unbelievably lucky. Throughout the series, he ends up in every crazy situation you can think of  and manages to come out of all of them with barely a scratch, as well as surviving the wrath of the deadliest fighters in the series. At one point, he has a gun pointed at his head and manages to avoid being shot by simply moving the gun to the side, getting only a scratch and suffering no permanent damage. I mean, I'm no stranger to the guy who can survive anything (I've played the \"Uncharted\" games) but Rock takes that to a whole new level, especially since he's just a negotiator with no fighting skills of any kind. It gets to the point where you just stop caring about what's going to happen to him, as you know that, one way or another, he'll manage to wiggle his way out of it somehow.\\n\\n\r\nElephant-thick plot armour aside, \"Black Lagoon\" nonetheless has a pretty fine cast of characters. Rock and Revy essentially serve as contrasts at the beginning of the series- she's a nihilist while he's a wide-eyed idealist, but as the series goes on, Revy starts to improve as a person due to Rock's influence, while Rock gradually becomes more amoral due to Roanapur influence. It gets to the point that, by the OVA series, Revy is the one calling Rock out for his actions, when it's made clear that he's been in Roanapur for far too long. As rash as Revy can be, she's still a pretty difficult person to hate once you learn about her incredibly tragic past, which is generally hinted at in flashbacks. And regardless of what I may have said before, seeing her take on so many guys at once is pretty damn awesome, especially when it's accompanied by her dark sarcasm. This makes her easily my favourite character.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Rock and Revy, we also have the Lagoon leader, Dutch, who is best described as the cool, badass type. He never panics and is the only member besides Revy who can (or is willing to) use a gun. The last member, Benny, is the computer specialist and unfortunately the least fleshed-out of the main cast. Simply put, he's introduced in the very first episode and essentially gets no development at all until the third episode of season 2, when it's finally made clear what kind of character he's supposed to be. There's also a very large supporting cast, most notably Roberta, the maid I mentioned earlier who works for a rich Colombian family. She first appears in the first season and returns as the focus of the OVA series. She acts as something of a foil to Revy and the two lock horns more than once, with the results being very brutal. She is definitely the best character in the series after Revy and Rock, to the point that I almost wished she showed up more often\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\nWhen it's just being an action series, which is actually more often than not, \"Black Lagoon\" is a very fun series to watch. Almost every episode has some kind of great fight scene and a lot of these are very intense. Unfortunately, there are some arcs that end quite weakly, with the last one of season 2 pretty much going downhill in the last two episodes, though the OVA series made up for this. There are also a lot of depressing moments, particularly in the second season, and they can be pretty heavy-handed to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'm not denying that \"Black Lagoon\" is a very good series, but I do think it's a bit overrated. It takes the basic premise of a Quentin Tarantino film and tries to present it as something realistic with really forced drama, almost as though Rei Hiroe forgot what made the series good and tried to convince us that this crazy city filled with superhuman women is a place that could actually exist. Because it's not drama you watch \"Black Lagoon\" for- you're in it for the action, and on that score, it definitely delivers.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n6.5+8+8.5+7.5+7.5=38/50=7.6/10",

            "content": "Pirates. The recent surge in the movie industry has given us the imagery of Johnny Depp, Davey Jones, Blackbeard, and other old world terms that we use to identify ourselves with pirates. This however, is where this gets off the bus and takes us into a whole new direction.\r\nWe start off with ordinary salaryman, Rokuro. Whom of which is kidnapped by two people of the Lagoon Trading ship (a ruse for those being pirates). He is captured as collateral for stealing a disc with the company Rokuro works for's private data with their vital information.\r\nEventually, Rokuro starts to enjoy living life on the edge withthis crew and joins them. Benny, the technological and computer whiz. Dutch, the captain and former military man. And Revy, the muscle, also known as \"Two Hands\" from her two guns she constantly carries. \\n\\n\r\nWith Rock rounding out this crew, the team goes on a series of adventures in the south asian seas near Roanapur, a fictional town. They take jobs to help them get by and to pay for the damage that they seem to consistently cause to their favorite bar. Jobs range from escorting diplomats to salvaging gold from a sunken sub which are given to them by an ex-military Russian crew headed by Balalaika.  All the while they are in constant danger from other pirates or other organizations that seek out to harm those of the Lagoon crew, or have their own ordeals and the crew are caught up in the middle of it. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the nitty gritty, the technical side of this review. How it delivers to the audience. To start off, the animation in this series is top notch and solid. You can clearly see how the action sequences pan out and are not lost in the constant cuts that occur in other shows. \\n\\n\r\nVoices are well done and each have distinct voices that make each character stand out, minor or major.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, however original, does get swept up in its own weight and can sometimes draw itself out for a bit too long. Meaning that some of the sequences where we learn of Revy's past kind of draws on too long and distracts me from the oncoming action and violence to be had soon enough. Not to say that this is a regular occurrence, a few episodes are drawn down, which is why this gets a 9. If there were any half or decimal point values for this, it would definitely reach a 9.5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoying this series is not for everyone. This is definitely a more mature audience since this does involve much violence and some nudity and other more adult topics such as Nazi's, children becoming serieal killers (second season) and other very mature themes. It does take some backbone to watch. But if you can get past some of the themes, which isn't too difficult to do, you will find a very nice story to watch through out this series.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth a viewing",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is a frantic shoot-em-up anime that also provides substance to its characters. This show manages to find a decent balance between crazy shootouts and character development to satisfy those looking for an action anime or a decent story.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe premise of this series is how a clean-cut businessman, fed up with the demeaning work life of someone at the bottom of the corporate ladder, breaks free of the shackles of his condensed world and pursues a completely opposite lifestyle for a chance to truly feel alive. This story is akin to that of Fight Club, though on a much more radical scale. Thereisn't much of an overarching storyline to this series. The season mainly follows Lagoon Company as they perform deliveries for clients, which almost never go as planned. Beyond this, the show steadily fleshes out the internalization of each character, to remind us that even the craziest of gun-toting mercenaries are still human after all. While this is all something to take note of, especially for an action anime like this, it isn't presented in a way that would really tug at your emotions, at least not enough for the story to really be considered that of great merit. Still, it's great to come across an action anime that actually cares about the people carrying the guns.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sounds: 6/7\\n\\n\r\nThe art, while nothing really worth singing about, is tailored nicely to display all the visceral scenes of destruction and bloodshed. What else is that the artists have made great using of lighting and shadows in certain scenes, mainly for scene structure and highlighting faces. The show features a wide variety of firearms and explosions that all sounds believable enough. The action scenes are often scored with some mean metal rock music, which I guess is to be expected. And while it isn't much worth noting, I always enjoyed how the music at the end of each episode transitioned into the ending credits, which is a nice touch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show features plenty of entertaining, yet often ridiculous, firefights, the show pays close attention to its cast members more than you'd think for a show as gritty as this. A major theme presented throughout the show is the struggle to deal with the woes of the past, something that nearly every character in the show has in common. Probably the most often explored character is Revy: a person who was forced into a life of constant struggle for survival at a young age, who eventually used her lethal skills as a means for profit, because it is the only thing she knows how to do. Everyone in Lagoon Company, even some of the antagonists for that matter, all have demons from their past that they're carrying with them. One complaint I have is the dialogue. It is weirdly hit or miss: you have some situations that truly sound organic, especially during those of character exposition, then you have others that don't quite hit the mark. I think the greatest example of this is Rock's frequent internal (sometimes external) monologues. I won't say that they're annoying, but they often sound like someone who is reading off of a script, as opposed to someone who is truly lost in thought. Despite this, it is still a pleasure to delve into the inner workings of these crooked people, who all gather at the city of Roanapur to relish in the only life they've even known, while knocking back a few drinks at The Yellow Flag.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are a lot of fun to watch. Though in some cases (ESPECIALLY episode 2) they just get downright absurd, but in sort of a good way that ends up being more entertaining. It manages to hit that sweet spot where the ridiculousness adds to the enjoyment, without overdoing it to the point where you become detached from it all and wait for the scene to be over. Now and then you have refreshing scenes of character development and story progression, and the producers did a good job of knowing when and where to place these scenes in a way that feels natural, and not forced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is quite entertaining on both an action and story level, sort of a rare breed in the genre. While its story and characters may not be something worth an Oscar nomination (they have anime at the Oscars, right?), they still hold a good standard of literary merit, enough for you to care about the characters and their outcomes. The action is, to put it in a weird way, reservedly over-the-top, meaning that it's crazy and frantic in a good way. Black Lagoon offers a lot of entertainment value for a variety of audiences, something that you might find yourself having a marathon watch if you allow yourself to get hooked on it.",

            "content": "It's no secret in anime over the last decade plus that barbaric violence and over the top comedy have been joined at the hip; therefore it's almost a guarantee that viewers will be treated to a title that wants to appeal to multiple audiences. While this is fine for a majority of anime fans, there are some whom simply loathe this artistic approach and will brush it off as genre clashes. Black Lagoon is one of the very few around this time period that manages to go against the grain on some level. It doesn't rely too much on gimmicks to drive its story, butthe ones it does fall back on are actually pretty entertaining to watch at times. This is one of the rare modern titles I come back to. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is still just as entertaining as I remember it, perhaps even more so. I have a soft spot for these characters since they feel quite believable, and the writing dabbles in heavy themes the likes of existentialism and strong atheist beliefs. The series handles these themes in ways I can relate to which adds to my personal enjoyment. Now the character development here isn't the greatest, but viewers will get to know Revy and Rock especially. The first several episodes develops their shaky relationship as they come from two different backgrounds. Revy's life was apparently very rough from the get-go, so her mentality is a heavy shade of black to the point where grave-robbing is far from beneath her. While Rock actually lived a decent life where his biggest complaint was kissing up to his bosses, so he doesn't get her at all. The writing is pretty solid bringing these two to an understanding, and it's actually easier for me to watch now. I feel the chemistry between these two, and some people will probably be hoping to see them get somewhere. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is plot less for the most part with Revy and Rock's budding relationship being the only consistent plot thread. However, the series maintains a fresh feel through several stand alone tales and even a two or three parter here and there. The Black Lagoon company will go against Neo-Nazi's, crime lords attempting to rise in power, and even a near indestructible assassin. Make no mistake, the series is action-packed full of gun battles either on foot or in the sea. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series has a consistent flow from one arc to the other, and it does not follow the monster of the week formula. It's pretty far from flawless though; the writers have their moments where they can run the comedy smoothly, and the jokes along with insults can creep up on you hitting that funny bone. Unfortunately, you can also see when it's trying very hard to be funny, it also tries hard to be stylish too on some occasions when it didn't really need to be. It did a far better job letting these elements run naturally. The action scenes are very cool, but I still roll my eyes to some degree as they can feel a bit too corny pushing Revy's psychotic side. At times, I kind of think her cool factor is quite over-rated in comparison to her boss Dutch, whom doesn't need this over the top action to be cool at all. \\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime isn't very impressive but it carries the action well enough. The vehicle and gun battles are very entertaining blanketed with plenty of shot bodies and explosions. When characters are shot with powerful weaponry, they're asses are sent twirling in the air. My only problem is that there are plenty of short cuts taken with the action; there's very little choreography with characters barely moving in which they try to cleverly work this into Revy's character, and it just comes off cheesy sometimes. Now I like the character designs as they have a mature look which abandons the usual chibi, big eyed look for everyone. The designs match their personality very well with the Russian Mafia crime lord Balalaika, along with Dutch, Benny, and Revy really standing out. The backgrounds are pretty nice in regards to the landscapes; the bright yet dull light shining on buildings, the night time atmosphere, it all looks very nice and even the CG blends in well enough. The only weakness I can think of are the background stills for the populace. This is something I will always take jabs at, because it renders everything lifeless due to the lack of movement. When I see a bunch of people crowded I want to see some activity. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the English dub deserves the biggest nod for its no nonsense and bold delivery. There is loads of profanity here and offensive content going around, and it fits very well with the characters personalities and design. The music gets the mood going for sure, with the opening theme Red Fraction which feels like a cross between rock and electronica leading the way. Unfortunately outside of that nothing really stood out as something memorable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this first half of Black Lagoon is pretty entertaining with some good action and decent characters. It doesn't suffer from a huge amount of tonal whiplash either which will always be a plus with me. The high level of profanity, sexual references, and offensive content will more than likely bother some people though, so you're being warned on who this anime is not aimed for. In any case, even if you don't like anime at all, this is something you can probably get into. If you're an anime fan and didn't see this, well you don't need to add it to the top of your list but check it out someday. \\n\\n\r\nHighs: Some stylish action and some type of character development, stellar voice-work\\n\\n\r\nLows: Action can feel corny, will be offensive to some",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe story focuses on the adventures of a delivery crew who work in a land of crime. There is no overarching story and the series is told in several non-related mini-arcs, each ranging from one to four episodes. This makes the story more of a character driven affair, focusing on the development and changes in the personalities of the characters. The plots of these separate arcs are told well; they are fast paced, yet quite easy to follow, although not exactly  Their short lengths stop them from dragging on, and the series uses a good mixture of comedy, action and drama to keep thingsinteresting. Although there are four crew-members of the eponymous Lagoon, it really only focuses on two of them, with the other two fading into the background. With the series focusing on the lives of criminals, its interesting to see how the characters are never clearly good or evil, instead standing in a gray spot between the two. This is shown in how they react to situations and is a breath of fresh air rather than the MCs just being the typical hero-types. The ending of the first series does seem a bit abrupt, with no real closure or any ead into the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Black Lagoon is clean and the animation is smooth, with no strange choppiness or other issues. The style isn't overly cute, nor is it too realistic, suitable for the action-movie style as well as not seeming out of place when it moves into comedy or serious territory. The backdrops throughout the series are diverse, ranging from open waters to uninhabited coasts to port cities. All of the areas are well detailed. Although well done, the art has nothing truly memorable or great about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI watched the series in Japanese, although I did rewatch a couple of episodes in English dubbing. Almost all of the voice-acting was great, with very few seeming strange or unsuited to the character. The english dubbing was on par of that of the Japanese, so watching it in either would be a viable choice (although watching all of the seasons in Japanese will create some plot-holes in season two). The sound was generally of good quality with nothing sounding weird/distorted/unclear. The soundtrack was nice, although it was really nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is Black Lagoon's greatest weakness. Although this is a character driven series, there is little in terms of actual character development throughout. There initially appears to be four main characters; the no-nonsense boss, the techie, the hyper gun-crazy woman and the new guy (the four crew of the Lagoon), but you'll quickly notice that two of them (the boss and the techie) are neglected and all of the focus will be put onto the remaining two. This under-utilisation wouldn't be so bad as it would allow more time to explore the other two. Unfortunately, this opportunity is not used very well, and although there seems to be some real changes in how the characters feel and interact, none of theses changes seem to be permanent or make any real difference later on. Characterisation in the series is saved only by a certain side-character, who really does seem dynamic and interesting. Being a frequent character, her presence manages to make the character at least somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe entire series is basically an action-film with an added layer of anime un-realism. There are many references to 80s and 90s action flicks and a lot of the action is over-the-top. Unfortunately, sometimes the action will seem kind of stupid (i.e two character running straight at each other while shooting at each other, yet nobody gets hit even though they get within a couple of feet from each other) and may pull you out of the moment, but these are few and far between.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something casual and fun to watch on a saturday evening that isn't deep, complex and thought-provoking, and is chock-full of comedy and firepower, you'll get some good entertainment out of this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.5/10 (rounded up to 8)",

Respecto al soundtrack es bueno y bastante variado, tiene desde canciones calmadas hasta otras muy energ\u00e9ticas muy acordes a las escenas de acci\u00f3n, la actuaci\u00f3n de voz tambi\u00e9n esta ok, quitando claro ese horrible acento que tienen los japoneses al pronunciar el ingl\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon es una serie de acci\u00f3n que basa todo su fuerte en esto, es m\u00e1s estilo sobre sustancia, y no pretende ser m\u00e1s que ello, aunque no deja de tener algo de contenido como el abuso infantil, drogas, terrorismo aunque esto es puesto m\u00e1s para encajar con el entorno, ya que no se explora seriamente estos temas, Black Lagoon es un homenaje a las cl\u00e1sicas pel\u00edculas de acci\u00f3n de Hollywood tambi\u00e9n incluye Yakuzas y carteles, etc, todo lo que sea acci\u00f3n Black Lagoon tratara de mostrarlo, la serie es acerca de un grupo de mercenarios tomando parte de diversas misiones en una ciudad sumida en el caos, donde reina la corrupci\u00f3n, asesinatos, violencia, mostrando como se vive en el mundo bajo, con grandes dosis de acci\u00f3n como persecuciones, tiroteos, ataques en bases militares, bombas etc. Bombarde\u00e1ndote (valga la iron\u00eda) en todo momento con todos estos elementos, sumado a la atmosfera bien construida y consistente de la serie, es bastante refrescante de visualizar. \\n\\n\r\nLa historia es acerca de un grupo de mercenarios que toman diversas misiones, por as\u00ed decirlo, estas misiones no llevan a nada realmente, todo mantiene el status quo en el show tras finalizar, no hay un sentido del progreso, estos mini arcos, en peque\u00f1as porciones est\u00e1n bien porque te entretienen con mucha acci\u00f3n en poco tiempo y no duran lo suficiente para que te des cuenta, si es que no le prestas atenci\u00f3n, que la serie no posee mucho sentido o contenido,  los personajes tampoco poseen un objetivo mayor al de mantener su estilo de vida, hablando de los personajes, los encuentro funcionales para el tipo de serie, tipos bastante rudos, guerreros, rebeldes(y hacen muecas y risas maniacas) pero no van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso, ninguno obtiene un desarrollo en la serie o aprendizaje y todos son los mismos de principio a fin, Revy por ejemplo es la chica rebelde y de car\u00e1cter fuerte y act\u00faa cool en la mayor\u00eda de situaciones, Rock es el tipo que busca ser la voz de la raz\u00f3n en un mundo tan ca\u00f3tico, pero tampoco va mas all\u00e1, me hubiera gustado que exploraran m\u00e1s el c\u00f3mo afecta este cambio tan brusco al personaje pero Black Lagoon no es una serie que se caracterice por profundizar en sus personajes, Rock y Revy tienen ocasionalmente interacciones muy divertidas al ser polos opuestos, los otros dos del cast principal realmente terminan siendo bastante relegados, incluso en la segunda temporada su participaci\u00f3n es casi nula, por ah\u00ed tambi\u00e9n se muestra momentos del pasado de los personajes para simpatizar con ellos, lo que los aleja de ser tan b\u00e1sicos, pero no lo suficiente para ser llamados buenos personajes, aunque tampoco son malos.  La serie ser\u00eda mejor si tuviera personajes, que se ven involucrados en estos problemas de manera m\u00e1s personal y luchando por alg\u00fan objetivo en concreto. Respecto a los personajes secundarios, son muy simples igualmente, encuentro dos tipos, o los que se parecen al actuar de Revy, siendo rebeldes, etc o los tipos fr\u00edos y calculadores, el resto son una hoja en blanco y carne de ca\u00f1\u00f3n. En cuanto a la acci\u00f3n al ser una serie de acci\u00f3n divertida, es obvio que los personajes estar\u00e1n jodidamente protegidos con el plot armor, caen much\u00edsimas balas y ninguna le dar\u00e1 a los protagonistas, mientras que con los rivales, pareciera que las atraen, tambi\u00e9n nuestros personajes pueden hacer acrobacias o cosas fuera de lo normal, pero es acci\u00f3n tonta al fin y al cabo, no importa mucho realmente, se enfoca en ser divertida y lo logra satisfactoriamente.\\n\\n\r\nSi bien la rese\u00f1a abarca ambas temporadas del anime, hare una diferenciaci\u00f3n y dir\u00e9 que la segunda es ligeramente inferior a la primera temporada, esto porque en un espect\u00e1culo que se enfoca casi totalmente en la acci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 en su segunda mitad disminuye la acci\u00f3n en pro de tratar de darle mayor seriedad al show en arcos de m\u00e1s larga duraci\u00f3n, fallo ac\u00e1 porque dicha seriedad se queda solo en intento, segu\u00edan siendo  historias simplonas y sin mucho sentido, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 el hecho que personajes como Dutch o Benny que ya eran opacados por el d\u00fao principal, ahora son completamente relegados, casi desapareciendo de escena.\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, encuentro a Black Lagoon como una serie muy entretenida y refrescante, un tributo a las pel\u00edculas de acci\u00f3n americanas, es acci\u00f3n pura y lo hace de manera fant\u00e1stica, pero que es vac\u00eda en contenido o carece de una historia general, con un cast de personajes funcional para una serie de acci\u00f3n, pero que no obtienen ninguna catarsis o desarrollo a lo largo del programa y finalmente con un trabajo t\u00e9cnico bastante adecuado, que hace la experiencia m\u00e1s agradable, con todo esto le doy a la serie un 6/10. La recomiendo si te gusta la acci\u00f3n sin m\u00e1s, si buscas algo m\u00e1s elaborado en cuanto a trama o personajes, no es tu tipo de serie.\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin this Review this is going to cover both seasons and the OVA no spoilers. lets start the review the story I thought it was a good the story follows a Japanese businessman named Rokurou Okajima and one day he gets kidnapped by a group of mercenaries or hired guns what will happen next. that is the story with out giving to much away next the action. the action in this anime was fucking great it was unrealistic but if your watching an anime i doubt your going for realism. next the most critical part of making this anime amazing and that isthe characters no doubt the characters is what made this anime great with out the great characters I would of got bored and probably would of gave this anime an average rating at best the characters were great they had there own personality and they felt like they were  actual people and not the cookie cutter characters like you see in a lot of anime. and each of the main characters had a really good backstory. overall the characters is what made this anime so great, next the art and sound I personally loved the art and the sound no problems there. next the negatives it was really hard for me to find negatives and believe me i am hard on anime if you dont believe me read my other reviews. but after thinking for 10 minutes there are only 2 things I can really think of the action in this anime was unrealistic I personally dont care about that because this is an anime but if you care that could be considered a negative and the last thing is the story progression the story really doesn't advance what you get in the first 5 episodes is all your really going to get as far as the story is concerned. Overall one of the best anime I have ever watched so far and I will say this it is important you watch both seasons and the Ova if you want more backstorys I dont really consider them different seasons I think its is just one big season if your curious about seeing what happens next the manga got picked up again last year the manga has 97 chapters on the day I am writing this all the seasons and the ova ends on chapter 76 it picks back up on chapter 77 if you want to read it. Overall great anime This is definitely on my rewatch list.",

            "content": "Welcome back Studio Madhouse. The person chosen for the director role was Sunao Katabuchi whom only previously worked in various storyboard roles and one previous role in directing the anime Great Dog Lassie (1996). Madhouse and Katabuchi together created a fast-paced action anime from start to finish with what seems to be a plethora of talented staff put into different episode director roles from Tetsurou Araki to Atsushi Nigorikawa. If there was one common factor with the staff, it was they all knew how to do action well.\r\nThe plot for Black Lagoon starts with a standard Japanese salary man named Rokuro aka \u201cRock\u201d later, beinggiven a task to take an \u201citem\u201d to a client for his boss. During this journey, pirates from the \u201cBlack Lagoon Company\u201d rob the boat to acquire said item. Rock\u2019s boss deems him expendable in order to keep the item from being stolen, and therefore Rock somehow joins the Black Lagoon Company and their crazy crew of misfits. From there, Rock and the crew live on a pirate island and attend everything from weapon deals to encounters with maid assassins. This is literally an anime about swearing, shooting things, and killing people. It\u2019s awesome.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is straight-up violence featuring many themes showing up in anime at the time like \u201cgirls-with-guns.\u201d Arguably the show\u2019s six strongest characters are all female from the main chick Revy to anime stereotypes like the maid assassin Roberta and the Nun Eda a weapon smuggler. Somehow, the show slips into the show humorous scenes and dialogues during and after violent battles. Important to note that this show is gorgeously animated and the hardcore music goes along with it so well.\\n\\n\r\nBe it the bullet mode animation to blood splatter to the memorable cast of characters with borderline psychologic disorders, Black Lagoon is unadulterated deviously vicious action\u2026 insert F word anywhere in between.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse did the anime industry a favor by creating two fantastic seasons of this show and cannot wait to ingest even more violence later.",

            "content": "If you have a crippling fear of women, this is probably not the best anime for you.\r\nStory:\r\nA harmless Japanese businessman ends up being hired by a transport company that deals with all kinds of illegal stuff. While Black Lagoon makes it very clear that it glorifies its violence, a big part of this anime deals with the harsh realities of living in the Underground. Every time we get a glimpse of somebody\u2019s past or background, this show gets incredibly grim. The job Rock took on a whim (more or less) is not as easy or safe as he might have thought. Black Lagoon walksa thin line and it walks it very well, the thin line between being a gangster flick action bloodfest on one hand and being a dark character study on the other. Normally these two don\u2019t mix well together (of course there are exceptions to this), often feeling like two different stories being told parallel to each other. Here however, they build a unit, one half can\u2019t exist without the other and they play off each other\u2019s strengths. This is only logical if you think about it. Life isn\u2019t just black and white, no matter who you are, what you do or where you stand. Black Lagoon is also one of the few cases where I have read the manga prior to watching the anime. As an adaption, this show is great. There is nothing left out nor are there any fillers. I can\u2019t even point my finger on my usual criticism about how this anime has no real ending, since the second season started airing only three months later. Black Lagoon does many, many things right, but could have benefitted from being a longer running show, though this is hardly the anime\u2019s fault, the source material goes on multi-year breaks all the time. There is also the fact that it has no general story arc besides the character relationships, but that is probably on purpose. After all, they take a job, finish it and get another. That\u2019s their routine.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is close to the more realistic styles of the pre-2000s, though it benefits from the modern possibilities in terms of effects. The action sequences look really good, something that many action-oriented adaptations fail to deliver (this is why I like shounen manga but mostly stay away from shounen anime). During the quieter moments we get to take a closer look at the character design. The animators did a good job visualizing emotions via facial expressions without going overboard a la \u201cTHIS IS MY ANGRY FACE\u201d kind of nonsense. You can see the stuff beneath the skin, much like in real life, by looking into somebody\u2019s eyes. Speaking of skin, unlike many other anime, Black Lagoon portrays the racial diversity of its cast visually. I don\u2019t want to open that door (you know the one) , but I always scratch my head when in an anime people are pointed out as obviously foreigners even though they look pretty much like anybody else. This feels very refreshing, especially since it doesn\u2019t go into the other, slightly racist cartoonish direction either.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon uses music sparsely. This is a good thing, since it gives much more of an impact when they do. There are two prominent tracks, the first being Roberta\u2019s theme (please forgive me for not looking up the name right now), a melancholic piece that beautifully grasps the inner conflict of the character. The other is Don\u2019t Look Behind which doubles as ending theme of the whole show. This has to be one of the most impressive pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard in an anime. While there is always a latent darkness underneath the coolness, this song emphasizes it and expresses the inevitable doom that is hanging over everybody\u2019s heads. The way it fades in while the episode is still running is just plain awesome. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the opening. It\u2019s not that bad and does a good enough job hyping the show, but the English lyrics are inane and cringe worthy. The voice acting is solid, there are no breathtaking performances though.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere is a general theme that describes the cast as a whole. The celebration of the outlaw lifestyle as coping mechanism for their broken personalities. That\u2019s the word that fits the characters best: broken. You can see it every time their past is mentioned and even when they\u2019re on a killing spree. Look into Revy\u2019s eyes when she is slaughtering dozens and you will see a big emptiness. These people may appear incredibly cool (and they are), but there is a reason they have become what they are. The best example of this duality is Roberta. She is easily the most cold-hearted killer of the whole bunch, yet there is an honest, warm kindness to her. It all depends on which trigger you pull. The only one who doesn\u2019t seem to fit into this category is Rock. He lacks the tragic or miserable background the others have, even though what happened to him wasn\u2019t exactly sunshine and rainbows, it\u2019s still far from what the rest experienced and suffered through. He still has morals left and is rightfully shocked at some of the crimes his comrades commit. This brings me to our main couple (pun may or may not be intended), consisting of Rock and Revy. It\u2019s painfully obvious she has a soft spot for him, though to which extend is unclear. Maybe it\u2019s because he keeps reminding her of what could have been had she not taken the wrong turn in her life. Or maybe (though that\u2019s just my personal theory) she subconsciously sees him as a last straw to escape this miserable life of hers. One thing you could criticize is the lack of character buildup for many others, like Dutch or Benny. But in the end, most of them keep a low profile for one reason or another. It takes quite some time till we get Revy\u2019s backstory too (and it doesn\u2019t happen in this season).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon has been one of my all-time favorite manga since the day I read the very first volume and it has just gotten better and better. So few manga or anime have managed to create a gangster epic to such a degree. The anime adaptation just adds to this with the extra layer of sound to give off an even better experience. This is an easy recommendation for anybody who is into action or for those who love classic gangster movies or even those, who used to like shounen but feel like they\u2019ve outgrown the genre and in general for anyone who just wants something else but fantasy worlds and high schools. However, as much as I may have praised this anime, I\u2019ll only give it a 9 out of ten, simply because I know that the best is yet to come. Look forward to child porn actors gone wild, best girl Sawyer and World War III in Roanapur.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.0/10",

            "content": "*This review takes consideration of the 2nd season*\r\n*Viewership is recommended to be watched in dub*\r\nIt's evident why parts of society regards some of its areas to be ghetto, sketchy, or a place no one should be involved in. It's a rougher life out there with little luxury and more grit and dirt to rub on you, in life, body, and health.\r\nCity people forget these types of lives which they titled nonredeemable. That they are scum. These lives are left alone to survive with questionable or less than moral methods.\r\nThere's a reason why audiences love a criminal cast, they become awed at witnessing the rough inboth mind and action. Our main male lead tastes this and gets his entire life changed from being part of the city, to being part of the Lagoon Company. A 'for-hire' group able to get things done in guns, glory and life threatening work.\\n\\n\r\nOur main group is bad ass and lovable each in their own way. Finding out how they entered this life or their outlooks to be such characters, this information is presented to the viewer in such an enthralling way that doesn't fall back to the \"Flashback narration.\" You can see their determination in their eyes, their actions and the demeanor. You will pick up changes and understand what their minds are thinking, and you will love them even more.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels damn great to get away from what I understand as the norm of anime, Black Lagoon will excite you when things gets going yet keep you interested when they are on the down-low. There's none of that cliche trope filled garbage to hurt it either.\\n\\n\r\nNot only do I love this show's characters, the theme and setting is so well done. This disarray mess of places could still be called home, even if one may worry of getting shot around the corner. The importance of money, lifestyle and reputation is properly asserted as well as what it means to its society.\\n\\n\r\nOthers may call them cockroaches, never dying no matter what the attempts or circumstances (Although there are times where some gunshots seemed like they should've hit), but others may see them as just as human as the rest of us. The imbalance of virtues and afflictions we always face in decision and life.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that I really wanted to highlight was the show's ED. It's so contrasting and confusing to a viewer. Why on earth after all that action, all those words and all the mayhem, does it end with something so serene and calm? In the end, we're all looking for that place where we can release even our most trusted tools in life, so we may finally walk in peace.\\n\\n\r\nDon't worry about transitioning to the second season, it really could just be one season. It properly continues without leaving one in lost question or thought.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch it dubbed, the voices and dialogue are perfect. Even hearing someone be called 'Chinglish' or even simply 'retarded' adds to watching and immersing one to this diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nSide note; check out stuff from Shadowrun like their games, always showcasing a story, a rough world, and a group of disagreeables. Black Lagoon heavily reminds me of that series.",

            "content": "If you like constant thrill and feeling your blood pulsing and pumping through your veins like never before this anime is perfect. \r\nThe story in itself is as original as you can have it in my opinion giving you a great feeling of the corrupted world and how government and people who hides in the shadows are not really different. This anime creating the capital of bad guys all over the world feels great. It captures everything you want creating a story that you want to follow through the end. There is not one episode that this anime has that i didnt like. The moreyou watch this anime the more you deeper in the darkest pit you will see. Nietzhes quote about\" if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you\" sums the this anime up perfectly. As this is the first season is part about how Rokuro and Revy getting to know eachother but also progress and shows how the city in this story really is both from the view of the living but also the view of those who are dead. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack makes my blood run wild and pumps it like crazy it feels so fun watching this thrilling anime while you see every kind of scum of the world shot at each other for reasons of their own and sometimes no reason at all. \\n\\n\r\nI generally have a hate for main characters who takes the entire series to become great. But this main character Rokuro/Rock is in the middle of the it he is never overpowered but when you start thinking he is weak you will be surprised at how crazy and fun a main character can be. Revy his partner is a perfect example of a female mc character who just have everything thats fun to watch. Wicked personality , fun humor , and exellent with any weapons that she hold. Sure there are other characters who i should be talking about but these two characters are the most important and also ones that creates a dynamique few anime can even come close to. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime i just think its great i want more and more i cant remember how many times i have rewatched this but im getting close to my 10 time i think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall there is nothing i dislike about this anime i love everything about it the action , the character , the music the art , i cant find a thing wrong though the only sad thing is that i want more as i write this i will also write an review to the other season and the Ova thats called Robertas blood trail. I could give it a 10 but i think 9 is what it deserves for what it gives us.",

I'm eagerly waiting for Final Fantasy XV to drop so I'm watching a few older shows to tide me over before I start binge playing that.\r\nThe honest truth is that if you have not hit puberty yet, this show will cause your balls to drop, put hair on your chest. Or if you're a woman your tits will bounce out to C or D cups immediately and it'll make you wet.\r\nBlack Lagoon is not a show for children, by the way, so if youdecided to accelerate your growth by watching it, don't blame me. Also, you will learn a buttload of racist slurs from this show. It probably sets the record for the amount of times \"fuck\" is said in a series as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show follows Lagoon company, a bunch of mercenaries that follow jobs to earn money. Black Lagoon succeeds in being a hilarious slice of life, and romantic comedy the likes never before seen. It sort of makes wading through a pile of moe trash to witness this (as in biblically witnessing) masterpiece worth it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this show are psychotic murderers, which makes them very charming, except the protagonist \"Rock\" who can talk no jutsu these psychopaths down and live to tell the tell. What a badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real weakness I found in this show is that there's a certain sequence between two girls that should have been better animated. Come on, it was supposed to be a fistfight, a good opportunity to go into some grade A sakuga and the show failed on that, especially when it's used in other sequences. I was pretty disappoint in that segment of the show, but the rest of it makes up for this wild ride that Black Lagoon takes the audience on.",

            "content": "For my second review, I chose Black Lagoon as it's one of my favorite animes. So let us start with the review, shall we?\r\nThe anime doesn't consist of any major storyline, but rather of small episode arcs.\u00a0So Black Lagoon is somewhat similar to an episodic anime series. Despite it, you barely, or should I rather say never, get bored throughout the entire series. To me, Black Lagoon basically felt like an intense summer hollywood action blockbuster movie. And just to point out how crazy and awesome Black Lagoon actually is, I have one thing to say: Nuns with guns!!\u00a0\r\nOne thing I'd like to criticize though,is the abrupt ending of the first season. So it's highly recommended that you watch the second season, as it basically leaves off where this season ends.\\n\\n\r\nLet's head on to the sound. I personally like the opening and ending. While the opening is a punk rock song, which makes me wanna flip over tables and punch someone in the face, the ending seems in some episodes out of place for it's more slower and sadder music, which already starts within the end of the episode. The in-episode music is great and fits most of the scenes well. And for those who are choosing between sub and dub: I highly recommend choosing the dub as it suits the characters overall much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Black Lagoon is quite beautiful. If you pay attention to it, you'll notice how detailed, colorful and well drawn the characters and the background are.\u00a0The animation is very smooth and enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, once you start watching the show, the build-up of the Black Lagoon seems quite clich\u00e9. You got your stereotypical black dude, the computer geek, the crazy chick with guns and the calm reasonable guy. But you'll find out that every character in this anime is quite unique with its own personality and background story. Unlike other action packed animes, there's quite a bit of character development. As the story progresses, you'll notice that most of the character development is being put into the protagonist Rock and Revy, who are in my opinion undoubtedly the most interesting characters of all, besides Balalaika.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is it worth watching? Definitely! It's got superb animation, great character development and kick-ass action scenes and characters. What more is there to want? I would recommend to stay away though if you are a young viewer or dislike violence, foul language and gory scenes.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n(Any kind of feedback is appreciated)",

            "content": "I watched the first few episodes of this anime and couldn't get into it. It was only recently that I picked it up again and finished it on a single sitting. All I can say is that I loved it. It mainly takes place in a city named Roanapura, where the baddest of the bad come to drink, party, and spend their loot on some hookers and blow.\r\n-Story- [7]\r\nThe story was a bit of a hit and miss for me. It revolves around the crew of Lagoon Company, more so a Japanese salaryman that gets kidnapped by the crew and later joins them. They area group of pirates/mercenaries that are given missions that usually lead to dangerous tasks and becomes a fight to stay alive. What I didn't like about the story was that it left me asking questions that really seems should be answered, I won't get into detail in order to make it spoiler-free. But one major flaw in this anime would be the lack of progression in the storyline.\\n\\n\r\n-Art/Sound- [10] - [9]\\n\r\nThe production value of this anime was incredible. The fights were very well executed, from the gunfights to hand-to-hand combat.There isn't much to criticize about the art style or the sounds in this anime, it was fantastically done and really fit the gloomy setting of Roanapura. Oh and great opening!\\n\\n\r\n-Character- [10]\\n\r\nThis anime had an abundance of colorful characters. My favorite character was Balalaika, it was what made me watch this until the end. I wanted to know how she got into power, her past (burn marks), and the story behind Roanapura and its major powers: Hotel Moscow and the Hong Kong Triads. They somewhat explain the stories of the characters, but it left me wanting more. It seems to be the lacking feature of this anime, it constantly keeps the viewers wondering. They would go into a character but leave out a crucial information in what seems to be an attempt in keeping the character seem protective of its past. This is done in a lot of anime and I have no problem with this, but in this one; it seems as though every character has a dark past and remains in the dark since none of them is really explored.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- [10]\\n\r\nAlthough there are some crucial flaws in this anime, like not describing their very well created characters, or the fact that it doesn't have a main plot, I still very much enjoyed this anime. The action covers up everything that lacks from character development to story telling. The humor in this anime is pretty dark, for instance playing rock paper scissors to decide which one can kill first, or the poor bartender who gets his bar blown up every time the infamous Lagoon Company visits. I found it incredibly humorous huehue. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall- [9]\\n\r\nThis is my current favorite anime, so why did I give it a 9/10? This anime has a really slow start, in the manga it starts with Rock already in the crew while in the anime Rock is kidnapped then joins the crew. They should have did it like the manga, it wasn't necessary at all and kind of boring. But get past that and you're in one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon: The Second Barrage 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this is where it started getting good. A little bit more character development and a sense of direction into the story. The characters start showing their true colors and you become immersed in the hell hole that is Roanapura. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon OVA: Roberta's Blood Trail 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the series I was genuinely sad and wanted to see more of Ronanapura and Miss Balalaika's reign of terror. I'm not one to watch OVAs but this one I had to. Roberta's Blood Trail left me with nothing but disappointment, it was nothing that I wanted from the series, although some interesting characters make a reappearance. This one I would say is for the die hard fans out there. It isn't very long (5 episodes) so you can still watch it if you want, but don't expect much from it.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is an action packed show that puts morality front and center every episode.\r\nThe show is centered on a guy named, \u201cRock\u201d who was captured by pirates and then chose to become one. During the show (Season one and two) Rock struggles with morality. He used to be a white-collar business man from Tokyo who had to suck up to his boss all the time, but now he is a low-life who sees people die nearly every day.\r\nArt 9/10\r\nThe shows artwork is very consistent throughout. It has a very serious tone to it. The directors did very well by putting certain episodes in darksettings to show how immoral certain things are, but the director also shows how immoral things can also be done in shiny and beautiful places too.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is pretty diverse when it comes down to the main characters. It shows a part of the personality you can\u2019t easily find out. To keep things less realistic, Revy, who is always wearing redneck shorts, always seems to have extra ammo somewhere. She doesn\u2019t wear a backpack or an ammo belt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development was near constant, although certain characters still ended up just being a shell that could\u2019ve gotten deeper. Rock and Revy get some decent character development while Benny and Dutch hardly get any.\\n\\n\r\nRevy aka Two-Hands, is a woman who has been killing since she was a little kid and she, as you may find out, is an amoral person. Rock, as stated before, is a trained business man who chose to become a pirate, but as you\u2019ll see, he never shoots a gun. Benny is the go-to guy when it comes down to technology and Dutch is the captain of the Black Lagoon boat and he seems like a very likable person.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the characters are unique and show very unstable personalities, the show doesn\u2019t give a full sense of development on their personalities. Some characters are very dangerous  almost Robot-from-the-future-like, while others are wimpy yet need a million bullets in order to actually hit anything they shoot at.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the most important part of the series. Their personalities dive deep into philosophical and psychological concepts. It is interesting to see that the characters were over-whelmingly well thought out. If you want to see character development at its core, I suggest watching this.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI watched the English Dub and I really liked it. One of the voice actresses in the English dub is also in Tenchi Muyo and that brought familiarity to me and helped me get more interested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the sound is great; there isn\u2019t much music to speak of other than the ending theme. The dialogue can get frustrating at times because they can be very lengthy, especially towards the end of season two. And the different sounds you\u2019ll hear from different types of deaths (both bodily and vocal) are unique and I never got the sense of voice actors being reused for other character parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the first time I heard of a story concept featuring pirates and romanticizing them, but the story wasn\u2019t bad at all. It starts off with Rock being punched in the face and being asked if the thing he was carrying is what the pirates were looking for. And eventually his boss says he should die in the sea and even got paramilitary groups to kill him and the pirates. Long story short, Rock chooses to become a pirate and the adventures start there. The ending is pretty sad, and it kind of felt that I got robbed of a better ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe story concepts are to use several different events placed throughout one year and show how they happened. Some sub-stories will last a couple episodes, and some even reached more than 5, so expect story changes throughout, but the overall/underlying story will always remain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough, the gun fights were interesting, I tended to get bored because it was usually the same thing over and over. I don\u2019t typically like seeing such a sad ending to such an action-packed show and I think that kind of robbed some of my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSince the story was centered around Rock and Revy, I expected some romance, or at least a little bit and no; there was no romance. There was only an extremely occasional ecchi moment.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall I liked the show and it stayed very consistent throughout. With such a sad ending, it felt that Rock\u2019s story truly ended when it was actually only beginning. Great directing, great stories and wonderful sound and art, but the ending should\u2019ve been different (in my opinion) and I think others who love gun-fighting action will love this show. I hope you all enjoy the show too.\\n\\n\r\nSub Group used: [Exiled Destiny]\\n",

            "content": "Preface: These are my general thoughts on Season 1, The Second Barrage, and Roberta\u2019s Blood Trail.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\n\tBlack Lagoon is the story of the seedy underbelly of the U.S., known as Roanapur, more specifically the Black Lagoon company stationed there. Rokuro Okajima a regular Japanese businessman gets wrapped up in one of their jobs, and decides to join them after he has nowhere left to go. Black Lagoon share a bunch of similarities to Cowboy Bebop, or really any show that relies on style and \u201ccoolness\u201d over other important aspects. Black Lagoon doesn\u2019t have an end goal in sight, and it's really about all thebadass, thrilling battles between each season and OVA. There are a lot of short story arcs, that resolve themselves quickly, but many of the secondary characters introduced in them, come back, and it's always a welcomed return. There are very gradual changes in the people of Black Lagoon at least until Roberta\u2019s Blood Trail since while they are all eventually hardened over time due to the bleakness and corruption compassing all of Roanapur, Rock \u201cRokuro Okajima\u201d is the only one who is stuck in an abstract limbo, between the normal corporate world he was once part of to the dark, and sinful world he has recently joined. Rock is the main character and this extremely gradual change in his personality is one of the biggest aspects of the show, but it isn\u2019t its crowning achievement, no, that award has to go to the entertaining, ballistic and at times insane Revy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI already gave you the general gist of Rock\u2019s character but I\u2019ll go a  bit more into detail now, he for the most part is pretty useless at the beginning (since he won\u2019t shoot a gun), at least until his unassuming and nice demeanor is used on transactions and errands for the company, and its like is the spokesmen of the company, and that most of the people they are doing business with if they are in a situation of duress, will open up to him, and eventually they will become torn apart by this world he has slowly become accustomed to it starts to break his humanity and hope bit by bit. He\u2019s a smart, level headed likeable character who is great main character material.\\n\\n\r\n\tRevy is the best member of the Black Lagoon company. She is extremely skilled with firearms, and due to her heavy backstory finds her murderous lifestyle to be enjoyable. Though she hasn\u2019t lost all of her humanity, which might be why she becomes so attached to Rock, and why she doesn\u2019t want him to change due to Roanapur. She is pretty foul mouth, in fact the duo uses swears pretty frequently which I\u2019m a fan of since it does not feel forced or unnecessary. She is just a joy to watch, and he fights with the other Female weapons of this series are a sight to behold, I really like how many cool and interesting multi dimensional female characters are in Black Lagoon, it's quite refreshing.The other main members of Lagoon (Benny and Dutch)are a bit stagnant in comparison but both are still decent characters, while barely featured compared to Rock and Revy.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art Style: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tIt looks really good for being made in 2006. The style is distinctive and dark enough, to really stand out from the rest. The fight scenes are great, and you can really feel a sense of weight and danger with each one since none of the main cast are invincible, there are enemies who are just as good if not better than Revy at fighting. The bright and beautiful setting of Roanapur contrasts greatly with the dark tone and subject matter of most of the storylines. Some of the facial expressions look twitchy and are really memorable, the artstyle is my prefered type over the generic moe artstyle a lot of series have taken a liking to nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Opening theme is maybe my favorite I\u2019ve ever seen, or I\u2019ve at least had it on repeat for the last week. The pace of the song is really intense and accompanied with the colorful and bleak imagery spliced with shots of Revy being badass, it really encapsulates what makes Black Lagoon so entertaining. I also love how 60% of the way through the opening theme the song transitions into a less heavy and more drawn out section that is just as memorable and ends with a bang with a really dope voice effect and the sounds of gunshots. The ending theme, is pretty odd, because it doesn\u2019t really feel like an ending song the transition feels so seemless from the ending scene to this theme, that you just figure that there is more to come. It's a very dreary and melancholy song, the complete opposite of the opening and it ends with a drum build up out of nowhere that doesn\u2019t really add much to the song,and more than anything takes away from it solemn and reflective tone. Still the opening is fucking incredible, so I really can\u2019t give the sound department anything but a 10/10, plus the dub is great, and the amount of hilarious bickering in this show was just the best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThis show is a blast to watch, and while it gets more introspective and thoughtful during season two there really isn\u2019t any moments that left me in awe of how great the show is. The show never surprised me, since all I ever expected were badass moments of awesome, and Revy swearing like a sailor, and it delivered that to me in folds. However with the bits of humanity and greater depth sprinkled throughout really had me interested in learning more about the main cast of characters, and for them to develop more, plus with any of their seasons none of the conclusions were all that satisfying since they were all open ended, but still The action was badass, the music was badass, and Revy was Badass, need I say more?",

They are toned down quite a bit compared to the manga, and it doesn't fit right with me. The guns may sound realistic, but it doesn't sound RIGHT. And the amount of blood that flies is actually a little too small.\r\nThe voice acting and characters also seem to fit right. Revy,has a voice which makes no sense whatsoever to me, especially, her voice should get more harsh, but stays mostly the same level.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and action unfortunately, are also a level down from the manga, and seem relatively simplified.\\n\\n\r\nThe story stays much the same, and is completely acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like action and guns, violence, and a bit of darkness, take a look at this. But also I recommend the manga to you if you enjoyed it, to me it was a great deal better.",

            "content": "(This review covers both seasons of Black Lagoon.)\r\nFor the time worth watching this, people have been describing this as the younger sister of \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d, being the anime equivalent to the big action blockbuster Hollywood movie (The Rock, Bad Boys, any 80s\u2019 action flick you can think of) with the many details of graphic violence, excessive cursing and language, sexuality thrown in there and a bit of inspiration some such filmmakers as Quentin Tarantino & John Woo, although the former did a bit of anime in his venture (yes, you should know what I\u2019m talking about).\r\nThe story follows a team of pirates/mercenaries known asLagoon Company, which smuggles goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia in the early to mid-1990s. Their base of operations is located in the fictional harbor city of Roanapur in southeast Thailand (somewhere in the Amphoe Mueang Trat district, likely on the mainland north/northeast of the Ko Chang island or on the island itself). They transport goods in the 80-foot (24 m) Elco-type PT boat Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions\u2014which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles\u2014in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters of the show, it does have a very vast range of characters but sometimes that showcase as little as they can. Rokuro Okajima, or Rock, is the main protagonist of the show as the Japanese salary man who is so bored and displeased with his daily life and no one exactly gave a shit about him. Actually, when the company he worked for send him out to deliver a package and he gotten captured, they just abandoned him as he was expendable to them. Aside from being captured, Rock manages to keep his mild-mannered and humble attitude throughout the whole show, which is in contrast to our next character, Revy, also known as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d (at least she didn\u2019t swing chains). She is one of the most foul-mouthed, merciless, sadistic and fatal characters of the show and that really got the show in drive. Hell, most of the opening sequence is practically her being showcased in action and while she often gets irritated by Rock in the first season but she is protective of him as the series goes along.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the Lagoon Company include Dutch, the black leader of the company, who is more of the easygoing and relaxed members and last, there\u2019s Benny, the tech specialist member who in his past gotten into the mafia and would\u2019ve ended up dead if Revy didn\u2019t saved him. Now, I would like these characters to have backstory in the show but unfortunately, it\u2019s being taken up by the former two characters of the series, which really disappointed me considering they seemed like interesting characters to know\u2026maybe they might be in the manga, though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, there was a wide variety of characters in the show that will probably be too many to mention and name drop like Balalaika, the boss of Hotel Moscow, one of the many gangs that are mentioned in the show and not only she is very skilled at what she does but practically a character that makes her presence to be feared. There is also the Hong Kong Triads lead by Mr. Chang and his top assassin Shenhua; The Colombian Cartel, The Church of Violence, The Aryan Socialist Union (Neo Nazis.) and The Washimine Group (Japanese Yakuza), who are more heavily-involved towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is total 24 episodes, with the first and the second season called \u201cThe Second Barrage\u201d, and I will say that the second season has more of a storyline while the first is just random missions with little storyline aside from the main one and yet for some characters like Roberta and her arc makes me crave for more of her (luckily, there is an option for that) but the vampire incestuous twins Hansel and Gretel didn\u2019t feel organic to the series or even to most of the plot. They could\u2019ve been thrown out of the show entirely and not much of a difference would have been made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the credit all goes to Madhouse for the many use of blood, detailed fight scenes and gun battles, chase scenes, beautiful scenery, and for the opening and ending sequences, which the music for both worked well. The OP theme, \u201cRed Faction\u201d by MELL will get your blood pumping as the show begins, although singing it\u2026.I would not suggest if you get the lyrics and the ending music\u2026.yeah, music, it\u2019s not much of a theme but many people complained about it being slow, depressing, and drags down the tone of the series\u2026..maybe it does but most of the time when the show have its serious moments, it\u2019s appropriate to rather end on that note rather than just generic hard-driving rock music. The ending music for episode 15 was actually one of my favorites but the last ending theme music was more of a \u201cmeh\u201d to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for the dub from Geneon/Ocean, it is a bit 50/50, on the one hand, the dub fits more naturally than the sub, considering its flair is more international and some characters speak English naturally, performances from Brad Swaile, Maryke Hendrikse, Brian Drummond & Dean Redman, which from him I will say this: \u201cFinally, a black character in an anime is voiced by an actual black guy.\u201d This is a good thing, people. But, unfortunately, some of the voices either irritated or creeped me out like the voice of Hansel and Gretel really had me freaking out a bit, considering I heard them before on a show that in a conscience that I\u2019m not telling you\u2026.well, one of the actresses was the voice of Nurse Witch Komugi. Garcia just seems annoying and grating whenever he speaks and whoever voiced Shenhua has the worst and slightly offensive Chinese voice I have ever heard. It sounds like that fake accent most people would put in a black-owned hair salon and that\u2019s about as Chinese as the Panda Express.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: By all means, Black Lagoon is worth seeing and definitely worth buying. This could be one of the few anime that I see Western culture getting into, maybe not as much or iconic as Bebop but still. It has a very in-your-face tone mixed with dark comedy and sometimes even darker drama once it gets more storyline driven. Your friends will love this but I wouldn\u2019t recommended seeing this with family or kids\u2026..unless they into that, too.\\n",

            "content": "To me black lagoon is in a great anime and one I watch and re-watch on a daily basis and here's why.\r\nThis may sound slightly  strange but it's a refreshingly violent anime and one in which the violence isn't portrayed as a negative thing like some anime's. The main characters love violence and as you watch more and more you will see why. The violence isn't downplayed as something \"the hero must do achieve his goals\" because there's no hero like character. And this is why it's refreshing because it's good to see an anime that has violence for the sake of violence andthat increases the entertainment factor for me a lot (although not for everyone).\\n\\n\r\nHowever it lacks an emotive story or really any indication that a story exists. Their is a small amount of romance that is implied but not acted upon or spoken about by the main characters. What I'm trying to say is that people should not watch this expecting romance or a story line that will move you to tears. It does however more than make up for that with excellent character creation (but not development). In any other show other than black lagoon these characters would be seen as the villains, not here their psychopathic tenancies make them hilariously funny when it comes to to both fighting scenes and non fighting scenes and makes them very lovable. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it is a good anime for those of us who love hilarious psychopaths who crave fighting.\\n\r\nIt would be a bad anime to watch if prefer a good story line with romance and a plot emphasizing character development.\\n\\n\r\ncya x",

            "content": "This is a review for season 1 and season 2 of Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon is a good anime overall. I would recommend it to someone who is really into action and doesn't really care that much about realistic-ness or overall story. \r\nSTORY- The story is about a group of modern day pirates going around doing other people's dirty work. They steal things, escort people, attack targets, and search for valuable items in East Asia. That's pretty much the overall idea to the story. Each episode is a different mini arc consisting of 1 to 3 episodes. They generally just get a contract from someonein each episode and they do it. Although most of theses episodes are entertaining, they were not entertaining enough and became kind of stale for me after the first 8 episodes.The story never really goes anywhere and is generally repetitive. The last arc was hard for me to get through because I was so uninterested. The last arc is one of the most boring arcs in the series and is a bad way to end the series. I know that isn\u2019t the true end to the series because the manga is still going but it was still a bad way to end the anime. I give the story a 7/10\\n\r\nART- The art is very good but not great so I give it an 8/10.\\n\r\nSOUND- The opening song has a nice beat but some of the lyrics were weird ex: \u201cYou make me violate you, no matter who you are\u201d, \u201cNo time for sissy pig\u201d and \u201cI just wanna feel you\u201d. The soundtrack is nothing special because none of the songs are very memorable for me. 6/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- The best part about Black Lagoon is its characters. One of the only reasons I stuck around and kept watching was because of the characters. Not only are they all unique and pretty cool people, several of them get very good character development and are very complex and realistic. I really liked the development between Rock and Revy and their characters as well. I will give the characters 8/10.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- I enjoyed Black Lagoon overall except for some of its flaws. One of the major flaws that really annoyed me was the fact that everybody will have a very accurate aim or a really bad aim whenever it is convenient to the plot. For example, one character is surrounded by 30-some people and they are all shooting at her at the same time and she manages to dodge all the bullets and kill almost all of them. It really takes away from the immersion when stuff like this happens and it happens waaaay too much. This would be acceptable in some unrealistic battle shonen with super powers or something but this show is supposed to be in the real world and it is supposed to be very realistic which it is most of the time except for the gun fights. Because of this, in every fight that involves the main characters I know that they are never going to be shot or die because they can just dodge bullets for no reason. This really impeded on my enjoyment of the show so I give my enjoyment a 7/10\\n\r\nOVERALL- overall I give Black Lagoon a 7/10. I would still recommend it to those of you that like action heavy stories with realistic characters in the real world.",

            "content": "What with the whole crippling recession thing and the massive black stain currently tainting the south coast, it's easy to imagine corporations as heartless money grubbers oppressing the common man in order to maintain their all-night drug-fueled yacht parties. A young japanese businessman by the name of Rokuro Okajima finds out the hard truth of these rumors when he is slated for death by his company simply because he found out about their plot to sell nuclear weapons to foreign dictators planning to use them to incinerate wide-eyed orphens in the small, undefended nation of Lovey-Dovey-stan. \r\nOh, wait, did I say that he found outabout their plan? What I meant to say was that they told him their plan so that they would have an excuse to kill him instead of rescuing him from a group of mercenaries.\\n\r\nIn the face of this revalation, Rokuro, or \"Rock\" to his captors, decides that any life is better than no life and helps the mercenaries escape their pursuers by dreaming up a manuever so outrageously awesome it has to be seen to be believed. And thus begins the adventures of Rock and the Black Lagoon company.\\n\r\nThe BL company is your standard gallery of rougues: Dutch, the charismatic, slightly insane leader; Benny, the nerdy, brainy guy who only does something useful about every five episodes; and Revy, the resident badass who is called upon to do everything that involves making things significantly less alive.\\n\r\nTogether, they accept missions from various parties to deliver things from point A to point B on their torpedo boat, The Black Lagoon.\\n\r\nSee, calling them mercenaries was a bit of a misnomer. They're more like delivery boys. Delivery boys in the sense that Paperboy was a delivery boy, where everything is constantly trying to kill you.\\n\r\nAnd as delivery boys, they are pitted against the very dregs of humanity: independent contractors, revolutionary guerillas, nazis, and, worst of all, maids. (Yeah, we know what you're hiding underneath those dresses.)\\n\r\nLuckily, they have the implacable Revy on their side to even things out, as she has the approximate net worth of 5,000 kilojoules of awesome behind her. See, Black Lagoon takes place in the same reality as every action movie in existence in that your ability to get hit by bullets is inversely proportional to how awesome you are. It's hard to notice in the earlier episodes with all of the flipping and shit, but five episodes in she isn't even trying anymore. She just calmly dispatches everyone in her path while enemy bullets clang helplessly against her concentrated cool.\\n\r\nStill, for the most part the gun fights are done well and are entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nThe stories are pretty dark, as you may have guessed from the story summary, but what prevents this show from turning into just a group of amoral escapades is Rock himself. He is the ray of light that shows that reason can still prevail in the depths of the underworld. But he is also the glimmer of naivety that violence is not the answer. For in the world they live in, violence is the standard and diplomacy is the exception. Watching his and Revy's philosophies clash is both amusing and terrifying, for it threatens to unravel your perception of the world as you know it.\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a psuedo-realistic action show that threatens to eradicate your bubble of safety and logic, Black Lagoon may be just the show for you. \\n\r\nAnd seriously, corporations suck.",

Black lagoon creates a world which i would love to submerse myself in, which even anime i consider to be \"better\" overall do not achieve. \r\nThrough the character Rock( who is in essences ordinary as someone gets) we are introduced to a world of guns, terrorists, nazis and a whole other set of weird all taking place in Asia. There is no real plot rather we see the crew carrying out different missions with no connection.The situations the Black Lagoon crew get involved in are always bizarre and usually end in a gunfight.\r\nAlthough i usually find Gunfightsin anime quite lackluster, Black Lagoon absolutely nails it. Its the combination of excellent animation and sound that really help make this so damn entertaining, which in turn help make up for the weaker plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from either awesome or meh. Revy is one bad ass character, not only is she the main contributor to the awesome action which make this anime great but her dialogue (dub) just perfectly matches her character. I should add Balalaika the Head of a Russian crime syndicate, outshines Revy in terms of badass, intelligent and ruthless she adds the Substance Black Lagoon usually  lacks in its stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is for those looking for something they can simply enjoy, and a must watch for those wanting too see awesome action.\\n",

Anyways, although the story is deep, it's only a compilation of several different stories.\r\nOver all, an 8/10, but people be forewarned.

            "content": "Black Lagoon is the perfect show to recommend to your guy friends who don't watch/haven't seen anime, given they have a fancy for action and adult content. The immense usage of curse words and flashy gun action, along with Revy's beautiful ass will keep your noob friend entertained and distracted like a baby who is having keys dangled in front of it, but does Black Lagoon have the ability to entertain us more \"avid\" viewers?\r\nThe answer is yes IF you don't it too seriously. The story starts off with our lead \"Okajima Rokuro\", a 20 something business man who lives a boring, monotonous life servingas a punching bag for his company and boss, UNTIL.!!1.!!.. he has to deliver some some disk thing to china or whatever. The ship Mr. Okajima is on get's raided by modern day pirates, then some bullshit ensues and \"Rock\" as he is newly dubbed, ends up as the crew's newest member. The ship's crew consists two irrelevant characters with little screen time, our MC Rock, and Finally, Revy. Revy is the bad ass bitch you see on the cover, and she is what many would say, the best thing about this show. Actually, she pretty much IS the show. Her jean shorts and and merciless ability to kill anyone pretty much provide the make up of this series.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, the story has been established, from this point on the show just follows random missions that the crew go on, often told in 2-3 episode story arcs. During this time, we get some good pretty good character development brewing while we explore Revy's dark past, and Rock's struggle to fit in, but other than that there's pretty much no progression in the series.\\n\r\nThe art and sound are up to par but nothing special, they do their job without any serious shortcomings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though there are near constant explosions and gun fights, the lack of a plot driving the action makes this show feel more like the wave pool at a water park rather than the 5 story high mega water slide. That's why i recommend watching this show on the side, along with another series that you care for more, because every now and then the wave pool is a nice, relaxing departure from the more serious anime you might be watching. Especially when nobody is peeing in the water... xD",

The intriguing and amazing criminal underworld setting is bogged down by the show's undying urge to cram as many action scenes as it can into its runtime, no matter how forced and absurd they may be. For an anime that tries so hard to depict a gritty and realistic GTA-like city, too often does Black Lagoon want you to suspend your disbelief so it can follow the \"Rule of Cool\" i.e characters can charge into a mob of enemy gunmen, gunsakimbo, and massacre every single one of them without suffering so much as a scratch amidst the hail of bullets. Do the enemies have the shittiest aim in the world or are the characters protected by one too many layers of plot armor? This dipshit has a handgun but inexplicably charges straight at someone with a shotgun, asking to be blown to bits. This show is the absolute embodiment of \"mindless action.\" \\n\\n\r\nIt's these inexcusable plot conveniences that completely destroy the immersion for me. I overlooked them at first but as they piled up higher than the tower of steaming bullshit that is certain story arcs, I began to lose my patience.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to say, though: cool dialogue. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are entertaining to watch. They're edgy, cool, and hard-boiled. Some of them even has decent backstories. They know what they're doing and has some rock-hard balls, which cannot be said for a shit ton of other anime characters. The action is what you come to see, but the characters is what has you staying.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFor Madhouse, I thought this was a pretty mediocre production. The recoil on the guns feels weak and underwhelming. The gunfights just do not have the weight and oomph. Dead bodies don't get blown backwards like they should,\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing special. Btw, WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB NOT THE JAPANESE SUB LOL. IT\"LL BLOW YOU AWAY.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n6/10 at least you can turn your brain off and decently enjoy this and not have a fucking stroke i.e Guilty Crown\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6/10 As Revy would say, \"Fuck this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nIt's kinda funny how an anime that an anime that mainly relies on action can actually be a very entertaining and enjoyable anime.\r\nThe story begins with Rokurou Okajima AKA Rock who gets captured by a group of pirates called black Lagoon, but when he discovers he was just a bargaining chip he decides to join the pirate crew and carry out their mischievous deeds.\r\nI was actually surprised that there wasn't a straight story mostly because it was really just about the crew of Black Lagoon doing some odd end jobs while also encountering weird complications like Neo-Nazi's or a Maid that could bemistaken for a Terminator she's that strong, but it was really fun to watch the continuous action along with the banter between the members of Black Lagoon actually made this into a really well done show, there is actually some development between the characters as there are moments between the action and shooting where some of the members get into a personal situation like Rock and Revy who had a talk on a Nazi submarine that ended up with Rock hitting a nerve in Revy and seeing them close this problem was absolutely badass.\\n\r\nYou also find out how dirty life is in the pirate business because there are some situations that were big even for the Lagoon crew who had to handle complex situations like when they were transporting Garcia Lovelace who had a badass maid to protect him which obviously got out of hand for the group or the multiple times they get betrayed by other pirates.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were actually really enjoyable and were good fun despite being people who didn't really have the best of lives.\\n\r\nRevy the main female character is a psychotic, merciless and sadistic killer who really doesn't give much of damn about anyone apart from her next paycheck and her two M92S Pistol's, she can be a fun person though once you get to know her and don't piss her off, but there are moments where she truly goes out of control and kills anyone in her way.\\n\r\nRock is the Main male character of the show and despite being a noob at the pirate business and lacking backbone at the beginning he really does become a much stronger and badass character by the end of the show because there are moments where he outsmarts the enemy either using superior tactics or by using his diplomatic skills of talking which is what surprisingly saves his ass when he confronted Revy about their working relationship.\\n\r\nDutch is the leader of the Lagoon and unlike Revy he helps Rock get accustomed to the group and has a very calm nature, but that doesn't mean he's a softy, he will go out of his way to make sure his crew survives by any means necessary which includes in the action himself with either his trusty Revolver or Shotgun.\\n\r\nBenny is the technical guy of the group and he actually doesn't really do a lot in the show other than background support so hopefully he gets better treatment in the next couple of seasons.\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters were well done too like Roberta an ex-guerrilla soldier who became a maid to Garcia Lovelace who is a goddamn badass with her almost Terminator like ferocity which even gave Revy a run for her money and there was also Miss Balalaika who is in charge of the Russian mafia, although she isn't around much she looks like someone who shouldn't be messed and if Revy and Roberta don't mess with her then she most definitely should be feared.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was familiar reminding me a little of Death Note which isn't a surprise since this was made by Madhouse, but the explosions, the shootouts and even the chase scenes were done very well, it was pretty gorey with the amount of gun shoots enemies would take before dying and there were a few moments where some people got knocked the hell up like the fist fight Revy and Roberta had to prove who was better.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is the main part of this show and it was done incredibly well, even though this was what the show relied on to keep going along with the interactions between the characters it never got tiresome and it was always great seeing Revy kick ass against opponents that didn't stand a chance against her, there are other characters though who add to awesomeness of the action too like Roberta who just rinsed her enemies to shreds with her cool weapons like the Umbrella shotgun and the Briefcase MG, but she also had amazing strength to go with that which made her the perfect killing machine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very fun anime and shows you don't even need a story to make your show entertaining, hopefully the next seasons are just as good and if someone out there loves action and women kicking major ass then this is certainly the place to be.",

            "content": "This will be a review of all three parts of the series for simplicity's sake. Video review here: https://youtu.be/DS0V83HPIu4\r\nBlack Lagoon first saw the light of day as a manga released in 2002. The series went on hiatus in 2010, but was brought back in spring of this year, so what better time to do a retroactive three-part review, amirite?\r\nThe anime debuted in the spring season of 2006 and the story starts off with our \u201cmain\u201d character, a painfully bland salaryman named Rokuro Okajima, referred to simply as \u201cRock\u201d for the duration of the show\u2019s run, being abducted while on a business trip by the LagoonCompany, a group of mercenary pirates operating the South Pacific. When Rock\u2019s corporate office finds out about this, they leave him for dead and he takes the opportunity to chunk his old life and throw in with the Lagoon Company in possibly the cuckiest, passive aggressive way possible. Wizz-bang-shooty-fun ensues.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Lagoon Company consists of Revy, the hot headed Chinese-American gun slinger, Dutch, the cool, calm, and collected African-American Vietnam veteran who acts as the CEO of the outfit, Benny, a Jewish American from Florida who is essentially the brains of the operation and seems eerily at-peace with all carnage and killing going on all the time, and the ever trusty Black Lagoon the team\u2019s World War 2 era torpedo boat that is not only their home-away-from home, but their biggest weapon and asset. With so many Americans in the cast it should come as no surprise that there is indeed a dub and it is superb, being one of only half a dozen dubs that I think you\u2019re missing out if you never get around to hearing them. (Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Dragonball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Black Lagoon, and Samurai Champloo).\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Lagoon Company operates as a sort dysfunctional family; in particular Rock and Revy are constantly at one another\u2019s throats as Revy is charged by Dutch to protect Rock and make sure he doesn\u2019t stumble into any trouble, which is easy to do in their home base in the lawless city of Roanapur. Although you see this adversarial relationship between the four slowly growing on all of them. They\u2019re all assholse to one another, but they all seem to think deep down yeah but they\u2019re my group of assholes. This show is really good at making you fall for characters that are by all measures total dicks.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd while I\u2019m in the process of mentioning the location from which most of the events unfold from, I\u2019d like to say this: The strongest character in the entire show is the city of Roanapur itself. You get a great sense of personality right as soon as you see the place. Rocka and the others are driving across the bridge into the city in Benny\u2019s pink Pontiac GTO and you just see old nooses littering the bridge; like someone hung a bunch of people there at one point and took the bodies down but didn\u2019t bothered to remove the nooses themselves. That\u2019s Roanapur: a city aware enough to remove the corpses from the streets, but not acclimated enough to normalcy to think to sweep up the bullet casings as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Black Lagoon introduces a litany of important and colorful side-characters, and their motivations over a well paced amount of time, but it\u2019s lacking in depth. You don\u2019t seem to get a strong sense of each character\u2019s place in the world or how they view themselves at least not in this first season anyway. However, in the Eagle Hunting arc (Episodes 4-6) you do get this really deep introspective monologue by Revy while she and Rock are picking through a sunken Nazi sub, as well as another great piece of prose in a flashback where the original Kriegsmarine officer questions the whole point of the war with a radical SS officer. These two moments were possibly the strongest of the entire first season, and there\u2019s even more moments like this in the Second Barrage and Roberta\u2019s Blood Trail, but that\u2019s not what most people praise the show for. \\n\\n\r\n\tMost people seem to ignore this philosophical and existential aspect of the show in favor of all the shooty-fun-stuff and the gun porn, and don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s good reason too; it\u2019s all top notch, but to see this show often written off as the aforementioned \u201cWizz-bang-shooty-fun\u201d is doing it a massive disservice. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe first season starts to wind down with the Maid to Kill arc, and in this one you may need to brush up on your geo-politics a bit; we start getting into South American politics, the many drug wars going on there and even the communist group FARC get\u2019s involved. Now me, I fucking love geo-politics, I keep up with it and know all the history, but the show has a tendency to exposition dump a history lesson every once in a while to set up the back story for a new arc. This can turn some people off, but its right up my alley and I can\u2019t get enough of it.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the Second Barrage, all the aforementioned shortcomings of Black Lagoon melt away and you get a lot of background into the different factions as well as a strong opening arc with the vampire twins and the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moskow. This where this show gets really dark in some places and it\u2019s far from the last time you\u2019ll get a taste of it in the series. There\u2019s some episodic mid-season fuckery going on after that but once we hit the Fujiyama Gansta Paradise arc, we\u2019re not hitting the ground at any point afterwards. At this point we start to see Rock go down a disturbing path were he doesn\u2019t seem to be trying to fix these problems he sees in the events unfolding before them, but just trying to exert some kind of control over them; almost like he just wants the power to manipulate things to his will. And this reaches its logical extreme when we set out on our third and final leg of this triple play: The five-part OVA series Roberta\u2019s Blood Trail.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe family from the Maid to Kill arc is back and things have gone tits-up back home in Columbia. Vowing revenge for her master\u2019s death, Roberta\u2019s on a full-blown suicide mission to take down the elite CIA team that murdered her master. Hotel Moskow gets involved trying to settle a decade old grudge against the United States, Chang and the Triad try to settle everything down, and all while our once quiet bashful Rock seeks to manipulate every single event from the shadows and play each side off the other. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the strongest of the three sections of Black Lagoon and it\u2019s likely because it focuses on just one arc. There\u2019s no bullshit. No filler. Just an intricately detailed story with interesting characters all with their own conflicting emotions and motivations. If this arc doesn\u2019t strike you with at least something then I think it\u2019s safe to say that you just don\u2019t have a pulse.\\n\\n\r\n\tUltimately, about Black Lagoon as a whole I would have to say everyone needs to give it a shot. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of niche with its crime/drama action-oriented story, filthy language, gun porn, and dark ominous existentialist philosophy flying around, but it has so many different facets to it that I think most viewers will find something here that they like or outright love. I might even go so far as to call it a cult classic and with the manga now ongoing again, hopefully we haven\u2019t seen the last of this brilliant series that holds nothing back.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon is the template for a great action anime. I love this show, and with good reason. You won't very many other anime that can go up against Black Lagoon when it comes down to the rule of cool. So let's break down just what makes this show so amazing, and why you should watch it.\r\n(This review contains my full thoughts for the entire series)\r\nSTORY\r\nI often call Black Lagoon the modern Cowboy Bebop, and with good reason. These two shows may not appear similar on the surface, but when you look closer, the similarities  begin to emerge. The premise is of a fourman crew of colorful characters, on a ship, taking random jobs for other colorful characters. Unlike Cowboy Bebop, the episodic nature of Black Lagoon's story has more time devoted to each arc. \\n\\n\r\nEach arc lasts between 4-6 episodes, and are all interconnected to make one overarching narrative. Some arcs are better than others, but each and every one is, at the very least, a blast to watch. I especially like the arc involving the Neo-Nazis and the U-boat salvage. The vampire twins arc in the second arc is also a blast, with a surprisingly chilling atmosphere surrounding the Twins themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to say is that it seems to me that many people tend to overlook how intelligent Black Lagoon really is. When I first heard about Black Lagoon, most people dismissed it as just aneed action series with little else to offer. I find this to be an underestimation of Black Lagoon's cleverness. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon does a great job at portraying a very grounded and cynical world,where no one cares about each other (except for the main character) and we see how the corruption of the criminal underworld affects all those whours come to Roanapur, which is like the most wretched hive of scum and villainy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we see how this corruption affects the MC, who is a man that tries to help others, and see the best in them. And how he slowly also gets corrupted by the seedy streets of the city s that shows no mercy.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, more depth than people give it credit for.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThis is where I think Black Lagoon truly shines. I've only seen a handful of anime with a cast so densely populated with cool and interesting characters. The crew of Black Lagoon consist of Rock, Revy, Dutch, and Benny. \\n\\n\r\nRock, the main character, is at odds with the world he now inhabits. He's very out of place in the city of Roanapur. This is what makes him so fun to watch. A former business man from Japan, Rokuro Okajima was suddenly thrust into a world of drugs, gang violence, and death. Watching him adjust to this brutal new life as a pirate is one of the most interesting aspects of Black Lagoon; but what makes Rock a truly awesome character is how he doesn't wield a gun, yet manages to survive everything thrown at him through pure wit and a silver tongue. He doesn't need a gun, because his words will do more damage in his possession.\\n\\n\r\nRevy is the other main character. An explosive and dangerous woman with a short temper and violent tendancies, Revy is just so badass. I don't have as much to say, but what I will say is that Revy's relationship with Rock is better than some of the best Romance anime I've seen. Her affection for him is VERY subtle and a lot of the information surrounding her true feelings are implied, making her a hard character to figure out.\\n\\n\r\nDutch and Benny are probably the most neglected characters in the entire show, which is a shame, considering that they are just as inTeresa in as Rock and Revy. This is mostly because we know so little about them, yet they are just as fun to watch. Dutch is the cool level-headed leader of the Lagoon Company, and Benny is the computer whiz and Tech guy of the crew. These two characters represent the \"look the other way\" mentality better than a y other character in the series, and since they are the only ones that do this, it has me begging for more of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe roster of supporting characters is equally impressive. Balalaika has got to be one of the coolest and most intimidating mob bosses ever, and I just love her dub voice. Hansel and Gretel are both tragic, and terrifying. Roberta is INTENSE AND UNSTOPPABLE, especially in the OVA. And everyone else is pretty much a stone-cold badass. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse made this anime. So you know this shit be good. The action is beautifully animated, not as beautiful as HOTD, but pretty close. Animation is smooth and pretty, so standard by what we should expect from Studio Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for Black Lagoon  is both grounded and colorful. I very much enjoyed the use of color in this show. Character designs are iconic and gritty. Roberta's made attire is sinister and unassuming, Revy's outfit is iconic and savage (just like her), Balalaika looks amazing in a Red suit, and I cannot imagine her wearing anything else (plus I love women in red).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nDub or Sub? Dub, without a doubt, the dub is better. I simply cannot envision these characters being voiced by any other cast. Not to mention that it fits more with the setting, and has better dialogue (btw the dialogue is very well written). Though admittedly, I prefer the Japanese performance of Revy.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is GODLY. It fits well with Revy's character, and the song is just great. The remixed version used for the OVA was also really awesome. The Black Lagoon opening is one of my favorites, and I find myself listening to it every time I watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also great, if a little short. One track in particular, Don't Look Behind, perfectly embodies the dark nature of Black Lagoon. The World of Midnight track is also worth kentioning, as it is basically the theme song of the vampire twins, and is thus already awesome based off of that fact alone.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION\\n\r\nIronically, in an action show, the action is the least interesting topic. Everything else is just a juicier topic. Black Lagoon is a fun, badass show with great characters, a very entertaining story, clever writing, and dialogue just as witty as Rokuro Okajima himself. \\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 9/10. With a definite recommendation. WATCH THIS SERIES. WATCH IT NOW. DO IT! You do yourself a disservice if you don't.",

But aside from that I enjoyed this show. \r\nIt's funny and ridiculous. The characters are likeable and strays away from those horseshit tropes in almost all action anime that makes you consider suicide. To my surprise and relief, Revy is not a 1 dimensional moe blob that drops her spaghetti when faced with a braindead protagonist (who is also not braindead or shitty like you'd expect in shounen garbage). \r\ngood show. Liked the second half even more. Character development takes off and more zany sidecharacters are introduced.",

            "content": "This review will cover my thoughts on all three seasons of Black Lagoon\r\nIf I had to describe Black Lagoon in one word it would be FUN . This anime takes every stereotype from American action movies from 30 years ago and hits out of the park . You will find references from Terminator to Die Hard and even Metal Gear Solid \r\nThe action is awesome with colorful and varied characters with different motivations and backstories \r\nThe plot is fairly simple an ordinary guy called \"Rock\" by a twist of fate gets involved with a group of pirates called the Black Lagoon . Together they takeon various jobs from clients and every 2-3 episodes we get a new arc\\n\\n\r\nInitially the show sometimes had this disjointed feeling and it took me a while to see where they where going with the overall plot . Basically without spoiling it it's about how bad experiences make you into a villain and the dilemma of either caring too much for the world and getting hurt or not care at all and feel like a monster something that Rock struggles with through out the seasons \\n\r\nIf you read between the lines it's actually a very thought provoking story and I loved Revy's character progression\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise it's good but nothing will amaze you and when it comes to music it has a few really good tracks with my personal favourite being the ending melody \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few problems I have with the plot and how much you have to suspend your disbelief as the show goes on especially in Roberta's Blood Trails which was the weakest entry in my opinion lacking a lot of backstory that was present in the books and also having an incredibly awkard and creepy romance\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think if you enjoy action movies , video games and even a little bit of psychological horror you will enjoy Black Lagoon :)",

I mean it, no one kicks more ass then she does. Shes one of the reasons I love Black Lagoon so much. \r\nOkajima Rokuro is a businessmen who is constantly kicked around by his bosses. Rokuro really has no spine and at first, it threw me off a bit. One day his company sends him to the beautiful tropic seas of eastern China were he must deliver a disk. It gets worse for Rokuro when his boat getshijacked by a group of mercenaries, and becomes their hostage while the group try and discover whats on the disk. The group dubbed Rokuro, Rock, and with his new group of kidnappers, Rock and co. try to find out what is on the mysterious disk. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is a good anime that looks great. I love the animation, it reminds me of the old school anime like Bebop and Outlaw Star. And thankfully, Rock grows on me, going from being a mediocre character, to probably the second best next to Revy. There are a lot of great action scenes, good looking fights and explosions. But what made it just a good anime, and not a great one was the lack of story. The fights and explosions covered up what was a weak story that ended in a dud. By the time Revy was done kicking every body's butt, and the team where done wiping out every opponent that stood in their way, when the story was resolved, I just didn't care. And when you got a lot of action and very little plot, it may make the anime look good, but it doesn't make it good.",

It is gritty and hard hitting and once you are into it you cant get out much like every good anime, i only gave the story a 6 because of the ending, in my opinion not the best. But the characters are very unique and even i struggle to find any similar ones in such a large anime world. It has quite a few mature themes through out the anime, and this is the main reason it stuck to me. The awe, the amazement you feel, and the depth of the story, charactersand anime as a whole all contribute to the outcome of an extremely good anime. Its also short SO WATCH IT",

Do not look here for plot and purpose... the epidodes wander at random and have little cohesive theme.  However, the character development is superb, and the dark, brutal world that the series paints is exciting and engaging.\r\nThe series focuses around Revi \"two-hand\", the gun-happy assassin-girl of the gang.  She takes a young buisnessman (nicknamed Rock) on board the Black Lagoon as a hostage and he ends up joining the rag-tag crew when his company betrays him.  Rock tellsthe story of his life on the run with the stern and calm captain &quot;Dutch&quot;, the lanky and careless technician &quot;Benny Boy&quot; and, most importantly, his struggle to win the friendship of bitter and violent Revi.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the main characters seem heartless and cruel, you can't help but become attached.  The interplay between Revi and Rock is brilliant and not sappy.  However, the series would have been much improved if it had been given more direction and plot.  Interesting characters like Balalika (the russian mob-boss) float in and out of the story with little consequence.  Althogether, the show left me a little unsatisfied at the end and I was eager to check out the &quot;second barrage.&quot;  Unfortunately, the second season was even more  plotless than the first.",

            "content": "A few years ago I took a break from watching anime, I guess I just got tired of all the similar stuff and felt like there was nothing new. About 2 years passed and I  saw a video review about a show called Black Lagoon, and I am so happy that I found it. \r\nI will try not to include any spoilers in this review it will cover seasons 1,2 and the OVA.\r\nStory: Normally action anime have a very similar story and are pretty relatable, however when it came to Black Lagoon it was nothing extraordinary but the way the story flowed really workedfor me. Some anime series start of slow, very slow, but in this case I got hooked in right from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is nothing special compared to today's anime series, but for the series age it stands up fairly well.  When the show wants to look well it does a ******* good job at it, and I am truly grateful for all of the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think you should just listen to the opening of the show and you can judge for yourself as sound is a very subjective category. The gun shot sounds gave a real bang and it stood out. I would also like to thank Maryke Hendrikse for her role as Revy, her performance will always be one of my favourites, hands down. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Revy is one of my favourtie characters of all time, hands down. I was getting tried of the cliche female character that depends on others and then busted in Revy. She is not afraid to do anything and is a total ******. The number one thing I liked about her is her character development, the show really gives you something to understand her and where she is coming from. Rock is another character I really enjoyed. I found him to be really relatable aswell, however I was not a big fan of him towards the end of the second season. However I think Rock and Revy are one of the best duo's in anime. Almost every other character in Black Lagoon is a total ******, nothing else to say. Just watch the show to see how awesome they are.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: About 2 years have passed since I have seen Black Lagoon and I thought it was my favourtie  anime, and it still is. Nothing I have seen since has made me feel the same way about Black Lagoon. \\n\\n\r\nIf you just watch Black Lagoon for its action and straight in your face pacing, you will enjoy the show. *But* if you watch the show and pay attention to the character development and the story you will *truly* love this anime.",

I get the tone they're trying to set but ffs you would think that a character would come in and say: \"Sorry i don't smoke.\" or something xD. Anyway I don't want that question to make you believe I didn't love this series.\r\nStory(8)\r\nThe story isn't all that great, but the overall tone of it is what made it so good. The gritty and realistic feel is somewhat refreshing. The story follows Rokuro Okajima or later known as \"Rock\", who was once a business man in Japanuntil his boss left him to die when he was kidnapped. That's when he befriended Dutch (captain), Revy (badass female), and Benny (hacker/computer mech.). They go on adventures together and work together as mercenaries.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound(8)\\n\r\nThe Art for its time is actually good, and the sound is really good too. Great for the intense moments in this anime.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters(9)\\n\r\n\"Rock\" is our main protagonist, but will sometimes come off as a bit whiny. However i overlook this because he has epic moments where he'll think with his brain and come up with some kind of strategy to get him and his friends out of sticky situations. Down the road you learn he's basically your average white collar worker who does what he wants to do when given the chance.\\n\r\n\"Revy\" or Rebecca is the main female protagonist, and my favorite character. She's harsh, and brash but you know her intentions for her actions. She's the main gunfighter, and is known as \"Two Hands\" for her abilities with dual wield pistols. This makes her the ultimate badass simply cause she gives 0 fucks whatsoever.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is thrown to the side later in the season. Mainly for relationship progression between these 2. You can tell Revy starts to actually care for our MC, so much that she was willing to turn around and save him when he was captured.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)\\n\r\nThis anime is just so enjoyable, the characters are great and the mc can be relatable. Although if i were kidnapped by pirate mercenaries, I have no idea how i'd react xD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9)\\n\r\nThis is a definite watch, and I would say you are missing out if you haven't watched it yet. But this anime is dark and has some very real themes. So take this show with a grain of salt when deciding to watch it.",

Not a whole lot of anime caught my attention at the time and i was fearing that i was losing my manliness by watching too much og cute girls doing coute thing while being cute, but then i found this gem. I might not be the best or the most prestigeous of anime, but i LOVED EVERY SECOND.\r\nThe mix of violence, madness and just pure fun you get to see in this anime is amazing. That dosent mean that it dosent go easy on you with the hardhitting stuff. That it does too.\r\nThe characters arent too special, but some are standouts.Revy (the one you see in all the fanart basically) is crazy enough that you dont know if shes joking or not, but stil has a little soft spot for our protagonist, Rokuro, or as you get to know him, Rock. He is a mildmannered japanese workerbee, whos abandoned by his company in the South China Sea. He isent a badass or a gunslinger, but you get to see the city of Roranapur and the people in it through the eyes of a somewhat innocent person. The 2 other crewmembers, Benny and Dutch are nothing more that a few lines and very little character. \\n\\n\r\nThe best characters are definantly the best part. I wont tell too much because that would ruin the fun and surprises. Lets just say that during the 2 seasons (and ovas) of this show you will come to fear maids, russians, small children, high irishmen and a taiwanese woman with a racist accent.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of the few were i recommend the dub. Its simply do to the fact that there is only 1 japanese person for 90% of the screentime. Then it makes a bit more sense that all the foreigners know english and not japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an explosive, cursing, violent, a little disturbed, but hillarious rollercoaster of fun. Just dont watch it with parents or anyone that might be easily offended. There is a reason for that 18+ rating ;)",

            "content": "A japanese businessman named rock gets captured by the mercenary group called Black Lagoon. Tired of his mundane corporate life, Rock sticks with the lagoon company becoming a part  of their gang. Have you ever watched any action films like Die Hard, The Matrix, or erminator 2: Judgement Day? Well this great anime series is like those films. There's a lot of guns and action.  I never really like rewatching anime but Black Lagoon is the only series I rewatch from time to time. There's just so much action in every episode, you'll never get bored. \r\nThe story is good enough. It's ananime that focuses on a lot of action so don't expect the story to be amazing like Evangelion and Berserk. The art is quality! I love realism in anime so the art in Black Lagoon is a big win for me. The sound is point. I prefer the dub because the voice actors do a better job in my opinion. One of the characters is russian, right? Why would a russian speak Japanese. It would make more sense to watch the dub because most of the characters speak english except for the yakuza. As for characters, there's plenty of interesting characters in this show. My favourite character is Revy who does most of the fighting for Black Lagoon. She dual wields two pistols in battle and has a fiery personality. She would eat Erza Scarlet for breakfast, trust me. Overall if you love guns and action, this show is for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Best Review:  8.5/10   Worst Review: 7/10   Average Review: 7.75/10\r\nThis was an awesome anime that really had some class to it.\r\nTo start off, I'd like to say that there really isn't much of a story to it. I guess there's the beginning of how The main character Okajima Rokuro later nicknamed Rock, joins the group Black Lagoon, but that's as much of a story as there is to it. It doesn't have any one thing about it to make it a complete story. It's more of just random missions and run of the mill jobs that the company Black Lagoon takeson. It's one of those types of stories that can go in just about any direction depending on the random missions. Although there isn't a preset story, it doesn't really need one in order to make an enjoyable anime. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters. I find that the characters are really unique and individualistic. You have the big black dude, Dutch, who acts as the boss in the group; he's often serious about his work but he can also be a pretty cool relaxing guy. Then you have the crazy physco chick, Revy, in the group that is hot-headed and is more of the type of person to talk with her guns rather than with words. She definitely has a few screws loose as you'll find out later on, but though she acts tough and crude, she really grows on you after a while. Then there is also Benny, who is the computer nerd of the group. He doesn't really do much action wise, he's more of the guy who acts as support for the group. He does his computer stuff and fixes things and what not. He's the most normal person in the group aside from Rock. Lastly, there is Rock, just a regular Japanese business guy who unfortunately got mixed in with the wrong crowd. He doesn't really do much in the group either, he's more of support for Revy than anything else. He also isn't bad with plans and negotiations  at times. He also has a wide variety of knowledge that comes in handy. It would be nice if he had more of an action role, but I suppose he's fine without it as well. He would also make a good romantic interest for Revy as she is often influenced by him. but as a matter of fact, that hasn't quite happened in this first season. still I would keep an open mind with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all fascinating and each have their own story as you figure out along the way. Revy has had a tough blood stained life since childhood, Benny got caught up in it as he was just a normal guy like Rock. Rock was just an average dispensable guy in his company who took a lot of shit from his superiors until he joined Black Lagoon. And so far, we haven't learned much about Dutch yet, but maybe we will in the second season. You also meet some other interesting side characters along the way like Balalaika, the boss of Hotel Moscow, Bao, the bar tender who constantly has his shop destroyed, Roberta, the crazy terminator like maid who is nearly invincible, and many more. \\n\\n\r\nThis has a lot of action and blood in it. It's pretty hardcore, I feel like it really nailed the sense of realism and intensity of real life crime. It's pretty exciting and interesting to watch, the senseless violence just adds to the awesomeness as well.\\n\\n\r\nThough it also has it's faults as some of the characters appear to be invincible at times. Certainly not realistic by and stretch of imagination. The way the characters always dominate without ever getting seriously injured or killed and so on. That one terminator like maid who I swear is the terminator as she is way to overpowered. though it can be unrealistic, it's an anime, so what do you expect? No anime ever has perfect realism in it.\\n\\n\r\nwith everything said, this is definitely an anime to check out if your into this type of genre. I certainly didn't think much of it at first but trust me you will get hooked after a few episodes. I certainly did. It's worth the watch, so give it a chance.",

            "content": "I first found out about this one when they aired it on Toonami a few years ago. I thought it looked pretty interesting, so I checked it out. I got hooked from the first episode. Usually when someone tells a story about pirates and the criminal underbelly of society, they set it back in the Golden Age, back in the 1700s, like your Pirates of the Carribean or Assassin's Creed: Black Flags of the world. Very rarely do I see such a thing set in a more contemporary setting.\r\nAs you could guess with the story, the series itself is pretty gritty, with constant gunfights andcluster F-bombings. Some would say it detracts from the appeal, but I think it enhances the tone of the series, especially with how the voice acting is delivered.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that DEFINITELY set this one above and beyond for me was the abundance of classic Detroit iron, which is pretty hard to find in anime. Glancing at the IMCDB page for this series, I see a Jeep Grand Cherokee, a Pontiac Tempest, a Chrysler New Yorker, a Tri-Five Bel Air, even a Plymouth Road Runner! The car guy in me really got a kick out of that!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's a pretty standard-grade action series with a ton of automotive awesomeness thrown in for good measure.",

Black Lagoon comes at you fast, but once you blink the flash blinding explosions out of your vision, it can bring you some serious food for thought too. Good, evil, and the nature of both are examined in detail and there's plenty of action courtesy of devil may care Revy to keep the pace up. This blend of philosophy and serious drama with action movie fun is intoxicating. The sound is gorgeous, music,voice acting. Hell this is one of the few animes where I think the English dub is the definitive one! (Yeah I went there, come at me. They're all supposed to be speaking English any way. Lagoon Company is three Americans and a Japanese salariman ffs.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep going. I could go into exhaustive detail. I love this series.

            "content": "The world is cruel, unforgiving and unfair...\r\nBlack Lagoon is an anime that lives up to it's name of high octane thriller whilst looking at the morality and virtues of humans by looking at the darkest, crime-riddled sectors of the world where our main protagonists resides.......Roanapur, Thailand.\r\nBlack Lagoon's plot format for the most part are isolated jobs the Lagoon Company goes through besides the first few episodes that focuses on the Rokurou \"Rock\" Okajima voiced by Daisuke Namikawa and how he became a part of the Lagoon Co. Each of the villains of this first season is \"diverse\" for the most part though they go toextremes mainly due to Revy, the gun totting madwoman of Lagoon Company only wanting to finish the mission at any cost, and other third parties pushing either the villains themselves or pushing a mission onto Lagoon Company and getting them involved with the villains of each arc. There are two villains however that get a bit of sympathy, those being Roberta voiced by Michie Tomizawa, a mercenary maid looking for her master who is very similar to Revy in many ways but becomes friendly rivals to her, more rivals than friendly, the other being Masahiro Takenaka voiced by Katsuhiko Sasaki an extremist only due to society pushing him to the brink. However for the rest of the rogue gallery the Lagoon Company faces off, they are stock evil but crazy at that considering what part of the world this anime takes place in and what jobs they go through, that's ok as it makes for great relief once these scummy villains meet their demise.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the Lagoon Company themselves?. Revy is LA's favourite character mainly because of her badassery (of course), however her lack of morality and her horrible upbringing does cause friction to Rock as Rock was having a normal life before getting recruited into Lagoon Company and wants to help innocent people who are in the firing line and sympathize with the villains at times but also succeed in their mission at the same time. They are complete opposites and oddly enough it makes for a dysfunctional relationship between the two. Dutch voiced by Tsutomu Isobe the leader of Lagoon Company has his past comes to haunt him but overall tries to keep Revy in check and usually takes contracts through Balalaika voiced by Mami Koyama, one of the more powerful characters in the anime right next to Roberta and Revy, Benny voiced by Hiroaki Hirata, Lagoon's mechanic and computer specialist, he probably has the least development in the group. LA presumes as much as Black Lagoon's plot forces the characters to act, it's not so much a bad thing as the characters and their interactions with one another are the most interesting things in this anime as much as the plot forces them, we get batshit crazy gun totting thrilling action laced with deep morality issues, makes sense to LA.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Madhouse still stands out to this day, even when this anime was released in 2006, the action is amazingly fluid and addrenalined fueled and wholesale destruction. Character designs are very distinct and exotic, Revy being an obvious example and the beautiful and intentionally depressing backgrounds and differing locales makes the animation stand out even further but yeah the animation lies in the thrilling action scenes which gets more insane as the episodes goes along. Madhouse outdid themselves and is expected Madhouse quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great as well from Megumi Toyoguchi doing a great brash, no fucks given character roles and some decent English laced inbetween, Mami Koyama and Michie Tomizawa did brilliantly in voicing charismatic badass (and that's saying something Roberta's voice actor!). As for the differing accents considering that the majority of characters aren't Japanese, LA gets at the time Black Lagoon was released, finding different voice actor who are fluent in English, Irish, Taiwanese or Deutsch would be extremely hard to find thus LA gets the awkward accenting done with some of the characters the best example being Shenhua voiced by Youko Sasaki. LA's favourite voice actor?...Megumi Toyoguchi of course bar none.\\n\\n\r\nThis being is a creation by Rei Hirose who loves Western media and Black Lagoon shows it in spades, from characters quoting American movies and pop culture and prominent figures in America, the name dropping in this anime is amazing and many of it isn't just for a name drop as many of shoutouts to American pop culture and movies makes sense to the context. It might be annoying at times but LA quite enjoyed it, it gave not only the characters personality but gave the anime itself it's own solid personality by paying homage to Western media.\\n\\n\r\nLA definitely understands Black Lagoon's fame and popularity and LA merely had a taste of it with this first season, sure this first season's finale ended on a vague note but LA kinda understands this due to the isolated job plot format this season had and again LA gets this. Black Lagoon is an amazing thrill ride of destruction, deep introspective of human morality without it being preachy about it and through that are able to develop it's mysterious main characters of Lagoon Co. through the odd jobs they go through.",

            "content": "Roanapur City, the home of the Lagoon Company, holds mercenaries, organised crime and some of the worst that humanity has to offer.The story begins in the 1990's, as the Lagoon Company cheats, fights, and steals it's way to complete each new and unique jobs. \r\nThe Lagoon Company is a mercenary crew, that occasionally does odd jobs for some of the mobs within the city. Though their outfit isn't very large, it still boasts some of the most formidable odds for anyone to go up against. The crew is made up of a computer specialist (Benny), a Japanese businessman turned negotiator (Rock), their fearless leader(Dutch), and the blood thirsty gun hand (Revy). \\n\r\nHumanity's dark side becomes vivid, in this action packed thrill ride that will keep any fan of shootouts, explosions and almost any other type of violence imaginable on the edge of their seat. \\n\r\nThe diverse nationality of those who dwell in Roanapur add a great deal of intrigue to an otherwise depressing way of life for the series' anti-heroes. The sunny beaches, the beautiful oceans, and the rest of the tropical scenery is masterfully contrasted by the people who thrive in one of the darkest corners of our earth. \\n\r\nThe voice acting for the characters themselves are very all too believable. They add more realism to an almost unbelievable world, that is all too real for many people in our world today. You really get a good feel for what they are feeling, or thinking at any given moment. \\n\r\nThe artwork, and design very much reminded me of Death Note. With it's similar dark times and  human moments. The art in my opinion captures the personalities of the characters almost as well as the voice acting in what they are feeling. Even without words, the art could tell you all about the hard life that the characters experience, and what makes them who they are. \\n\r\nThe thing that I enjoyed about this anime the most was the different view point of the characters as opposed to many other main characters of other anime. The fact that there is no real protagonist, just a collection of anti-heroes intrigued me. \\n\r\nMany anime I have seen don't have characters that are even remotely that sour toward the world or life itself. Some characters have become desensitized to the corruption or have even become a part of it. Where as most main characters don't go to that place, ever. \\n\r\nThis anime's sheer contrast to the rest of the anime world drew me in, but what kept me involved was the character development and the plot that never stops.",

However, his boat is hijacked by a \"delivery company\" for the criminal world called Black Lagoon and Rokuro is kidnapped with the disk for his potential ransom value. Unfortunately for Rokuro he is told by his superiors to throw himself in to the sea to cover up his company's shady and illegal business deal. With nowhere else to go Rokuro is invited to join Black Lagoon by its sympathetic employees and nicknamed Rock.\r\nBlack Lagoon is an extremely violent and wildride. The story is fairly episodic and basically involves Black Lagoon dealing with complications caused by Nazis, gun toting, drug smuggling Nuns, a killer maid and terrorists when on a job. It could have been just a violent bloodfest if it wasn't for the great characters and script backed a great sound track.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as Rock Black Lagoon is a tight knit motley crew of individuals. Dutch a muscle bound Vietnam veteran, Benny an electronics expert and Revy a merciless and sadistic killer. Although the show follows Rock, it is Revy who takes centre stage and is played with relish by Toyoguchi Megumi. It is Revy whose character is developed the most. She is very short tempered who sometimes has to be held back from needlessly killing people and is overly keen to use her guns, however, at unguarded moments is shown to be some what insecure and unhappy at the hand life has dealt her and puts this in to expression with \"the world won't stop turning just because theirs no justice\" a view as a consequence of childhood spent growing up in the gutter surrounded by violence.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give a special mention to some of the badass oneliners which include:\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to weld your ass shut and open a new one in your head!\\n\\n\r\nRemember to pray so you know what god to go to!\\n\\n\r\nDo you want me to show you how to smoke through your head!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the animation which, although competent, doesn't live up to the high standards of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nBadass is a common description for Black Lagoon.

You have a bitchy supposed master gun shooter woman and a wimpy shit and tie kinda guy.

            "content": "In this review I will be covering Black Lagoon and Second Barrage as a whole.\r\nSince the two seasons conjoin so well I see no point in writing a separate review. However, nothing regarding Roberta's Blood Trail will be brought up here.\r\nBlack Lagoon is a seinen joy-ride that never seems to end, not like you'd want it to.\r\n~Story / Characters / Sub or Dub(?)~ \r\nBlack Lagoon's plot really stands out, a 'delivery company' who's missions tend to lead to a lot of action in a sort of Micheal Bay manner. The Lagoon Company will deliver anything, so everything's on the table.  The build up ofthe plot is extremely important and I really enjoyed how the road ahead progressed. I love how we are introduced to new characters and then flipped on our side to realize that perhaps these people aren't really on our side, but rather, have different goals. Season one takes a look at and molds the show into what it is: an ex-Japanese business-man left for dead by his employer whom winds up in the hands of the Lagoon Company. He ends up confronting his boss and tells him he's 'already dead' so he might as well join the Lagoon Company. This is the start of the show, and we already know it's going to be one hell of a ride, nothing that Die Hard could live up to. The first season establishes who are cast is and the premise of the show, however, in Second Barrage this all changes. In Second Barrage the show takes a turn for the better and gets darker, more action, and more development of our characters. I feel the second season did the show justice in the highest possible regard. All war breaks out - don't **** with the Russians. \\n\r\nI was told that Black Lagoon had an amazing Dub. I took heed to this and decided to watch the first episode in Japanese to see the original work, then I watched a few episodes in English, then reverted back to the original Japanese. I do not hate the dub, it is very very well done. But there's a bone I have to pick concerning it. Maryke Hendrikse does a good job captivating the audience during the Dub when she voices Revy, however, Revy in the dub tends to come off as whiny. In the Sub Toyoguchi Megumi's voice almost rings with the dark experience in which Revy has. I could relate to her version of Revy way more. Also, in regard to Second Barrage's English scenes during the Sub, honestly they're not bad. I found it quite comical, and this I think was the intent of the 'Engrish'.\\n\\n\r\n~Art / Sound~\\n\r\nThe animation in Black Lagoon is stunning, that's it. You can't really bicker about the art.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is ridiculously amazing. When that opening starts, (Red Fraction - Mell) Jesus Christ. It's an amazing introduction to what the show is and sets a tone, putting the show on a pedestal.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of Black Lagoon.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is  ****ing Masterpiece.\\n\r\nIf you're into into eye-candy this show is for you.\\n\r\nBuy the **** out of it.\\n\r\nThen go to Roanapur City, stop by YellowFlag bar and have a drink.\\n\r\nDon't forget your piece.",

            "content": "-Story\r\nA note: This review covers both Black Lagoon and Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage, and the score is a composite of the two series. If I were to rate the two seasons individually, I would most likely give season 1 around a 7.5 and season 2 around a 6.5.\r\nBlack Lagoon looks like a mindless action series. It smells like a mindless action series. However, it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a mindless action series.\r\nTo be sure, Black Lagoon almost certainly has mindless action in it. Minor characters spew streams of automatic fire at the protagonists without so much as scratching them. Buildingsand vehicles explode at the slightest provocation. Villains emerge from flaming wreckage completely unscathed. Without doubt, these scenes are completely brain-dead, but this is not really what Black Lagoon is all about.\\n\r\nIn fact, more than three quarters of the show is reserved for dialogue. One might think that this would slow down an action series, but instead it is easily the best part of the show. Put simply, the show's script sparkles with wit and intelligence. Through an interesting blend of obscure pop culture references, serious philosophical debate and hilarious one-liners, Black Lagoon has some of the best writing of the year.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Black Lagoon is hampered by a disappointing final arc. The ending drowns itself in a seeming avalanche of petty plot details that I didnt really care about, and the things that made the first season so great (the black humor, interesting philosophical discussions, and risqu\u00e9 attitude) are almost completely gone. In particular, a large part of the normally excellent dialogue is carried out in English. While all of the English is grammatically correct, it's hideously voice-acted, almost to the point of being unwatchable.\\n\r\nIn fact, as a whole, the storyline is somewhat uneven. Some of the episodic arcs work well (in particular, the Twins arc at the beginning of the second season is wonderfully creepy), but others either are too ridiculous to really take seriously or get bogged down in unimportant details. Fortunately, as mentioned earlier, the story usually takes a backseat to the dialogue, which is fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the show are serviceable, but certainly not outstanding. Animation-wise, the show looks fine most of the time but seems unsure of itself when it comes to the action scenes. Some scenes literally consist of two characters running in a straight line while shooting at each other, and are somewhat dull to sit through. Still, the character designs and backgrounds are top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems with the sound. For one, the show leads into the ED at the end of every episode. This slow and depressing instrumental piece is often at odds with the frenetic action that has happened right before it, and serves to dampen the mood of the show. Also, the aforementioned switch to spoken English represents a key misstep in my mind. Fortunately, the OP and non-English voice acting are both great, so Black Lagoon's sound isn't a complete failure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe wonderful dialogue serves to create characters that feel much more real than the cookie cutter clich\u00e9s that have come to dominate most of today's action series. Despite the inherent ridiculousness of the setting, all of the characters are believable and likeable. In particular, the two primary protagonists, Rock and Revy, are fantastically well-developed and serve as primary illustrations of the show's theme of moral relativism.\\n\r\nAs a denizen of the \"normal world,\" Rock represents the core moral values of modern Japan. Conflict is wrong, life is sacred, good and evil exist, etc. Then, over the course of the series, his traditional beliefs are challenged again and again and again. These beliefs are most apparent in his conversations with Revy. In the beginning, whether he can help it or not, he judges her. He sees her as a thoughtless, cold-blooded beast, an amoral killer that should be both despised and pitied. However, over the course of several heated arguments, Revy slowly shows him that he cannot judge her, because he has no experience whatsoever in her world. He is an alien, a visitor. He does not live in the \"night\" like the rest of the people of Black Lagoon's accursed city of Roanapur (where even the church is corrupted); he can only peek in through the \"twilight.\" Combined with the characters, this moral \"twilight\" is ultimately what makes the show what it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the show strongly resembles Cowboy Bebop. Both series can superficially be written off for their action or episodic plots, but both have significant and interesting things to say about the outcasts of society. While Black Lagoon fails to match Cowboy Bebop in sheer execution, the anime is certainly a step in the right direction for the otherwise increasingly derivative action genre.",

Also a certain arc where things took a turn into mainstream anime a little too much ( when all the mercenaries showed up with f-ed up powers).\r\n I love Black Lagoon because it isnt like any other anime. It plays by it's own rules and the rules of this show is gunslinging. People shoot eachother, and that's about it. It's completely flabbergastingly awesome firefights. They are good at shooting eachother, but because it is based around humans who diewhen a bullet split their cranium, it feels like it never sails away into a level where it get's out off hand. Which is the cause with almost every anime. If you dont enjoy black lagoon, something is wrong with you. Because it's just so damn good! \\n\\n\r\nYou may find nitpicks here and there and certain episodes you didnt enjoy, I can think off a few, but you forget them, because the rest are way to immersive.

            "content": "Black Lagoon is by far one of the best animes I've seen in a while. It's a perfect blend of action/thriller and heavy drama. Every episode of this series is like a mission split into a number of parts. Well, it's needless to say that black lagoon doesn't focus on a main plot. For example, it's not about saving the world or becoming the greatest gunslinger there ever existed. No, this anime is about a group of mercenaries that take on odd jobs in a city filled with crime, where the weak are punished and the strong still survive. \r\nNone the less, the sets ofstories given, which are most likely another mission, are always epic and give you something to look forward to. However, the lack of a main plot and part by part story telling will set an erratic pace leaving some episodes slow to start. Don't worry though every episode is worth while and the impending action will have you hooked in no time.\\n\r\nThe art and sound blend well in this series. The sometimes hardcore action scenes are well animated and mostly not stiff. The songs accentuate the   various situations the characters are presented. So I found nothing wrong with it. The series was great for the eyes and ears.\\n\r\nNow, the character development is what you should really look out for in BL. This is where the show truly shines gold and glimmering colors. I mean the characters are absolutely fantastic. They are all presented in a way that you want to sympathize for each character. Even if one of those characters  don't make much screen time, you know that he is still a valuable member of this fine act. As I said, each mission device is a part by part episode. Each sheds light on small bits and piece of each characters past, personality, and opinion. Sooner of later you'll want to know more. Revy's history, rocks change for the better or worse, Dutch's eccentricity, and Benny....well just Benny for now. But there is so much to look forward to for the characters in BL.\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment is a 10/10. As you watch this show you'll start to love each and every character that you come across and I assure you it's helluva ride.",

            "content": "Black lagoon was one of the first real anime's I ever watched. Needless to say, I very much enjoyed it, but it's not perfect. Nevertheless, it's a good, solid anime with plenty of humor and tons of action. I like this series regardless of its flaws.\r\nStory: Black lagoon is a crime anime. Crime and illegal activities are its central theme, which to me is an original idea. There are about 4 major chunks to the story and all of them were good, but the main theme of the show is its action, so some of you may feel the story isn't anything special.\r\nArt: The artis very good. Explosions look vibrant, environments are detailed and character designs are excellent. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I didn't very much like the music. The opening theme is epic, but the OST was just lacking in many areas for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is good. My favorite character in the series is definitely Revy, she is absolutely hilarious and completely awesome. However, there are some characters which have little to no development at all such as Benny. I would have loved for him to be a little more central to the story. All in all the characters are good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The action scenes are thrilling to watch. Everything is put together perfectly when action occurs. I also enjoyed the jokes and frequent cursing. They made me laugh on many occasions. I highly enjoyed the action and humor in this series the most.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give black lagoon a solid 7. It's a good anime and I enjoyed it. However, my biggest complaint is that at times it tries to be all dark and edgy. I would have very much preferred if it didn't try to be something it's not in this regard. But it's a good series either way.",

This show has a really dark theme to it which was kinda cool, and some dark humor as well. The action scenes were cool but a little over the top and kind of repetitive. I really enjoyed the setting as well, it was very detailed and immersive, it really takes you away.  Black Lagoon is really easy to follow too! There aren't too many characters and its not like one long story, instead its kind of likea lot of little adventures. Overall I would say it just has a really sad feeling to it, all the characters are just so lost and I kinda felt bad for them. If you are trying to get into anime I would highly recommend this, its only 24 episodes total so not too long. In fact I wish there was more!",

            "content": "Note: this review covers my thoughts on both seasons of Black Lagoon and the OVA Roberta's Blood Trail.\r\nThe best way to describe Black Lagoon is dark and twisted fun. The show can easily swing between an over the top, bloody, violent, and action filled romp and extremely dark, psychological, mature, and a bit horrifying in the best of ways. The two lead characters are both very well developed and have one of the more interesting relationships I have seen in anime in a while. However, there are some side characters that I feel could have used some more development. Shows like this that go backand forth between two very different genres can often feel like they have consistency issues, but Black Lagoon pulls this blend of genres off better than most. The animation is great and the action is bloody and fun. The music is also pretty kick ass and the show has a really cool/interesting setting.\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is an easy recommendation for anybody looking for a darker more mature action series.",

            "content": "NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL !!!! \r\nI'm starting with the verdict and then following up with some of my thoughts on the show. \r\nI didn't particularly like Black Lagoon. I'd rate it lower than 6 but the line art was pleasing to look at and I'm a sucker for good line art. Especially the character designs. Rebecca is so fucking hot and I could watch her shoot people up and cause explosions and stare at her ass and thick thighs all day. Her character design is great and she's awesome. Dutch and Benny seem like likable dudes and I wish hey had more screen time andmore to do in the show. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Lagoon is the kinda show where we have a few main characters and their day to day life has enough shit going on to be made a show out of. Much like Cowboy Bebop or Stand alone complex. Meaning that the show will be, to some extend, episodic.  There is no overarching narrative in this show and that didn't really become a hindrance to my enjoyment. But what did become a hindrance was a lot of other things. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, when you don't have a story to tell with your piece of visual entertainment, you better compensate with something else. For a show like Black Lagoon where the main characters are criminals that undertake illegal and dangerous jobs to put food on their table on a regular basis, the compensation I expected was some adrenaline pumping action and badass characters. And Black Lagoon has these things. However, in order for such a compensation to work, the show needs to focus on it and give it more screen time. And Black Lagoon focused too much on the background details of each of their jobs and some Japanese guy who's tired of his job and some other characters that I don't give a shit about. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, don't fuck around Black Lagoon. Just get to the fucking point instead of trying to give me all the irrelevant background details through boring exposition scenes. The worst part is that, I didn't even get what  all those boring expository dialogues were trying to convey. The exposition is there enough to be boring yet not enough to clarify what's going on. Keep it simple for fuck's sake ! Omit the unnecessary crap ! \\n\\n\r\nAnd the Japanese guy who hates his job. Rock ! What a wimp and waste of screen time. He's just plain boring. He gets all serious and philosophical at times and it's supposed to be deep or some shit. Bleh ! The scenes where he talks to Revy in the submarine and at the restaurant were just cringe worthy and pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nHeart and cheese has no place in a show with a premise like that of Black Lagoon. So characters like the kid who got kidnapped and his lovey dovy maid and rock have no place in it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, the heck was with their last job ? What even was the job ? I don't know. Because fuck me for expecting some clarity in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the dialogues and the personality of these characters work better in an English dub. But the Eng-dub for Black Lagoon is terrible like almost every other Eng-dub. None of them sound natural or cool. And the Japanese voice acting just ain't got the punch it takes to make these characters click. \\n\\n\r\nI hate bad anime. But I especially hate anime that has all the good pieces there, only to then screw up miraculously in ways I would never imagine. Black Lagoon is almost such a show.",

            "content": "Nuns, Nazi\u2019s, soldiers, maids, terrorists, ninjas, this anime truly does have every possible type of antagonist. It\u2019s truly bombastic and doesn\u2019t have much pre-tense of creating a believable World. It isn\u2019t long before we see our cast of heroes go driving up a ramp and flying 80 feet into in the air in a gunboat on a collision course with a Hind D attack helicopter. It goes without saying you shouldn\u2019t be expecting realism. If all of Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s action movies where packed into an anime this would be it. Expect to see platoons worth of soldiers mowed down by little more than our heroineand a couple of handguns all whilst striking poses, and at the same time being shot at and missed hundreds of times from just meters away.\\n\r\nYou should also expect cigarettes to be smoked and liquor drunk with noiristic levels of cinematography. Oh yes and guns galore all shown in fetishistic detail, our heroine\u2019s chromed twin 9mm Beretta\u2019s with ivory grips and skull symbols get a great deal of screen time along with every other weapon and military vehicle imaginable. As for the story well there actually is one being told in between the explosions and one-liners and it centres on the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime only two characters are actually fleshed out, and even they have their backstories from a book of clich\u00e9\u2019s. The two are Rock and Revy. Revy is basically an angstier female version of Arnold Schwarzenegger who tries to solve her internal conflicts through wanton carnage. Her arc revolves around her past as a tough kid growing up on the rough streets being forced into a life of crime and making her own code to live by. Rock gets himself somehow embroiled in a corporate conspiracy when he is sent to deliver a package and is nearly killed in the process before meeting our team of misfit mercenary pirates led by the Morpheus clone; Dutch. Due to Rock\u2019s background as a corporate wage slave he is the subject to Revy\u2019s uncontrollable rage, as Rock loses his humanity by his association with the pirates Revy begins to regain part of hers. As for Dutch well there isn\u2019t much that can be said he is the typical cool bald headed sunglasses wearing, muscled black dude. He acts as a commander says wise things when the plot demands it, and is like an impromptu father figure to Revy at times.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music there are two extremes adrenaline fuelled action riffs and somber melodies.  The soundtracks sets up the gore-filled action sequences and gives our characters a touch of humanity afterwards as they stare angstily into the Ocean whilst cruising on a gunboat at night smoking cigarettes under the moonlight. The voice acting is great, this is one of the few times where I can recommend the dubbed version over the subbed. Rock is the only weak voice here, his emotional range is a lot narrower than it ought to be given the intense situations he often finds himself in. Dutch plays the part of the cool black dude with no range whatsoever. Dutch does get fleshed more in the OVA but not by much.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing this anime is both let down by and excels at is the facial animations. It exceeds with Revy and is let down by everyone else. Revy can steal a scene just by stink-eying someone from the backseat of a car or snarling for the 50th time that episode but the rest of the characters have no memorable expressions to speak of. They simply aren\u2019t as animated as Revy and consequently you forget them pretty much immediately. The lighting and shadowing are a cut above average for a 2006 anime. The backgrounds whilst not poor quality are definitely less detailed then they could have been. If our heroes visit the same bar 3 times we won\u2019t have any recognisable feature to remember from that bar. If they go to a military camp all we get for detailing is a few tents and boxes. Out of all the locations the most detailed is the interior of our heroes\u2019 gunboat and even that doesn\u2019t have a single personal touch unless beer cans and cigarette butts count. Fortunately the focus isn\u2019t on the environments but on Revy pulling off action poses midair whilst dodging a hail of bullets. The action sequences are usually dynamic enough to hold your attention just don\u2019t expect there to be any realism. The budget went on explosions and bullet wounds not on carefully choreographing scenes in a way that would make them appear plausible.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst this anime is mostly style over substance it manages to pull off the style well enough to warrant a view. Due to the blistering pace at which we swap in and out new characters and locations every episode ends up having a high point. I highly recommend this anime to anyone whether your new to the medium or a veteran of it.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal Review:\\n\r\nhttp://thatsterror.com/anime-review-black-lagoon/",

The main crew member of note is an attractive, trigger happy psychopath named Revy aka Two-hands who is very Laura Croft-esque in terms of looks and shooting style but replace the fascination withtombs with killing people. Rock is a very cool-headed, intelligent individual who is innocent of the truly messed up horrors that Revy has been through and over time they begin to understand and respect each other, even with Revy's contrasting hot-headedness, blood lust, and loud obnoxious demeanor. Also emphasized are other characters similar to Revy in terms of the morose, unfeeling and monstrous personalities gained from innocence long lost and bloody wars and conflicts survived. The shoot downs, the explosions, the profanity, the fist fights, and the most amazingly pumped up intro song ever make this an excellent action anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nPlease take a look at my favorite characters and watched animes and send me any recommendations please. I'm always looking for my next fix.",

Suppose on the worst day of your life (which was, at that point, not too good anyway) turned-out to be the one that changes it for the better?  Well that's the case for Rokoru Okajima, a put-upon salaryman who, while in the South China Sea, gets kidnapped by a group of pirates.\r\nThis group, the Lagoon Company, is a varied lot.  The owner of the company, Dutch, is a USMC deserter who bought an old WWII-era PT boat with the money he got as a mercenary, named it 'Black Lagoon'.  Benny is the group'stech-head, a graduate student who ended-up on the bad sides of BOTH the F.B.I. and the Italian mob!  And HIS rescuer happens to be the muscle of the group - and the one who kidnapped Okajima - Revy, a Chinese American beauty who also happens to be a homicidal killer!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Revy kidnapped Rock (as the company later calls Okajima) in the hopes his company would pay a ransom for his release.  But it later turns out the disc Rock was carrying to Borneo had plans for nuclear weapons - and his company hired a mercenary company to kill the Lagoon Company - and Rock!  A heated chase follows, with the Lagoon Company coming out on top, but when the disc was returned to his company (with a generous 'fee' paid-out to the Lagoon Company's client, the Russian crimelord Balalaika), Rock decides to quit - and joins the Lagoon Company!\\n\\n\r\nThus begins Rock's life as a pirate in the corrupt city of Roanapur.  His clean-cut looks seem to set him apart from the rest of the city, despite Revy's efforts to have him loosen-up.  And his tightly-held morality often contrasts with Revy, who constantly threatens to kill him - which she acts to the contrary!  And all through this, Rock and the Lagoon Company have to face threats like rival pirates, neo-Nazis, a killer maid, jihadists, psychotic children hit persons - as well as a return to his native Japan for business... the type of business that involves shootings, deaths, and constant danger!  So get ready for the ride, kiddies!",

It was not the same one hyper,strong,crazy girl you get and one weak and useless guy. The other characters such as \"Dutch\" and \"Benny\", I found played some good parts in it to keep me going. I found it a change that was well needed. \r\nThe art in \"Black lagoon\" was amazing too. The beautiful scenes were breathtaking, But, you must remember \"Art\" Is not what makes a good anime. \r\nAs for the story... I found it kindadull..... Yeah it had it's good moments but for the most part not so much. Could of used more work to it. \\n\\n\r\nFinaly the characters. They're all well put together and you like all of them but some more then others such as \"Benny\" He's too trapped in that room but it works. \\n\\n\r\nOverall review. I'd give it a 7.5/10.",

I fully recommend this anime to everyone firstly because its very unique and secondly its possibly the best in the action/crime genre in my opinion.",

            "content": "Rokurou Okajima is your everyday office worker except he gets bullied at work. One day he gets kidnapped by a group of mercenaries who call themselves, \"Black Lagoon\". When his company shows little concern for him and marks him off as dead, he decides enough is enough. He proves his worth to the mercenaries and joins them as \"Rock\" to start a new live on the island of Roanapur where the wicked live.\r\nThis is an action show which mainly focus on the relationship between the blood lusting, hot-headed, merciless Revy who grew up rough and Rock from the more civilised world. They just don't getalong.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show, the action is quite bland as it's mostly Revy being a one person army posing, firing off her guns while the enemies drop like flies and misses with their shots as with most action flicks. The motives to the missions they undertake mostly have little impact to make the episodes interesting too apart from one or two that spread out over multiple episodes. Action gets better then but... also quite silly at the same time. There are the odd times the tougher enemies that rival Revy fall back to your cliche silly Anime characters which is a shame even though the tension picks up a fair bit. That said, there's some twists to balance it back out and the show really picks up once it gets to the OVA that follows after the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's got some strong characters, one of the rare shows where the female characters aren't getting screentime for fan service apart from the scanty get-ups.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, one mission deal with Nazis so you might want to avoid this if you're sensitive to them.\\n\\n\r\nI kept watching just to see what the newly knit Black Lagoon would end up going through. You could say it's a slice-of-life action show but starring mercenaries. Life for the characters are portrayed as cruel and unforgiving as you'd expect from living on an island filled with the wicked where even church is no sanctuary.",

            "content": "Black Lagoon aka Bitches Be Crazy! Seriously the female characters in this series are crazy or robots send from the future either way they kick ass and say a lot of bad words (not that I'm complaining)\r\nThe Story\r\nAs the summary said its about Rock (That is what his name is since the characters cant pronounce it) a Japanese Business man who did a job for his company and ended up being held hostage by the Lagoon company a bunch of devilry guys who occasionally brake the law in order to put food on the table (or drinks in the hand). After a bit of actionand by action I mean using an old sunken ship as a ramp only to shoot the attack chopper shooting the crap out of them with a torpedo he decides to join the Lagoon company and so the story begins with everything from a crazy indestructible maid to gang wars and even terrorists. Pretty fun stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation\\n\r\nWell this is a action anime so the animation in that sense is pretty amazing considering the age. And it didn't fall flat in the more relaxed scenes as well. All in all it was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nThe opening was amazing hands down. It has a catchy tune as well as cool lyrics but as always this will depend on your taste. The sound to the series was also pretty good especially in the action scenes and there are lots of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIf you love action violence and crazy girls that can beat you to death and not think twice about it, then this series is for you. It makes a small amount of reverences to American movies to. I preferred it dubbed over subbed because everyone sounds like they should. The Russians sound like Russians and the Taiwanese girl sounds like she should. The voice acting is very good in my opinion.",

            "content": "Note this is a review for both seasons one and 2 of Black Lagoon because in my eyes there is only one season of Black Lagoon as there is no continuously ongoing story only 3-4 episode arcs!\r\nCriteria \r\nStory: 7\r\nThere Really is no \u2018solid story\u2019 to Black Lagoon, as its basically separated into 3 episode arc each with their own \u2018small story\u2019 however there is no bigger picture, like small events that happen in each arc that are supposed to lead up to the final arc. Each arc completely differs from the other in terms of plot, scenes and story. If there was really any generalstory it would be about a man named \u2018Rock\u2019 who is one day taken for hostage/ransom whilst traveling aboard a boat. He then finds friendship among his kidnappers and joins them upon there many \u2018adventures\u2019\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 5\\n\r\nReally average ending seeing as it\u2019s technically just an ending to arc, there was no build up, no mystery, no cliffhanger, it just ends\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 8\\n\r\nThe plot is as solid a it gets seeing as they only have to worry about 3-4 episodes worth of plot/story.\\n\\n\r\nMoral: 5\\n\r\nThe only one I could make out of this anime was that no matter who you are or where you are you\u2019re on a \u2018side\u2019 whether you\u2019re for or against or on the sideline, life will be much easier for you once you realize whose side your on.\\n\\n\r\nSense: 5\\n\r\nThis anime makes ABSOLUTELY NO sense at all. For starters on one of the arc there is an enemy who is basically portrayed as the terminator and can neat die. For example in a room where she drops about 20 grenades from under her dress she so happens to walk out of the fiery building unscathed. For an anime that is based in the real world the laws of \u2018death\u2019 surely do not apply.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6\\n\r\nReally boring music didn't like it out of the whole 24 episodes the music did not change once. The intros and outros remained exactly the same. The music was also not complimentary to the mood of the scene as I couldn't even tell if there was some sort of sound track playing to amplify the mood.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was good to say the least. Nice art, nice drawing and at least not every main character looked the same. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started on the characters because I really disliked them. Especially since there was basically no character development whatsoever; Rock is as much of a cry baby from day as he is until the last episode. A high-schooler has more balls than him.  Also Revy\u2019s gun skills remain the same all the way till the last episode. There is no emotional development or physical development.  \\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 7\\n\r\nIf it was for the action scenes I would have left this anime a long, long, long time ago because it just didn't do it for me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 5\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not into anime that only focus on 3-4 episode story lines and plots then I don\u2019t recommend this anime, however if you are than this anime is perfect for you.\\n\r\nLastly I would not watch this anime again and I do not recommend it to those who like a good story/plot.\\n\r\nHowever if you are going to watch it the best Arc of all the 7 arcs is definitely episodes 13-15 (inclusive) \u2018Vampire\u2019 Arc and 16-18 (Inclusive) Assassins Arc\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nAction: 8\\n\r\nGreat Action scenes, only thing that kept me watching.",
