            "content": "Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched.\r\nStory: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes itin hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly. \\n\\n\r\nBut this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 in my books. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light's demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5/10 (rounded to 10)\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10",

            "content": "Death Note. Another famous anime. But this time there is one reason for it. In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.\r\nStory (8): The first half of this anime is a masterpiece. The concept itself - the Shinigami's notebook which grants the person who has it the power to kill anyone by simply writing the person's name while picturing the face in his mind - is already brilliant to begin with as it presents the viewer questions like \"What would I do ifI had that power?\" The way it is developed brings us yet more questions and defies our morals.\\n\r\nLight Yagami, the main character, is a brilliant high school student who's angry at all the injustice in the world. One day, he finds the notebook and he tries it out. At first, he's not sure about if what he did is correct but he ends up loving the power he got and trying to use it to build a new and better world. He's nicknamed as Kira by the citizens. Of course that would simply be boring if it wasn't for L, a detective that tries to discover Kira's identity. Both of them are simply genius and their counter clock run to find out each other's identity is full of intelligent moves and suspense which kept me trying to guess what each one of them would do next.\\n\r\nReally, the simple ingredient that's so great about this story is that it manages to keep you thinking. But at several levels. Let me explain that to you.\\n\r\nFirst, it makes you think about if what Light's doing is right or wrong. \"Is it right to be the judge and executer simultaneously?\" \"Don't the circumstances of each crime matter as well and is it right to judge without knowing all the facts?\" \"Can't the criminals be reformed?\" \"Is a world where people don't commit crimes because they're simply afraid really desirable? Isn't what Light aims to achieve theoretically similar to a dictatorship?\" Those are questions that ran through my mind.  At one point, I was totally rooting for him. But as the story develops and his actions begin to change, you'll start to wonder...\\n\r\nSecond, it makes you think about what's going to happen next. Trying to follow Light's and L's line of though is both challenging and entertaining. Their move will surprise you and you'll keep trying to guess what they're gonna do next. This show will keep you on the edge of your sit through its entirety.\\n\r\nThird, it changes the way you see the world and the people in it. With each kill and each action Light takes you can't help but wonder: \"It may be wrong but what would I do if I were in his place?\". People change, situations make us change. One different thing in your life and you could be going from a dedicated doctor to a serial killer (just an example).\\n\r\nThe only problem with the story is really the second half, for Near isn't nearly as intelligent as L, and Light seems to become way dumber and make pointless decisions rather than retaining control of the situation. The fact that the resolution didn't steam from Light's mistakes but from someone else's and was pure luck on Near's part in that regard was both a nice factor (I was rooting for Light to win because... no idea, I just was.) and a rather underwhelming one as well, for neither of them was the central piece that ended the puzzle. The story receives a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): The art is clean, the character designs are both unique and somewhat similar to reality. The backgrounds are detailed enough and the animation is really good. Even though there are few action scenes throughout the show, the car chasing scenes for example are really well done. A little exaggerated, yes, but nevertheless pretty good.\\n\r\nBut were the art really shines is in the coloring schemes.  The dark and dull tones totally fit the anime. And Light's monologues, with the red hair also add a nice touch.\\n\r\nQuite good for its time and genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): First, let's talk about the openings and endings. Well, I dislike both openings and love both endings. Quite wired isn't it? Because you know, the 1st opening and the 1st ending are both by the band \"Nightmare\" (they're a really good band by the way) and the 2nd ones are both by \"Maximum the Hormone\". Still, it's just my personal preference though some people may be turned of by the heavy metal sound of the last opening and respective ending. \\n\r\nThe ending song from episode 37 is really beautiful and fits the last scenes awesomely well.\\n\r\nBut that's not all. The opera-like songs that pass in the episodes really add to the scenes and were, with they're somewhat religious tune,  the best choice to set the mood.\\n\r\nI can't say much about the voice acting. I watched the english dubbed version and I thought it was good enough but I'm no expert on that matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8): The characters are rather well portrayed. Let me put it this way. When I see an anime, there's always a character that stands out the most for me, that has characteristics that make me root for him/her. When that doesn't happen, I usually don't enjoy an anime. In Death Note, no character stood out. But somehow, I still loved it. I think no one stood out because they were all equally great. There was no one with fantasy-like characteristics. They all seemed like real people with real problems. No unneeded and exaggerated tragedies but no totally sweet lives either.\\n\r\nThe character development is pretty much nonexistent for most of the cast, but it doesn't need to be there, for it is really good for Light Yagami, the main character. Starting of as a genius, calm and collected high school student with a strong sense of morals and justice, he undergoes a slow but drastic change of character. The more he uses the Death Note, the more he slowly drops his morals because he finds it is needed to continue his work. He ends up an arrogant person with no consideration by the people who surround him. He starts trying to create a new and better world for people to live him but ends up obsessed with power and with being the \"God of the New World\".\\n\r\nI love it when Light loses his memories about the Death Note. He turns back to his old self, refuses to use people as tools (what he had been doing all the time) and he even thinks Kira is wrong and wants to catch him. At that point, I also thought Kira's actions were going way too far but so did Light. And Light WAS Kira. So what if the notebook was real, what if I had pick it up? Wouldn't I do the same and end up like that?\\n\r\nMoving on to L. He may seem like a plain character, but he is not. He tried his best to capture Kira risking himself a bit more in each attempt. He seems cold but deep inside I think he really didn't want Light to be Kira because he had never met anyone so similar to him in his ways of thinking and he saw Light as a friend, even though he was almost sure that Light was, in fact, Kira.\\n\r\nThe support characters are surprisingly interesting, despite not being all that well developed. I'm talking about the task force. At first, we didn't know much about them and they're development is not much noticeable but then at some point you realize you already know how they feel about Kira, what their line of thought is. The truth is, we subtly get introduced to their problems and internal struggles. This anime has an interesting cast of supporting characters.\\n\r\nMy least favorite character was Near. Even Mello was better developed than him. Near wanted to catch Light, sure. But it seemed like he was barely concerned about anything else that was happening as long as he could catch him. He was too cold and underwent none changes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): This review is getting way too long... Anyway, I really enjoyed this anime. Each episode got me craving for more. It made me think, it made me feel bad for some characters, it made me hate some situations... It was truly a great viewing experience. I enjoyed it a lot. \\n\r\nBiggest problem was really the second half not being as intelligently scripted as the first one. But even now, one month after watching, I still think about Death Note and its moral changing story whenever I see some hostage situation on the news. Sometimes I'm just like \"Damn, I wish I had one notebook like that! I could prevent so many bad stuff from happening...\". And then, on those nights, as I'm in my bed the same questions I had when I was watching the show come once again to my mind. \"If the notebook was real, wouldn't it bring even more bad things that it could prevent? Would it be right to use it? What would guarantee that I would not get corrupted by its power?\" I loved this show and I still do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): I may rate it a 8, but once again, that's largely due to the second half of the show. Nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone. Whatever genre of anime you like, you should watch this. It is a really intelligent story and even though you may not love it as much as I did, the chances are, you will. Even for people who never enjoyed anime, I would still recommend it. In fact, I am now in the process of making Portuguese subtitles so I can get my mom to watch it. Death Note defies your morals and enables deep discussions with yourself and others. It truly is a great show.",

            "content": "Allow me to explain my love of \"the pay off\" in entertainment:\r\nI hate when I watch something, and it doesn't really matter if I'm following it or not because nothing pays off.  So many times I the credits of a movie roll and I'm left stupified thinking to myself \"That's it?  What about the ___ and the ___? What was the point of me paying attention to the first hour and 20 minutes of this film?\"\r\nSome shows or movies set little subconscious mental snares, so that when something happens later on-it pays off.  Your friend walks in the room and sees ascene that looks like nothing happened, but you're going :O OMGG!  They don't understand what it means, the significance of what happened, because they didn't see the set up.  Therefore, when you watched that early part and did get the set up, it was worth your time and attention.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Death Note is one of the best examples of great pay-offs in the history of entertainment.  It's hard to even pinpoint this show/manga/story to a genre.  The aforementioned pay-off aspect makes it feel like a mystery, but unlike your cliche Sherlock Holmes or Law and Order mystery story you're in on the answers.  The main character is the solution to the puzzle, and you come along for the ride.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is like a reverse-mystery story.  Instead of the show centering around the good guy detective (L) you get to take a journey with a young Japanese lad with a heart of black.  And unlike a common anti-hero, cheered-antagonist trope, he is truly evil to the point of not even being able to relate to him deep down. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is an easy pitch to those who haven't seen the show.  What would you do if you could kill people by writing their name?  Would you do it?  If so, who?  This anime then blasts off with an amazingly intriguing universe back-story of death gods in another realm featuring some of my favorite artwork in any anime.  It's truly dark and monstrous.  The creator imagined such a barren, hopeless, faithless, and gutless wasteland of sketchy characters and landscapes, which you then get to see collide with the human world's truly evil bad guy's moral play.  \\n\\n\r\nIn issue 13 of the manga, which has interviews with the writer and artist, (fascinating read, highly recommended as well) the author insists that he meant no political or social commentary.  But allow me to do it for him:\\n\\n\r\nIs the death penalty OK?  Is it OK to try to wipe out the bad people of the world?  How far does it go?  When is it OK to execute someone?  At the beginning of the story, it's clear that the people of Japan LIKE the killings but won't admit it.  Is that what would happen?  And even further on, after so many 'bad' people have been killed it's depicted that the world actually does improve because of the executions.  Is that far-fetched?  I actually think it actually would make people more afraid, and less likely to commit heinous crimes.  But is that a good thing?  Would we want a world in fear of an invisible executioner?  Which brings me to my next point..\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Light and Ryuk is highly dynamic, and the crux of the entire story.  When you think about it, this story is Ryuk's.  He is by far the most important character in the story and dictates the most essential plot points.  And yet, you might not think that when you watch it.  While Light is serious, well-planned, methodical, almost scientific, Ryuk is the opposite.  He literally can not stop smiling throughout the entire story.  He loves it.  The empty wasteland was boring, and now he gets to show us an interesting story.  And I have to agree, even if I was an extremely bored death god I probably would have had a blast watching that story unfold too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, you could say the human is the one who became the real death god.  But who really called the shots in the end?  I've heard some people criticize the end, and even the entire second half of the show.  But to me, these elements are equally fascinating and add a lot, especially as they wrap up so many pay-offs.  I know I've said a lot so far, but this is truly a masterpiece.  Now I'm going to break down the technicalities. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nEven if I didn't like anything I said above, I would love this art style.  This is by far my favorite art style in anime.  Just seeing this art style in another anime, like Monster, will make me enjoy it more.  This anime is not a bright bubbly explosion of genki fireworks.  And the art is no different.  It is dark and realistic.  Some of the expressions are so horrified and so believable.  It's not distracting, it really helps you get a sense of realism like-\"what if this happened?\" because everything is drawn to scale and with a certain weighted, grounded feeling that some animes completely lack on purpose.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art gives special attention to colors, such as the red shinigami eyes, but it doesn't take color out of the realm of being realistic.  No purple haired people or girls with outfits that even the best cosplayers in the world couldn't pull off.  The animation itself is also excellent.  It's never too still, and never too fast.  When there are big movements (for example, the infamous \"most epic writing scene in the world\" from YouTube when Light is first writing his long list of names) the animation flows dramatically.  The kind of angles and smooth motion that would be hard to capture for even the best director with a million frames per second.  You can visibly and clearly see a tremendous amount of work was put into animating this series. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOh, wow.  Just wow.  As a music addict, I'll tell you right away that this soundtrack never leaves my playlist.  I don't go around listening to all 1000 songs on this vast library of music constantly, but there are certain themes and moments in this soundtrack that surpass some of the greatest Hollywood film scores of all time.  Huge orchestras and choirs, smooth jazz, hard rock, club ambience, they really hit almost every genre of music and combine them in a really innovative way.  It's so hard to get tired of the deep variation, and when you put all of these songs to such an amazing story, you've got pure gold. This soundtrack really has some mood-altering songs.  I highly recommend you buy the soundtrack and check it out, whether you've seen the show or not.  \\n\\n\r\nAgain, you can tell an unbelievable amount of work went into scoring this series.  Songs like \"Dominae Kira\" feature some of the craziest choir sounds and orchestral arpeggios that I've ever heard.  And once you've heard the L theme and its John Carpenter-esque odd time signature (which are also prevalent in the score) it will stay with you.  And then when they remix it and reprise different variations of the melody, it subconsciously brings you even further into immersion.  Interesting to note that one of the composers of Death Note was arrested for marijuana in Japan, and at the time of his arrest he had a little more than a gram on him.  (US: $20) Since this drug is very taboo in Japan, the reported value of a little more than a gram was over $120.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI've already touched on the main characters, so I'll just talk about the great supporting cast.  Misa, a gothic pop star, plays a really interesting, integral role in the story.  She indeed has the high-pitch voice of a cliche blonde haired little girl in an anime, but in this case it really works.  This is not your ordinary high pitched little Japanese anime girl.  She brings another layer to the social commentary of capital punishment, and Light eats it up.  They are perfectly meant for each other, despite the course of events that unfold between them.  To me, their relationship is beyond Shakespearean.  And like Ryuk, in the end she is clearly one of the most important characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a great supporting cast in the police side of this epic chase, including Matsuda and Light's father Soichiro.  Light's dad is also one of my favorite characters.  He brings such a stern discomfort to scenes, which is realistic for some fathers.  All of the characters are utilized perfectly, and he definitely has his opportunities to shine.  There is also a small supporting cast of other shinigami, which I think gave the author and artists a chance to bring some fantasy elements to their work while still keeping it feeling grounded and real.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story depicts the shinigami as a secret realm, so the entire concept is introduced as something that could actually exist in a fantasy sense.  The revelation of their mysterious existence is realistically shocking, and from this you get shinigami like Rem-who my friend had to point out to me is actually a female.  Which makes her actions in the story even more intriguing.  You also get to briefly meet a few other shinigami, who are equally unique.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING:\\n\r\nFirst off, you should know that I've never seen this show with English voices.  So I will be talking about the Japanese voice actors only.  The voices on this show are absolutely expert.  Light's tone and dynamics really put you in a mood, especially when contrasted by the tone and patterns of L.  Their conversations make me feel so interested to hear what they're talking about, whatever it is.  Also Ryuk is my favorite anime/cartoon voice ever.  His trademark laugh and quirky speech style is probably what initially pulled me into the show the most at first.  It's just a brilliant character. \\n\\n\r\nLight's dad and Misa also have really well-acted voices.  There's nothing and no one I can criticize as far as the voice acting.  Bringing this group of voice actors was so well done that it's one of the few times where I would like to thank whoever did the casting on the series.  \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nThere is one thing that I don't like about Death Note: it had to end.  I don't mean this in a joking way.  To me, the way it ends, the shinigami realm, the characters, the universe this story creates BEGS for another story, another season.  Some criticized the second half, but I truly feel this universe and premise has legs.  The follow-up to this show for the author and artist is so far removed from my interests.  There are few things that could happen in my life that would make me happier than if Death Note were to continue.  \\n\\n\r\nPlease note: I'm not a huge anime fan.  I barely watch it, and this was the first anime I ever watched start to finish.  Which was almost a curse in disguise, because after that my interest in anime started as mostly a quest to find something 'else' to watch.  That is-something just like Death Note, something just as good, but different.  I still haven't found it.  There are lots of forum threads and Yahoo! answers of people who feel the same way-and sadly I don't think we will ever find something as good as Death Note.  This series was magical lightning caught in a bottle with perfect timing.  The planets aligned and the hard work of everyone involved lead to an anime series that is truly enchanting to enjoy.  So check it out!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "May contain light spoilers...\r\nDeath Note is a solid series with some brilliant moments in it, but some equally ridiculous ones too. Most of it is pretty much the same thing: a long-ass cat-and-mouse game that keeps taking turns going for and against the two lead foes. Early on it's rather boring as you watching everything take it's time to pick up, and there's even an episode that consists almost entirely of two characters wandering around aimlessly that get real boring real fast. Once the big twists start happening they're mostly impressive, but you almost get kind of sick of them after they keep coming overand over and they start to get a little repetitious. The last few episodes leading up to a major character's death are really good, but after it actually happens the plot goes off the rails and just winds up repeating a good portion of everything that's just happened before. But despite getting rather ludicrous at the end, the finale is a good payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThe silliest thing about it is whenever the big, epic music starts playing everything is made out to be SUPER intense and over-the-top...and most of the time it's just someone writing down names, so instead of seeming super epic it just comes off as painfully cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally pretty stiff and don't change much, and when they do it's normally pretty sudden and doesn't have much, if any, build-up to it. One of the exceptions to this seems to be Aizawa, who is one of the few characters for whom you actually get a glimpse into the outside life of, even if it is small. L is impressively intelligent and deductive, but outside of that there really isn't much to him. Light is a sociopath with a god complex and anytime that might change it just turns out to be part of a monster scheme. Near and Mello are really forced characters, and Mello doesn't even stay the same character in his short stay and ends up becoming a mess of identity (he's seriously, like, three different people in his short time on the show). When it comes down to it, the best and most interesting characters in the show are the Shinigami.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the overall artistic style and the general presentation, and the crazy colour changes get old after a while, but it's nothing too off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, I did enjoy the series. I can see why it's so popular, but I do think it's rather overrated.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\r\nI wanted to like this. I really did. And I did for about the first 10-15 episodes. Death Note is probably the most popular anime ever, and when I read the summary, I could see why. After viewing 27 episodes and reading a summary of the subsequent 10, however, that opinion has changed a little bit. \r\nFirst, a review of the things I DID like:\r\nA) The Concept. Notebook that kills whoever has his name written into it, death gods that love apples, and two genius teens: one a student with a god complex, and the other a highly famous detective with a strong senseof justice and a wide variety of quirks. Who wouldn't want to watch this?\\n\\n\r\nB) Protagonist/Antagonist Switch. Stories where the protagonist is the bad guy and the good guy is the antagonist are more in-depth. It makes you think more about whose side you should be on as opposed to the normal setup, where it's obvious that you should be behind the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nC) L. He's a great character, period. I love how the creators made him a quirky, unattractive genius instead of an attractive, pretty boy genius (*cough* Yagami Light! *cough*). This makes his likability depend on his personality and mannerisms instead of his looks. This so defies any male protagonist guidelines in general, and I love when authors have the brain capacity to create a likable character without making them look like they belong on the front of a magazine.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the things I DID NOT like:\\n\\n\r\nA) The Plot Randomness. After the first 10-15 episodes or so (and especially after 26), the plot seemed to have this \"made up on the spot\" feel to it, as if the author made the story up as he went along instead of mapping it out before he started writing it. Stories like that tend to tell me that the author is either overconfident or too lazy to plan it out beforehand. While this story had a few plot twists, none of them were really that twisty (except for the unpleasant one I'm about to mention in point B), considering that I wasn't really surprised by any of them and that I was thoroughly bored by episode 18. So if you like spur-of-the-moment plot development, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nB) They Killed L. Seriously. Many of you are probably saying, \"It's good that the author was willing to kill off the main good guy. It's a great plot twist, and you don't see many stories where that happens, so it's creative.\" I do agree that it's a good plot twist, but IT'S L. The creators are quoted as saying that L is \"the smartest character in the series,\" but yet, he gets outsmarted and dies. Not to mention that in the episodes leading up to this, Light wasn't exactly getting the upper hand. In fact, somewhere right before the middle of the show, Light seemed to start drifting away from his previously praised intelligence. L was so close to connecting all the pieces, when BAM! And why did he die? \\n\\n\r\nBecause no one seems to realize that Light's girlfriend is the most annoying creature to inhabit the universe. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, really. Two death gods fall in love with her, Matsuda idolizes her, Light's sister loves her, and everyone else acts as if there isn't a little pest buzzing around the room. Honestly, how can you not make her want to shut up? I hated her 30 seconds after she first showed up. She's not even necessary to the story, to be perfectly honest, and it would probably be 10 times better without her. But still, L dies because of a shinigami's misguided love for her. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then they try to replace him with children, one of which is an obvious ripoff of L himself (dark circles under the eyes, crouching position, black eyes, calm demeanor, etc.). And they don't even offer something like a clever he's-still-a-genius-because-he-planned-his-death solution, which would have made sense considering how smart he's supposed to be. The authors also made L's death out to be unimportant. No one grieves for him or gives him a funeral. Everyone's just like, \"L's dead, we need a replacement.\" Instead they just killed him off and pretended that nothing major just happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a great concept with a great start that spiraled into a bunch of random not-so-well-thought-out plothole coverups. I can see why most people like it, but it got way too boring and unoriginal to me.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to say that this is my opinion. Everyone has them, so I'm sorry if mine is unsatisfactory to you, but I'm just sharing why I think a very popular show is a bit overrated.",

            "content": "Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? \r\nA: Death Note. \r\nThe protagonist, and his adversary, are both genius pretty boys (with the odd names of Light and L) who have an incredible amount of achievements and skill for their young age. Light somehow predicts things that he could not possibly have the foresight to predict, because, you know, probability is a thing.  Don\u2019t worry though, it\u2019s not like you know that he\u2019ll always win, because L possesses this exact same unexplained and ludicrous ability to predict the future; he just does so without a cheesy \u201cJust as planned!\u201dcatchphrase that makes me want to shoot myself every-time I hear it. In this way, rather than being a dark and mysterious thriller, Death Note often manages to be an overblown mental mudslinging contest between two impossibly perfect master practitioners of bullshit who are both describable in a single sentence. This is epitomized in an early scene where the two, who both have tennis skills at a professional level, get into a match and engage in a ridiculously drawn-out internal line of logic about how the desire to not lose might relate to the true identity of the other. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, what kind of psychological mystery thriller has a plot entirely driven by coincidences, improbabilities, and impossibilities? Again, Death Note. Plot devices like this were used every-time the anime found itself in a narrative corner, and these cop-outs always completely killed the tension that was built up to that point, while simultaneously disengaging the plot from the audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe concept was intriguing, and I won\u2019t say it did not entertain me at some parts, but it was ultimately far too flawed in its execution to be called enjoyable or good overall, and it never managed to pull off the promise of its premise. It seemed overdone at times, with eye-roll worthy developments, and lines like \u201cI take a potato chip and eat it!\u201d delivered with the utmost significance and conviction, devoid of any irony or self-awareness. Light\u2019s ability, of writing a name in a notebook as a method of killing, is initially well established and limited, while being relatively creative, although you would think he\u2019d be able to do a bit more with it, but the way the new rules of the note are introduced as the story goes on can get a tad contrived.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization quality is somewhat varied, but I would say that it's generally not all that good. It was bad, really. Light is a bit too perfect, his only flaws being the well-concealed logical results of his perfection, such as his narcissism and overconfidence. It could be argued that this flawlessness was intentionally done in an effort to depict the deconstruction of a seemingly perfect human being, but I think this concept eventually fell flat. It would have been far more interesting to see an average teenager find the note and watch the scope of his ambitions and arrogance develop over time. Light is arrogant, ambitious, and a staunch consequentialist from the very outset; this, logically, kills almost all opportunity for development.  As for the rest of the characters, L was far more interesting and entertaining than Light, although he was even more unrealistic, evoking the child prodigy and boy detective clich\u00e9s among other things; I mostly found myself rooting for him rather than the protagonist.  Light's eventual \u201cgirlfriend\u201d falls in love with him, to the extent of obsession, right away, as the plot commands it, and this insufficiently-explored obsession with him defines her entire character. There is absolutely nothing to her besides that, despite her eventually becoming one of the most significant characters in the series. In all actuality, the motivations for most characters, besides the protagonist and the Shinigami, are hazy at best and, with the exception of L, none of them are interesting in the slightest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some religious symbolisms and themes, which are underplayed and done well until a forced Christ allegory towards the middle, but this all kind of falls apart in the second half and all of the symbolism disappears. To make matters more dire, the already limited development of the protagonist stagnates and his adversary is quickly replaced by two identical, yet duller and less compelling, copies. At the same time, while the developments and additional rules to Light\u2019s ability in the first half were often a bit contrived, they were usually better than nothing; pretty much all evolution stops in the second half, and it only gets worse. The anime essentially loses everything that it ever had going for it, and it then stays in that inadequate stage for the remainder of the plot, all leading up to an anticlimactic conclusion that the audience knew was coming from the very beginning. The anime would have lost nothing to speak of had that conclusion come  at least 10 episodes earlier than it did. Therefore, as the plot progressed, it increasingly lost its higher significance and simultaneously started to wear thin the initial appeal of its premise. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is arguably the strongest, or least flawed, aspect of Death Note, the character design being particularly astounding, with the exception of a couple characters introduced in the second half whose designs were either dumb-looking or recycled. The art is generally pretty atmospheric and it never skimps on detail out of convenience, although not much detail is required in the first place. The design of the main antagonist, while understated, is particularly impressive due to the fact that he manages to be very aesthetically appealing, despite the ridiculous heroin chic vibe that the audience gets from him. The animation is nothing special, but it does not really have to be; this is not an action series. I feel like the art for the manga was superior, and it could have been done better in the anime adaptation, but any complaints I have about it are relatively minor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what Death Note did accomplish was hackneyed and not all that original; it could not be called \u201cdeep\u201d nor was it ever cutting-edge in the grand scheme of things. The coincidences and general improbabilities that drove the plot bar it from being called \u201crealistic,\u201d more than the out-there premise ever could. That said, it should be given some credit for featuring a true antihero, who is still often admired by the audience, and ultimately not being afraid to portray him as pathetic. It also never used the character\u2019s high school age as an excuse to throw light school-life hijinks into the plot. But these positive qualities unfortunately failed to have too much influence in the industry, and they are additionally outweighed by negatives in the universe of the anime itself. Code Geass, a blatant Death Note rip-off, wasted no time at all in taking every single good Death Note did and flipping it all on its head. I might recommend Death Note, if only for the first half, but only with a warning that it fell apart and that even the first half is not as great as it's often made out to be. You honestly might be best off watching the first half and simply skimming the plot summary of the second, because it has nothing of value to offer the viewer beyond that point.",

But then this legendary detective - L - is set to stop him. So starts the battle of the extraordinary geniuses. Yes, they're geniuses. And the same can be said about the ones who created the show.

            "content": "There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Note faces is how seriously it takes the threat of a killer notebook being dropped into the world, and how realistic a stanceit takes on the response by police forces.  Since it attempts to be as realistic as possible given a fantastic story, the viewer is forced to start viewing the show critically, and if you're like me, it might ruin the show as your critical viewing and analyzing, since it does have a mystery side, will slowly chip away at how much you're able to overlook plotholes and points that don't make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, there isn't much I can say in the way of what exactly makes the plot \"fundamentally contrived\" without revealing too much and giving away some spoilers, but I'll do my best to give you my position and why I rated the show a four.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the most important part of a show that focuses most of its time developing plot.  As far as I'm concerned, the actual story that the show puts together isn't bad, it's the way that it is executed that puts the score so low for me.  There's major problems with the way that the drama is created.  The main character is essentially given something extremely powerful and, in some ways, overpowered, in order to make it realistic that he would act the way he does in an attempt to establish his own ideals.  It would be impossible to justify the main characters actions, especially after making him a genius, if the Death Note wasn't so grandly unfair in its power.  Of course, this forces and equally unfair opponent, which is where most of the \"contrived\" nature of the show comes from.  The story focuses on L, a detective, trying to figure out who's killing people.  The problem is that since its by a supernatural force, the writers are forced to create situations in which L is able to bypass his ignorance of the presence of supernatural forces and still get closer to the culprit.  This culminates in a series of completely contrived assumptions that the detective L must make that are NEVER WRONG.  And right there is where my main problem with the show is.  Either L needs to know something and the show creates a situation in which he somehow obtains that information, or L makes an assumption and the show arranges itself such that the assumption is true and then provides some reason for why the assumption is logical and not, indeed, an ass-pull, when really every single one is an ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nA story that relies so heavily on assumption and then does a poor job justifying why those assumptions are being pursued is difficult to watch.  It forces the show to create situations that seem too perfect, or plans that have a very slim chance of working, which of course work every time.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, moving away from this aspect, there are yet more problems.  The show creates a set of rules early on to establish what's different between the world of Death Note and the regular world.  There's a lot of rules and parameters.  The show has issues dealing with these conditions later on when it realizes that the parameters that worked in the beginning now make things too difficult to create any sense of drama, since the person with the Death Note should, by any logical reasoning, have the absolute advantage all the time.  Once again, the show is forced to create situations that seem unreal, or that seem to artificially enhance the abilities and luck of the opposing characters in order to make it somewhat believable that any conflict would actually occur, and in the process runs into problems with the conditions it sets up in the beginning.  Sometimes it will ignore some basic principles it had set up for a scene beforehand, and your left wondering why that information or ability was ignored, or why the character doesn't just _______ or _______.  In the end, the story could have been executed much better with simple changes that wouldn't require contrived scenes and turns of events.  When the show attempts to artificially inflate one scene with more drama by creating a new aspect to the whole situation, it just makes future scenes more difficult because now it has to deal with what it created beforehand.  All of this together makes the story difficult to believe and watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's a not a show you watch for the art.  It's got some pretty backgrounds, but you don't watch an animation for still shots of some city backgrounds now do you?  The animation isn't anything extraordinary.  \"Action\" usually takes the form of camera pans and people writing in notebooks.  Of course, that isn't to say that it isn't pretty or well drawn, but it just isn't anything spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the soundtrack isn't anything to write home about, and some songs get played so often that it's almost comical.  They did take some risks with the OPs, making them heavy rock/metal, but once again, nothing too special here.  The music suits the setting/scenes well, but that's what you should be expecting from a professionally produced show, right?  Standards might be set in different places for some people, but this isn't a soundtrack I'll be listening to after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some major problems with the characters, not so much as with the story but enough to be of note.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is with the main character, an antihero named Light.  He's introduced as your cliche \"tired with the world\" guy who's \"too smart for this shit\" and looks down on others.  He has a sense of justice that centers around punishment for all those who \"deserve\" it, and makes this very clear.  Light develops into something like your classic villain who sits in an armchair tapping his fingers together and who cackles and smiles evily every time something goes \"exactly as planned\".  I've never had a problem with plans coming together perfectly, in fact I like it better than the overdone \"perfect plan falls apart but the heroes pull through anyway because of some bullshit\", but Light's plans... well... the most I'll say is that both you and he should have little reason to believe that they will work, but most of the time they will anyway, regardless of what logic may say.  This gets even worse as time goes on and the situation gets even more dramatized and on a larger scale. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had was that Light makes some pretty questionable choices even though he's introduced as a genius, and most of those choices seem to be written in specifically for the purpose of giving the opposition a chance.\\n\\n\r\nL is the only other problem character.  I've already discussed it, but it's not realistic to believe that he's good enough at detective work to literally defy probability and reason multiple times in a row and be correct.  While he's weird and goofy, and sometimes he's actually clever and not just given wisdom from the writing staff, but he's given too much help from the writing staff to be a believable character.  \\n\\n\r\nMisa is just sort of annoying, but I have no real complaints about her character other than that.  She's your typical head-over-heels MC loving character and pretty much is introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that neither party, Light or L, gets too much of an upper hand before the show has run long enough to replay the same sequence of events over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to enjoy a show that, against your better judgement, you start analyzing.  The main problem is that it's difficult NOT to look at the show critically when it's analyzing itself in the first place through detective work and giving you every reason to believe you should be treating the actions occurring as realistic outside of the existence of the Death Note in the real world.  The problems with execution are a real shame, because the show could have been very enjoyable if it allowed a viewer enough room to suspend disbelief without crossing the line and forcing the viewer to turn a blind eye if they wished to continue without getting critical of the plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nI realize that my opinion is probably unpopular, and I expect that there's going to be some sort of backlash because of how low a score I'm giving to an extremely popular show, but I had real issues with the execution and couldn't look past the problems I saw.  The show could have been much better if they had gone about allowing the plot to progress in a more believable manner instead of stuffing it full of drama that forced unbelievable events to occur.",

            "content": "Adapted by Madhouse in 2006 from the popular Shonen Jump manga written by Ohba Tsugumi and drawn by Obata Takeshi, Death Note is an entertaining ride if an ultimately shallow work.  Unless you just got into the fandom, I\u2019ll assume you are already familiar with the basic plot.\r\nOne aspect of the show that its fans seem to constantly praise is its writing and if you can swallow the cheesy, over-the-top dialogue (\u201cAll according to plan,\u201d must be repeated at least a dozen times throughout the series) then you will definitely be rewarded with fan-favorite gems such as the infamous, \u201cI\u2019ll take a potato chip\u2026and EAT IT!\u201d scene.  The writing also has a tendency to rely on unnecessarily absurd plans in order to establish its characters as geniuses.  While some viewers may find these facets clever and entertaining, others will want to slap their foreheads at the circuitous logic that gets forced upon them.\\n\\n\r\nAs the manga was completed by the time the anime was under production, it doesn\u2019t suffer from the common lack of an ending that plagues many anime titles.  Due to this the pacing is quite deft and if you allow it to pull you in, you can find it hard to stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the series premise alone, some questions on morality have to, and are, raised.  But to the detriment of the work, these ideas are never explored or expounded upon.  So while something like, \u201cIs it acceptable to take human life (for the \u2018greater good\u2019)?\u201d is presented it neglects to provide any further insight.  The heralded moralistic quandaries some claim are, unfortunately, fan-created illusions.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note\u2019s biggest flaw is found within its characters.  They suffer from being one-dimensionally predictable and as a result from the lack of development the relationships between characters quickly become stale.  The author tried to remedy this with a twist at the series mid-point by inserting new characters, but it ultimately fails as they suffer from the same faults; character depth is not created by tacking on quirks.  When the most memorable traits the characters\u2019 have is a knack for puzzles or an affinity for chocolate it means they aren\u2019t particularly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Death Note is by no means a terrible show.  Madhouse\u2019s animation, with the exception of a very few amount awkward digital copouts scattered throughout the show, is quite slick and stylized.  It does an exceptional job at capturing the gothic atmosphere that appeals to the show\u2019s targeted angsty teen demographic.  The music is another highlight which serves to set the tone for the series (especially the first opening song).  On top of that you really can\u2019t go wrong with either the Japanese or the English dubs as both have their fair share of standout performances.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of these strengths that that the anime adaptation receives the recommendation over the manga.  It also glosses over the previously noted much weaker second half.  Other than the slightly different ending, it is faithful to the original material so much so that if you\u2019ve already seen one version, it probably is not worth your time to experience both unless you are a huge fan.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, as long as you don\u2019t go in expecting an analysis to complicated, ideological questions or complex characters, you will likely be pleased with what Death Note delivers.  It\u2019s accessible, presents an appealing aesthetic and is a cut above your average Shonen Jump title.",

            "content": "Death Note will forever be the best suspense anime for me..... and millions of fans.\r\nThe anime starts off Light Yagami, a brilliant college student. While walking towards home, he stumbled upon a notebook that has the word Death Note written on it. As soon as he finds out that the notebook can easily kill off anyone by just knowing the name and face of an person, Light only desire for one thing. To be God of the new world that he will create by erasing all unjust people of the world. And nothing in the world can stop him....except an illustrious detective, who hides underthe alias of L, known for solving every case he took.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not successful on all fronts, it certainly does its share of anticipating, entertaining, and making the viewer think... which is a lot more than most anime's manage.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing rare about some kid going against the world. But it is how he goes against the world that defines whether it'll be among the hundreds of trash out there, or become a silver anime that shine's brightly. Death Note is no silver by any means, it is a pure gold. The story is already promising enough to be recognize. But never have I encountered a complex weapon before the Death Note. To kill someone you have to know his face and name right? That is only one of the many rules and capabilities of the Death Note. As if fighting the whole world isnt already complicated to begin with. But Light manage to use this rules to his advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one reason why Death Note's popularity is spreading like a wild fire.\\n\r\nAnd that is the chess element of the anime. Aside from the anti-climactic ending, Death Note never fails to deliver suspense to the audience as it has already mastered suspense. As Light plans gets to rid the world of evil, L foils his constantly intrudes and foils plans. The whole anime is about both of them outsmarting each other. For Light, the ends justifies the means. Light will do anything to win, from manipulating people to using them until they're on lying their ass off on a death bed. . While L on the other hand, will do anything to stop Light from killing more people as humane and rational as possible. Their display of rivalry is excellent, the relationship they have is intricate at best. It was the most refined connection between rivals I have ever seen. And what makes them different from each other is their ability to think, not by physical means. To remain triumph over the other, one must first be one step ahead. In the case of this two, either of them remains in same position for each episode. Its a constant overturn, thanks to this, this is what makes Death Note is where it is today, everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was smooth, nothing to worry about there. But the characters design are a real treat... for the fan girls. Personally I would've prefer Light and L to look someone like the handsome Usopp(btw L and Ussop have the same seiyuu) of One Piece. That way, those people that are watching just for the superficial things, will be non-existent. Anyways, as for the music, besides than the OP's sounding worse than a fingernail scratching a blackboard, it was superb. It really set the mood. Whether it was Light or L, it never failed to leave me in an uncertain cognitive state. I was always in an apprehension about what is going to happen and the credit goes to the sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime had one weak point it would be character development. Although I was already pre-occupied with all thats happening, I cant deny the fact that its missing a piece. Its a really total letdown that Light and L never changes. Even the rest of the cast, has minimal transition. It wouldve been a nice change of pace to see Light do something right for a change rather than gradually becoming more wicked and apathetic. It felt that Light was a soulless cardboard cutout who can do little to generate audience empathy.\\n\\n\r\nNow I havent read the manga nor do I plan to but I thought that he second half of the show couldve been better, a whole lot better. Although it was still good, the decision to linger on was a pitfall. And the shocking turn of events, was the blunder of the show but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed critics in the history of connoisseurs, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb anime, to myself.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a pulse-racing treat that is among the best. It is a stunning display of suspense that is still unprecedented today. I cannot stress enough on how much I want you to watch this and have the time of your life. Suspense-wise, Death Note is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "The #1 popular anime on this site, and perhaps in the world. But does Death Note deserve all that popularity and praise? People are entitled to their own opinions based off of how they perceived (if there were any) the themes in Death Note, and how much people individually enjoyed the anime. But this anime is definitely one that EVERYONE should watch and decide for themselves how much they like/dislike it. If you haven't seen Death Note yet, then I'd definitely recommend you to watch it, because in my own opinion, Death Note is the greatest anime made. Of course, I may have over-thought the\"deep\" concepts in Death Note that may not have been written to be interpreted that way, but I'll write in my review, facts and the way I personally interpreted Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off the story was surprisingly simple, yet captivating, creative, and rather genius. The story is told not from the view of the 2 main characters, but from the view of a Shinigami (God of Death), named Ryuk. Ryuk's world, the Shinigami realm is boring and slowly rotting away, and so, seeking excitement and a way out of his boring, repeating daily routines, Ryuk drops his Death Note into our human world. On Earth, in Tokyo, Japan, a genius, bored and disgusted (of our world) high school teenager, Light Yagami picks up the Death Note. Out of curiosity to see if what he has in his possession is an actually a deadly mass-murder weapon, (Death Note: Any human whose name is written in this note shall die) Light writes down the name of a criminal that was on TV in the notebook. 40 seconds later, the criminal is confirmed to have been found dead. Finding out the true power of the Death Note, Light accepts his \"role\" in life, and vows to use this Death Note for justice; to cleanse out evil from the world and make the world a better/safer place. Light claims that he will become pure justice itself in the world. In society, some people see Light's actions as wrong, and some as right; the public names Light, \"Kira\" derived from the American world: Killer. Then there's the world's greatest detective L (Lawliet) who sees Kira's actions as morally wrong, and pure evil; and L believes that he is \"righteous justice\". L teams up with the Japanese Task Force Police in an attempt to capture this criminal murdering, \"Kira\" guy. And so, the epic, and intelligent Cat & Mouse game between Light and L begins. Justice Vs Justice. Who will win, and who is true justice? \\n\\n\r\nOften in great literature, the main character is a morally ambiguous character who has a naive dream that eventually leads him to his downfall; teaching the viewers/readers a life-lesson. Such is the case with Death Note. Light's dream to kill all the criminals in society today, and then become the God (Ruler) of the world was very, very naive. First off, when a criminal dies, there'll be another criminal that takes his/her place, the cycle will never end: that's human nature, we're not made to be pure and perfect. Secondly, killing criminals is not the solution to creating a better world. Killing other humans, even if they are this so-called \"evil\", is just wrong to begin with. But what about pollution, rich, corrupt business men/government employees? This is our reality, there will never be a perfect world, and no human will ever be perfect. Light Yagami's dream of getting rid of criminals started out as pure and naive, but as the temptation of power and struggle for survival increases, the purity of his dream dies away. There's a famous saying, \"Absolute power, corrupts absolutely.\" Light Yagami and his dream became corrupt as the story progressed, and he eventually gets overwhelmed by the immense greatness of his power/dream. Light had a bright future, and everything a teenage boy could want. He was accepted into the greatest college, as the top student, his family was financially stable, and he lots of friends/ and girls that like him. But because of a naive dream, he loses everything, his future, his happiness, and his innocence. I believe that the anime sends a message to the viewers about corruption, temptation, right/wrong, righteous/evil, and accepting reality. The apple was referred to as Ryuk's favorite fruit, and comes up quite often in the anime. Why do you think that is? It's because apple's are the symbol for temptation (Adam and Eve), and the Death Note in the anime is often connected to an apple (and when Light uses the Death Note, it's like he's taken a bite from the apple and gives into temptation). Is what Light did right? In my opinion, NO. Is Light evil? That's where he's morally ambiguous. Is Light's mindset evil, or is the power to kill (Death Note) the real evil? Moving onto L Lawliet's character: To me, L is a character that represents Jesus. He came, and served in order to protect the people, even those that didn't trust/like him. If you watch Death Note, then on episode 25 before an absolutely tragic climax, there's a scene that's the betrayal of Judas (to Jesus), which was represented by Light and L. Honestly, I may have over-thought things, but from my take of the anime, this is why I believe Death Note is a masterpiece, and perhaps the greatest anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music in the anime were masterful. This anime was made almost 10 years ago, can you believe that? But the art still bests most of the art today, not in the sense of beauty, but in the sense of matching the mood of the anime and realism. I particularly liked the portrayal of Light and L. Light was portrayed as a very handsome teenager, who was bright and popular, while on the other hand, L was portrayed as an (not so good-looking), isolated, weirdo. I found that to be pretty symbolic actually. But enough with the symbolism, and onto the soundtracks. The soundtrack in Death Note is the best soundtrack in an anime, period. Not only are the music delightful to listen to, but they also fit the anime perfectly, and the soundtrack built up the suspense in every episode. Each character got their own theme song (all amazing), there were church chants (matched the mood of the anime perfectly), and EPIC songs (that made the anime so epic, despite there being no physical action). Well, deserved 10/10s.\\n\\n\r\nI will not write about how much and why I enjoyed this anime, because then it would take up probably 10 pages of writing. I'll just say that this is (in my opinion and many other's) the greatest anime ever, and that everyone, no matter what genre you like, should AT LEAST give a watch. If you don't like it, then that's fine, everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but not giving Death Note a try, would be a mistake of a lifetime. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Death Note is probably one of the best series I&rsquo;ve ever seen. What I really like about it is that I feel the need to pay attention &ndash; that rarely happens with the other series I&rsquo;ve watched. If you blink too much you might miss what&rsquo;s happening.\r\nEverything that happened was just so interesting. The details are always so well thought of and there are little to no loopholes. I think something major happens in each episode. I always have my jaw dropped at the end of each episode. I do have to admit that Death Note died down around 25-26. I&rsquo;ll leave it at thatto avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just amazing. The way they think and act really contributes to the output of the story. I like how Light, despite his evil and sick ways (I hate his evil grins and laughs, but I love him at the same time!), is made to be the hero of the story. He&rsquo;s actually more like an anti-hero. Although I have to say, he is very smart. If I didn&rsquo;t know who Kira was, I would think he was someone like Light. However, I love L even more! He&rsquo;s really, really smart and quick. I also love observing his eccentricities. Another character I like is Light&rsquo;s dad &ndash; Soichiro Yagami. His attitude, personality and beliefs are to be admired. I also like Mello, mostly because he&rsquo;s good eye candy. Men in leather = perfect eye candy. Misa is OK too &ndash; she&rsquo;s kind of a brat, but she is funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting made the characters even more appealing and interesting. L sounds like he&rsquo;s eating his words, but it fits his personality really well. I hate Light&rsquo;s mocking laughter and I scringe when he uses &ldquo;Boku&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Ore&rdquo; but again, it fits his personality. Plus there&rsquo;s Aya Hirano for Misa. Basically any character Aya Hirano plays comes out great.\\n\\n\r\nI always say that anything Madhouse animates is good enough for me. The same is true with Death Note. The animation is really good and for some reason, it reminds me of Batman. Maybe it&rsquo;s because Ryuk looks a bit like the Joker from the Batman series? The color coordination fits the mood and feel of the series. Most of the colors are dark and neutral and bright colors such as pink and yellow were rarely used.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the BGM were really eerie and creepy, again complimenting and accentuating the theme of Death Note. I really love the opening and ending themes too, especially the second OP and ED. Maximum the Hormone&rsquo;s &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, People?&rdquo; really rocks. I still can&rsquo;t get enough of it until now.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m almost sorry, no I am sorry that I put it on hold for so long. I definitely was missing out and I hate myself for not realizing it sooner. I guess I&rsquo;m hooked, like all the other Death Note fans out there. For me, Death Note in a word is -  Brilliant.",

            "content": "This is one of the most engaging thriller anime i have ever seen EVER. How could that be? Let me count the ways...\r\nStory - The first story arc involves an extremely intelligent high schooler (Yagami Light) with the power to kill against the best detective the world has to offer (only known to the world as \"L\"). Its a classic story of cat and mouse, one consistently outwitting the other with cunning tactics and sly tricks. Each episode also leaves the viewer with just enough suspense to keep you wanting more EVERYTIME! Not only that, like any good detective show (i.e. CSI), both main characterslove to tell the viewers exactly how they pull off plans and show of their intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation its very good and smooth no stuttering. The whole screen seems to have a purpose. The mood of the whole show is dark and shadowy theme which is why its predominantly black, night scenes, dark lit rooms, clothing, etc. The great thing about having the main theme as black is that they can portray certain emotions easier (i.e. snow representing innocence, apples being bright red, protagonist = white, antagonist = black, etc.) my only gripe is mostly dark... you'll understand when you start watching. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a good storyline and good animation, you might as well throw the characters out the window since you wont relate to them. But thanks to the outstanding story and very good animation, the characters are some of the best in the business. You'll really relate to the characters point of view, thanks mainly to their thoughts being spoken aloud. They take \"getting inside their head\" to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one anime that you wont forget for a long LONG time...",

            "content": "Death Note\r\nBefore you read this review I want you to know that a \"10\" does not mean perfect, because nothing is perfect. A rating of \"10\" is what MAL says it is, \"outstanding.\"\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nI'm not going to bother writing a synopsis of the preface of the story since you can read one if you scroll up a little. So moving onto to what I thought of it:\r\nOne of the things I loved about Death Note is I felt the need to pay attention. If you don't, you're going to miss what's going on -- and not only did I need to pay attention, I wantedto. Something I haven't experienced in an anime for a long time. The story was unique, original, intriguing, and really makes you rethink your own morals and views on the world, another thing I had yet to experience while watching an anime. On a side note, I personally loved the motifs, themes and symbols seen in the anime -- they're very original and really reflect the plot and just make you say, wow. How cool.\\n\\n\r\nSome argue that Death Note sank after the first 25 episodes or so, but I happen to beg to differ. Just because a certain character isn't there anymore doesn't mean the story is any worse. In fact, in  my opinion it only got more suspenseful and exciting until the excellent and stunning finale. The story is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nI can't really elaborate much on the art and animation seen in Death Note. To reflect the dark plot, bright colors were rarely used which I view a plus, animation flowed nicely for the most part and the hair especially I think was well-animated and looked nice. Nothing really spectacular about it though. Very good art, but nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nA very good bonus that I fear some may overlook in Death Note was the sound and music. Sure, I didn't personally like the second opening all that much (though I &lt;3 the first) but it's incredibly fitting to the series and all the animation in each opening and ending themes are very nice and original. However, the real thing I want to touch on here is the amazing job done by the voice actors. Most notably Mamoru Miyano's role as Light Yagami. It was absolutely stunning and most excellent. Of course, that's not to say the other voice actors did a bad job, in fact, they also did fantastic, but he stood out the most to me personally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nAlong with the initial plot, themes &amp; motifs, the best part of Death Note is the characters. Oh, the characters. I can almost guarantee you'll come to love one and loathe another. The characters are original and full of life as opposed to boring archetypes that I seem to be seeing more of everyday in anime. Not only that, but Death Note has easily brought me some of the most unique characters I've ever seen an anime, hands down, which I believe to be a very good thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nThose of you who've read my other reviews should know by now that I don't let &quot;enjoyment&quot; affect my overall score since it's pure personal opinion -- obviously someone who doesn't like a psychological-shounen-drama like Death Note won't enjoy it -- however, I enjoyed every single episode, every single minute, and every single second immensely. To this date (August 16, 2008), Death Note stands as my #1 favorite anime. It brought a new light to something I didn't think was possible to be in an anime with wonderful character, a unique and original plot that makes you really think, and just an overall terrific thrill ride.",

It doesn&rsquo;t mean this series is in any way bad, no not at all, it just isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea as they say.  After about half the series I began to feel less and less like finishing, counting the number of episodes I had left to watch.  To be honest it is a quality series with many and more good features, themes, characters and ideas, but it just didn&rsquo;t mesh with me.  \r\nThe writingin the series is its strongest points and the voice it uses to tell the story in each episode is very strong, I suppose the real problem I had was with the supporting characters, I just didn&rsquo;t find any of them really entertaining.  The plot was good and can keep you on your toes.  The series also keeps up a good pace throughout.  Would I watch it again?  No.  Does that mean you shouldn&rsquo;t watch it?  No, if you enjoy decent anime with horror/supernatural themes with a splash drama then you&rsquo;ll be truly happy with Death Note, so sayth Lord Nyarlathotep. \\n",

            "content": "When approaching Death Note it is important not to let any preconceptions you may have about the series cloud your vision of the series itself. Being one of the most popular anime/manga series of recent times, means that it has its fair share of both advocates and detractors. In fact it is easy to have already formed an opinion on Death Note without having watched a single episode or read a single volume.\r\nSo, does it live up to the hype? Is Death Note a series worth watching? Well, the answer, as is often the case, is both yes and no.\r\nThe series' plot is one ofit's major selling points. Being somewhat loosely classed as a 'Psychological thriller', the storyline is the single most important aspect of the series' success. The series certainly starts out strongly, with the first five or so episodes being an expositional roller-coaster, the series, whilst being a tale of the supernatural, remains grounded in the real world. The characters are empathetic, with the two leads sitting on different sides of a distinct moral fence. However, about halfway through, the series begins to take a turn for the worse. The frequent logical jumps made by the characters become more impossible (I know they're supposed to geniuses, but come on!), their motives and intentions become cloudier and the plot begins to lose the fast pace it had in the beginning. By the time it reaches it's climax, the plot plods along without much motivation. Reasons and motives are never really fully explained, and when they are they don't always make a lot of sense and tend to be very confused. As is often the case with series that have explosive beginnings, Death Note peters out towards the end, to the point in which you are left uninterested in the climactic final episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, however, Death Note is sublime. The entire series is conducted in a 'realistic' greyish filter with no real bright colours. The characters are wonderfully animated, and the stylistic 'epic-writing' scenes are a wonder to behold (if not somewhat ridiculous). The audio aspect of the series, however is a bit of a mixed bag. The voice actors all do good work with their roles, and some of the music is very good indeed, the first ED in particular is excellent. However, the background music and sound of much of the series is not particularly notable, and a the second two OP and EDs are, in my opinion, far inferior to their predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Death Note provides us with an interesting selection. We have the Gary Stu main character, who (one suspects) is somewhat of a wish-fulfilment character for the author, and his nemesis, L, who spend most of his spare time eating a variety of chocolates and cakes without putting on any weight. Both of which are prone to omniscient leaps of logic, jumping to the correct conclusions without any significant evidence, or even hunches. Probably the most interesting character of the series is Ryuuk, the Death God, who gets unfortunately little screen time as the series progresses. Ryuuk spends most of his time cackling, eating apples and looking gangly, a refreshing simple character in a Byzantine series. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, I initially enjoyed the series greatly, the characters were fresh and the plot interesting enough. However, the series starts needlessly complicating things around episode 15 with triple and even quadruple bluffs from the two main characters playing off against one another. The change in tone and pace after episode 25 also dampened my enjoyment of the series, with new characters being introduced that were either uninteresting or gimmicky (Melo's chocolate bar chomping and N's toys got old pretty quickly).\\n\\n\r\nDespite a somewhat scathing review compared to other reviews on this site, I do not think Death Note is a bad anime. On the contrary it has a refreshingly unique concept, and the characters, despite being somewhat idealised, are likeable and interesting. However, a dramatic decline in quality and pace, as well as issues with the plot means that this anime cannot really be truly considered an all-time great",

            "content": "\u201cThe human whose name is written in this note shall die.\u201d \u2013 Death Note\r\nImagine one day you come across a notebook, but it\u2019s not like those notebooks that you can buy at the nearest bookstore for a buck or two. By writing someone\u2019s name on that notebook, you can kill that someone. What would you do? Would you kill those people who bully you during your grade school? Would you kill those who rejected you when you confessed your love? Or would you\u2026?\r\nThe story of Death Note starts when a perfect student, appearance-wise and intelligence-wise, Yagami Light comes across the Death Note, a Shinigami\u2019s (Godof Death, literally) notebook. On Death Note, an instruction of how to use the Death Note is written in English language. Light, being curious, tries to write a criminal\u2019s name onto the Death Note, and much to his disbelief, the criminal dies. Light then vows to rid the world of evil to make a better world, he executes every criminal under the alias of Kira (Japanese interpretation for the English word \u201ckiller\u201d). Fast forward for a few weeks, the polices begin to notice there are unusual deaths going among the criminals, they then decide to bring in the legendary detective L to track down whoever is killing the criminals.  Although it is true that the criminal rate has gone down drastically ever since Kira shows up, L believes that Kira is promoting peace in the wrong way.\\n\r\nFirst of all, I have to say that the art is really well-drawn. Although it is tagged as shounen and most of the time it shows guys, the girls are really well drawn as well. The art style in this anime is really suitable for the genre. The art tries to be as \u201canime-like\u201d as possible while maintaining its realistic and mysterious quality. I personally think there isn\u2019t any better-suited drawing style for Death Note.\\n\r\nI like to think that I\u2019m an audiophile myself, and I find this anime really interesting sound-wise. The background music, which slides in every now and then, will allow you to feel the suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice actors/actresses are also very good. The voices for \"shinigamis\" are well dubbed in a hoarse voice.The opening and ending songs are really good, lyrics wise and music wise.\\n\r\nThe characters are very unique and varied. Light won\u2019t bat an eye when he is killing other people, L likes to sit with his legs raised on the chair. Light and L are pretty much opposite in everything they do, but they both don\u2019t like losing, and they will do practically anything to avoid it. Other characters, like Amane Misa, which will be introduced later as the anime goes, is also very unique. Out of all the characters in the anime, I personally find L very interesting.\\n\r\nDeath Note is one of those animes that require a bit of thinking in order for you to fully understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s really interesting to see how Kira and L try to outsmart one another, and it\u2019s even more interesting when you can actually understand why they do what they do. That aside, if you are looking for some easy-viewing anime without any thinking, Death Note definitely is not your cup of tea.\\n\r\nFor those of you romance-lovers: although Death Note does provide some romance, (and by some, I totally meant little to none) expect to see Light doing some romantic manipulation scenes instead of lovey-dovey scenes.\\n\r\nBottom line, I really enjoyed this anime, and I will recommend this to almost anyone out there with decent comprehension level. Although this anime is relatively old (it was released in 2006), I feel the need to review this anime since I think this anime is hands-down one of the best animes out there. If you like those animes which require you to think, give this anime a shot and let me know what you think below! Oh, my personal favorite character is L, what\u2019s yours?",

            "content": "This is a unique show that brings a new meaning to the concept of &ldquo;Death Gods&rdquo;. Death Note would have to be the finest written non-action, non-romance anime/manga of our time, with a story that can easily get you hooked. ^_^\r\nThis is the setting of this incredibly unique show. From the summary it may not seem like something worth watching but the first two episodes are capable of getting almost any anime fan hooked, to this thought-provoking show. Underneath all the death and normal day-to-day occurrences is a battle of wits, where you have two geniuses Light and L, constantly trying to outsmart each other.During these mental clashes it is easy to change the side you support, as both characters are so alike but with different ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this show can only be described as &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. The character designs are highly detailed and strangely enough, even a lot of detail is put into something as simple as writing that it can make anything seem so dramatic. There&rsquo;s really nothing negative that can be said about the animation because no corners were cut in the production process.\\n\\n\r\nThe music helps add to the spectacular viewing experience, with the addicting opening and ending themes and a superb orchestra score to back it up. The only bad thing is the deafening 2nd opening theme, which you&rsquo;ll either love or hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a masterpiece able to turn a simple plot of a notebook giving the user the power of death, into something so thought-provoking and intricately written that you&rsquo;ll be glued to every word that&rsquo;s said. The only bad points are that there&rsquo;s some unneeded comedy and a phase when the show went downhill a little but this short period didn&rsquo;t last long. Although some of it changed from the original manga storyline, it managed to end disturbingly well, wrapping up everything with no lose ends. So I recommend Death Note to any shounen anime fan, who wants to try something a little different.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched.\r\nStory: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes itin hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly. \\n\\n\r\nBut this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 in my books. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light's demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5/10 (rounded to 10)\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10",

            "content": "Death Note. Another famous anime. But this time there is one reason for it. In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.\r\nStory (8): The first half of this anime is a masterpiece. The concept itself - the Shinigami's notebook which grants the person who has it the power to kill anyone by simply writing the person's name while picturing the face in his mind - is already brilliant to begin with as it presents the viewer questions like \"What would I do ifI had that power?\" The way it is developed brings us yet more questions and defies our morals.\\n\r\nLight Yagami, the main character, is a brilliant high school student who's angry at all the injustice in the world. One day, he finds the notebook and he tries it out. At first, he's not sure about if what he did is correct but he ends up loving the power he got and trying to use it to build a new and better world. He's nicknamed as Kira by the citizens. Of course that would simply be boring if it wasn't for L, a detective that tries to discover Kira's identity. Both of them are simply genius and their counter clock run to find out each other's identity is full of intelligent moves and suspense which kept me trying to guess what each one of them would do next.\\n\r\nReally, the simple ingredient that's so great about this story is that it manages to keep you thinking. But at several levels. Let me explain that to you.\\n\r\nFirst, it makes you think about if what Light's doing is right or wrong. \"Is it right to be the judge and executer simultaneously?\" \"Don't the circumstances of each crime matter as well and is it right to judge without knowing all the facts?\" \"Can't the criminals be reformed?\" \"Is a world where people don't commit crimes because they're simply afraid really desirable? Isn't what Light aims to achieve theoretically similar to a dictatorship?\" Those are questions that ran through my mind.  At one point, I was totally rooting for him. But as the story develops and his actions begin to change, you'll start to wonder...\\n\r\nSecond, it makes you think about what's going to happen next. Trying to follow Light's and L's line of though is both challenging and entertaining. Their move will surprise you and you'll keep trying to guess what they're gonna do next. This show will keep you on the edge of your sit through its entirety.\\n\r\nThird, it changes the way you see the world and the people in it. With each kill and each action Light takes you can't help but wonder: \"It may be wrong but what would I do if I were in his place?\". People change, situations make us change. One different thing in your life and you could be going from a dedicated doctor to a serial killer (just an example).\\n\r\nThe only problem with the story is really the second half, for Near isn't nearly as intelligent as L, and Light seems to become way dumber and make pointless decisions rather than retaining control of the situation. The fact that the resolution didn't steam from Light's mistakes but from someone else's and was pure luck on Near's part in that regard was both a nice factor (I was rooting for Light to win because... no idea, I just was.) and a rather underwhelming one as well, for neither of them was the central piece that ended the puzzle. The story receives a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): The art is clean, the character designs are both unique and somewhat similar to reality. The backgrounds are detailed enough and the animation is really good. Even though there are few action scenes throughout the show, the car chasing scenes for example are really well done. A little exaggerated, yes, but nevertheless pretty good.\\n\r\nBut were the art really shines is in the coloring schemes.  The dark and dull tones totally fit the anime. And Light's monologues, with the red hair also add a nice touch.\\n\r\nQuite good for its time and genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): First, let's talk about the openings and endings. Well, I dislike both openings and love both endings. Quite wired isn't it? Because you know, the 1st opening and the 1st ending are both by the band \"Nightmare\" (they're a really good band by the way) and the 2nd ones are both by \"Maximum the Hormone\". Still, it's just my personal preference though some people may be turned of by the heavy metal sound of the last opening and respective ending. \\n\r\nThe ending song from episode 37 is really beautiful and fits the last scenes awesomely well.\\n\r\nBut that's not all. The opera-like songs that pass in the episodes really add to the scenes and were, with they're somewhat religious tune,  the best choice to set the mood.\\n\r\nI can't say much about the voice acting. I watched the english dubbed version and I thought it was good enough but I'm no expert on that matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8): The characters are rather well portrayed. Let me put it this way. When I see an anime, there's always a character that stands out the most for me, that has characteristics that make me root for him/her. When that doesn't happen, I usually don't enjoy an anime. In Death Note, no character stood out. But somehow, I still loved it. I think no one stood out because they were all equally great. There was no one with fantasy-like characteristics. They all seemed like real people with real problems. No unneeded and exaggerated tragedies but no totally sweet lives either.\\n\r\nThe character development is pretty much nonexistent for most of the cast, but it doesn't need to be there, for it is really good for Light Yagami, the main character. Starting of as a genius, calm and collected high school student with a strong sense of morals and justice, he undergoes a slow but drastic change of character. The more he uses the Death Note, the more he slowly drops his morals because he finds it is needed to continue his work. He ends up an arrogant person with no consideration by the people who surround him. He starts trying to create a new and better world for people to live him but ends up obsessed with power and with being the \"God of the New World\".\\n\r\nI love it when Light loses his memories about the Death Note. He turns back to his old self, refuses to use people as tools (what he had been doing all the time) and he even thinks Kira is wrong and wants to catch him. At that point, I also thought Kira's actions were going way too far but so did Light. And Light WAS Kira. So what if the notebook was real, what if I had pick it up? Wouldn't I do the same and end up like that?\\n\r\nMoving on to L. He may seem like a plain character, but he is not. He tried his best to capture Kira risking himself a bit more in each attempt. He seems cold but deep inside I think he really didn't want Light to be Kira because he had never met anyone so similar to him in his ways of thinking and he saw Light as a friend, even though he was almost sure that Light was, in fact, Kira.\\n\r\nThe support characters are surprisingly interesting, despite not being all that well developed. I'm talking about the task force. At first, we didn't know much about them and they're development is not much noticeable but then at some point you realize you already know how they feel about Kira, what their line of thought is. The truth is, we subtly get introduced to their problems and internal struggles. This anime has an interesting cast of supporting characters.\\n\r\nMy least favorite character was Near. Even Mello was better developed than him. Near wanted to catch Light, sure. But it seemed like he was barely concerned about anything else that was happening as long as he could catch him. He was too cold and underwent none changes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): This review is getting way too long... Anyway, I really enjoyed this anime. Each episode got me craving for more. It made me think, it made me feel bad for some characters, it made me hate some situations... It was truly a great viewing experience. I enjoyed it a lot. \\n\r\nBiggest problem was really the second half not being as intelligently scripted as the first one. But even now, one month after watching, I still think about Death Note and its moral changing story whenever I see some hostage situation on the news. Sometimes I'm just like \"Damn, I wish I had one notebook like that! I could prevent so many bad stuff from happening...\". And then, on those nights, as I'm in my bed the same questions I had when I was watching the show come once again to my mind. \"If the notebook was real, wouldn't it bring even more bad things that it could prevent? Would it be right to use it? What would guarantee that I would not get corrupted by its power?\" I loved this show and I still do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): I may rate it a 8, but once again, that's largely due to the second half of the show. Nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone. Whatever genre of anime you like, you should watch this. It is a really intelligent story and even though you may not love it as much as I did, the chances are, you will. Even for people who never enjoyed anime, I would still recommend it. In fact, I am now in the process of making Portuguese subtitles so I can get my mom to watch it. Death Note defies your morals and enables deep discussions with yourself and others. It truly is a great show.",

            "content": "Allow me to explain my love of \"the pay off\" in entertainment:\r\nI hate when I watch something, and it doesn't really matter if I'm following it or not because nothing pays off.  So many times I the credits of a movie roll and I'm left stupified thinking to myself \"That's it?  What about the ___ and the ___? What was the point of me paying attention to the first hour and 20 minutes of this film?\"\r\nSome shows or movies set little subconscious mental snares, so that when something happens later on-it pays off.  Your friend walks in the room and sees ascene that looks like nothing happened, but you're going :O OMGG!  They don't understand what it means, the significance of what happened, because they didn't see the set up.  Therefore, when you watched that early part and did get the set up, it was worth your time and attention.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Death Note is one of the best examples of great pay-offs in the history of entertainment.  It's hard to even pinpoint this show/manga/story to a genre.  The aforementioned pay-off aspect makes it feel like a mystery, but unlike your cliche Sherlock Holmes or Law and Order mystery story you're in on the answers.  The main character is the solution to the puzzle, and you come along for the ride.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is like a reverse-mystery story.  Instead of the show centering around the good guy detective (L) you get to take a journey with a young Japanese lad with a heart of black.  And unlike a common anti-hero, cheered-antagonist trope, he is truly evil to the point of not even being able to relate to him deep down. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is an easy pitch to those who haven't seen the show.  What would you do if you could kill people by writing their name?  Would you do it?  If so, who?  This anime then blasts off with an amazingly intriguing universe back-story of death gods in another realm featuring some of my favorite artwork in any anime.  It's truly dark and monstrous.  The creator imagined such a barren, hopeless, faithless, and gutless wasteland of sketchy characters and landscapes, which you then get to see collide with the human world's truly evil bad guy's moral play.  \\n\\n\r\nIn issue 13 of the manga, which has interviews with the writer and artist, (fascinating read, highly recommended as well) the author insists that he meant no political or social commentary.  But allow me to do it for him:\\n\\n\r\nIs the death penalty OK?  Is it OK to try to wipe out the bad people of the world?  How far does it go?  When is it OK to execute someone?  At the beginning of the story, it's clear that the people of Japan LIKE the killings but won't admit it.  Is that what would happen?  And even further on, after so many 'bad' people have been killed it's depicted that the world actually does improve because of the executions.  Is that far-fetched?  I actually think it actually would make people more afraid, and less likely to commit heinous crimes.  But is that a good thing?  Would we want a world in fear of an invisible executioner?  Which brings me to my next point..\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Light and Ryuk is highly dynamic, and the crux of the entire story.  When you think about it, this story is Ryuk's.  He is by far the most important character in the story and dictates the most essential plot points.  And yet, you might not think that when you watch it.  While Light is serious, well-planned, methodical, almost scientific, Ryuk is the opposite.  He literally can not stop smiling throughout the entire story.  He loves it.  The empty wasteland was boring, and now he gets to show us an interesting story.  And I have to agree, even if I was an extremely bored death god I probably would have had a blast watching that story unfold too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, you could say the human is the one who became the real death god.  But who really called the shots in the end?  I've heard some people criticize the end, and even the entire second half of the show.  But to me, these elements are equally fascinating and add a lot, especially as they wrap up so many pay-offs.  I know I've said a lot so far, but this is truly a masterpiece.  Now I'm going to break down the technicalities. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nEven if I didn't like anything I said above, I would love this art style.  This is by far my favorite art style in anime.  Just seeing this art style in another anime, like Monster, will make me enjoy it more.  This anime is not a bright bubbly explosion of genki fireworks.  And the art is no different.  It is dark and realistic.  Some of the expressions are so horrified and so believable.  It's not distracting, it really helps you get a sense of realism like-\"what if this happened?\" because everything is drawn to scale and with a certain weighted, grounded feeling that some animes completely lack on purpose.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art gives special attention to colors, such as the red shinigami eyes, but it doesn't take color out of the realm of being realistic.  No purple haired people or girls with outfits that even the best cosplayers in the world couldn't pull off.  The animation itself is also excellent.  It's never too still, and never too fast.  When there are big movements (for example, the infamous \"most epic writing scene in the world\" from YouTube when Light is first writing his long list of names) the animation flows dramatically.  The kind of angles and smooth motion that would be hard to capture for even the best director with a million frames per second.  You can visibly and clearly see a tremendous amount of work was put into animating this series. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOh, wow.  Just wow.  As a music addict, I'll tell you right away that this soundtrack never leaves my playlist.  I don't go around listening to all 1000 songs on this vast library of music constantly, but there are certain themes and moments in this soundtrack that surpass some of the greatest Hollywood film scores of all time.  Huge orchestras and choirs, smooth jazz, hard rock, club ambience, they really hit almost every genre of music and combine them in a really innovative way.  It's so hard to get tired of the deep variation, and when you put all of these songs to such an amazing story, you've got pure gold. This soundtrack really has some mood-altering songs.  I highly recommend you buy the soundtrack and check it out, whether you've seen the show or not.  \\n\\n\r\nAgain, you can tell an unbelievable amount of work went into scoring this series.  Songs like \"Dominae Kira\" feature some of the craziest choir sounds and orchestral arpeggios that I've ever heard.  And once you've heard the L theme and its John Carpenter-esque odd time signature (which are also prevalent in the score) it will stay with you.  And then when they remix it and reprise different variations of the melody, it subconsciously brings you even further into immersion.  Interesting to note that one of the composers of Death Note was arrested for marijuana in Japan, and at the time of his arrest he had a little more than a gram on him.  (US: $20) Since this drug is very taboo in Japan, the reported value of a little more than a gram was over $120.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI've already touched on the main characters, so I'll just talk about the great supporting cast.  Misa, a gothic pop star, plays a really interesting, integral role in the story.  She indeed has the high-pitch voice of a cliche blonde haired little girl in an anime, but in this case it really works.  This is not your ordinary high pitched little Japanese anime girl.  She brings another layer to the social commentary of capital punishment, and Light eats it up.  They are perfectly meant for each other, despite the course of events that unfold between them.  To me, their relationship is beyond Shakespearean.  And like Ryuk, in the end she is clearly one of the most important characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a great supporting cast in the police side of this epic chase, including Matsuda and Light's father Soichiro.  Light's dad is also one of my favorite characters.  He brings such a stern discomfort to scenes, which is realistic for some fathers.  All of the characters are utilized perfectly, and he definitely has his opportunities to shine.  There is also a small supporting cast of other shinigami, which I think gave the author and artists a chance to bring some fantasy elements to their work while still keeping it feeling grounded and real.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story depicts the shinigami as a secret realm, so the entire concept is introduced as something that could actually exist in a fantasy sense.  The revelation of their mysterious existence is realistically shocking, and from this you get shinigami like Rem-who my friend had to point out to me is actually a female.  Which makes her actions in the story even more intriguing.  You also get to briefly meet a few other shinigami, who are equally unique.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING:\\n\r\nFirst off, you should know that I've never seen this show with English voices.  So I will be talking about the Japanese voice actors only.  The voices on this show are absolutely expert.  Light's tone and dynamics really put you in a mood, especially when contrasted by the tone and patterns of L.  Their conversations make me feel so interested to hear what they're talking about, whatever it is.  Also Ryuk is my favorite anime/cartoon voice ever.  His trademark laugh and quirky speech style is probably what initially pulled me into the show the most at first.  It's just a brilliant character. \\n\\n\r\nLight's dad and Misa also have really well-acted voices.  There's nothing and no one I can criticize as far as the voice acting.  Bringing this group of voice actors was so well done that it's one of the few times where I would like to thank whoever did the casting on the series.  \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nThere is one thing that I don't like about Death Note: it had to end.  I don't mean this in a joking way.  To me, the way it ends, the shinigami realm, the characters, the universe this story creates BEGS for another story, another season.  Some criticized the second half, but I truly feel this universe and premise has legs.  The follow-up to this show for the author and artist is so far removed from my interests.  There are few things that could happen in my life that would make me happier than if Death Note were to continue.  \\n\\n\r\nPlease note: I'm not a huge anime fan.  I barely watch it, and this was the first anime I ever watched start to finish.  Which was almost a curse in disguise, because after that my interest in anime started as mostly a quest to find something 'else' to watch.  That is-something just like Death Note, something just as good, but different.  I still haven't found it.  There are lots of forum threads and Yahoo! answers of people who feel the same way-and sadly I don't think we will ever find something as good as Death Note.  This series was magical lightning caught in a bottle with perfect timing.  The planets aligned and the hard work of everyone involved lead to an anime series that is truly enchanting to enjoy.  So check it out!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "May contain light spoilers...\r\nDeath Note is a solid series with some brilliant moments in it, but some equally ridiculous ones too. Most of it is pretty much the same thing: a long-ass cat-and-mouse game that keeps taking turns going for and against the two lead foes. Early on it's rather boring as you watching everything take it's time to pick up, and there's even an episode that consists almost entirely of two characters wandering around aimlessly that get real boring real fast. Once the big twists start happening they're mostly impressive, but you almost get kind of sick of them after they keep coming overand over and they start to get a little repetitious. The last few episodes leading up to a major character's death are really good, but after it actually happens the plot goes off the rails and just winds up repeating a good portion of everything that's just happened before. But despite getting rather ludicrous at the end, the finale is a good payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThe silliest thing about it is whenever the big, epic music starts playing everything is made out to be SUPER intense and over-the-top...and most of the time it's just someone writing down names, so instead of seeming super epic it just comes off as painfully cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally pretty stiff and don't change much, and when they do it's normally pretty sudden and doesn't have much, if any, build-up to it. One of the exceptions to this seems to be Aizawa, who is one of the few characters for whom you actually get a glimpse into the outside life of, even if it is small. L is impressively intelligent and deductive, but outside of that there really isn't much to him. Light is a sociopath with a god complex and anytime that might change it just turns out to be part of a monster scheme. Near and Mello are really forced characters, and Mello doesn't even stay the same character in his short stay and ends up becoming a mess of identity (he's seriously, like, three different people in his short time on the show). When it comes down to it, the best and most interesting characters in the show are the Shinigami.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the overall artistic style and the general presentation, and the crazy colour changes get old after a while, but it's nothing too off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, I did enjoy the series. I can see why it's so popular, but I do think it's rather overrated.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\r\nI wanted to like this. I really did. And I did for about the first 10-15 episodes. Death Note is probably the most popular anime ever, and when I read the summary, I could see why. After viewing 27 episodes and reading a summary of the subsequent 10, however, that opinion has changed a little bit. \r\nFirst, a review of the things I DID like:\r\nA) The Concept. Notebook that kills whoever has his name written into it, death gods that love apples, and two genius teens: one a student with a god complex, and the other a highly famous detective with a strong senseof justice and a wide variety of quirks. Who wouldn't want to watch this?\\n\\n\r\nB) Protagonist/Antagonist Switch. Stories where the protagonist is the bad guy and the good guy is the antagonist are more in-depth. It makes you think more about whose side you should be on as opposed to the normal setup, where it's obvious that you should be behind the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nC) L. He's a great character, period. I love how the creators made him a quirky, unattractive genius instead of an attractive, pretty boy genius (*cough* Yagami Light! *cough*). This makes his likability depend on his personality and mannerisms instead of his looks. This so defies any male protagonist guidelines in general, and I love when authors have the brain capacity to create a likable character without making them look like they belong on the front of a magazine.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the things I DID NOT like:\\n\\n\r\nA) The Plot Randomness. After the first 10-15 episodes or so (and especially after 26), the plot seemed to have this \"made up on the spot\" feel to it, as if the author made the story up as he went along instead of mapping it out before he started writing it. Stories like that tend to tell me that the author is either overconfident or too lazy to plan it out beforehand. While this story had a few plot twists, none of them were really that twisty (except for the unpleasant one I'm about to mention in point B), considering that I wasn't really surprised by any of them and that I was thoroughly bored by episode 18. So if you like spur-of-the-moment plot development, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nB) They Killed L. Seriously. Many of you are probably saying, \"It's good that the author was willing to kill off the main good guy. It's a great plot twist, and you don't see many stories where that happens, so it's creative.\" I do agree that it's a good plot twist, but IT'S L. The creators are quoted as saying that L is \"the smartest character in the series,\" but yet, he gets outsmarted and dies. Not to mention that in the episodes leading up to this, Light wasn't exactly getting the upper hand. In fact, somewhere right before the middle of the show, Light seemed to start drifting away from his previously praised intelligence. L was so close to connecting all the pieces, when BAM! And why did he die? \\n\\n\r\nBecause no one seems to realize that Light's girlfriend is the most annoying creature to inhabit the universe. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, really. Two death gods fall in love with her, Matsuda idolizes her, Light's sister loves her, and everyone else acts as if there isn't a little pest buzzing around the room. Honestly, how can you not make her want to shut up? I hated her 30 seconds after she first showed up. She's not even necessary to the story, to be perfectly honest, and it would probably be 10 times better without her. But still, L dies because of a shinigami's misguided love for her. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then they try to replace him with children, one of which is an obvious ripoff of L himself (dark circles under the eyes, crouching position, black eyes, calm demeanor, etc.). And they don't even offer something like a clever he's-still-a-genius-because-he-planned-his-death solution, which would have made sense considering how smart he's supposed to be. The authors also made L's death out to be unimportant. No one grieves for him or gives him a funeral. Everyone's just like, \"L's dead, we need a replacement.\" Instead they just killed him off and pretended that nothing major just happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a great concept with a great start that spiraled into a bunch of random not-so-well-thought-out plothole coverups. I can see why most people like it, but it got way too boring and unoriginal to me.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to say that this is my opinion. Everyone has them, so I'm sorry if mine is unsatisfactory to you, but I'm just sharing why I think a very popular show is a bit overrated.",

            "content": "Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? \r\nA: Death Note. \r\nThe protagonist, and his adversary, are both genius pretty boys (with the odd names of Light and L) who have an incredible amount of achievements and skill for their young age. Light somehow predicts things that he could not possibly have the foresight to predict, because, you know, probability is a thing.  Don\u2019t worry though, it\u2019s not like you know that he\u2019ll always win, because L possesses this exact same unexplained and ludicrous ability to predict the future; he just does so without a cheesy \u201cJust as planned!\u201dcatchphrase that makes me want to shoot myself every-time I hear it. In this way, rather than being a dark and mysterious thriller, Death Note often manages to be an overblown mental mudslinging contest between two impossibly perfect master practitioners of bullshit who are both describable in a single sentence. This is epitomized in an early scene where the two, who both have tennis skills at a professional level, get into a match and engage in a ridiculously drawn-out internal line of logic about how the desire to not lose might relate to the true identity of the other. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, what kind of psychological mystery thriller has a plot entirely driven by coincidences, improbabilities, and impossibilities? Again, Death Note. Plot devices like this were used every-time the anime found itself in a narrative corner, and these cop-outs always completely killed the tension that was built up to that point, while simultaneously disengaging the plot from the audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe concept was intriguing, and I won\u2019t say it did not entertain me at some parts, but it was ultimately far too flawed in its execution to be called enjoyable or good overall, and it never managed to pull off the promise of its premise. It seemed overdone at times, with eye-roll worthy developments, and lines like \u201cI take a potato chip and eat it!\u201d delivered with the utmost significance and conviction, devoid of any irony or self-awareness. Light\u2019s ability, of writing a name in a notebook as a method of killing, is initially well established and limited, while being relatively creative, although you would think he\u2019d be able to do a bit more with it, but the way the new rules of the note are introduced as the story goes on can get a tad contrived.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization quality is somewhat varied, but I would say that it's generally not all that good. It was bad, really. Light is a bit too perfect, his only flaws being the well-concealed logical results of his perfection, such as his narcissism and overconfidence. It could be argued that this flawlessness was intentionally done in an effort to depict the deconstruction of a seemingly perfect human being, but I think this concept eventually fell flat. It would have been far more interesting to see an average teenager find the note and watch the scope of his ambitions and arrogance develop over time. Light is arrogant, ambitious, and a staunch consequentialist from the very outset; this, logically, kills almost all opportunity for development.  As for the rest of the characters, L was far more interesting and entertaining than Light, although he was even more unrealistic, evoking the child prodigy and boy detective clich\u00e9s among other things; I mostly found myself rooting for him rather than the protagonist.  Light's eventual \u201cgirlfriend\u201d falls in love with him, to the extent of obsession, right away, as the plot commands it, and this insufficiently-explored obsession with him defines her entire character. There is absolutely nothing to her besides that, despite her eventually becoming one of the most significant characters in the series. In all actuality, the motivations for most characters, besides the protagonist and the Shinigami, are hazy at best and, with the exception of L, none of them are interesting in the slightest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some religious symbolisms and themes, which are underplayed and done well until a forced Christ allegory towards the middle, but this all kind of falls apart in the second half and all of the symbolism disappears. To make matters more dire, the already limited development of the protagonist stagnates and his adversary is quickly replaced by two identical, yet duller and less compelling, copies. At the same time, while the developments and additional rules to Light\u2019s ability in the first half were often a bit contrived, they were usually better than nothing; pretty much all evolution stops in the second half, and it only gets worse. The anime essentially loses everything that it ever had going for it, and it then stays in that inadequate stage for the remainder of the plot, all leading up to an anticlimactic conclusion that the audience knew was coming from the very beginning. The anime would have lost nothing to speak of had that conclusion come  at least 10 episodes earlier than it did. Therefore, as the plot progressed, it increasingly lost its higher significance and simultaneously started to wear thin the initial appeal of its premise. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is arguably the strongest, or least flawed, aspect of Death Note, the character design being particularly astounding, with the exception of a couple characters introduced in the second half whose designs were either dumb-looking or recycled. The art is generally pretty atmospheric and it never skimps on detail out of convenience, although not much detail is required in the first place. The design of the main antagonist, while understated, is particularly impressive due to the fact that he manages to be very aesthetically appealing, despite the ridiculous heroin chic vibe that the audience gets from him. The animation is nothing special, but it does not really have to be; this is not an action series. I feel like the art for the manga was superior, and it could have been done better in the anime adaptation, but any complaints I have about it are relatively minor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what Death Note did accomplish was hackneyed and not all that original; it could not be called \u201cdeep\u201d nor was it ever cutting-edge in the grand scheme of things. The coincidences and general improbabilities that drove the plot bar it from being called \u201crealistic,\u201d more than the out-there premise ever could. That said, it should be given some credit for featuring a true antihero, who is still often admired by the audience, and ultimately not being afraid to portray him as pathetic. It also never used the character\u2019s high school age as an excuse to throw light school-life hijinks into the plot. But these positive qualities unfortunately failed to have too much influence in the industry, and they are additionally outweighed by negatives in the universe of the anime itself. Code Geass, a blatant Death Note rip-off, wasted no time at all in taking every single good Death Note did and flipping it all on its head. I might recommend Death Note, if only for the first half, but only with a warning that it fell apart and that even the first half is not as great as it's often made out to be. You honestly might be best off watching the first half and simply skimming the plot summary of the second, because it has nothing of value to offer the viewer beyond that point.",

If he knows someone's face and writes down their name, they die.\r\nSo, he wants to kill all the criminals in the world with this, and he gets off to a good start. But then this legendary detective - L - is set to stop him. So starts the battle of the extraordinary geniuses. Yes, they're geniuses. And the same can be said about the ones who created the show. At times I just had to pause it andtake a deep breath because everything that happened was so ingenious. Seriously, how could anyone think up such a good plot. It's just... awesomeness! Light trying to avoid detection by L, and L trying to find out who the killer - a.k.a. Kira - is. They even get close and get to know each other, which just makes it so much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is noteworthy. It's really nice, and I totally love some of the more intense scenes, as well as the scenes when Light or L is thinking, and everything is colored red or blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty cool, and I really like it. The second OP theme was really, really bad, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Light. is a pretty interesting case. He seems to be an alright fellow who wants to rid this world of criminals.

            "content": "There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Note faces is how seriously it takes the threat of a killer notebook being dropped into the world, and how realistic a stanceit takes on the response by police forces.  Since it attempts to be as realistic as possible given a fantastic story, the viewer is forced to start viewing the show critically, and if you're like me, it might ruin the show as your critical viewing and analyzing, since it does have a mystery side, will slowly chip away at how much you're able to overlook plotholes and points that don't make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, there isn't much I can say in the way of what exactly makes the plot \"fundamentally contrived\" without revealing too much and giving away some spoilers, but I'll do my best to give you my position and why I rated the show a four.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the most important part of a show that focuses most of its time developing plot.  As far as I'm concerned, the actual story that the show puts together isn't bad, it's the way that it is executed that puts the score so low for me.  There's major problems with the way that the drama is created.  The main character is essentially given something extremely powerful and, in some ways, overpowered, in order to make it realistic that he would act the way he does in an attempt to establish his own ideals.  It would be impossible to justify the main characters actions, especially after making him a genius, if the Death Note wasn't so grandly unfair in its power.  Of course, this forces and equally unfair opponent, which is where most of the \"contrived\" nature of the show comes from.  The story focuses on L, a detective, trying to figure out who's killing people.  The problem is that since its by a supernatural force, the writers are forced to create situations in which L is able to bypass his ignorance of the presence of supernatural forces and still get closer to the culprit.  This culminates in a series of completely contrived assumptions that the detective L must make that are NEVER WRONG.  And right there is where my main problem with the show is.  Either L needs to know something and the show creates a situation in which he somehow obtains that information, or L makes an assumption and the show arranges itself such that the assumption is true and then provides some reason for why the assumption is logical and not, indeed, an ass-pull, when really every single one is an ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nA story that relies so heavily on assumption and then does a poor job justifying why those assumptions are being pursued is difficult to watch.  It forces the show to create situations that seem too perfect, or plans that have a very slim chance of working, which of course work every time.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, moving away from this aspect, there are yet more problems.  The show creates a set of rules early on to establish what's different between the world of Death Note and the regular world.  There's a lot of rules and parameters.  The show has issues dealing with these conditions later on when it realizes that the parameters that worked in the beginning now make things too difficult to create any sense of drama, since the person with the Death Note should, by any logical reasoning, have the absolute advantage all the time.  Once again, the show is forced to create situations that seem unreal, or that seem to artificially enhance the abilities and luck of the opposing characters in order to make it somewhat believable that any conflict would actually occur, and in the process runs into problems with the conditions it sets up in the beginning.  Sometimes it will ignore some basic principles it had set up for a scene beforehand, and your left wondering why that information or ability was ignored, or why the character doesn't just _______ or _______.  In the end, the story could have been executed much better with simple changes that wouldn't require contrived scenes and turns of events.  When the show attempts to artificially inflate one scene with more drama by creating a new aspect to the whole situation, it just makes future scenes more difficult because now it has to deal with what it created beforehand.  All of this together makes the story difficult to believe and watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's a not a show you watch for the art.  It's got some pretty backgrounds, but you don't watch an animation for still shots of some city backgrounds now do you?  The animation isn't anything extraordinary.  \"Action\" usually takes the form of camera pans and people writing in notebooks.  Of course, that isn't to say that it isn't pretty or well drawn, but it just isn't anything spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the soundtrack isn't anything to write home about, and some songs get played so often that it's almost comical.  They did take some risks with the OPs, making them heavy rock/metal, but once again, nothing too special here.  The music suits the setting/scenes well, but that's what you should be expecting from a professionally produced show, right?  Standards might be set in different places for some people, but this isn't a soundtrack I'll be listening to after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some major problems with the characters, not so much as with the story but enough to be of note.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is with the main character, an antihero named Light.  He's introduced as your cliche \"tired with the world\" guy who's \"too smart for this shit\" and looks down on others.  He has a sense of justice that centers around punishment for all those who \"deserve\" it, and makes this very clear.  Light develops into something like your classic villain who sits in an armchair tapping his fingers together and who cackles and smiles evily every time something goes \"exactly as planned\".  I've never had a problem with plans coming together perfectly, in fact I like it better than the overdone \"perfect plan falls apart but the heroes pull through anyway because of some bullshit\", but Light's plans... well... the most I'll say is that both you and he should have little reason to believe that they will work, but most of the time they will anyway, regardless of what logic may say.  This gets even worse as time goes on and the situation gets even more dramatized and on a larger scale. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had was that Light makes some pretty questionable choices even though he's introduced as a genius, and most of those choices seem to be written in specifically for the purpose of giving the opposition a chance.\\n\\n\r\nL is the only other problem character.  I've already discussed it, but it's not realistic to believe that he's good enough at detective work to literally defy probability and reason multiple times in a row and be correct.  While he's weird and goofy, and sometimes he's actually clever and not just given wisdom from the writing staff, but he's given too much help from the writing staff to be a believable character.  \\n\\n\r\nMisa is just sort of annoying, but I have no real complaints about her character other than that.  She's your typical head-over-heels MC loving character and pretty much is introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that neither party, Light or L, gets too much of an upper hand before the show has run long enough to replay the same sequence of events over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to enjoy a show that, against your better judgement, you start analyzing.  The main problem is that it's difficult NOT to look at the show critically when it's analyzing itself in the first place through detective work and giving you every reason to believe you should be treating the actions occurring as realistic outside of the existence of the Death Note in the real world.  The problems with execution are a real shame, because the show could have been very enjoyable if it allowed a viewer enough room to suspend disbelief without crossing the line and forcing the viewer to turn a blind eye if they wished to continue without getting critical of the plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nI realize that my opinion is probably unpopular, and I expect that there's going to be some sort of backlash because of how low a score I'm giving to an extremely popular show, but I had real issues with the execution and couldn't look past the problems I saw.  The show could have been much better if they had gone about allowing the plot to progress in a more believable manner instead of stuffing it full of drama that forced unbelievable events to occur.",

            "content": "Adapted by Madhouse in 2006 from the popular Shonen Jump manga written by Ohba Tsugumi and drawn by Obata Takeshi, Death Note is an entertaining ride if an ultimately shallow work.  Unless you just got into the fandom, I\u2019ll assume you are already familiar with the basic plot.\r\nOne aspect of the show that its fans seem to constantly praise is its writing and if you can swallow the cheesy, over-the-top dialogue (\u201cAll according to plan,\u201d must be repeated at least a dozen times throughout the series) then you will definitely be rewarded with fan-favorite gems such as the infamous, \u201cI\u2019ll take a potato chip\u2026and EAT IT!\u201d scene.  The writing also has a tendency to rely on unnecessarily absurd plans in order to establish its characters as geniuses.  While some viewers may find these facets clever and entertaining, others will want to slap their foreheads at the circuitous logic that gets forced upon them.\\n\\n\r\nAs the manga was completed by the time the anime was under production, it doesn\u2019t suffer from the common lack of an ending that plagues many anime titles.  Due to this the pacing is quite deft and if you allow it to pull you in, you can find it hard to stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the series premise alone, some questions on morality have to, and are, raised.  But to the detriment of the work, these ideas are never explored or expounded upon.  So while something like, \u201cIs it acceptable to take human life (for the \u2018greater good\u2019)?\u201d is presented it neglects to provide any further insight.  The heralded moralistic quandaries some claim are, unfortunately, fan-created illusions.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note\u2019s biggest flaw is found within its characters.  They suffer from being one-dimensionally predictable and as a result from the lack of development the relationships between characters quickly become stale.  The author tried to remedy this with a twist at the series mid-point by inserting new characters, but it ultimately fails as they suffer from the same faults; character depth is not created by tacking on quirks.  When the most memorable traits the characters\u2019 have is a knack for puzzles or an affinity for chocolate it means they aren\u2019t particularly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Death Note is by no means a terrible show.  Madhouse\u2019s animation, with the exception of a very few amount awkward digital copouts scattered throughout the show, is quite slick and stylized.  It does an exceptional job at capturing the gothic atmosphere that appeals to the show\u2019s targeted angsty teen demographic.  The music is another highlight which serves to set the tone for the series (especially the first opening song).  On top of that you really can\u2019t go wrong with either the Japanese or the English dubs as both have their fair share of standout performances.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of these strengths that that the anime adaptation receives the recommendation over the manga.  It also glosses over the previously noted much weaker second half.  Other than the slightly different ending, it is faithful to the original material so much so that if you\u2019ve already seen one version, it probably is not worth your time to experience both unless you are a huge fan.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, as long as you don\u2019t go in expecting an analysis to complicated, ideological questions or complex characters, you will likely be pleased with what Death Note delivers.  It\u2019s accessible, presents an appealing aesthetic and is a cut above your average Shonen Jump title.",

            "content": "Death Note will forever be the best suspense anime for me..... and millions of fans.\r\nThe anime starts off Light Yagami, a brilliant college student. While walking towards home, he stumbled upon a notebook that has the word Death Note written on it. As soon as he finds out that the notebook can easily kill off anyone by just knowing the name and face of an person, Light only desire for one thing. To be God of the new world that he will create by erasing all unjust people of the world. And nothing in the world can stop him....except an illustrious detective, who hides underthe alias of L, known for solving every case he took.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not successful on all fronts, it certainly does its share of anticipating, entertaining, and making the viewer think... which is a lot more than most anime's manage.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing rare about some kid going against the world. But it is how he goes against the world that defines whether it'll be among the hundreds of trash out there, or become a silver anime that shine's brightly. Death Note is no silver by any means, it is a pure gold. The story is already promising enough to be recognize. But never have I encountered a complex weapon before the Death Note. To kill someone you have to know his face and name right? That is only one of the many rules and capabilities of the Death Note. As if fighting the whole world isnt already complicated to begin with. But Light manage to use this rules to his advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one reason why Death Note's popularity is spreading like a wild fire.\\n\r\nAnd that is the chess element of the anime. Aside from the anti-climactic ending, Death Note never fails to deliver suspense to the audience as it has already mastered suspense. As Light plans gets to rid the world of evil, L foils his constantly intrudes and foils plans. The whole anime is about both of them outsmarting each other. For Light, the ends justifies the means. Light will do anything to win, from manipulating people to using them until they're on lying their ass off on a death bed. . While L on the other hand, will do anything to stop Light from killing more people as humane and rational as possible. Their display of rivalry is excellent, the relationship they have is intricate at best. It was the most refined connection between rivals I have ever seen. And what makes them different from each other is their ability to think, not by physical means. To remain triumph over the other, one must first be one step ahead. In the case of this two, either of them remains in same position for each episode. Its a constant overturn, thanks to this, this is what makes Death Note is where it is today, everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was smooth, nothing to worry about there. But the characters design are a real treat... for the fan girls. Personally I would've prefer Light and L to look someone like the handsome Usopp(btw L and Ussop have the same seiyuu) of One Piece. That way, those people that are watching just for the superficial things, will be non-existent. Anyways, as for the music, besides than the OP's sounding worse than a fingernail scratching a blackboard, it was superb. It really set the mood. Whether it was Light or L, it never failed to leave me in an uncertain cognitive state. I was always in an apprehension about what is going to happen and the credit goes to the sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime had one weak point it would be character development. Although I was already pre-occupied with all thats happening, I cant deny the fact that its missing a piece. Its a really total letdown that Light and L never changes. Even the rest of the cast, has minimal transition. It wouldve been a nice change of pace to see Light do something right for a change rather than gradually becoming more wicked and apathetic. It felt that Light was a soulless cardboard cutout who can do little to generate audience empathy.\\n\\n\r\nNow I havent read the manga nor do I plan to but I thought that he second half of the show couldve been better, a whole lot better. Although it was still good, the decision to linger on was a pitfall. And the shocking turn of events, was the blunder of the show but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed critics in the history of connoisseurs, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb anime, to myself.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a pulse-racing treat that is among the best. It is a stunning display of suspense that is still unprecedented today. I cannot stress enough on how much I want you to watch this and have the time of your life. Suspense-wise, Death Note is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "The #1 popular anime on this site, and perhaps in the world. But does Death Note deserve all that popularity and praise? People are entitled to their own opinions based off of how they perceived (if there were any) the themes in Death Note, and how much people individually enjoyed the anime. But this anime is definitely one that EVERYONE should watch and decide for themselves how much they like/dislike it. If you haven't seen Death Note yet, then I'd definitely recommend you to watch it, because in my own opinion, Death Note is the greatest anime made. Of course, I may have over-thought the\"deep\" concepts in Death Note that may not have been written to be interpreted that way, but I'll write in my review, facts and the way I personally interpreted Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off the story was surprisingly simple, yet captivating, creative, and rather genius. The story is told not from the view of the 2 main characters, but from the view of a Shinigami (God of Death), named Ryuk. Ryuk's world, the Shinigami realm is boring and slowly rotting away, and so, seeking excitement and a way out of his boring, repeating daily routines, Ryuk drops his Death Note into our human world. On Earth, in Tokyo, Japan, a genius, bored and disgusted (of our world) high school teenager, Light Yagami picks up the Death Note. Out of curiosity to see if what he has in his possession is an actually a deadly mass-murder weapon, (Death Note: Any human whose name is written in this note shall die) Light writes down the name of a criminal that was on TV in the notebook. 40 seconds later, the criminal is confirmed to have been found dead. Finding out the true power of the Death Note, Light accepts his \"role\" in life, and vows to use this Death Note for justice; to cleanse out evil from the world and make the world a better/safer place. Light claims that he will become pure justice itself in the world. In society, some people see Light's actions as wrong, and some as right; the public names Light, \"Kira\" derived from the American world: Killer. Then there's the world's greatest detective L (Lawliet) who sees Kira's actions as morally wrong, and pure evil; and L believes that he is \"righteous justice\". L teams up with the Japanese Task Force Police in an attempt to capture this criminal murdering, \"Kira\" guy. And so, the epic, and intelligent Cat & Mouse game between Light and L begins. Justice Vs Justice. Who will win, and who is true justice? \\n\\n\r\nOften in great literature, the main character is a morally ambiguous character who has a naive dream that eventually leads him to his downfall; teaching the viewers/readers a life-lesson. Such is the case with Death Note. Light's dream to kill all the criminals in society today, and then become the God (Ruler) of the world was very, very naive. First off, when a criminal dies, there'll be another criminal that takes his/her place, the cycle will never end: that's human nature, we're not made to be pure and perfect. Secondly, killing criminals is not the solution to creating a better world. Killing other humans, even if they are this so-called \"evil\", is just wrong to begin with. But what about pollution, rich, corrupt business men/government employees? This is our reality, there will never be a perfect world, and no human will ever be perfect. Light Yagami's dream of getting rid of criminals started out as pure and naive, but as the temptation of power and struggle for survival increases, the purity of his dream dies away. There's a famous saying, \"Absolute power, corrupts absolutely.\" Light Yagami and his dream became corrupt as the story progressed, and he eventually gets overwhelmed by the immense greatness of his power/dream. Light had a bright future, and everything a teenage boy could want. He was accepted into the greatest college, as the top student, his family was financially stable, and he lots of friends/ and girls that like him. But because of a naive dream, he loses everything, his future, his happiness, and his innocence. I believe that the anime sends a message to the viewers about corruption, temptation, right/wrong, righteous/evil, and accepting reality. The apple was referred to as Ryuk's favorite fruit, and comes up quite often in the anime. Why do you think that is? It's because apple's are the symbol for temptation (Adam and Eve), and the Death Note in the anime is often connected to an apple (and when Light uses the Death Note, it's like he's taken a bite from the apple and gives into temptation). Is what Light did right? In my opinion, NO. Is Light evil? That's where he's morally ambiguous. Is Light's mindset evil, or is the power to kill (Death Note) the real evil? Moving onto L Lawliet's character: To me, L is a character that represents Jesus. He came, and served in order to protect the people, even those that didn't trust/like him. If you watch Death Note, then on episode 25 before an absolutely tragic climax, there's a scene that's the betrayal of Judas (to Jesus), which was represented by Light and L. Honestly, I may have over-thought things, but from my take of the anime, this is why I believe Death Note is a masterpiece, and perhaps the greatest anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music in the anime were masterful. This anime was made almost 10 years ago, can you believe that? But the art still bests most of the art today, not in the sense of beauty, but in the sense of matching the mood of the anime and realism. I particularly liked the portrayal of Light and L. Light was portrayed as a very handsome teenager, who was bright and popular, while on the other hand, L was portrayed as an (not so good-looking), isolated, weirdo. I found that to be pretty symbolic actually. But enough with the symbolism, and onto the soundtracks. The soundtrack in Death Note is the best soundtrack in an anime, period. Not only are the music delightful to listen to, but they also fit the anime perfectly, and the soundtrack built up the suspense in every episode. Each character got their own theme song (all amazing), there were church chants (matched the mood of the anime perfectly), and EPIC songs (that made the anime so epic, despite there being no physical action). Well, deserved 10/10s.\\n\\n\r\nI will not write about how much and why I enjoyed this anime, because then it would take up probably 10 pages of writing. I'll just say that this is (in my opinion and many other's) the greatest anime ever, and that everyone, no matter what genre you like, should AT LEAST give a watch. If you don't like it, then that's fine, everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but not giving Death Note a try, would be a mistake of a lifetime. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Death Note is probably one of the best series I&rsquo;ve ever seen. What I really like about it is that I feel the need to pay attention &ndash; that rarely happens with the other series I&rsquo;ve watched. If you blink too much you might miss what&rsquo;s happening.\r\nEverything that happened was just so interesting. The details are always so well thought of and there are little to no loopholes. I think something major happens in each episode. I always have my jaw dropped at the end of each episode. I do have to admit that Death Note died down around 25-26. I&rsquo;ll leave it at thatto avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just amazing. The way they think and act really contributes to the output of the story. I like how Light, despite his evil and sick ways (I hate his evil grins and laughs, but I love him at the same time!), is made to be the hero of the story. He&rsquo;s actually more like an anti-hero. Although I have to say, he is very smart. If I didn&rsquo;t know who Kira was, I would think he was someone like Light. However, I love L even more! He&rsquo;s really, really smart and quick. I also love observing his eccentricities. Another character I like is Light&rsquo;s dad &ndash; Soichiro Yagami. His attitude, personality and beliefs are to be admired. I also like Mello, mostly because he&rsquo;s good eye candy. Men in leather = perfect eye candy. Misa is OK too &ndash; she&rsquo;s kind of a brat, but she is funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting made the characters even more appealing and interesting. L sounds like he&rsquo;s eating his words, but it fits his personality really well. I hate Light&rsquo;s mocking laughter and I scringe when he uses &ldquo;Boku&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Ore&rdquo; but again, it fits his personality. Plus there&rsquo;s Aya Hirano for Misa. Basically any character Aya Hirano plays comes out great.\\n\\n\r\nI always say that anything Madhouse animates is good enough for me. The same is true with Death Note. The animation is really good and for some reason, it reminds me of Batman. Maybe it&rsquo;s because Ryuk looks a bit like the Joker from the Batman series? The color coordination fits the mood and feel of the series. Most of the colors are dark and neutral and bright colors such as pink and yellow were rarely used.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the BGM were really eerie and creepy, again complimenting and accentuating the theme of Death Note. I really love the opening and ending themes too, especially the second OP and ED. Maximum the Hormone&rsquo;s &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, People?&rdquo; really rocks. I still can&rsquo;t get enough of it until now.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m almost sorry, no I am sorry that I put it on hold for so long. I definitely was missing out and I hate myself for not realizing it sooner. I guess I&rsquo;m hooked, like all the other Death Note fans out there. For me, Death Note in a word is -  Brilliant.",

Let me count the ways...\r\nStory - The first story arc involves an extremely intelligent high schooler (Yagami Light) with the power to kill against the best detective the world has to offer (only known to the world as \"L\"). Its a classic story of cat and mouse, one consistently outwitting the other with cunning tactics and sly tricks. Each episode also leaves the viewer with just enough suspense to keep you wanting more EVERYTIME! Not only that, like any good detective show (i.e. CSI), both main characterslove to tell the viewers exactly how they pull off plans and show of their intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation its very good and smooth no stuttering. The whole screen seems to have a purpose. The mood of the whole show is dark and shadowy theme which is why its predominantly black, night scenes, dark lit rooms, clothing, etc. The great thing about having the main theme as black is that they can portray certain emotions easier (i.e. snow representing innocence, apples being bright red, protagonist = white, antagonist = black, etc.) my only gripe is mostly dark... you'll understand when you start watching. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a good storyline and good animation, you might as well throw the characters out the window since you wont relate to them. But thanks to the outstanding story and very good animation, the characters are some of the best in the business. You'll really relate to the characters point of view, thanks mainly to their thoughts being spoken aloud.

            "content": "Death Note\r\nBefore you read this review I want you to know that a \"10\" does not mean perfect, because nothing is perfect. A rating of \"10\" is what MAL says it is, \"outstanding.\"\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nI'm not going to bother writing a synopsis of the preface of the story since you can read one if you scroll up a little. So moving onto to what I thought of it:\r\nOne of the things I loved about Death Note is I felt the need to pay attention. If you don't, you're going to miss what's going on -- and not only did I need to pay attention, I wantedto. Something I haven't experienced in an anime for a long time. The story was unique, original, intriguing, and really makes you rethink your own morals and views on the world, another thing I had yet to experience while watching an anime. On a side note, I personally loved the motifs, themes and symbols seen in the anime -- they're very original and really reflect the plot and just make you say, wow. How cool.\\n\\n\r\nSome argue that Death Note sank after the first 25 episodes or so, but I happen to beg to differ. Just because a certain character isn't there anymore doesn't mean the story is any worse. In fact, in  my opinion it only got more suspenseful and exciting until the excellent and stunning finale. The story is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nI can't really elaborate much on the art and animation seen in Death Note. To reflect the dark plot, bright colors were rarely used which I view a plus, animation flowed nicely for the most part and the hair especially I think was well-animated and looked nice. Nothing really spectacular about it though. Very good art, but nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nA very good bonus that I fear some may overlook in Death Note was the sound and music. Sure, I didn't personally like the second opening all that much (though I &lt;3 the first) but it's incredibly fitting to the series and all the animation in each opening and ending themes are very nice and original. However, the real thing I want to touch on here is the amazing job done by the voice actors. Most notably Mamoru Miyano's role as Light Yagami. It was absolutely stunning and most excellent. Of course, that's not to say the other voice actors did a bad job, in fact, they also did fantastic, but he stood out the most to me personally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nAlong with the initial plot, themes &amp; motifs, the best part of Death Note is the characters. Oh, the characters. I can almost guarantee you'll come to love one and loathe another. The characters are original and full of life as opposed to boring archetypes that I seem to be seeing more of everyday in anime. Not only that, but Death Note has easily brought me some of the most unique characters I've ever seen an anime, hands down, which I believe to be a very good thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nThose of you who've read my other reviews should know by now that I don't let &quot;enjoyment&quot; affect my overall score since it's pure personal opinion -- obviously someone who doesn't like a psychological-shounen-drama like Death Note won't enjoy it -- however, I enjoyed every single episode, every single minute, and every single second immensely. To this date (August 16, 2008), Death Note stands as my #1 favorite anime. It brought a new light to something I didn't think was possible to be in an anime with wonderful character, a unique and original plot that makes you really think, and just an overall terrific thrill ride.",

It doesn&rsquo;t mean this series is in any way bad, no not at all, it just isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea as they say.  After about half the series I began to feel less and less like finishing, counting the number of episodes I had left to watch.  To be honest it is a quality series with many and more good features, themes, characters and ideas, but it just didn&rsquo;t mesh with me.  \r\nThe writingin the series is its strongest points and the voice it uses to tell the story in each episode is very strong, I suppose the real problem I had was with the supporting characters, I just didn&rsquo;t find any of them really entertaining.  The plot was good and can keep you on your toes.  The series also keeps up a good pace throughout.  Would I watch it again?  No.  Does that mean you shouldn&rsquo;t watch it?  No, if you enjoy decent anime with horror/supernatural themes with a splash drama then you&rsquo;ll be truly happy with Death Note, so sayth Lord Nyarlathotep. \\n",

            "content": "When approaching Death Note it is important not to let any preconceptions you may have about the series cloud your vision of the series itself. Being one of the most popular anime/manga series of recent times, means that it has its fair share of both advocates and detractors. In fact it is easy to have already formed an opinion on Death Note without having watched a single episode or read a single volume.\r\nSo, does it live up to the hype? Is Death Note a series worth watching? Well, the answer, as is often the case, is both yes and no.\r\nThe series' plot is one ofit's major selling points. Being somewhat loosely classed as a 'Psychological thriller', the storyline is the single most important aspect of the series' success. The series certainly starts out strongly, with the first five or so episodes being an expositional roller-coaster, the series, whilst being a tale of the supernatural, remains grounded in the real world. The characters are empathetic, with the two leads sitting on different sides of a distinct moral fence. However, about halfway through, the series begins to take a turn for the worse. The frequent logical jumps made by the characters become more impossible (I know they're supposed to geniuses, but come on!), their motives and intentions become cloudier and the plot begins to lose the fast pace it had in the beginning. By the time it reaches it's climax, the plot plods along without much motivation. Reasons and motives are never really fully explained, and when they are they don't always make a lot of sense and tend to be very confused. As is often the case with series that have explosive beginnings, Death Note peters out towards the end, to the point in which you are left uninterested in the climactic final episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, however, Death Note is sublime. The entire series is conducted in a 'realistic' greyish filter with no real bright colours. The characters are wonderfully animated, and the stylistic 'epic-writing' scenes are a wonder to behold (if not somewhat ridiculous). The audio aspect of the series, however is a bit of a mixed bag. The voice actors all do good work with their roles, and some of the music is very good indeed, the first ED in particular is excellent. However, the background music and sound of much of the series is not particularly notable, and a the second two OP and EDs are, in my opinion, far inferior to their predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Death Note provides us with an interesting selection. We have the Gary Stu main character, who (one suspects) is somewhat of a wish-fulfilment character for the author, and his nemesis, L, who spend most of his spare time eating a variety of chocolates and cakes without putting on any weight. Both of which are prone to omniscient leaps of logic, jumping to the correct conclusions without any significant evidence, or even hunches. Probably the most interesting character of the series is Ryuuk, the Death God, who gets unfortunately little screen time as the series progresses. Ryuuk spends most of his time cackling, eating apples and looking gangly, a refreshing simple character in a Byzantine series. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, I initially enjoyed the series greatly, the characters were fresh and the plot interesting enough. However, the series starts needlessly complicating things around episode 15 with triple and even quadruple bluffs from the two main characters playing off against one another. The change in tone and pace after episode 25 also dampened my enjoyment of the series, with new characters being introduced that were either uninteresting or gimmicky (Melo's chocolate bar chomping and N's toys got old pretty quickly).\\n\\n\r\nDespite a somewhat scathing review compared to other reviews on this site, I do not think Death Note is a bad anime. On the contrary it has a refreshingly unique concept, and the characters, despite being somewhat idealised, are likeable and interesting. However, a dramatic decline in quality and pace, as well as issues with the plot means that this anime cannot really be truly considered an all-time great",

            "content": "\u201cThe human whose name is written in this note shall die.\u201d \u2013 Death Note\r\nImagine one day you come across a notebook, but it\u2019s not like those notebooks that you can buy at the nearest bookstore for a buck or two. By writing someone\u2019s name on that notebook, you can kill that someone. What would you do? Would you kill those people who bully you during your grade school? Would you kill those who rejected you when you confessed your love? Or would you\u2026?\r\nThe story of Death Note starts when a perfect student, appearance-wise and intelligence-wise, Yagami Light comes across the Death Note, a Shinigami\u2019s (Godof Death, literally) notebook. On Death Note, an instruction of how to use the Death Note is written in English language. Light, being curious, tries to write a criminal\u2019s name onto the Death Note, and much to his disbelief, the criminal dies. Light then vows to rid the world of evil to make a better world, he executes every criminal under the alias of Kira (Japanese interpretation for the English word \u201ckiller\u201d). Fast forward for a few weeks, the polices begin to notice there are unusual deaths going among the criminals, they then decide to bring in the legendary detective L to track down whoever is killing the criminals.  Although it is true that the criminal rate has gone down drastically ever since Kira shows up, L believes that Kira is promoting peace in the wrong way.\\n\r\nFirst of all, I have to say that the art is really well-drawn. Although it is tagged as shounen and most of the time it shows guys, the girls are really well drawn as well. The art style in this anime is really suitable for the genre. The art tries to be as \u201canime-like\u201d as possible while maintaining its realistic and mysterious quality. I personally think there isn\u2019t any better-suited drawing style for Death Note.\\n\r\nI like to think that I\u2019m an audiophile myself, and I find this anime really interesting sound-wise. The background music, which slides in every now and then, will allow you to feel the suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice actors/actresses are also very good. The voices for \"shinigamis\" are well dubbed in a hoarse voice.The opening and ending songs are really good, lyrics wise and music wise.\\n\r\nThe characters are very unique and varied. Light won\u2019t bat an eye when he is killing other people, L likes to sit with his legs raised on the chair. Light and L are pretty much opposite in everything they do, but they both don\u2019t like losing, and they will do practically anything to avoid it. Other characters, like Amane Misa, which will be introduced later as the anime goes, is also very unique. Out of all the characters in the anime, I personally find L very interesting.\\n\r\nDeath Note is one of those animes that require a bit of thinking in order for you to fully understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s really interesting to see how Kira and L try to outsmart one another, and it\u2019s even more interesting when you can actually understand why they do what they do. That aside, if you are looking for some easy-viewing anime without any thinking, Death Note definitely is not your cup of tea.\\n\r\nFor those of you romance-lovers: although Death Note does provide some romance, (and by some, I totally meant little to none) expect to see Light doing some romantic manipulation scenes instead of lovey-dovey scenes.\\n\r\nBottom line, I really enjoyed this anime, and I will recommend this to almost anyone out there with decent comprehension level. Although this anime is relatively old (it was released in 2006), I feel the need to review this anime since I think this anime is hands-down one of the best animes out there. If you like those animes which require you to think, give this anime a shot and let me know what you think below! Oh, my personal favorite character is L, what\u2019s yours?",

            "content": "This is a unique show that brings a new meaning to the concept of &ldquo;Death Gods&rdquo;. Death Note would have to be the finest written non-action, non-romance anime/manga of our time, with a story that can easily get you hooked. ^_^\r\nThis is the setting of this incredibly unique show. From the summary it may not seem like something worth watching but the first two episodes are capable of getting almost any anime fan hooked, to this thought-provoking show. Underneath all the death and normal day-to-day occurrences is a battle of wits, where you have two geniuses Light and L, constantly trying to outsmart each other.During these mental clashes it is easy to change the side you support, as both characters are so alike but with different ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this show can only be described as &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. The character designs are highly detailed and strangely enough, even a lot of detail is put into something as simple as writing that it can make anything seem so dramatic. There&rsquo;s really nothing negative that can be said about the animation because no corners were cut in the production process.\\n\\n\r\nThe music helps add to the spectacular viewing experience, with the addicting opening and ending themes and a superb orchestra score to back it up. The only bad thing is the deafening 2nd opening theme, which you&rsquo;ll either love or hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a masterpiece able to turn a simple plot of a notebook giving the user the power of death, into something so thought-provoking and intricately written that you&rsquo;ll be glued to every word that&rsquo;s said. The only bad points are that there&rsquo;s some unneeded comedy and a phase when the show went downhill a little but this short period didn&rsquo;t last long. Although some of it changed from the original manga storyline, it managed to end disturbingly well, wrapping up everything with no lose ends. So I recommend Death Note to any shounen anime fan, who wants to try something a little different.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Death Note was probably one of the first anime series for which I read the manga first, but that's the main reason I was disappointed in it.\r\nSTORY - As I said in my review of the manga, I find Death Note's story impressive in many ways, the most prominent of which is its ability to deal with such serious and controversial issues without offending or alienating anyone. The themes in this series are some of the most relevant and volatile ones I've encountered in a long time, and I really admire the manga for that. Unfortunately, adaptations of brilliant works will always be subject tocomparisons with the original. This will probably be a very comparative review then, and I know myself to be a bit of a purist; that's my bias. Just keep it in mind, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nThe first twenty-three or so episodes of the anime were wonderfully done as they did followed the manga almost exactly. Sure, there were a few hiccups here and there (for seemingly no reason), but as a whole, I was satisfied. The story was good, and the storytelling was good. But then everything fell apart. The spoiler episode was awful. They tried too hard. They changed too much. One of the most dramatic things about the entire ordeal was that even though there was certainly anticipation, the actual event seemed to come out of no where. It had been sudden and went against all expectations. The storytelling in the manga had been fantastic. The anime made it far too predictable, far too cliche, and it tried way too hard to turn it into a gigantic sobstory. And it didn't impress me. I know I have a hard time seeing this anime as a standalone work, but even if I hadn't already read the manga, I feel like I would have thought this important turning point in the series was done in a completely over-the-top and unnecessary way. There were just so many utterly awkward and useless moments thrown in that I was left wondering what the hell the producers had been thinking. Did I dare think anything would improve?\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised to see that the anime was only 37 episodes. The manga was 108 chapters with your very clear halfway point at 58. This translated into episode 25 of the anime. Why compact the last 50 chapters into a measly 12 episodes? I am inclined to think that because the second half of the manga was considerably less popular compared to the first, they didn't think it necessary to dwell too much on it. This was unfortunate because it means they had to rush everything and consequently seemed to give very little thought to the build up and suspense that was so key in the manga. The last few episodes were a blur, character development was thrown out the window, tension remained low, and the end was disappointingly underwhelming. They once again, tried too hard to make a tragedy out of it when it wasn't supposed to be a tragedy at all. They changed the final tone of the series and completely ignored/overwrote what two of the characters ended up doing. I'm not so anal that I don't think changes from the original can be good (indeed, I adored both Death Note live action movies and they were incredibly different), but changes need to be done for a reason, and none of the changes that happened in transition from manga to anime made any sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - For the most part, the anime remained true to the manga characterizations. Light was as conniving as ever, and L retained all of his endearing little quirks. Because of the condensed nature of the anime though, some of the detectives in the investigation team ended up not as developed or explored as their manga counterparts. The most drastic of the personality cuts fell on Mello though. Near was lucky enough to retain much more screentime than his counterpart and his character was mostly the same as a result. Mello, on the other hand, was reduced to nothing more than a chocolate-munching tool with an incredibly flat personality. And poor Matt wasn't even explained in his entire five minutes of screentime. Of course, Matt wasn't all that vital of a character, but if that was the case, why include him at all? No time is better than half-assed time. And considering Mello and Near's inevitable &quot;partnership,&quot; I felt like he was really cheated out of better development in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, because some material was changed from the manga, some characters ended up acting in ways they never did before, and these actions conflicted with their personalities. I still don't really understand why any of these changes were made other than to force the idea of a grand tragedy, which is kind of silly in the end. :/\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, you can refer to my obnoxiously long section on characters in my manga review.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Though the anime didn't quite capture the essence of Obata's style, it was still well-rendered, and I would consider the animation to be on the higher end of the spectrum for series these days. The details in characters like Misa and Ryuk were well done, and the realistic environment of the world they lived in translated well from manga to anime. It was also interesting (and kind of hilarious) to see the high number of over-exaggeration, over-dramatization, and over-emphasis for some sequences in the series. As the manga had very little actual action, Death Note was destined to be a &quot;talking&quot; anime, but it didn't seem to want to just take that label sitting down. Indeed, in between the talking, there are wild arm gestures, epic crunching of potato chips, and some of the most ridiculous depictions of the act of writing you've ever seen. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable art and animation in the series was probably contained in its themes though. Both openings and both endings had a very experimental style to them that I really appreciated. The strong, symbolic colors worked well, and the craziness of some of things (lol, second OP?) really added to the experience. I kind of wonder if the carry-over of Light's EVIL RED EYES into the actual episodes was a bit overkill though.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - I was incredibly pleased with Death Note's soundtrack and especially the music for its openings and endings. It isn't often you get some of the harsher jrock stuff in anime. As Death Note presents itself as a fairly serious series, it was interesting to note that the wildness of its theme songs suggested at least a little bit of self-mockery. Then again, maybe that's just the impression I get as an American viewer; certainly the Japanese don't always realize that their use of Engrish is often hilarious to us. Already a fan of Nightmare, I was very happy with the first OP and ED themes; &quot;The World,&quot; especially, seemed to work well considering the themes of the series; there is a tension in the vocals that parallels with all of the drama and suspense in Death Note, and &quot;Alumina&quot; offers a more mellow and uncertain mood at the end of each episode. The second pair of themes by Maximum the Hormone were also pretty brilliant. Of course, &quot;What's up people?&quot; has become infamous in itself for its refrain and near-psychedelic animation sequence, but really, I think the song works well for the latter portion of the series, and the &quot;Zetsubou Billy&quot; is a good follow up for &quot;Alumina&quot; as well. It's pretty rare to see a group do both themes for a certain cluster of episodes, but I really think this set-up works great.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is impressive because, once again, it's able to capture the mood and themes of the series very well. L's theme is mysterious and a bit badass, and there is a slew of crazy dramatic orchestral and opera pieces that I think is incredibly appropriate for Kira's executions. What is with this association with classical music and death? In any case, this dramatic music, coupled with the animated over-emphasis of certain motions, makes even the most mundane of action sequences fun to watch (if not a bit silly), It definitely succeeds at entertaining you anyway.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I watched 1-25 and 36-37 subbed, and then followed the entirety of the dub as it aired. Let's talk about the sub first. The hilarious implications of Yamaguchi Kappei being the voice of L aside, I really enjoyed the Japanese cast for Death Note. Light's voice fit well with what I'd expected, and Kappei really did a fantastic job with L, though I thought would be tricky not only because of his unique personality and quirks, but because his age was largely unknown. I also really liked Ryuk's and Rem's voices as they were both rather strange and unique and thus fitting, considering their supernatural existence. Misa was maybe too genericly &quot;cute,&quot; but she didn't really have that complicated of a personality to depict anyway. The investigation team also had some great voices; Matsuda in particular had a wonderfully appropriate voice and was fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the dub. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over the absolute hilarity that is the fact that Brad Swaile is Light Yagami. For the Gundam Wing fans among us, yes, that means that your pacifist Quatre Raberba Winner is your megalomaniac Kira. Of course, Quatre did go crazy for that one episode, so maybe it isn't so farfetched after all... In any case, because Swaile didn't really change his voice for the role, I had a hard time un-hearing it as Quatre and thus had the persisting impression that Light sounded far too innocent and nice, even when he was having one of his monstrous monologues. L's voice I was pleasantly surprised at because I'd never imagined they'd be clever or insightful enough to give him the slightest British accent. His age also remained appropriately ambiguous, and I appreciated the efforts to make him sound socially awkward as well. Was it as good a performance as Kappei? No, but I still found it rather impressive.\\n\\n\r\nRyuk and Rem also had pretty awesome dub voices, while Misa fell into the trap of having an annoyingly high-pitched, cute-girl voice, though I'd blame her general personality for that more than her voice actor. Most everyone else, including all of the detectives, Mikami, Takada, Near, and the SPK, had good, solid, and appropriate dub voices. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for poor Mello who gets cheated again. Considering the otherwise decent dub cast, I was really surprised (and actually somewhat shocked) that Mello got stuck with some kind of stupid jock kind of voice. Seriously, what the hell happened? His voice was nasally and obnoxious, and it really sounded like his actor was trying too hard and failing miserably with every attempt to sound badass and/or serious. Matt also got a mediocre voice, but hey, he got like... two lines, so whatever, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Honestly, if you count them, there aren't all that many changes between the anime and manga, but what did change was very significant. It's the little details that entirely change the way you might look at something. Some characters didn't get their final words; some characters did things they never would have done (and didn't). I'm indignant on these characters' behalf. Maybe I'm fixating a bit too much on these details though. Most of the story did remain intact, and the technical aspects of the show (animation, art, music, etc) were certainly impressive. In the end, I suppose how much you enjoy this depends a lot on whether you've already read the manga and how much of a purist you are.",

            "content": "\u201cDark and mature. A predictable physiological anime. A diamond that choose to stay coal\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nDEATH NOTE one of the most well-known anime worldwide and highly ranked. \r\nLet's start! :)\r\n-STORY: 8-\r\nDon\u2019t get carried away, the story isn\u2019t really unique, after all it is \u2013almost- your typical \u201cvigilante\u201d \u2013or hero of justice- anime with a twist. The \u201clore\u201d \u2013to call it somehow- used in the story IS what makes it unique.\r\nEnter Death Note, a book that falls from the sky, a book that is able to kill people by picturing the person on your mind and writing his or her name on the book \u2013probablythe most original thing in the shows-. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with a bang, a very well-grounded \u201cmyth\u201d and focus but after some episodes it becomes dull, repetitive and unimpressive -thing that usually happens with some mystery/police/detective anime shows- losing the decent ambient showed on the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start of the \u201csecond\u201d part of the show it becomes predictable. I understand what they were trying to do; displaying a bigger and more intricate situation and world but what the writers achieved was to create a boring way to create the climax that would lead to the ending of the show \u2013a very predictable ending if I may add-.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the \u201cthird\u201d part, \u201cthe real climax and ending\u201d \u2013the last 10 episodes- are probably the \u201cbest\u201d. As I\u2019ve stated before since the beginning of \u201cpart 2\u201d the show becomes predictable and it doesn\u2019t promise anything more but a great, expected yet graceful ending. The climax starts from the episode 30 \u2013more or less- leading to an ending of \u201cfireworks and explosions\u201d \u2013I mean this. You\u2019ll need to see the show to know if it\u2019s symbolically or literal-.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I was disappointed that the \u201cmyth\u201d in which the story is based \u2013the book and gods- doesn\u2019t evolve it just gets \u201cstuck in the back\u201d of most of the story, like an inconvenient thing that will be used when it becomes convenient.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that saved \u2013in my opinion- the story department in the show is three things: One: the ambition of the writers, a very interesting premise that will lead eventually to better things \u2013in the end of the show-. Two: the suspense carried through the entire show. As I said before some episodes are dull and repetitive, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no interesting or good closing scene. And three: Something so small yet so important in the whole show the debate of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. Or in other words Light or L?\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 7- \\n\r\nOutdated. That\u2019s a word that I would use for the art in this show but let us remember that it was aired from 2006 to 2007. Death Note doesn\u2019t have one of those art styles that \u201cimmerse\u201d you into the show. It\u2019s just generic. Does this means is bad? No, not at all, it just means that the art isn\u2019t the most important thing in the show and that the art isn\u2019t something memorable. The dark \u201cpalette\u201d is good but it\u2019s just there to give the mood and not to amaze the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nAs a psychological show, most of the time the characters are talking and there isn\u2019t really \u201cthat much\u201d action making me believe that the ART team could have done something more or something better. \\n\r\nIn the last episodes the art becomes \u2013really- much better, the \u201cpalette\u201d changes from dark colors to brighter color giving a better sensation that in most of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 6-\\n\r\nThe voice acting isn\u2019t a role model nor inspiring, it isn\u2019t imposing something good. It\u2019s typical and not passionate \u2013until the last episode-. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is forgettable and uninteresting with some good choirs or piano compositions thrown at key moments. There\u2019s nothing left to say except for the main themes that slightly save that department.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 6-\\n\r\nDisappointing, That\u2019s the word I will use, other word would be \u201cwanting\u201d.  \\n\r\nThe presentation of the characters is great.  Here you have Light, a character that looks amazing and really interesting but the through the show becomes typical.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters regretfully as it may sound, are boring and plain. With the understandable exceptions of \u201cLight\u201d \u2013of course- and \u201cL\u201d. Characters that are incredibly smart, making the rest of the characters look dumb and ordinary with no business there; this in my opinion is short from all the potential they could have \u201csqueezed\u201d from most character (ex. Touta Matsuda). \\n\r\nBeing a show that depicts very intelligent people such as L and Lightning, to be honest, I\u2019ve seen better portrayed \u201cmasterminds\u201d in other anime -predominantly Lelouch vi Britannia (Code Geass) character usually compared to Light-\\n\\n\r\nThe most disappointing part of the characters is their development which is your typical \u201cdevelopment\u201d in a psychological show. The typical cold and calculating characters that turn into the obsessive and mad characters, nothing new there. What started as a great mastermind character \u2013Light- ended as an average psychological MC.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 8 & OVERALL: 7-\\n\r\nI would be lying if I told you that I didn\u2019t enjoy DEATH NOTE, the waiting \u2013through some boring episodes- to see how the -obvious and unavoidable- ending would unveil itself. The show isn\u2019t bad, the premise as I told before is good, it promises something great, but the journey from begging to end its just boring in most episodes and the ending \u2013expected I\u2019m sure by most- is beautiful and as I said \u201cpoetic\u201d. \\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but it doesn\u2019t reach the potential it promises.",

            "content": "I'm one of the few people who would never say this is one of the best animes of all times and here is why:\r\nAlthough the plot of Death Note seems to be very interesting to me, I really belive it is painfully developed all over the anime.\r\nFor me was pretty cool when the two main characters was presented has rivals (Light and L): I belived it would be really interesting to see which of them will defeat the other and how. However, all I could get watching it was fucking stupid monologues in which Light and L where ridiculously guessing each other thougts.\r\nHere it's anexample of a joke I found on a spanish web (Inciclopedia) of an hypothetical battle of \"Rock-paper-scissors\" between Light and L:\\n\\n\r\n(YAGAMI LIGHT THINKING): \"The most logical to do would be play rock; L must know this, because of what he would probably play paper, and to defeat him I must play scissors. But: what if he discovered my plan? If that's what it is, to beating my paper he would play scissors, and therefore I should keep playing rock. But maybe he tought that I would think this way, so I must play paper...\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fun example of what I belive is pretty much all you can find on Death Note. Really: this is what this anime is about. At the beginning is \"ok\", but then it just gets dummer and dummer, and in my case finished in the desire of killing the screenplayer. \\n\\n\r\nFor the other hand, before watching Death Note you need to consider that you'd probably never expect to find what you will in the second half of the anime. And I'm not saying it in a good way: on the contrary, from my point of view the second half of Death Note is a big peace of crap. It is as if the writer had died, and a complete asshole had replaced it. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters I would say, although there are a lot of them, only a few has their own personality, and by the way, a non very deep one.  In the particular case of the only important female character, Misa,  I need to say she is hatefully annoying and do not have a will for her own: the only thing she does is adoring Light Yagami because he is hot, in other words: she is as shallow as she can be.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing: I have to admit I like L wiredness, but I hated when among the story more \"wired\" characters appear: for me they were just mediocre imitations. Don't make me talk about the guy that was always eating the beginning of a chocolate bar (you would never see him eating a whole bar: I belive he makes one bite, throw away the bar, open a new one, makes another bite, and so on).  \\n\\n\r\nFinally I have to admit I enjoyed the music and also the animation: they were really good... but that's not enough to make Death Note a a good anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo: this anime sucks, and the only think I really love about it is the way some people make fun of it. If you want to watch it... go on, probably you will like it because most people does. However, if you watch it and you hate it, have for sure you will make fun of it forever and ever.  \\n\\n\r\nP.D.: yeah, the characters are hot, especially if you're a girl, or a gay guy.",

            "content": "Death Note is areally wickid awsome anime that is pretty much one of the best. Everything about it is pretty cool and set up well so thatalso makes t a good anime to watch.\r\nStory: Death Note is about a 17 year old student names Light/Ratio Yagami who one day stumbles apon a book called the \"Death Note\" that the shinigami Ryuk droped into the human world from the shinigami world. After a few days of playing with the death note Light meets Ryuk. Because is trying to make the world a better place by killing all the criminals with heart attacks or so o heis nicknamed &quot;Kira&quot; which in japanese means killer. Also because of what he is doing the famous detective L Lawliet and some other police go on a hunt to find this so called kira and bring him to justice. We get into more charactes and other things when you get deeper into the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of death note is very detailed and good. How they draw the characters and senary is almost realistic. The detail of it is also very well drawn and is very enjoyble to wtch when seeing the episodes. So the art of death note is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds in death note is very much related to the characters it is playing for. A example of it is Light's kira theme when righting names in the death note. It adds a edge to the characters. Also for sould the openings and endings are also much like the plot and chaacters. The OP and ED akes you wanna know what it is about pretty much in a way. The sound is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters of death note are, in a way, related to the plot. Like Light Yagami is the killer trying to bring piece, L is the detective trying to hunt down and put a end to the killer, and Ryuk is the previder of the device to help the killer. So the characters are very great and relate to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, death note is a great aime for all who enjoy horror, mystery, psychological, and everything else it is. death Note is truely a anime worth looking at.  &lt; 3",

            "content": "Look, I am not a regular viewer of anime. For all I know, I'm probably missing something that I would not otherwise if I viewed anime as regularly as you. Still, Death Note was an interesting show that quickly made me realise that following the culture surrounding it is a good way of losing whatever sense of taste I have apparently cultivated. \r\nDeath Note is not a bad show. Its just a show that is too clever for its own good. Actually, \"clever\" makes it sound like a backhanded compliment- \"paranoid\" would suit it better. Paranoia swirls around in the mind of its protagonist, YagamiLight, telling him that someone might always suspect him, a teenager, of murdering people despite the means of the murders being untraceable- there was no real way the law would have caught up to him until he decided to take public requests. But he insists that he may be caught. So he builds an elaborate invention to destroy a goofy-looking notebook with rules written in a foreign language in case someone in his house or outside tries to reach for it. Egging him on is the Spirit of Death Ryuk, who acts both to applaud the pointless complexity of Yagami's thinking and to be an audience POV character, because, even if you don't understand what's happening, Ryuk affirms how the whole thing could only come from the mind of a supremely intelligent person so that you too applaud at what's happening on the screen. I followed this logic too, until I realised that such thinking is characteristic of paranoid individuals- the last thing they need is encouragement. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is L- the weirdo who's strange behaviour makes everybody uncomfortable, except for his butler Watery. No wait, its \"Watari\" or something. Anyway, he apparently comes from money and has a cult going in the background to make sure his \"legacy\" survives with M and N, in case something happens to him. Of course, something does, and how this happens is so convoluted that only people who have seen the show can begin to fathom. Regardless, Ryuk is there to prevent anyone from calling out the bucket-sized plot-hole as well as the horse-sized good luck necessary for such a plan to work and induce exhilaration at the completely artificial solution to Yagami's equally Byzantine problem, because of course another Spirit of Death would fall in love with one of the worst characters I've ever seen in anime, no matter how little I have seen of it. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe that's the point. This show is not about two geniuses fighting each other over their own ideas of justice- its about how the biggest geniuses in the world are paranoid people, and giving them Death Notes is like throwing petrol on a raging fire. Unfortunately, the original author had a lot of petrol to spare, as is visible in the problem called Misa Amane. \\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned \"worst character\", Misa is the kind of baggage an intrepid traveller is offended when asked to carry. Not only is she shallow and stupid, but her committing suicide was one of the best things that happened at the end of the show. While Yagami treats her like the pointless piece of garbage she is, it just reflects what a terrible view this show has of female characters. Why couldn't L have been a woman? Or anyone in the \"anti-Kira\" gang? Or \"Near\" or \"Mello\" (what amazing names)? At the very least, the show wouldn't have appeared to be contemptuous of women then.\\n\\n\r\nThe pointless use of logic to substitute for characters shows how much storytelling has changed. No need for emotional development, just throw the closest approximation of intelligence that the writer believes he has on the screen. However, do not be fooled into thinking that this is actually intelligence, because the writing leaves a lot unsaid about the failures in intelligence made by the characters: How, for instance, does Yagami justify murdering people who weren't given a fair trial? What if he killed people who were wrongly convicted? He didn't have access to the evidence that those actually investigating crimes did, right? And even if he did, where did he gather them for criminals from outside Tokyo, let alone Japan? In short, Yagami's juvenile sense of justice remains unquestioned by his actions or his emotions. Both the Death Note and Ryuk prevent him from seeing anything other than what he does and the audience feels compelled to accept him because Ryuk will tell you how impressive all of this is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nBut then comes the second season. I liked it far more than the painfully manipulative first season, because it was trying to discuss the consequences of Yagami's actions, with religions popping up around Kira and the anti-Kira gang realising what a big mistake they had made by trusting Yagami. That is precisely why I could tolerate Near and Mello- they came from a bigger world, not to be easily placed within the conflict of insulated geniuses who kept fighting among and decided the \"fate of the world\" for themselves. Yes, even Near, who is almost an L clone, except that he has a close friend in Mello. There was nothing I liked more than Yagami breaking down because that was the only time I heard the voice acting of Mamoru Miyano come to life in this show. I won't say that the second season justifies the first season, with the introduction of new Death Notes for no discernable reason other than to increase the list of characters, but I do feel that there was far more that was redeemed in this season.\\n\\n\r\nI still maintain that Death Note was not worth my time, but I am kind of okay with it existing. I nearly forgot about it and I am sure that, now I have written this here, I will forget about it within a few more months. I understand that reading this may likely incense you into writing some really mean comments. If you are going to insult my intelligence, please do: I found out that I am really insecure about it and I need as much of your salt as you can spare in order to get over it. At least that way, this show wouldn't have been a waste.",

            "content": "We always have this inkling feeling that we can change human nature for the better. That change would be to wipe off all scum and villainy off the face of the earth to ensure that we can protect the ones we love and make the world a better place. Idealistic angst plays a role in it, which fits perfectly with Death Note\u2019s theme. \r\nThe quote signifies the theme in such a way that characterizes the plot involving our protagonist, Light Yagami, who stumbles upon a notebook that can kill people by writing their names. At first, he uses it for justice to kill every criminalhe sees on the News from their faces, at least what he believes to be justice in his eyes. Then we realize that with his fantastical power, he develops a holier-than-thou attitude and descends into pure madness. That, giving context to the plot, makes Death Note a fascinating character study to behold.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we first get introduced to Light and the plot in general, we don\u2019t necessarily know how we are supposed to view his intentions at a moral level. The writing does a splendid job of not portraying Light in a glorified stature to his heinous acts. It pieces all of the psychological aspects of his character in a way that makes him a very hateful person, but it feels fitting to how he portrays himself to the audience. Delving into how he manipulates people to do his very bidding gives him an anti-hero status from the halfway point, and we see him from a very different angle than before. How it paces this growth in each episode is very subtle but poignant when it reaches the climax and gives it a nice spark of genius to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, while not the most significant plot there is, has some meat to its subject matter. Its only sufferings are how it skews over insightful commentary into the theme it presents and instead devolves into more extravagant drama. I wouldn\u2019t call it out if the show didn\u2019t bother actually to hint at doing one. The constant narration over Light seems to imply that it wants to add a message to its philosophy, but it doesn\u2019t seem to explain itself any further than derivative narration. This style over substance makes it seem like mere preaching than actually trying to convey a message in any meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with that flaw on point, what does save it is the amount of tension it brings in the dramatic moments in sufficient depth. Direction and writing serve this case nicely where, yes, even a scene of a guy eating a potato chip and him having a monologue about it still makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Death Note essentially comes across as a hard-boiled police story with elements of mystery to it. The only difference is that you know who the killer is in plain sight, which adds to a slight problem to the story: it kills the mystery aspect. It would prove more fruitful on Death Note\u2019s part to have L be the main protagonist and we not know who Kira is specifically, and we could then follow Light\u2019s criminal methods later on to add a rich narrative. All that we have here is a simple drama piece with really halfhearted attempts at being a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nL and Light prove to be a welcoming duo near the middle portion of Death Note, whether they are secretly clashing with each other or working together to stop \u201cKira.\u201d Both of these characters are gifted with great intelligence and charisma to their characters that don\u2019t seem like such a bore to experience in either drama or comedy. However, there is the issue of the typical \u201cmain protagonists are amazing, but the rest pale in comparison\u201d syndrome in Death Note. One character even started pretty good until she eventually devolved into pure nothingness during the 2nd half of the series, and that is Misa. She\u2019s the antithesis of a character who has a pretty significant tragic edge to her archetype, but it seemed as the writers didn\u2019t give her the time of day to really shine and just become another pointless side character.\\n\\n\r\nOthers that fall in the supporting cast are hit or miss. Except for Near, who is L 2.0 but hey I\u2019m not complaining, I couldn\u2019t find any connection with any of them. They can all be summed up as having a problem with the lack of having a unique identity and no development to them. And I\u2019m not explicitly talking about the typical person in the police force. Yello and Mikami, in particular, have pretty significant roles in the story but they aren\u2019t given enough depth for me to earn my interest. Nevertheless, some of the people in the police force to have more to offer in terms of actual presence. Light\u2019s father, Soichiro Yagami, does have some nice-needed depth to facilitate the police-side of the issue of things.\\n\\n\r\nWith the dark overtones in the colors washed in the background and foreground, the art compliments the tone with supreme efficiency. What is also fitting is the fact that it does not overshadow it to the point where it's hard to tell what is going on. Having a grand scope to its animation is pretty astounding with the advents of the fantasy aspect to Death Note in conjunction with the real world.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has either seen Death Note or at least heard of it. Does it deserve to be called the best anime of all time because of this? Nope. It is most certainly good in its own right in many aspects. An intense and gripping drama are two things that define Death Note, and that can be enough to warrant one viewing. Just don\u2019t buy into all the hype that it has gotten, not even a little.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B",

            "content": "On the technical side of things, it\u2019s hard to say Death Note has great animation because 90% of this show is dialogue. No one ever stops talking, and while they blabber endlessly, the artists have a field day with lighting, masking, and the poses of the intricately designed characters. Death Note has great, beautiful, gothic, faux-realistic ART. The background and character art is a regal feast for the eyes. The animation is rarely showcased. When it is, the animators have entirely too much fun, but bless \u2018em for it, penmanship has never been so epic. (An A plus and twenty counts of murder in thefirst degree, Mr. Yagami!) \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of over the top, the music reaches new heights in gothic melodrama that makes shots of toilet paper seem epic...Forget over the top, every speck of this series is floating in orbit somewhere around \u201cthe top,\u201d it\u2019s heart-stopping and laid on entirely too thick, but clearly, the ludicrous flair was intentional and will color you impressed in its majestic silliness. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voicing these characters in all their bombastic melodrama, you have to stick to RGAs: REALLY GOOD ACTORS. This anime is entirely talking, half the time monologuing, and that is a complete disaster unless the voice actors are captivating. THANKfully, great care was taken with this dub, bringing in a few veterans for the main roles and several newbies with great voices for lesser parts. But rivals L and Light control this game and do most of the talking, so, I\u2019ll be blunt: Alessandro Juliani is L. He blows away his Japanese counterpart who gave the detective a good gnomish and sometimes quirky monotone but comes nowhere near the musicality and nuance in Juliani\u2019s delivery. It\u2019s rare to hear a character say one thing but communicate several different things, but you hear it in almost every line L speaks, and I would recommend the dub for his performance alone. In reference to Light, though, I have to switch languages for a sec. I think Mamoru Miyano may be the most talented young seiyuu in Japan. Like Light, he\u2019s a perfectionist in every subject, with breadth ranging from stalwart hero (Kiba) to comedic buffoon (Tamaki) to angsty hotty (Zero) and effeminate toady (Ichiru). He played his own evil twin so well in Vampire Knight that I thought it was a different actor for the entire show\u2019s run. But nowhere is he more at home than in the part of the charismatic murderous mastermind. It\u2019s scary how good this guy is, you\u2019d think he had practice. Brad Swaille might have noticed this, because he starts off trying way too hard as Light. But within a couple episodes, he seems to slip into the role naturally, and by the end, his portrayal can stand up tall beside Miyano\u2019s, laughing in perfect maniacal pitch.\\n\\n\r\nSo if the incredible hype or the fact that the show\u2019s almost a radio drama hasn\u2019t scared you off yet, you\u2019ll want to listen up: Death Note is one brilliant rollercoaster ride. It\u2019s as Ryuk predicts: never boring. It\u2019s not blah, blah, blah, car chase, fist fight, blah, it\u2019s captivating revelation, melodramatic declaration of victory, brilliant deduction, holmes, and why are we watching a car chase, I want to hear them talk more! To give you an idea of the intricacy present, the original manga was illustrated by one man and written in fine detail by another, who I can only assume is one of those guys who sleep-solves Rubik\u2019s cubes when he wants to give his brain a rest. He fills in cracks in the case\u2019s web of logic that I didn\u2019t even know were cracks until L is nice enough to explain it to us, and I find it astonishing how well the author remembered which character knows what and how he could use it down the storyline. It has the adrenaline fuel of a sports anime, but all anyone plays is mind games, brilliant mind games. This should offer a caution to some viewers though, because Death Note makes homicide \u201cso much fun.\u201d While it\u2019s not irreverent, only impartial, the very idea of turning good and evil into a childish chess game turns a few people off, so be wary if you\u2019re one of them.\\n\\n\r\nBe wary as well if you\u2019re into complex characters, because Light and L are psychologically complex but emotionally underdeveloped little things subject to entirely too much speculation about what their relationship is like. (Yaaaaaoi fangirls approacheth...) Past their interaction, everyone else is a one-note pawn. None of them are unrealistic, and many are entertaining, but don\u2019t expect to see any development, unfortunately. That would take away from the drive of the mindgame, so the show chooses quantity over quality with heaps of supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nNone of them can take a smear of the spotlight from Light or L, though, which is the death-knell for Death Note later on in the series when the focus is taken away from L for a time and the series spirals from masterpiece to barely watchable, saving itself only through a last episode so good you\u2019ll want to rewatch it as soon as it\u2019s over. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, these spare pages of imperfection are just papercuts on a masterful hand that guides this mystery in all the right directions, so if the phenomenon still hasn\u2019t bitten your interest, make a note to see a show that for once, deserves its hype.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Death Note is Shonen Jump at its very best, but it\u2019s still just shonen jump. Don\u2019t believe the rabid fans who tell you it\u2019s some profound exploration of good and evil, because to give it false credit as a mature title would be to miss the point. This is a teen-aimed thrill ride that\u2019s not too deep and it\u2019s barely realistic, but dang, is it well-written, with high-gloss presentation and spare flaws you could fit on a post-it note.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdOV2Y0KAUk\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "I have to say that even though some elements of this series can be a bit predictable, it is still effectively cerebral. It\u2019s one of those stories where it\u2019s not about the destination, but about the journey. This anime is very methodical with its approach to further openly re-defining the classic good vs evil battle, and keeps other aspects at a certain ambiguity that opens up a lot of legitimate debate and discussion, such as the morality in relation to this anime, though the creators of the original manga have admitted that wasn\u2019t a concern or intention of theirs. At times, the anime will gobeyond good vs. evil, but I felt can be seen as a battle about whose right will prevail.  \\n\\n\r\nEverybody watching this anime, or maybe even reading the manga will naturally think that even though Lights intends to do the world away of criminals, does he have a right to take the life of another person regardless of the severity of their actions? Thinking about it, if you had the same kind of power, would you do the same? Do something different? Or try nothing at all? In addition to this, it\u2019s not just Light that you will find yourself at odds with, but L will even stoop to some lows that will make him the poster boy for the Patriot Act. So even though L is on the side of the authorities, his methods at times doesn\u2019t make him any better than Light when it comes to exceeding moral boundaries in the name of justice. While with Light being progressively preachy and power hungry, he will manipulate people and treat them as expendable that will make him detestable to viewers. At times, I felt the rivalry between Light and L went beyond who was right or wrong, but was more of a clash of who has the bigger ego, in which it has its own kind of entertaining value and really gets you immersed to the characters.   \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters and how they interact and relate to each other is another trait I love about Death Note. Even though L and Light are mortal enemies, the series excellently presents that they are the only people that they can relate to. And I also enjoy the moments where Ryuk can be a foil to Light. Even though Ryuk only sees Light\u2019s attempt at conquest as cheap entertainment, there are times he will question his motives and exhibits he is disturbed by his behavior. And it\u2019s hard to really imagine a Shinigami of Ryuk\u2019s laid back attitude to really have the moral high ground when he only sees it as fun, but you can\u2019t help but see he has a point. \\n\\n\r\nBut moving on, the pacing is very fast and a lot happens throughout a majority of the show, but I think some things rush are a bit too much for the sake of convenience, especially approaching the end. But I\u2019m pretty sure most people prefer fast over slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are very faithful to the manga so I can\u2019t really complain.  First thing I really like to talk about is the use of colors: due to the nature of this anime; not only is the presentation dark, it still exhibits very excellent resolution where you can see a good majority of the surrounding environment, and it greatly emphasizes the atmosphere and mood. The quality of the coloring makes the experience very significant to environmental and character details in which they all fit, and yet still stand out at a point where you can see virtually everything.  What I also enjoy from this series is when certain characters such as Light and L are high lighted in blue and red when they are internally thinking. It easily conveys who is the aggressor, and who is on the defensive, and also shows who is calm and collected, and who is hot headed. Granted these use of colors are obvious with the meaning, the way it\u2019s highlighted around the hair and skin tones really brings the presentation more directly immersing and charismatic. I also love the scene with Near and Light when they are on the phone and it also shows the viewers of those characters in an imaginary elevator at a construction site. It did feel very random, but I thought it really added a sweet sense of the intensity to that moment in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I strongly believe is that bringing out a sense of intensity is what keeps people hooked on Death Note. I believe what further defines that trait in this series were the angles, movements and pacing when Light was writing in the death note in the initial episodes, and you just gotta love it when Mikami does it. The speed and angles along with the music appropriately emphasizes the divinity that the notebook has, and brings a cinematic feel to it in which only the magic of animation can pull off. Some(of those) scenes involving writing in the death note will be over the top, but I think it\u2019s one of those moments where you have to accept the approach, even if over the top and exaggeration of certain scenes aren\u2019t your thing. Especially in the episode where he opens up a bag of chips and eats it, and that scene alone since then has changed my outlook at potato chips for the rest of my life. I had no idea potato chips could be that dramatic and epic. I simultaneously found it humorous and entertaining, which makes that scene iconic. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to open this part of the review by saying I enjoy the dub, and think it\u2019s great. I\u2019ll admit I was skeptical about Brad Swaile playing Light at first. I\u2019m used to hearing him playing generically nicer and regular characters like Youta from Video Girl Ai, Quatre from Gundam Wing, or Amuro from Gundam. And I\u2019ll admit that he does a good job of playing cynical characters like Mousse from Ranma, but I wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to make that work with Light. I came to accept him as Light, though I personally think he could have been better as L based on my previous exposure to the actor over my years of watching anime. But I\u2019ll acknowledge he made that potato chip scene, while it felt wasn\u2019t that emphatically dramatic in the Japanese version. I believe Allesandro Juliani was pretty good as L, but I think he sounded a bit too formal and not really childish enough to make the character feel complete. But with the intention that the character was raised in England, I feel the English portrayal brings it out in its own way where you can interpret the character in that way. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll also say that I was taken by surprise that Yamaguchi Kappei, the voice of Ranma and Inuyasha, was L in the JPN version. Despite playing loud mouth and rowdy characters, he really did well coming across as calm, quiet and intellectual and I thought that the pitch of his voice gave him those child-like qualities he has, and it gives him a different kind of charisma to why his character is unique. Brian Drummond as Ryuk really had a voice that went well with the grin and really made him sound cool, but I think he kind of lacked this bizarre friendly charm that I felt he has in the Japanese version which I think makes him appealing. \\n\\n\r\nI also think that both Japanese and English voices of Misa were perfect in their own way. Haruhi fans will rejoice that Hirano Aya plays her in the Japanese version - and she will sound pretty recognizable to you, and I think the voice does a great job of representing her bubbly personality, as does Shannon Chan-Kent\u2019s portrayal. If anything, I think Shannon Chan-Kent could make a great Misa in a Hollywood live action Death Note movie, along with the actors who played Light, L, and Watari. \\n\\n\r\nThe last portrayal I want to get into is Mikami\u2019s. In the Japanese version, he is played by Matsukaze Masaya, the voice of Hazuki Ryo, the main character from one of my favorite games of all time, Shenmue. While in the English version, he is played by Kirby Mirrow, the voice of Trowa Barton from Gundam Wing, Van from Escaflowne, Cyclops in X-Men Evolution, and Miroku from Inuyasha. I think they approached the characters stylistically different in their own ways, but I think the portrayals in both versions work that really do represent the character. If I were to define the portrayal of the character by his introduction alone by saying delete or sakujo, or whatever word you want to use - I say in the Japanese version, I get the impression that Mikami is more apathetic, while in the English, I though he sounded more aggressive, but I think that both portrayals bring out the sadist in him. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is accurately orchestrated to suit the dark and cerebral atmosphere of this series and is 110% in your face, and I get that impression with Hirano Yoshihisa's music all the time, especially in the current installment of the Hajime no Ippo anime series. It really immerses you into the scene and keeps your eyes glued to your screen. The tempo and instruments perfectly fits the imagery at the right moment. A lot of the songs used really made me think of Verdis Requiem, the opening to Battle Royale, so I had a very strong feeling that I was to be disturbed but yet amazed by what was going on in the anime. The opening theme called the World by Nightmare couldn\u2019t have been a better choice. It\u2019s dark, but yet extreme and energetic and perfectly flows with the presented imagery that really just grabs your attention by your balls and makes you curious about this anime, that\u2019s how excellent it is.\\n\\n\r\nAt some capacity, I feel Death Note along with a huge majority of Madhouse\u2019s and Shounen Jump\u2019s products deserves a good portion of the praise it has gotten, and I\u2019ll explain what I mean by \u201cgood portion,\u201d and that relates to the ending. Death Note is one of the very few anime I\u2019ve seen in which I already read the entire manga before hand. What has made the Death Note anime very controversial in some circles of the fan base is its ending. I can\u2019t elaborate on it due to spoiler reasons, but if you\u2019ve read the manga AND watched the anime, you know what I\u2019m talking about, and I side with the manga readers on this issue, and that\u2019s all I can say about it without getting into spoilers. And if it weren\u2019t for this change in the ending, I would have probably given this series a perfect 10/10 overall. But anyway, that's my review of Death Note. \\n",

            "content": "Basically a brief summary of Death Note from my point of view:\r\nDeath Note is a show that needs no introduction at all. The name is on pretty much everyone's lips, the people who have watched it or not and one thing which is certainly true is that if you aren't living under a rock all this time there's a very good chance you have heard the name atleast once in your life. It's one of the very few mediums that have crossed boundaries of it's specific origin and in this case, anime. Yes, Death Note is a name that has gone beyond the peripheral reachesof animation and is on a whole new level shared by a few. Dragon Ball Z, Attack on Titan, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood etc. are some of the titles if named. Even so, there's a great amount of daylight between all these and Death Note, which stands atop the popularity section here on Myanimelist, with members flowing in and the number rising by the second. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment you step inside the world of Death Note, it takes a firm hold of you, denying to let go. The adrenaline this show provides is immense, keeping the viewer on his toes for almost every minute of the twenty-three. This is one of the greatest assets and the very core of success for Death Note. With a mind-boggling storyline and head-twisting plot twists, Death Note leaves no chance for the viewer to look away and is captivating throughout the entire process. And thus it also provides a high rewatch value. Perhaps one major mistake the show made is by introducing the two antagonists in the form of Near and Mello. With the addition of these two and Light seemingly in reach of his motive, Death Note loses all its tension and thrill which was imminent in the first arc of the show. To put it rightly, the story gets all mixed up and moves away slowly from its path. This however is not a good reason to look down on the show as a whole, which is still extremely and incredibly well executed. The popularity of Death Note and the fact that is one of the greatest piece of art ever made goes hand in hand with over 669k members and growing by the second. Death Note's place is cemented as the show that lit a fire on the industry and produced an inferno that would last forever. \\n",

            "content": "\"Ever get the feeling of being cheated\" because that's what I get about \"Death Note\".\r\nYagami Raito(Light) is your average high school student who just happens to hate the world (the reason, just because), one day he finds the death note a strange notebook that apparently can be used to kill people with just knowin their name, taking it as seriuosly as a chain letter he tries to prove the \"functioning\" of the book by writting in it the name of a criminal who saw in the news, short after that the criminal died of a heart faliure, surprised by that fact he tires the bookagain with a street gang member and again tha man died this time the cause of death that raito chooses is crashing with a car, after a \"extremely\" quick deppresion for taking the lives of another humang being he decides to bring judgement into al the sinners in the world.\\n\r\nafter a month and with more than 100 victims of the \"note\" the international police starts supecting that the deaths of the criminals are the work of a serial killer with that the world's most famous detective (does that not sound like a clich\u00e9 to you) \"L\" decide to take over the case, at the mean time Raito gets the visit of \"Ryuk\" the shinigami who owns the book, and thet's the begining of a the game of the cat and mouse betwen L and Raito \\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying the story is not interesting it is really enyoyable at least in the beginning but the mayor problem with the series it's how the story is developed into a lame and predictable (Yes, I said Predictable) cop drama.\\n\r\nit appears to me that the main iterest of the author was delivering a great amount of plot twists, in an intent for making it unpredictable but this ends in a big faliure especially in the second part of the series, insteadof taking his time developing L's investigation he just pump it up with a great amout of tecnological gatgets and other stuff you must heve seen in most of hollywood spy movies (and that's not a good thing), due to this non stop bombarding of  bombastic action the mental battle of our main charcters just seems a little too unrealistic and some of the conclusions of our \"great\" team of detectives appear to be just taken out of nowhere\\n\\n\r\nI find most laughable when people label this series as \"psycological\" when there's no such thing as character developmet, if you don't believe me then tell me from when does Raito's hate for the world come he's the son of the chief of the police departament and he leads an easy life as a student and does not have a worry in the world, just as L, and most of the characters, stays in the shadow with no background or a true reason for their actions.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the creator of  Death Note tried too hard to make something new and unpredictable and end with  something we could see in one of the  countless and stereotyped detective series and movies that you could see everywhere. if you're looking for a well paced series with realistic characters and events and a police investigation that makes sense  you probbably don't want to see this, by the other hand if you're looking for some mindless fun this might do the trick",

            "content": "To tell the truth, there are very, very few animes that I really disliked like this one. Actually, dislike is a euphemism. I should say, I loath it. And for good reasons. \r\nI know lots of people think Death Note is one of the masterpiece of the anime-manga industry and that is also why I forced myself to watch it till the last minute. But as I was going through this anime, disliking it more with every episode, I really thought that it was probably me not grasping the full subtlety of the story. But by the last episode, I could honestly say, that thiswas simply a smartly presented empty shell. Maybe the manga is better than that, I wouldn't know, as I haven't read it. And to be honest, I don't feel like to. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole story starts on quite an interesting premise, with a complete psychopathic anti-hero as the lead character and quite twisted protagonists as his main opponents. This could have made for a really thrilling and profound scenario about such issues as the causes for the existence of evil, the meaning of good and evil, the moral contradictions when dealing with it, especially when in possession of a great power, the balancing between good and evil, etc, which are all essential philosophic and moral issues that humans have been dealing with for as long as they started asking questions about the reason for their presence on earth. It could have been interesting to see what a teenage, bored by a too easy life, could have done with it.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, we end up stuck for 37 episodes with a completely immature, if not outright retarded, and self-righteous block who can't even realize the quite obvious and naked contradiction at the heart of his actions, despite being described by his surrounding as a brilliant and precocious genius! In his rage to exterminate bad people from earth, he almost never pause to pounder his own resorting to criminal means to achieve his aim. If he had been as smart as said, it shouldn't have taken him more than a minute to realize that his acceptance of criminal means to accomplish a \"good\" cause means that good and bad aren't completely distinguishable and that they are more often than not simply the two sides of the same coin. This should have led him quickly to the conclusion that no one is completely evil or saintly, but a mix of both good and bad. And to throw away that stupid \"Death book\" even before starting using it. But no, instead he simply sinks always lower into his frantic childish Manichean mindset to reach the final conclusion that he is the only decent person deserving to live! The last episode is so pathetic that I almost threw up! I couldn't believe I had mustered the courage to watch the whole thing to reach such a dumb end! \\n\\n\r\nMy overall feeling was that of an absolute hoax and huge waste of time. Honestly, don't get fooled around by the apparent complexity of the plot itself, in which two parties are seemingly engaged in a chess-like life-size game. They are not. The fact is, Light is so simple-minded that L is always hundred moves ahead of him and this clearly shows in the last episode when Light realizes, FINALLY, that he has made a complete fool of himself from the very beginning!",

            "content": "Death Note is a very good anime and manga, however the phrase \"more is not always better\" applies quite well here.\r\nProgression (10): The planning sequences are done spectacularly and are kind of like the action in this show. If feels very \"adrenaline-y\".\r\nStory (6): I felt that the themes were not well depicted, especially the ones about justice felt even somewhat childish as many characters attempt to prove their justice but never start having a grey morality. They never start questioning themselves and believing that there are no evils involved within this plot, only people who wish to do what they believe in. It even startsto depict some characters as evil which further reinforces the black and white morality in this show. For me, a show that is dark should have a more mature gray morality theme. The story is also relatively simple and even somewhat generic when written so that the main reason why you'll be watching this show is for the brilliantly executed plans that the characters use.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): The artstyle is very dark and very well polished. I felt it fit the atmosphere very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): Though there's no soundtrack I would really prefer listening to by itself, the sound for this show was amazing when played together with the plans so much so that you could feel adrenaline rushing through your veins.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4): There are not really any great characters in Death Note other than L. However, even he is somewhat generic and bland as he and Light make up the \"perfect\" stereotype often played up in anime. Worse is the fact that there is perhaps no or barely any character development and Misa is a very annoying character who often breaks mood and tension in the show where one should be immersed in the plan. However, this shouldn't really be faulted too much as this show doesn't rely on the characters to keep it moving. It relies on the plans of the characters to keep immersion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): This show has some of the best planning scenes I've ever seen within any anime. However, there are a fair number of flaws, not too large, but regardless they are flaws: the characters, the themes, and after episode 25 it felt dragged and boring. However, the reason why you came to watch Death Note was for those action scenes that have adrenaline rush up in your blood as you see Light's plans unfold and as your mind proceeds to be blown away.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR?\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n*Great planning sequences (kind of like the action of the story)\\n\r\n*Amazing artwork for its time\\n\r\n*Great soundtrack\\n\r\n*Very nice mood and atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n*Poor/little character development (though this show does not require much)\\n\r\n*The story and themes are relatively simple and seem somewhat childish\\n\r\n*Inconsistent pacing; after episode 25 the show gets quite dull and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.5/10 (Round up to 8/10)\\n\\n\r\n***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it. If you enjoy/hate this anime/manga, feel free to accept my thoughts on said anime/manga or discard it.",

            "content": "The plot is simple: Light Yagami (pronounced I'm-a-gay-ass-fag), a typical prep-school jerk, god wannabe, 13 year old weeaboo fuck, and part-time man whore, finds a magic notebook (teh Death Note) that kills people simply by writing their name in said notebook. A person whose name is written in the Death Note dies after 40 seconds. Even better, you get to pick the cause of death as well. You could choose \"vehicular homicide\" even if the victim is on the top floor of a skyscraper, and the car will take the elevator. After finding the notebook, Light calls himself 'Kira' which is the Engrish way Japanesepeople say \"killer\". \\n\\n\r\nApparently, the manga is very popular in Japan. The only reason the series has even lasted this long is due to Yaoi obsessed fangirls turning all the characters gay. Some say this is redundant. Possibly the biggest, most overrated, Faggotry of an anime of all time. Think of it as the Twilight of the anime world. Light uses the book to kill criminals in order to create what he considers \"the perfect world\" and act as God in it, thus achieving Hitler's unfinished work. Then he made a mistake by writing his penis' name in the Death Note. The cause of death was bone cancer, although in the director's cut, he accidentally rips it of while masturbating to a picture of L. \\n\\n\r\nLight Yagami is gay solely because Yagami spelled backwards reads Im a gay. The transcription of Japanese characters into Roman letters is never just a weak attempt to take two languages that formed in isolation from one another and make one vaguely coherent to speakers of the other, therefore this has something to do with his/her sexuality, and nothing to do with the fact that it means \"Night God.\" \\n\\n\r\nSources also state that the retarded detective L (yes the letter L) finds that it would be a brilliant idea to CHAIN himself to Light with the excuse that he needed to watch Light at all times. To prove that he is not Kira. Also L states, in the animu/manga, that he needs to keep a eye on him, even in the bathroom. Creepy? Perhaps. \\n\\n\r\nSum the plot up faster? Light is an emo freak who wants to become god of all animu characters and thinks that by using the Death Note he will reign supreme, even though he still lives with his mom. But first he has to get past insane Pedophai-L who only wants to capture him and chain him to a bed post. Fun!\\n\\n\r\nSide-note: As predictable, Death Note has spawned countless yaoi doujinshi, fanfictions, and fanart. The main duo featured is always LightxL or LxLight. Those are silly stories where they OMFG have anal sex like wabbits on heat and all that fucking jazz. There are also doujinshi with Light and other sideshows, like some nasty ones about the Shinigami's massive inhuman cock filling Light's ass. Sometimes mpreg is also featured; typically with Light being the one shoving a fetus out of his magical vagina.",

            "content": "In my opinion, Death Note carries a weight of suspense that I\\'ve never experienced in most or any animes before. Its story revolves around a notebook that a Shinigami, (AKA Death God) Drops into the real world on account of a whim, one of boredom. The Shinigami, Ryuk, finds the book to be obtained by Yagami Light, a highly intelligent, even elite student, who takes it upon himself to see it as a higher calling to become God of a New World, without criminals or crime, with which he can kill anyone whose name he writes into the book with the image of their facein his mind. It is up to L, the legendary detective, to stop him. The anime is unlike any other. It manages to have a plot twist that uproots everything you believed up until that point and turns it around. Death Note will leave your palms sweaty and heart pounding as you experience a battle of epic proportions among geniuses.The music and art are so articulate and riveting that it &quot;takes no prisoners&quot; when it comes to the attention of the viewer. Each character has a specific and valuable role that is crucial to the series of events that comprise Death Note. The Viewer must choose a side of good or bad, that of the God-Judge of Mankind Yagami Light, or that of the defender of what is right, the legendary &quot;L&quot; and his arsenal of objective diligence and dedication. Their war holds the lives of many in its midst, it encompasses a delicate subject of the role of god and justice in the world into a war over what is right and wrong, and that a single error will create a downfall. Death Note is a Must Watch 100% Anime, I loved it for its sheer insanity and unpredictability as I held on to the edge of my seat for each episode. I Highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone. \\n\r\nChoose a side, and choose it wisely, for whichever you choose will be a thrill and an experience one will never forget. &quot;Death Note w00t!! ^_^&quot;",

            "content": "All I can say is wow.  With the extreme amount of hype and popularity surrounding Death Note, it was only a matter of time before I watched it, and I must say it was everything I expected it to be and more.  A tale of a perfect kid with a perfect life trying to play his own version of God and pass judgement to the wicked?  This anime has suspense written all over it.\r\nI love how fucking original this plotline is.  To be honest, I was getting bored of following the same underdog or \"rags to riches\" style story.  DeathNote was a breath of fresh air.  You follow Light Yagami, a straight A student as he picks up a \"Death Note\", which allows him to kill the name of the person he writes in it within 40 seconds.  After the initial doubt of the validity of such an object... Light is soon greeted by Ryuk, a God of Death or 'Shinigami\".  At first, Light uses his new found powers for what he thinks is a betterment of the world... that is until the police begin to track him down.  Insert L, the man behind a computer screen and the lead investigator on the case to catch Light.  What do you get when you cross the world's best detective with a blind-youth brainiac?  One of the best iterations of a cat and mouse story around.  Not to mention the fact that L may have been the best antagonist you could root for in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt times during Death Note, the tension was so thick, you could cut it with a knife.  I couldn't tell you the last time I was that on the edge of my seat while watching an anime... if ever.  As devastated as I was once the first arc ended, the second one picked up with increased steam.  Every time I thought Light was about to get caught, he would pull some magic plan out of his hat, and live to hide another day, and the writing was damn brilliant.  A powerful, gripping piece of fiction, Death Note kept me glued up till and through its incredible conclusion.  The story was so powerful in fact, that it even enticed real-life \"Death Notes\" to sprout up throughout Japan and caused Vladimir Putin to place regulations on the series in Russia.  \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note doesn't have the best animation out there, but I also had to take into consideration that it was created almost 10 years ago.  Quite a lot of breakthroughs have been made in visuals since then.  One thing I will say is that I was both terrified and intrigued the first time I laid eyes on a Shinigami.  Ryuk's creepy stare would be enough to scare the living shit out of anyone who came across him in real life.  I also like how introverted they drew L to look... socially awkward but genius, right down to the weird way he sat with his feet.  I also really enjoyed both openings, even though I almost fell out of my seat in shock when I heard the second one for the first time.  The death metal vibe did sit well, amassing the chaos between L and Light while getting you pumped up for the next episode.  Situational sound effects were also present at key points during the show... adding to the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of Light and his actions during the series are incredible, and entirely believable.  The transformation he goes through as a person and the degradation of his morality are showcased most often in the form of inner-monologue, and I couldn't wait to see what he would do next.  He's the perfect villain, and it was nice to see a story through the eyes of one as the protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nL may very well be the greatest non-main character I've seen in an anime.  I was pulling for him the whole time, and his ability to match wits with Light was incredible.  Even when no one else believed him, L stuck to his hunches, and his weird mannerisms and love of sweets made him that much more interesting.  Sometimes when he stared at Light you could just read his thoughts and then he would utter some spot on observation of the situation.  I want to see more characters like this!\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the ensemble cast was great too.  I really enjoyed how goofy Matsuda and Mogi could be, following the clueless Misa around as her bodyguards.  Mello and Near also played great roles, and their vengeance rang loud and clear.\\n\\n\r\nI'm normally pretty critical as a reviewer, but there's not much to criticize in Death Note.  It's an intense and mind-bending ride, and I enjoyed every second of it.  It's \"binge-watch\" worthy for as I can neither confirm nor deny I finished it in 3 sittings.  As the story neared the end, I tried not to look at the episode number in fear that it would end sooner.  I would greatly appreciate more shows like this in the future!",

But it did not. Actually almost the whole anime changes after about 1/3 of the anime (more clearly you coukl say that the whole atmosphere dies there), what I found really disappointing and made mestop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd still recommend this anime, even tough it died for me at the end of the first part, because it's still something you should have seen, also some people might even love the anime even though the story twists THAT hard.\\n",

            "content": "You may be thinking \"Why has this guy given a low rating compared to everyone else?\"\r\nWell, unlike the DN fanboys, I spotted the immediate problems in the story, which seems pretty big considering that Light and L are geniuses.\r\nStory:\r\nIt got off to a strong start, with twists in the story being explained logically step-by-step, and without any repetitiveness. However, it began to get more and more illogical as the story went on. Someone watching the show might not realise it, but if you put yourselves in the charcters shoes and say 'What would L/Light do now?', you'll see that it gets more and more rediculous.If you want clarification, send me a comment/message, and I'll try and reply.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSeems good at some points, fantastic at others, and mediocre at others. Overall, pretty good with effects like the shaking camera and uses of shadows and colours. Some character art seems questionable (N and M), but overall pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDeath Note stands out here. The Gregorian chanting while Lights writes in the death note reallly sets the mood, and the drums and violins complement each other during dramatic scenes. Different instruments are for different moods (e.g. piano = waiting), but are not used so often that you get sick of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAt the beginning, you can predict the kind of people L and Light are. But as time goes on, you realise that they have different facets. The character designs for almost every charcter is really good, from Watari to Matsuda to L himself. Only N and M look out of place.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved the first part of the show, but like I said, it gets more illogical until you want to strangle L yourself for not realising the obvious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDefinately worth watching, regardless of the plot holes. It makes you challenge yourself to ask 'What would I do if I had a Death Note?'",

            "content": "Okay, I'm going to a review this time. So, as of a start I will be doing a review on Death Note since it's a fun anime to explain about. I've explained the plot of Death Note many times to the people who have never watched it. And if somebody is getting into anime, I'm sure they will love this anime. Death Note is an anime that really does a lot for me since it was very enjoyable. I review anime differently though. So, you have to follow along with me as I go along. Most my other reviews have got hatred. But, I reallyappreciate that since I think I could better on my other reviews. I hope this review gets very good since Death Note is a very popular anime as I see. And I'm bored and have nothing better to do with my time. So, why not write this review about an anime that I've been wanting to write about for a long time. So, I hope you like my review. And enjoy  :D \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note really is an anime that is for beginners. If you haven't just watched anime a lot, or are trying to get somebody into anime, I recommend Death Note. Since it's fun to watch. But, it's not entirely good. Still, it can really stand out as an amazing anime, not the best. You get the point. Death Note was created by Tsugumi Ohba[wrote Death Note] and Takeshi Obata[manga artist]. They have many other manga such as: Bakuman, Cyborg Jii-chan G[Takeshi's work], and many more I don't want to name. Takeshi though has been an artist for many of manga. But, I'm not reviewing the manga. But, I haven't started to review yet. This is more of a beginning. Death Note really has a lot of detail to explain, since I liked this anime. And it's one of my favorite manga/anime. I love the anime more, since I enjoyed how it went. Light really looked sweet in the anime. His animation was really good, I enjoyed the art a lot. It looked pretty realistic, that's why I loved the art. Anime with a good art makes me want to watch it. Or anything else with a good art. But, I look for the story even more. After I watched Death episode 1, I wanted to watch the rest. My chest gave me the feeling that I should go even more, since it got me excited. The story really got me pumped. To see what would happen. Usually, when I go to sleep. I would think about Death Note's plot all the time. The way I rate anime is very different then most do. For example, I don't care about the number. 10, really. Why not something else, like 12 or beyond? MAL won't let me for some reason. I go even deeper than the 5/6 things MAL gave me. But, in this I will really have to tell you that the anime Death Note is really heart-pumping. Really exciting, and with many things that are so practical, maybe I can go on beyond what happened. \\n\\n\r\nI will get onto the Story, Art, Sound, Character, and so on and on.... \\n\r\nI want to review my way first. \\n\\n\r\nMy interpretation of Death Note: Death Note starts with a teen named ''Light Yagami''. He is really bored throughout life[kinda of like I am], and he would ''browse'' anything to get out of boredom. He is very smart, but really is bored. And watches the news on TV everyday, he notices how horrible the world is. Crime, rape, murder, and etc. He hates it. One day, he finds something falling out of the sky. He has no idea what it is. But, that's where his curiosity begins. After he had to get out of class, he went there. And saw a book entitled ''Death Note''. In curiosity, he picks it up and really puts everything in wonder: ''What is this?'' \\n\r\nHe looks in it and it says: ''Any human's name who is written in this will die'' \\n\r\nReally in not thinking, he just leaves it as a mere joke. But, he keeps looking at it. And wonders more......\\n\r\nThough, he takes it home and to ''research'' and ''test'' it out to see if it works. When taking home, he greets his mom and forth. While watching TV, talking about a man. Light writes the man's name down to see if the ''Death Note'' works. He writes the man's name, and waits[in seconds or so]. Forgets it, Light Yagami thought it is a flaw. Until, the man dies of a heart attack. \\n\r\nDeath Note says: ''Write the last name and the first name of the person, and you must think of the person's face at the time of writing it, and they will die of a heart attack in seconds or so. Unless you specify the death'',  \\n\r\nthat's the best I got out of it. \\n\r\nLight uses the Death Note to create a ''new world'' killing crime. But, then a shinigami[Japanese god of Death] comes(noticing that the Death Note is here. The shinigami lets him keep it, so Light can go on with his plan. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't want to tell everything for the first saga.  More of just to get you the basic idea. \\n\\n\r\nLight can't get away with everything, so he has to hide from a Detective named ''L''. \\n\\n\r\nThat's as far as I'm going. Not much here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season: I will just tell you my opinions now. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season was amazing, I just wanted to see everything that was going to happen after episode after episode. I just thought it was amazing. My heart got pumped up literally to see the anime. Just wanting to see more. And I loved the second season opening. It was strange and wild. Not going to talk about deaths or anything, but the anime gets sad too. In the ending and many parts near the second season. And I don't want to be ''open'' on this. It's just too much of the plot. And this is to get you into watching Death Note. Death Note is like a soul for anime, and as I mentioned. New anime fans should watch it. I consider it a very ''Practical'' and amazing anime. There are anime that might beat it, but it's a very good anime. I don't care if you watch it in sub or dub. Either way is amazing. The sub was funny, since I liked the voices on how they did this. And it was more fast-paced in the sub. The dub was very funny, and it really showed comedic flow. But, also made it very sad. Since, how much yelling was going on in the series. The second series should definitely be watched in dub, unless you want to go on to sad parts. I would say watch it in sub or dub. But, it gets very emotional in both ways since you're expressing a lot in the show. I would say due to its originality and its paced heart-pumping story. Watch the anime, I gave you a brief plot of the first season, the second season really could just be explained as if you watch it. Since, you've already watch the first season. The plot of the second season would just be amazing since you would know what was going on in preoccupation for the first plot. Same thing, but a different turn. Many of the characters emphasize their own role, many of them do. It really excites me to see that. And it really is a mixed anime, it's sad, funny, and heart-pumping at the same time. I have seen many anime like Death Note, but DN is a very original. Loved it! Death Note is a good show for beginners. So, watch it.  \\n\\n\r\nOkay, now MAL's way: \\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI would give it a 1000, but I can't since MAL is rude. Not really rude, but you could improve the system. Story is very heart-pumping and exciting. It keeps you motivated for the plot and very active into watching it. And it has an amazing balance of emotion, comedy, and excitement. Like its own aroma, the story is balanced in every way. [Read the manga too] \\n\r\nIf you want a good anime, watch Death Note. The story is a good part for everything almost in the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe art is amazing, very realistic. And very balanced too. I loved the art, an amazing balance of sharpness, and a very legit art. The art looks very realistic as I said before, the art really compared to others is outstanding. The art is very good, the sharpest art I've seen in anime. But, I look for more. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe sound was good, especially this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYcApRm318\u200e\\n\r\nI love the theme, so exciting. But, really it could be even more of a variety in theme. I do wish that it made more themes. Hey, that's how they made it. I can respect that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nAll the characters emphasize thier own role in the series, and it really can't be beat that the characters have weird experiences and are all in the den of doom. And they really make me want to laugh at how amazing the show was, but can't pace the best character is *never told* in my opinion. My favorite character was L. He really was a secret dude, and very smart. The best detective. But, can he beat Conan from Detective Conan? \\n\r\nAnswer: *shrugs* \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Infinity X Infinity/10[10/10] \\n\r\nI really enjoyed. I've explained much of why I enjoyed it. So, I think you should just know I told enough. But, I have very good feelings for it. It really made me cry out loud how amazing it was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Error, number is too big. [10/10] \\n\r\nOverall is based on by the mean of the other things, so you take 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, and divided. \\n\\n\r\nBut, that's it. \\n\r\nHope you enjoyed it :D",

            "content": "\u201cThis world is rotten. The rotten should die.\u201d \r\nStory- 9/10\r\nDeath note has a very well written story. The two masterminds, Light Yagami and \u2018L\u2019 have realistic and intelligent conflicts, through testing each other\u2019s resolve and pulling poker faces so straight I could hear Lady Gaga in the background. In crime genres, it is common for a \u2018genius\u2019 police officer to pick up some evidence and go, \u2018hmmm, this gun has been scratched here. Therefore the suspect is male, 28 and lives in America!\u2019 On the whole, this line of realism was never crossed and any plot holes in a particular method were quickly resolved. Thisall made Death Note feel more realistic and it enables the viewer to take the themes in the story that much more seriously, which is a huge bonus for something as serious as Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really engaging. Throughout the anime, controversial viewpoints are presented to the viewer, which aren\u2019t directly answered in the show itself. Although the different viewpoints are tested to a certain degree in the show, it is the viewer that is encouraged to answer the questions themselves. This changes the experience from watching the anime to actually thinking about it. In a show where there is little action, being drawn in by the dialogue and themes is of the up most importance, and Death Note does this very successfully. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the story of Death Note is that it feels like it\u2019s not going anywhere. All of these moral themes are suggested, and the end ambitions of Light are clear, but the show ends up being bogged down by seemingly endless police/ investigation scenes. Whilst this isn\u2019t an issue if you like that sort of genre, when the show did end, it felt kind of anti-climactic because it never did finish those interesting themes it touched on. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, as you are probably more than aware of, the show has a huge drop in quality after episode 25. This is partly because of the reason above; that the police themes are needlessly extended just to stretch out the show, but mainly because the show had put itself in the position of having to kill a pretty much invincible character. The result of which will most likely end up in you hating the entire new cast of characters that are suddenly introduced, and make you painstakingly aware of all the plot holes that start to form. Saying this, a huge drop in quality in Death Note still means that it\u2019s pretty blady good. \\n\\n\r\nSound- art 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece. There is a deep symbolism within the artwork which I greatly admired. The whole idea of playing God and death were well explored. The atmosphere created through the use of lighting and colours made those intense scenes that much more epic. The animation itself and character design is slick and realistic. Again, it all helps you to take Death Note that much more seriously. The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. The composers, Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi were able to make the simplest actions seem so impressive and were able to create some very intense scenes. There are more than a few iconic tracks, here are a few to whet your taste buds; \u2018Low of solipsism\u2019, \u2018Light\u2019s theme\u2019 and of course \u2018L\u2019s theme\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMisa: I can't imagine a world without Light!\\n\\n\r\nL: Yes, that would be dark.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe battle between Light and L is and will always be one of the greatest conflicts of all time\u2026\u2026.. (notice the amount of full stops). Both characters were so epically awesome, but were never unrealistically awesome. They both developed at equal rates and voiced their arguments with equal power. As a result the fight could have gone either way and you would still be happy. The only proof I need to back up this statement is to look up the numbers here on MAL on character favourites. We\u2019re talking huge numbers, and both L and Light are very close. The conflict between these two giants was certainly very entertaining and is definitely the main reason to watch Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was successful in bringing balance to Death Note. The two main characters are pretty much Gods of their own worlds. Whilst not entirely true, they do therefore lack basic human emotions as they have to become emotionally detached from the situation. The sub characters make up for this by adding very human reactions and emotions into the mix. Although generally overpowered by the awesome Light and L in terms of depth, they do have their time to shine and develop as individuals. So, as I said, they almost put the godly battle between L and Light back to earth which makes the whole situation that much more believable; which is key when presenting very real moral issues. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, the only flaw in the characters is after the 25th episode. A twist in the story leads to the inevitable influx of new characters that are having to compete with already developed and incredibly likeable characters. This does not work. The final episodes are pretty much carried on the shoulders of already developed characters which makes the end result even more aggravating. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (awesomeness)- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note isn\u2019t something you enjoy, per se. You don\u2019t exactly jump up and down when someone is killed in such a serious way. The overall awesomeness of Death Note is what I will mark this section on. \\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a lot of media to find awesome in Death Note. As stated above, the soundtrack and art is nothing short of a masterpiece. Any given situation, no matter how menial is thus able to reach its full potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe different genres that Death Note is listed as, (crime and supernatural predominately) are represented with skill. In terms of crime, Light\u2019s plans and L\u2019s methods are very intelligent. Individual scenes are very intense, and the general feel of a police genre is evident. In terms of the supernatural aspects, ideas and themes are definitely explored, but weren\u2019t given as much definitive screen time, (i.e. nothing much was answered). Which was a great shame because Death Note definitely had more to offer in this department. \\n\\n\r\nAnd again, the conflict between Light and L was perhaps the most awesome aspect of this anime. There were so many memorable scenes that are the very definition of awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the sheer popularity of Death Note isn\u2019t enough for you, sufficed to say, I do recommend for you to watch Death Note. If it weren\u2019t for a few short fallings, especially towards the end, Death Note would undoubtedly be at least in the top 5 animes of all time. But just falling short of perfection is still pretty damn good!\\n",

            "content": "Let's be honest: There's a lot of shitty anime out there. Whether it's bland harems, obnoxious ecchi, or vapid dramas, many people have seen what physically and artistically represents the fact that sometimes even inane dimwits can slip through the cracks of entertainment. Thus, it makes sense that when a so-called \"smart\" anime hits the streets, people would naturally be enticed by the allure of a mature, thoughtful work. A lot of times these fail to impress as the author spends so much time thinking of ways to outsmart the audience that he loses track of the writing and sends it spiraling into stupidity and,quite simply, idiosyncratic nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Death Note avoids that catastrophic cycle and is, in its own right, a very good anime. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nWell, where to begin. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, as I said above, many anime in this genre tend to flaunt superior intelligence in the face of their audience, and Death Note is no exception. It is incredibly creative and the gambits created by the characters are truly mesmerizing at times. The problem is that because they are so over-the-top and absurdly scheming, many of them feel somewhat preposterous and a few plot points then become stretches of the imagination. While this isn't an overwhelming problem, as much of the plot is well thought out and planned for, the lack of meticulous care to the plot-line shows up at times and detracts from the story... but just a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nMore negative is the lack of logic in the characters. Other than a few (the obvious two, mainly), the majority of the characters are just plain stupid. This becomes overwhelmingly evident when, at times, the villain of the story could have been caught but isn't out of sheer luck. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the lack of logic isn't too overbearing, and the plot is mostly clean of any holes, so while it is a problem, it did not cause much of a backbite from my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nOn another note, one of the main pluses of Death Note is the suspense and twists/turns that the narrative presents. While the plot twists aren't extremely unexpected or anything of the like, the series does throw some curveballs and the battle between Light and L is such an engrossing cat and mouse chase that it is rather enticing to watch. To this day Death Note is the anime I have watched the fastest because I just couldn't stop reveling in the overall intensity and eccentricities of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not as heavy as something like Monster, Death Note has its fair share of thematic elements. Some of them are executed well (flaws of justice, legality of capital punishment, not so different heroes/villains) whereas some have some issues (power corrupts). It's unfortunate that the main theme is flawed, but because of the inconsistency and certain issues regarding it, the story comes off as more of a character study of a sociopath than anything else, which is completely fine but veritably inadvertent on the author's part.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting point of discussion with Death Note, in my humble opinion, relates to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Light Yagami. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't go into detail, but essentially my thoughts are as such: Light Yagami is a very good character, a very likable/detestable character depending on your perspective, and he is written extremely well in the story. However, his character development has an inherent flaw in that it is much too quickly paced. Now, this is unfortunate because it isn't indicative of bad characterization as it is seen that Light has some flaws before a certain event, but the characterization used directly contradicts some of the moral purports that the author wished to establish. In other words, the \"power corrupts\" theme is nullified by Light's characterization. To truly make Death Note top-notch, I personally believe that Ohba would have had to have made his development more gradual, but alas that did not happen.\\n\\n\r\nStill though, I would like to clarify that, again, I really like Light Yagami and I believe he is written extremely well in the context, but there are some things I personally would have done differently with him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... well, that's pretty much it. While there are some other good characters (L, Ryuk, Matsuda) none of them stand out in my opinion as truly brilliant achievements. This is yet another reason why I treat Death Note as more of a character study than anything else, because the development undergone by other characters is next to none for the most part, and while they do have some semblance of depth, their inner workings aren't profound enough to validate themselves as anything special. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is truly a feat in itself when it comes to the quality of the animation. Despite being made some time ago, it still holds up marvelously well, even with the anime that is being made now. The color scheme is very... gray, but it works because of the tone of the series. It just feels ominous and torrid, which is quite fitting. The characters look fantastic, especially in moments of fear or emotion, and their movements are fluid and don't look fake. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nAh, here we go. My favorite OST of all time goes to Death Note. If you want to make something seem epic, go for the choir noises, and it paid off marvelously here. There are a plethora of tracks that are illusive and fantastic for every sort of melancholy, vehemence, excitement, etc. The first opening and ending are also great songs in my opinion, but the second opening is... bad. Somehow a lot of people like it though, so don't take my word for it. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting goes, I've seen both the dub and the sub, and I personally prefer the dub but neither are bad choices. Brad Swaile does a phenomenal job with Light Yagami and L's voice actor (who escapes me at the moment) does as well, along with Brian Drummond as Ryuk. Besides those three in particular, everyone from Soichiro to Matsuda to Rem are played quite well, although the voice actress playing Misa Amane can be a little... jarring at times. You'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note has flaws, as I have stated. However, these flaws are part of what is a high-quality anime to be sure. I recommend it.",

One day, a black notebook falls from the sky. He opens it and inscribed inside, \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die\". He laughs it off, a sick joke perhaps.. But sometimes curiosity getsthe best of us. Light is no exception- a skeptic, he writes a name in the note, expecting nothing. A name of a criminal that was broadcast on the news, a man scheduled for execution. 30 seconds pass. Nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe man falls to the ground, clutching at his chest as though some specter has hold of his heart, squeezing the life out of him. \\n\\n\r\nHe Dies.\\n\\n\r\nIs this real? What is this unholy gift? \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nVery consistent character design, and excellent attention to detail, even for characters who get one frame of time in the scope of the show. Dark, gray palette meshes very well with the overall tone. Shinigami designs are grotesque and unique, and at times downright creepy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nExcellent dramatic and suitably epic soundtrack by Yoshihisa Hirano. With a title as pretentious as God of the New World, the music fits perfectly. The subtle tension it builds over the course of the show kept me engaged and on the edge of the seat just as much as the intellectual battle going onscreen did.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: dub\\n\r\nTop notch VA from Brad Swaile (Light), and Alessandro Juliani (L). The supporting cast also give very dynamic and heartfelt performances, my favorite among them (and favorite character of the show) Brian Drummond (of Vegeta fame) as Ryuk.\\n\\n\r\nOpening 1, \"Alumina\" and Ending 1, \"The World\"  both by Nightmare are excellent tone setters for the show. Opening 2 isn't my favorite, but the Ending 2, \"Zetsubo Billy\" by Maximum the Hormone is phenomenal.\\n\\n\\n\r\n****Begin Minor Spoilers****\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 (hear me out)\\n\r\nLight Yagami, genius 17 year old, incredible investigative, manipulative, and problem solving skills- potentially the most brilliant character you'll ever see in animated form, and rightfully so. He thinks his way out of whatever is set in front of him, but not to a deus ex machina point where it was clear the writers were written into a corner and had nowhere to go, a mistake lesser shows make, but not this one. His motives are complex, and his means of achieving them moreso, but Light will stop for nothing to attain his goals. \\n\\n\r\nL- Counterpart to Light- mysterious, eccentric, and incorrigible sugar addict. A detective that, alone, has solved cases for the nationalities of the world, and has never failed to apprehend the suspect. His skills are every bit as honed as Light's, and with the most deadly killer in history on the loose, he has every bit as much to gain from its completion, as the ultimate price may end up being paid. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*******************Spoilers************************\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only scuff on this tour de force would be two characters, who appear late in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe child detectives, L's proteges, Near and Mello, were, I felt, something of a ripoff of L, as if you took his persona and divided it in two, but with none of the charisma and aura of mystery/quirkiness that made L so outstanding and entertaining to watch. While not bad characters in the sense that they didn't break the established rules or come to untoward conclusions, they just were far less interesting to behold.\\n\\n\r\n*******************End Spoilers************************\\n\\n\r\n****End Minor Spoilers****\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAn absolute thriller of cat and mouse detective drama. Cerebral, mind bending, and importantly- never tries to be something it's not. Death Note prescribes to a set of rules introduced early on, and never breaks them. It stays within the confines of its narrative, and exploits it to the utmost. The story twists and turns, and never leaves you hanging with unanswered plot points or ridiculous cliffhangers. As mentioned above, though it seems sometimes that situations arise where there's no way the character can escape their situation, deft writing takes center stage and delivers with aplomb. Believable motives, heady dialogue, and stunning conclusions keep the wild ride rolling from start to finish. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest, this was the first anime I ever watched, and the show that got me interested in the medium as a whole. I have a lot to be thankful for- this show was my first 10, and has remained in my top 5 from day one. Death note was a great starter, and I'd recommend it to anyone who expresses even a passing interest in anime. It doesn't have ridiculous over the top action, it's not a fanservice machine, and it doesn't fall into the trappings that some anime seem to have to fulfill to get an audience. It's a an excellent, complete product that doesn't have to rely on filler and tropes to reel you in. The story is very well thought out, and comes to life on the screen.\\n\r\nAll in all, a blast to watch, and when each episode ends, you're left with a choice, albeit not much of one- \"Do I watch one more?\". \\n\r\nThe answer is always yes. \\n\\n\r\nHumans are _so_ interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nDeath Note is one of the most popular anime ever to air on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block. It is obviously  an anime that most otaku and even non-otaku are familiar with, but if you aren't I will give you some examples of the things this show did great and some things it could have improved on. \r\nWarning: minor spoilers. I mention a character dies, but I don't say which one.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story starts out with a very interesting premise about a brilliant student named Light Yagami that one day finds a mysterious book. The book called the Death Note allows you to writethe name of any person along with a time and cause of death, and if you know what the person looks like than they will die in exactly this way at that time. This book was dropped by a shinigami, which is a minor god of death in Japanese mythology somewhat like the Western figure of the Grim Reaper. This shinigami named Ryuk, dropped the Death Not simply because he got bored and wanted to see what a human would do with the powers of a God. Unsurprisingly, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Light starts out with an almost admirable goal of cleaning up the world by killing all the \"bad people\". However, his definition of bad begins to shift towards anyone and everyone that opposes him as God of a new world crafted according to his ideology. In order to keep killing, Light must engage in a cat and mouse game with the brilliant detective L. Lawliet. This starts out somewhat like Crime and Punishment with Raskolnikov's game of cat and mouse game with Porfiry Petrovich following the murder of a \"worthless\" old woman that Raskolnikov believed he made the world better by murdering. However, this isn't a redemption tale where Light realizes his crimes and attempts to atone. Light is an evil psychopath who abuses power to the fullest and doesn't give a shit who he needs to kill in order to keep that power. Light's personality profile is similar to that of your average egomaniac, paranoid, sociopathic dictator. What bothers me is that it seems a bit of a stretch that Japan's brightest student could think that all problems can be solved by killing \"bad people\". That is the world view of a naive moron that doesn't understand the complexity of global issues. The problems of overpopulation, pollution, famine, disease,  poverty, and most other problems can't be solved by killing a few bad people. Imagine I kill a brutal dictator in Africa like Kabila that rules the Democratic Republic of Congo. Would that make the Congo into a paradise? No! It would create a power vacuum and civil strife that will probably be replaced with another dictator. If I kill the replacement it will rinse and repeat. The Congo has all of the aforementioned structural problems that can't be solved with a simple murder or two. The second problem with Death Note's story is that it goes on for far too long. The manga was only 12 volumes and it really didn't need 37 episodes. This causes it to drag at times and I especially wasn't happy with the 2nd half. My last grudge with Death Note is something that was at least corrected in the movie. If your show or movie is almost entirely dependent on one beloved character to carry it on his back, don't fucking kill off that character half way through! Death Note suffers from the Full Metal Jacket syndrome, where it slides in the 2nd half at least in part because literally everyone's favorite character is dead.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main lead is Light, who starts out like the Punisher, Dexter, and all those Texan justice characters that kill bad guys and we root for them. I really appreciate that Death Note does not condone this simplistic, apish cultural trend and actually shows Light to be an absolute bastard. Just because a sociopath kills bad guys doesn't mean he is a good guy or that we should root for him! We in the US rooted for Bin Laden and his ilk when he was killing Soviets and called him a freedom fighter and hero of liberty. In fact he was a despicable psychopath who just happened to be killing people we didn't like. This is no guarantee that the sociopathic killer is going to continue killing only bad guys, because you know...they're a fucking sociopath and have no concept of right and wrong.  A rabid dog that just happens to maul and kill a rapist is still a rabid dog and should be put down rather than rewarded or praised. What astounds me is that some viewers still root for Light even though the show goes to every length to show that you are not supposed to. They even give him red eyes and a blood curdling evil laugh out of Austin Powers for God's sake! The best character by far is L, who is in the running with Lisbeth Salender as the greatest Asperger's afflicted detective in fiction. L is hysterical and simply adorable. When your main character is Joseph Stalin put in the body of a Japanese pop star, you need someone more amiable to keep people watching. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast kind of sucks and there isn't enough L. Special shout out to Misa, who is the suckiest of sucky. She is the Jar Jar Binks of Death Note. I have the FEVER! and the only cure...is more L Lawliet!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really top notch in this series. It had a huge budget and even though it has been a few years since it came out, it still looks just as good today.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good. I didn't really care for that death growl opening and thought it was a tad silly, but besides that thumbs up!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first part of the series and thought it really had the potential to be great. However, as the series wore on I began to grow tired of it and wanted it to simply end already. I can't really give it high marks for enjoyment when I spend the last 15 or so episodes looking at Light and screaming, \"Just fucking DIE already!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I see the appeal and understand why people love this series, it isn't one of my personal favorites. It has a few flaws that made it somewhat lackluster for me personally. That doesn't mean its bad by any means or that you shouldn't watch it! It is in fact quite good and I highly recommend checking it out if you have been living under a rock and haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "I've delayed this review for a long, long time. Such a long time, I dropped it off my favourites and the grade dropped from 10 to 9. Maybe it will drop from 9 to 5. You ask why, and I answer-hands down, the ending was terrible. Unsuprisingly, looking up my favourite characters shouldn't suprise you. Yet I thought Air had a great ending. That ending made me love the show even more, same goes for School Days. This?\r\nWhen I first heard of Death Note, I couldn't give a rat's ass about it. The common syndrome of not trying what is popular, and I thought it'ssome sort of a &quot;deep&quot; anime, for the elitists. You know, like those losers in their Led Zeppelin shirt. Funny stuff. Then my friend recommended it to me, and I said, &quot;what the hell&quot; and gave it a shot, because I have to get rid of my &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; attitude. To my suprise, it was fire. Since the first episode, it already boomed. Just like how Holden starts &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;. But, guys, why compare the two? The ending of Death Note got me saying &quot;what the fuck&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nI should seperate the concept from the story. The concept was pretty good. I don't know why, but I can't call it &quot;genius&quot; right now, but it was great. So was the story. It definitely got me questioning my morals and crap like that. The pace was also perfect. It definitely had some moments where I wanted to go sleep. Some parts were really slow, but it had enough great climaxes that were a wake up call. It's also not as pretentious as I thought it would be. I expected some pretentious drivel passed off as &quot;intelligence&quot;, but what I got is something both deep and entertaining. How I love that cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't very far from the quality for the story. Here some bias shall be reveled. Light has to be one of the best male characters out there. Damn it, I enjoyed his character all the way through. Ryuk? Damn it guys, he was so needed in the show. His comic relief was really on-point, and helped the series not become pretentious drivel. However, I can't join the crowd and idolize L. Before watching Death Note, his design already pissed me off a bit. Luckily his character wasn't, but I never felt he was so unique, nor deep. L always looked like it came out of &quot;Conjuring Up Weirdos 101&quot;. I find typical black sheeps to be much more interesting. There were also many characters who came and go. They all were able to milk their personality, and pop off beautifully. Yeah, it invoked the sadist in me. Another refreshing change is that the characters don't rely on attractive design. I'm a big fan of attractive characters, but this wasn't the right place. Thank god the creators had enough brain cells to know that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound is... Eh.. Sound is great. I didn't bother watching the OP/EP, because I'm too damn impatient. But the background music was brilliant. Damn it, I never thought BGM could help so much. I mean, yeah it helped that part in Transporter 2, but I thought it was a one-time thing. My favourite was that creepy bassline. The animation could've been better, but it's still good. Not really average, not anything really impressive like School Days or something. I already mentioned the characters weren't really attractive in design, but they all had unique looks to them, and the Shinigamis actually looked really cool. Shido was cute, Rem was creepy, and Ryuk was somewhere in between. I must say I expected better animation actually, because the popularity made the whole thing feel like some big-budget stuff, guess not.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything is peaches and cream in the world of Death Note. Not after 36 goddamn episodes. I don't know why the creators decided to end the series like that, and frankly, I don't wanna know. Keep that crap behind closed doors. What's important is that the whole series got flushed down the toilet. I was so damn close to giving this a 10, claiming this is the best thing since Air, and jumping on the bandwagon. I did, but after some time I stopped. The volcano did a really nice eruption, but nothing was left. Not even those cool black rocks. I can't even find ways to describe how much I hated it. There's no way beer goggles will make it look better.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were able to keep reading 'till here, then kudos to you. As you can see, I loved the series until the ending. It never let up. Even the slow moments were redeemed by climaxes, yet the ending was the antichrist of the climax, the christ of the anticlimax. Yes, I know I'm harsh, but it's fun stuff. I can't say the anime is bad, it just doesn't make sense to me. But I definitely don't know how I can recommend an anime that had to kill itself in such a humiliating manner.",

            "content": "Death Note, as I'm sure you know by now, revolves around Light Yagami, a genius high school student, who finds a notebook titled Death Note, giving him the power to kill someone simply by writing his or her name into it. He takes it upon himself to rid the world of criminals, and hopes to become the God of the new world he creates. Upon killing many criminals, the world takes notice, giving this unknown killer the name Kira. The greatest detective in the world, L, is notified and takes up the case to find Kira and bring him to justice.\r\nThe story really is aninteresting one, there are many extremely suspenseful moments spread throughout the anime (although most are in the first half). It starts out exceptionally well, hooking you from the first episode due to the interesting story, and instantly making you a fan in the second with the introduction of L. From there, the story goes on at a fast pace, always suspenseful and  extremely entertaining. We first run into some problems when, in episode 16, Light executes a plan which we may appreciate in later episodes as genius, but for the span of seven episodes, the series' excitement lessens. This is because previously in the series, there were two different focuses: Light attempting to kill L and L attempting to find out Kira's identity. However, after episode 16, the former element is removed from the show until episode 24, when Light's plan is unveiled. But the show barely even has a chance to pick up steam again, because two episodes later, an even worse change takes place, as two new characters take up the Kira case, Near and Mello. For the remaining episodes, the only motivation for watching the series is that you feel a need to know how it ends since it was so captivating in the beginning, but almost none of the suspense remains. The series doesn't return to form until the last two episodes, when Light is directly confronted, but with one last trick up his sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, it has a darker feel to it, which suits the tone of the anime. During some of the more crazy name-writing scenes the limits of the artists are really pushed as there is a sudden explosion of pen flying across paper with sparks seemingly erupting from the Death Note, and the criminals subsequently collapsing. The art also receives a needed improvement during the most important scenes, where the background detail is significantly amplified. Aside from these improvements, the art still remains fantastic throughout, the characters look great and the backgrounds are nicely detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting (I've only seen the dub) is similarly great, especially in L's case. The music is a strong point, the first opening and closing themes are great, as is the rest of the music for L's arc. There are many memorable songs, from simple but catchy guitar riffs to haunting piano compositions to full-blown neo-classical orchestras, complete with opera-esque vocals (to accompany those crazy name-writing scenes mentioned earlier, along with a couple other moments of major suspense). Like all (well, most) things in Death Note, the music gets weaker after L's arc, but there are still a couple great songs introduced in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe character selection shows a nice variety, and nearly all of them have a purpose in the show. Light is a very interesting character, yet as the protagonist (if you can call him that) he lacks qualities you can relate to. Obviously there are people who agree with the major ideal of Kira, the ideal being that murdering people who do nothing but bad for the world is morally right, however you can not relate to Light from the very beginning of the show, best shown by his immediate desire to become God of his new world upon discovering the Death Note. No matter your ideals, I highly doubt your major concern, if given the power to kill, would be becoming a God. Sure, everyone wants power, but Light's just a little...crazy. And his craziness increases throughout the show, gradually increasing as Light gains less and less regard for other people until his insanity peaks with the last episode. L is a very interesting character, a lonely genius who enjoys eating sweets, sits (and holds objects) oddly. He doesn't really develop from there, he's always the same old detective with questionable tactics, but the character's always fun to watch. The small police team working with L has a nice little variety of personalities and moral positions. Misa is annoying, as she's supposed to be, so I'm not really sure if that's a positive for the show, for being able to make a character who you wish Light would just kill off, or a negative, for being, you know, annoying. Ryuk, the Shinigami who follows Light for a section of the show, is very entertaining. He's the one who causes the story to unravel, dropping the Death Note from the Shinigami realm just because he was bored. He brings some humor to a show that is devoid of it otherwise (other than Matsuda's obsession with Misa and L making the rare quip, which is always hilarious to me because up until he says it, you'd never imagine his character would make a \"Light\" pun, among other things), with his love of apples and the withdrawal symptoms he gets when doesn't have access to any, always laughing at the misfortune of Light in his raspy voice. Rem, another Shinigami, serves her purpose as a small obstacle to Light but doesn't add any extra enjoyment in doing so. Near is really a flat-out bad character. Although he serves as an \"L 2\" of sorts, just because he takes up the Kira investigation doesn't mean he has to act just like L with minor differences.\\n\\n\r\nFormula for 1N (one Near)\\n\\n\r\nL - love of sweets + love of toys -  black hair + white hair - both legs up when sitting + one leg up when sitting + always sitting - all enjoyment while watching - respect* = N\\n\\n\r\n*L gains your respect (or he would if you had respect for anime characters) by showing his genius throughout the show while Near just comes to the right conclusion immediately. L is guilty of this as well at times, but not to the same extent that Near is.\\n\\n\r\nMello is pretty generic, he's pretty much just your average bad guy. But smarter. And with chocolate.\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Death Note deserve a 10? Well, not really. All the flaws should take a huge chunk of enjoyment away, and they do, especially the entirety of the last half of the show (and that sounds like a damn huge flaw, an entire HALF of the show!?), but there's just no other rating I can give it. I flat out loved this show, and while in my mind it seems that I'm overrating it, it seems that it has a similar effect on others, as generally everyone recognizes the second half of the show as weak, yet the average rating is still 8.89. So while there are apparent flaws all over the show, all the positives outweigh the negatives to such an extent that the show receives a perfect score from me.",

            "content": "Death Note: Ah, you know! That anime where apples are a huge theme with a whiny genius who wants to rule the world! Of course. It was good but ended with lack luster.\r\nLet's start with the story: I'll try to keep it spoiler free.\r\nStory: Light Yagami is a young, Japanese male genius who is bored with life. One day he finds something called a Death Note, a notebook with the ability to kill. He uses this death note to rule down on all he deams unworthy (criminals). He sets off his plan but a group of investigators and one main one set off to findthis killer (Light) and that is the premise of the show. It carries through and is quite the thrilling anime with situation after situation stopping Light and him cunningly find a way around it. The series really starts to die down after episode 26 though with most of the corners being cut and everything coming down to \"I'll just have to kill you before you kill me!\" It still has a spark but it doesn't ignite as well.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the art style.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The design and art style of this anime is very unique. It takes a modern day gothic style but applies a civil, sharp manner to it. If something looks sharp enough to stab you, that'll say something about that character or object. It keeps it either very dark or very vibrant. It likes to mix the two up to make a beautiful painting that is Death Note. It'll stay unique and you'll remember how it looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is critical so I'll talk about that. \\n\\n\r\nSound: As previously stated above, the show takes that Gothic theme into mind. Even the first set of opening and endings applies this style to the show. If something needs a dramatic, classical themed background song, it'll use it to it's best.  Later on, the show picks ups a more chaotic feeling and even applies that through it's second opening and ending. Though I'm not a big fan of the second opening and ending, it does fit quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... Well...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: Personally, I didn't hate any of the characters. They all fit their roles in they were designed but I feel as if their attitudes were all copy paste. Each character looks different but the villains, excluding light, are all just in for the reputation, money, and power. All the detectives behind the Kira/Light case are justified and want to stop everything, though they may actually conflict with each other. Nothing just felt really special about any of the characters besides Light, L, Misa, Ryuk, Light's father, Near, and Mellow. Those were the only characters that stood out to me. Besides that, no one was too special. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment/overall feeling of the show are about the same: It's a great anime that I suggest to everyone because it has it's own unique style and feeling towards it's audience but it really starts to lose what made it so great after episode 26. If you're going to watch it, stop after that episode. Leave everything else up to your imagination. I watched it because I wanted to see what was canon and I don't quite regret it but nothing popped out to me. It's great, exciting, but lack luster in the end.",

            "content": "The pen really is, mightier than the sword. This anime is proof.\r\n [ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nDeath Note is one of the best anime out there and for many, it IS the best. This supernatural mystery thriller is simply amazing. With an extremely compelling storyline and a ruthless protagonist(s), this show keeps you at the edge of your seat with its exceptionally fast pacing. Watching the two main characters battle it out psychologically in a deadly game of cat and mouse is a real treat. With beautiful animation and a great background score backing this anime up, there really is no reason for you notto check this one out. The realistic approach to a supernatural concept is one of the main reasons for this anime\u2019s success. It is a brilliant anime that will surpass your expectations. This show also serves as one of the best introductions to anime for casual fans.\\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nYou are given a notebook. You are informed that if you write a person\u2019s name in the notebook, then that person will die. Now, what will you do? Assuming you don\u2019t believe this note works, who will you test it on? You wouldn\u2019t risk writing your name, would you? Even if you did believe in this notebook\u2019s powers, would you actually use it to kill someone? \\n\\n\r\nEven if you wouldn\u2019t, Yagami Light would. In fact, he wouldn\u2019t use it to just kill one person, but to kill thousands. Yes, thousands. \\n\\n\r\nIn Death Note, you follow Yagami Light in his quest to become the god of the new world. And how does he plan on doing that? Very simple \u2013 he has a Death Note. A Death Note is a notebook, carried by Shinigami(Japanese death gods) and is used to kill humans. Now, to kill someone with the Death Note, you just have to write their name in it and they will die of a heart attack within the next forty seconds. One day, Ryuk, a Shinigami, is bored out of his wits and decides to drop his Death Note into the human world. And Light, a high school student, stumbles upon this deadly notebook and decides to take it home, thinking that it must be a prank. Once he confirms that this notebook is the real deal and becomes processed by Ryuk, he decides to take the law into this own hands by killing the criminals in jail. So every day, this boy wakes up, goes to school, comes home and kills a bunch of criminals by writing down their name in the Death Note while munching chips and watching TV. And to top it all off, this guy is one of Japan\u2019s top students and is an absolute genius. He must be unstoppable now, right? Not quite. A master detective called L decides to step in and try to deduce who the criminal is. And so begins an engrossing game of cat and mouse between Light, who hides behind the identity of Kira and L, the world\u2019s greatest detective who has never revealed his name or face. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note\u2019s story is, without a doubt, the best I have ever seen. The plot is filled with twists and turns, guaranteed to take the viewer on a rollercoaster. The storyline is completely unpredictable and even hardcore detective fans will have a hard time predicting the next move. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent with fluid movements and seamless transitions. There is almost no recycling of frames and this makes for an enjoyable experience. The graphics are really good and the character designs and detailing are very well done. Modern Tokyo is drawn artfully and blends in wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe background score for this anime is stellar. The dark goth themes are dramatic and are orchestrated really well. There are also a few mild tracks which suit the mood perfectly. The first OP was decent, while the second was just painful to hear. The first ED was great, especially the video, while the second was passable. However, the average OPs and EDs are forgiven because of the otherwise neat job by the audio department.\\n\\n\r\nLight vs L is probably the best duel ever, easily surpassing Naruto vs Sasuke. On one side we have the merciless and untiring Light, who will stop at nothing to wipe the criminals off the face of the Earth and on the other, we have L, Tokyo\u2019s white knight, who masterminds all the operations to stop Light ( to him, Kira) in his tracks. The rules of the game are very simple \u2013 The one whose identity is compromised, dies. While Light tries to uncover L\u2019s true identity, L tries to uncover Kira\u2019s true identity. The dynamic script makes sure that this duel never gets stale by forcing them into confrontations with unique stipulations. Now, I did have an issue with the characters. They were extremely shallow and there was hardly any character development. Neither Light nor L display any form of emotion and this does start to itch a little. The only character who displayed any emotions at all was Light\u2019s father.\\n\\n\r\n Another problem I had with this show was that it failed to answer the critical questions. For example, Light\u2019s philosophy on killing criminals is never explained. And although his ruthlessness is understood, the viewer never gets to know Light\u2019s motivation for wanting to be a god or whether killing a person just because he has committed one crime is right. Right till the disappointing last episode, you do not get a clear idea on either of the two protagonists\u2019 true mindset. The pacing becomes dreadfully slow in the second arc. I really felt that the second arc could be done away with and the series could\u2019ve been condensed into a 26 episode one and that\u2019s mainly why I\u2019m denying this anime a perfect score of ten.",

            "content": "What if one person was given the power to kill anyone they wanted, whenever they wanted, simply by writing their name in a notebook?\r\nIf you\u2019re screaming at me about spoilers, you must not have realized what the title of this anime implies. This question is the basic theme throughout the entire show. While it sounds very strange, I can almost promise you that you have never seen anything like it before. This anime is easily one of my favorites, and I\u2019ll show you why. I\u2019ll also show you why this anime has a few commonly overlooked shortcomings. I apologize in advance for the length, butthis anime requires a lot of analysis to do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10) \u2013 It\u2019s going to seem like I\u2019m contradicting myself here. You see, the story of Death Note is simply outstanding. I was completely blown away by it, and nearly everyone I know feels the same way! Now, if I say that, why is the score only an 8/10? Well, the reason I only scored it an 8 was because of how it felt like the show drug a bit at points. Let me try to clear this up for you a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the show opens in modern-day Japan. The story closely follows a teenager named \u201cYagami Light\u201d (a bit of an odd name, but more on the characters later).  Light isn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d call average. He\u2019s a mostly unremarkable character at the beginning of the show, except that he\u2019s extremely intelligent. He\u2019s the top of his class, and is preparing to enter into a prestigious university. Well, Light\u2019s comfortable world suddenly has a very large loop thrown into it when he discovers a \u201cDeath Note\u201d. Now don\u2019t freak out on me for spoilers; all of this is explained in the very first episode. Light discovers that the \u201cDeath Note\u201d was dropped by a \u201cShinigami\u201d (commonly translated as \u201cDeath God\u201d, or also \u201cSoul Reaper\u201d, if you\u2019ve watched Bleach). This Shinigami explains to Light how the Death Note works. As you may have guessed, the Death Note has supernatural power, granting Light the ability to kill anyone he desires. All he has to do is know their name, and be able to picture their face when he writes in the Death Note. Naturally, Light tests this power to see if it\u2019s for real, and is surprised to discover that the Shinigami was telling the truth. Light holds the power to kill nearly anyone in his hands.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as you can imagine, this has some VERY interesting implications for the plot of the show. I won\u2019t get into any further detail, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but the outset of this show is simply brilliant. Light goes through some downright incredible twists to try and hide what he\u2019s been doing, and to keep his precious Death Note a secret. The first ten or twelve episodes of this show are very addicting. You won\u2019t want to stop watching, as you\u2019ll never know what\u2019s coming next. Light has to kill off several people in an attempt to hide his tracks, and as the show wears on, you\u2019ll begin to wonder if any of the original cast will make it to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the reasons why I only gave it an 8/10. While the first twelve or so episodes had me completely hooked, the initial shock and uniqueness of the opening wears off after a bit. Around episode 18 to about 25, the show slows down for a bit. Now, this is a chance for some very interesting things to happen with the characters, but once again, more on that later. It felt like the show sacrificed plot for character development here, which wasn\u2019t entirely bad, but it did make things a little slow.\\n\\n\r\nThings pick up again around 26 and don\u2019t really slow down until the end. Even though things got more exciting, it never really lived up to the first twelve or so episodes of the show. The ending wasn\u2019t necessarily predictable, but you will come to realize that there\u2019s only one way for the show to end if there\u2019s going to be a complete resolution. The way they arrive at the ending may surprise you, but you\u2019ll likely see it coming.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I felt like the show was just a few episodes too long. If they had, perhaps, cut it down to 30 episodes instead of 37, it may have helped things to move a little faster. You\u2019ll likely enjoy all of the episodes, and none of them had that \u201cfiller\u201d feel that a show can sometimes give you when it\u2019s trying to avoid moving too fast. In any case, excellent story, just told over a few too many episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) \u2013 After writing rather more than I intended on the last section, I\u2019ll try to be more succinct here. I find the art in this show excellent! The character designs aren\u2019t as creative as you might normally find, but this is supposed to be the real world, not some fantasy, where girls have pink hair and cat ears. Even so, some of the Shinigami are pretty interesting, and no two of them look even remotely similar (except for looking like reapers of death of course).\\n\\n\r\nThere weren\u2019t any especially eye-popping effects to gaze at, but then again, this show is a psychological thriller, not an action or shonen, thus, it contains a rather sparse peppering of explosions, so there really wasn\u2019t a need. The animators occasionally chose to animate things like cars with computer animation, but I found that this added, rather than detracted from the overall art design. The art is all based on a rather dark color palette, but I feel that this fits with the dark and ominous themes of the show. I really have nothing to complain about here. This show is superbly animated!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) \u2013 The music in this show certainly fits the mood, but it rarely stood out to me as being excellent. It\u2019s not the sort of stuff you\u2019ll find yourself whistling as you wash the car, so some of it is quite forgettable. There are, however, some moments where the music will give you chills! The operatic, haunting music when people are being killed off by the Death Note is astoundingly powerful!  The music in moments like these really helps to capture the mood.\\n\\n\r\n I had to knock down a point for the second opening though. I\u2019m really not a fan of death metal to begin with, but the singer screaming \u201chuman f***er!\u201d was just a little too much for me (why are they screaming English curse-words, anyway?). While this probably fit the mood and themes of the show, it made me feel gross, and I skipped it every time after I\u2019d heard it once. The first opening is much better though, and is usually worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, however, is top notch. The voices are very believable, and stay away from what I often find can be very whiny, irritating voices when a character is emotional. The lone exception being \u201cMisa\u201d, who\u2019s shrill voice did bother me from time to time. On the other hand, the actors for Light and L were outstanding! The voice actors had to pull of some very strange dialogue at times, yet still managed it in a completely believable way. Excellently done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) \u2013 Ah, the characters! Here\u2019s where this show truly shines! I have never seen an anime that so brilliantly depicts the nature of humans who are given too much power. It takes Light a grand total of about one episode to develop something of a \u201cgod complex\u201d. Light believes that he should create his own rules with the new power he\u2019s been given.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I find the name \u201cLight\u201d to be rather strange, I got over it when I saw what a compelling character he truly is. I can\u2019t go into much detail without spoilers, but the course of events that follows Light as he uses his power is easily believable. The power that Light has discovered changes people into cold-hearted maniacs, and causes them to show their true colors. \u201cL\u201d (yet another odd name) is an equally compelling character, and his skills with deductive reasoning and logic are astounding at times. I cannot say much more about him, but L\u2019s attempts to catch the mysterious killer cause he and Light to work against each other. Light and L get into a number of battles involving mostly their minds, and while the logic used isn\u2019t always flawless, it will still impress you, and leave you eager to find out what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nThe morality of Light\u2019s goals and ambitions are highly questionable, and bring up such topics as whether one individual should have the right to decide the fates of others. Should criminals be killed off for the good of society, even if there\u2019s a chance they may change their ways? Can one person be given the power to decide who lives and who dies and not become corrupted? Many, many more questions are brought up than this, but I won\u2019t ruin them all for you.\\n\\n\r\nI really could go on and on about how brilliantly Death Note depicts what would happen if someone were to be given a power such as a Death Note. But, for the sake of time and spoilers, I will not. All you need to know is that this show is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and simply brilliant with its characters. Whatever shortcomings the story had are almost compensated for by the perfect depiction of the corruptible nature of human beings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) \u2013 While certain parts of this anime were nothing short of brilliant, I found myself rather bored at certain points in the story, forcing myself forward to find out what happens next. Overall, I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it to anyone. The re-watch value isn\u2019t particularly high, as much of the show\u2019s potency comes from surprise and suspense, but you still might find yourself wanting to re-watch it with a friend who hasn\u2019t seen it yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) \u2013 Some points of this show were simply brilliant, yet I feel that some of its flaws are oftentimes overlooked. Despite what I find to be a few shortcomings, Death Note is still one of the most thought-provoking animes ever created. I simply felt that I couldn\u2019t quite give it a 10/10, even though it\u2019s considered a masterpiece by many. If it weren\u2019t for the slow parts in the middle, I easily would have given it a 10. I was disappointed that the show stumbled slightly in this area, but I\u2019m trying to be as objective as I can, here. Once again, sorry for the length, but I felt this anime deserved a lot of analysis.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful. Feedback appreciated! (And don\u2019t click \u201cnot helpful\u201d just because I didn\u2019t give it a 10 =P)\\n",

            "content": "death note is one of the most popular anime in the main stream anime list and generally it is the 1st anime you recommend to your friends to enter into the anime  world. BUT i feel like this anime is bit overrated i mean its good for starters but it will not as good for a regular. \r\nstory(6)\r\nnot much special there in the story still its pretty decent . I feels like there just more fancy things which might entertain you like some thrilling moments and feud between L and Light is really entertaining, but after watching some 15 episode i feel kind ofbored coz i cant feel the characters in the story. Character development is really important part of the story and this is where death note is lacking the most. In short i can say that its more like a cat and mouse story rather than a real crime story with supernatural contents in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9)\\n\r\ndeath note feature some best quality of direction and backgrounds its really well directed and u can praise the studio. though its not has animation quality on the level of like fate series or  its still one of the best directed anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10)\\n\r\nTHis is where death note shines the most . As i discussed earlier its one of the most well directed anime so find some of the best sound quality in anime . 1st opening is really one of my favorite anime theme.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter(5)\\n\r\nIts my personal opinion but if the story is not that decent if it also got many plot holes if anime got good character development and influencial characters i can ignore what story lacking. Here death note really sucks I mean I really feel dissapointed after watching this story. Other than Light Yagami which I feels one of the best villains in anime rest all characters sucks.Ya many people argue are u for gotten about THE GREAT L which is 2nd on MAL popularity . ya i like L but who is L some super genius thats all . there is no character development not at all he just simply chasing after Light and we know nothing about him. Ya many characters are mysterious but they have there weakness inspirations personalty and there backstory which feel really important coz it connects characters and audience you really needs to feel for characters if its protagonist you admire there thinking you idolize them you love them you feel sad if something bad happen to them or in the case of antagonist a feeling of hatred is there( i mean light is really son of a bitch).\\n\r\nI cant feel anything for L during whole series He is just there as Light play material which i feels really dissapointing . there are many support characters who can be great but light carried the whole anime and I watch whole anime just because light is there.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment(7)\\n\r\nya i enjoy this show at least 1st 15 episodes . so its pretty dencent show and you can view this as a Binge watch.\\n\\n\r\noverall(7.6)\\n\r\nAs i say again its bit overrated and incomplete but its good for starters because its plain and simple with amazing direction and animation. \\n\\n\r\nrecommedation\\n\r\nfor staters-high\\n\r\noverall-medium",

            "content": "WARNING: Minor spoilers within.\r\nTITLE: Death Note\r\nMANGA/ANIME: Death Note was originally a manga authored by Tsugumi Ohba and with art done by Takeshi Obata (well-known for his work on the Hikaru no Go manga).  It was serialized in Kadokawa's Weekly Shonen Jump from May 2003 until December of 2006, and was licensed Stateside by Viz Media, with all volumes currently available.\r\nThe anime version of Death Note was produced by Studio Madhouse (well-known for their work on Paranoia Agent and X) and was directed by Tetsuro Araki (Death Note was his first major work).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 3rd, 2006 until June26th, 2007, and was licensed Stateside by, again, Viz Media, and was released in various formats, including Download to Own/Rent and DVDs (with the complete series being available at the time of this writing), along with a run on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim from October 20th, 2007 til July 6th, 2008.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Light Yagami is an incredibly smart high school student who's bored out of his head.  One day, he finds a notebook lying on the ground with instructions inside that claim that if the owner writes a name of a person while picturing their face, that person will die.  Light is skeptical at first, and tests it out on a few subjects, confirming its powers, along with the previous owner of the notebook, the apple-addicted shinigami Ryuk, appearing to him.  Light then decides to use the notebook's powers to rid the world of criminals, which, in turn, attracts the attention of the international police community and a mysterious detective named L.\\n\\n\r\nThe area where Death Note excels is in its plot, and how it's structured.  For essentially being a shonen show, Death Note develops its mind games between Light and those pursuing him, L especially, amazingly well, with each relying on various gambits and bluffs to stay a few steps ahead of the other.  And the tension and suspense builds incredibly well throughout the run; in the last few episodes, there were several points at which my heart was actually pounding as I watched what was happening on screen.  And the fact that the writers didn't always make Light infallible, that he slips up at times and risks not being able to outbluff his opponents, is a definite plus in the shonen genre.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note has two major flaws, however.  One is centered in the structure of the series, which I'll discuss later in Length; the other is in character development.  Throughout the course of the thirty-nine episodes, none of our three major characters undergoes any sort of character development.  L remains eccentric and brillaint, Light remains brilliant and manipulative, except to develop a paranoid messiah complex and turn into even more of a jackass, and Misa remains blindly devotional and makes me want to trade in my uterus.  And without any sort of development, it's hard to relate to any of these characters.  Some of the more minor characters underwent minor character development, like growing a pair or getting even more crazy than they already were.  Additionally, some characters are defined simply by their quirks, which is not characterization at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of how accurate of an adaptation this is from the manga, I can only speak for the first three volumes or so, and vague knowledge of the rest of the manga.  Based on what I know, this is a fairly faithful adaptation, with each episode covering one or two chapters of the manga or so.\\n\\n\r\nART: Madhouse does its normal attention to realism in character designs and background here, which is always good.  There's also heavy emphasis on religious symbolism with the main trifecta of characters, and different primary color schemes for each of them when they go into internal monologues, especially in particularly dramatic moments.  And this is all fine and well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one part where they lost me was their use of SLOOOOOW MOOOOTIOOON in particularly dramatic moments, which may cause moments of laughter where the director may not have intended.  There's one particular moment early on in the series' run that best exemplifies this; Light is under surveillance by L and, in order to keep on killing criminals as Kira, he slips a portable TV and a slip of the Note into the potato chips package, seemingly studying and eating as he is actually killing off criminals.  The animation during this sequence goes into incredibly slow motion, with the grease off the potato chips sparkling, and Light seemingly making DRAMATIC EATING MOTIONS.  It's fairly ridiculous, and I was laughing out loud; pretty sure this was not what was intended.  And this is used fairly often throughout the series, and just pushes things over into ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: The background music for this is very heavy on the dramatic choral and orchestral arrangements, which kind of helps with pushing some of the more dramatic moments into the series into over-the-top ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP and ED are fairly standard J-Rock numbers, don't stand out that much, but pretty good in and of themselves.  The second OP and ED are speed metal numbers, and the OP's pretty catchy, good to use as an alarm.  Aya Hirano's (Misa's seiyuu) also got an insert song in here as well, not anything particularly big, but decent in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nSEIYUU: Aya Hirano (famous for her role as Haruhi Suzumiya and Konata Izumi in Lucky Star) plays Misa Amane, and Maaya Sakamoto (famous for her roles as Hitmoi in Escaflowne and Aeris in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children) shows up as Takada Kiyomi.  Everyone else does a fairly good job in their roles.\\n\\n\r\nLENGTH: The biggest issue that I have with the series is in its length, and to go into this requires SPOILERS, so skip to the end of this section if you wish to avoid them.  The first twenty-five episodes are all well and good.  But after L dies, we essentially get what we saw in the last twenty five episodes recycled and compressed into twelve episodes, with a few new characters taking on the roles that L and Misa did during the first twenty-five episodes.  And honestly... it worked the first time around, not so much the second.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: This is a fairly solid show in the plot department, but it has its share of flaws, mainly with regards to characterization, dramatic moments turning ridiculous, and the plot after the first half of the series pretty much just being a recycling of what we saw before.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth a watch, but not the ZOMG MASTERPIECE that everyone makes it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\r\nMUSIC: 7/10\\n\r\nSEIYUU: 8/10\\n\r\nLENGTH: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 37/50; 74% (C)",

            "content": "Prior to Death Note I stuck to watching anime that had some form of romance in it, but when I saw how great the animation in Death Note was I jut had to check it out. It completely changed the way I felt about supernatural/psychologial anime. It made me realize how enjoyabl other genres could be.\r\nStory: Death Note has such a great and unique story to it. With the arrival of a death note that came from the Shinigami. The person with the death note can kill anyone just by writting down their name in an otherwise seemingly normal notebook. It falls into the handsof Light who plans to kill off all te criminals in the world and anyone who tries to get in his way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation in this series is superb. The character designs are flawless. The Shinigami's look creepy and it's nice to see how differently each one looks. Light's character looks like any ordinary teenage boy. He doesn't look like the type that would kill by any means. Bringing to mind that the worst people in society are the ones that blend in perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There were plenty of dramatic scenes in this anime and the voice actors managed to pull each one off. Light's voice actor did great job. He could sound dark and evil in one sentence and normal and innocent the next. Both ending and openings go swell with the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters just like the rest of the show are unique in their own right. Light's character is the supreme anti-hero, but he's written so well that regardless of what's happening you're compared to cheer for him because athough he's evil, he's an evil genius. Even the unimportant characters are well written and develope nicely throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: VERY enjoyable. At the end of each episode, I desperately anticapated the next. The pyschological aspect of the show draws you in and refuses to let you go until the ongoing war has reached it's ending mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this to most people. The pyschological points in the series can be quite complicated at times so it's probably best to watch it when you're at your best at using your brain.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Death Note last night, and I just had to write a review for the series.\r\nAfter my friend spending months trying to get me to watch Death note, I decided, \"what the hay, I might as well give it a try.\" From the very first episode I was hooked.\r\nStory: I like the story a lot. I thought it was pretty original compared to a lot of anime's I've seen where the plot is recycled. If you don't know already, the Death Note is a notebook in which whose ever name is written down in it will die. Him or her will diein 40 seconds if the writer doesn't specify when they will die. If the cause of death is not written, then the person written down in the note will die of a heart attack. It's not that simple. For a person to die, you need to know their name and their face for the death to take place. These notebooks are in the world of the Shinigami, or death Gods, if you will, and the shinigami only use them to lengthen their lives by taking away from the humans lives. Well what happens when the notebook is dropped onto earth and the power of the Death Note is passed onto a human? Lets just say calamity ensues. \\n\\n\r\nPick your own definition of justice. Light or L.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I absolutely loved the characters in Death Note. Although I wasn't on their sides most of the time, (mainly Light) I still liked the character development as well as the character design. L and Light are very intellectual and mysterious in someways; it adds to the story. There are many times throughout the series where you think, \"Nuh-uh, how the hell did he think of that?\" Basically they're not very predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI adored the first theme song; I think it's called \"the world\" by nightmare. I thought it went perfectly with the series and it truly did get me amped up to watch the show. I never skipped the theme song, even when I watched many episodes in one sitting. The second theme song was a little to creepy in my opinion. It made everything seem all dark and demonic, although you can argue that it fits in with DN too. I wouldn't disagree, it just wasn't my taste.\\n\\n\r\nThere are moments in Death Note where you're just thinking, \".... Seriously? Why did they even do that?\" - useless moments that don't add or subtract from the storyline. Death note hits a boring patch for a bit. Well, I mean it still is kind of interesting, but the episodes beforehand were more alluring. But trust me, it does get out of the 'slump'.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like about this series is that they did things that deliberately pissed off fans of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything, but they did the unthinkable in certain cases, and it just added onto the overall effect of the show and made it seem more real, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of this show was high, and I would highly recommend it to people who haven't seen the series. Even if you're a Rom/com junkie like I ;) Death Note is still a good investment. Only will take 37x23m to watch ;D",

            "content": "Death Note is the anime that got me into watching anime. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Although this show is great, I still think that it has several problems. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY love this show. Really. \r\nStory (B+): The story in Death Note starts out very fast-paced and exciting from episode one. I was sucked in right from the beginning and I always found myself wondering what was going to happen to next. There are many twists and turns that make it unique and really interesting. Unfortunately, this iswhat causes the many flaws in Death Note. The beginning is so intense that throughout the middle, it kind of seems like the author ran out of ideas and started coming up with random plot developments just to hold us over until he could think of something exciting again. The Yotsuba arc was really boring, and at times confusing, and several other parts get bogged down with too much dialogue and confusing additions to the plot. Both Light and L explain not only their own thoughts, but also eachother's. At first, this is really interesting because it's amazing how they know what the other is going to do, but eventually it becomes predictable.There's also some things that happen in the story that seem...a little too implausible (like having people in a room under surveillance for more than 50 days...wtf), but this really isn't too big of a problem.There's one MAJOR plot twist in Death Note that a lot of people have a problem with. Overall, I thought the twist was good, but after it happened the story was never able to be what it was in the beginning. The ending of Death Note should have been a climactic finale, but I found myself more dissapointed than satisfied. With all that being said, the story is still intense, and I was still very invested in it. The twists are really suspenseful and well crafted even in the very end. \\n\\n\r\nArt (A+) - The art in Death Note is some of the best. There are really no complaints here. The style of animation is distinctive, and definitely adds to the suspensful atmosphere and intense moments. Everything is done with flawless detail. The art can't be given anything less than a perfect 10. \\n\\n\r\nSound (A+) - The same goes for sound. The music is PERFECT for this series. It goes so well with everything that happens. It really enhances moments that are emotional and intense. I was never dissatisfied with the music. The opening and ending themes are good too. Throughout the middle (I forget which episode), the opening and ending themes change. I was a little dissapointed because I really liked the first ones, but the new ones did grow on me overtime. The voice acting is really good in Death Note. Mamoru Miyano does such a good job as Light. It's definitely one of the best performances I've ever heard. All the voice actors are well suited for their part. The voice acting was another strong point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (B+) - The characters in Death Note are the same as the story - definitely a strong point, but also a major flaw. Light Yagami is one of the most memorable characters ever.  It's funny how you find yourself rooting for him even though he is clearly evil (although technically he's still the protagonist). His relationship with Ryuk  was one of the best parts of this show, but in the later episodes Light barely talks to Ryuk anymore which was really dissapointing. L was also one of my favorite characters and definitely a fan favorite. All of the Japanese police were very entertaining, and the shinigami were also funny. The characters that REALLY ruined some of the show for me were MISA and NEAR. At first, Misa is annoying, but atleast her character has a purpose (kind of) in the beginning of the show. In the later episodes, she doesn't even do anything! She ended up being a waste of space, and it was completely unnecessary to make her so dumb. Near was the other problem. He was like a less cool version of  L that magically knows everything without having to figure anything out. If they were going to copy L they might as well have just left Near out of it. The one character that I thought got the short end of the stick was Mello. He deserved wayyyy more screen time. He was one of the more intersting characters in the later episodes that actually had some depth, and he actually looked cool unlike Near. His mafia arc was alright, but I think he could have been utilized much more. The whole fight between Light and L was the driving force of the show. Taking that away and adding uninteresting characters like NEAR was really lame. The only other good character in the end was Mikami, and he wasn't even there that long. Overall, I liked the characters, but after that one big plot twist some of the new characters are kind of just...meh.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (A-) - Death Note is a very enjoyable series. When I first watched it I was sooo into it. I just couldn't stop watching. Even when the show fell short, I still enjoyed watching it a lot. It's an intense thrill ride that definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Although there are many intense parts, there was an extended period where I found myself pretty bored (ahem..the Yotsuba Arc), and waiting for the excitement to come back. Also, the second half of the show, while still entertaining, suffered a lot because of that big twist that happens in the middle. There's also not a lot of rewatch value because you know everything that's going to happen. I'd say after watching it twice it loses some of its appeal. Death Note is also a really well made show. I appreciate anime that are very well developed and produced when you think about all the crappy anime out there that look so cheap. Death Note definitely had a lot of effort put into it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall (A-) - This show would have been a perfect 10, but flaws in the story and characterization keep it from achieving its full potential (in my opinion). It's definitely worth a watch for anyone who enjoys suspense, complex characters, and an in- depth story. It's sad that such a good show kind of lost its way through the middle, and was never really able to get back on track, but the creativity of the story makes up for it.",

            "content": "Death Note, as millions of reviews have already said, it is indeed the best anime of all time. Even though it is not my personal favorite i can't deny the fact that it is the biggest masterpiece in history of anime. From the very first episode of Yagami Light's introduction until the last confrontation with Near against Yagami the suspense and excitement never ends in the entirety of the plot, the events are so well established and laid out that it always keeps the hype of the unknown. The main cast which are Yagami Light, L Lawliet, Misa Amane, Near and Mello not only haveexcellent designs from the art prespective in an edgy and menacing way but each one of their personalities and development throughout the story is also outstanding. Also it has that university / high school fantasy setting which is very popular amongst anime to lean towards academic theme with the elegant outfits. A good fact without spoiling anything is that in general no matter if some anime characters die, as long as they are look good and are profitable they always return at some point through other media such as Yagami Light & Ryuk being in Jump Force. My main reason of why i love Death Note is the character Near, the combination of his amazing character design and development make him a lovable person and i am glad that he even got his own manga later. The overall atmosphere of Death Note is pure perfection from all aspects.",

One has the power to kill, other one has the entire police at his side.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is alright, you will not get bored because of this, because every episode will be mind bugling. Every strategy both geniuses take took a lot of time for any normal person to come up with, and they just do it like it took them 5 minutes.\r\nAnimation:\r\nPretty good actually, not perfect but that's just my opinion (Animation is NEVER perfect). But you stillknow exactly what's going on if you look, it's not that you don't know what's going on and who is shooting who for instance.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music is somewhat creepy, and it should! You're in a thriller and not in a comedy. The background music fits really good with the tension thats building up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters, well you basically have L and Kira, both are aliases for those 2 geniuses. The characters all have a background story why they became the ones they did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEvery strategy they make, every plan they scheme and every path they walk will keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis has got to be, one of the best anime's I saw in a long while.

            "content": "Well... my friend introduced this to me a while back. She said it was fun and really well-made, but with all the L and Light shipping by fans, I thought, \"Another piece of yaoi crud. Joy.\" I mean... To those of you who like yaoi, good for you! But it's just... Not my type. I'm sorry. \r\nFinally, out of my utter boredom, I got desperate. \"I'll watch it just so I can make fun of it, and point out to all the fans out there that this show is awful!\" ...And then, I watched episode 1.\r\nStory~\r\nThis is my favorite of all time. I have toadmit. I know that in my Higurashi review, I really praised it, but Death Note is my number one. I know, it's not the best thing, so it's my guilty pleasure, I guess. I lost count of the times I've seen this. Um, 10? Maybe 9. Basically, I watch it when I'm bored or I want a good thrill. After I finished it the first time, I IMMEDIATELY started it over (literally, immediately) just so I could pick out the plot holes. I found a couple, but then I realized they were quickly resolved after and/or explained. In my third time through I found some holes that weren't really resolved, but they are so small that it's almost impossible to notice-- and they really don't even matter or even hurt the story. Overall, it's great, and every little fine detail is so important to the overall show that I swear-- your mind might explode at some point in Death Note. Yes, some people think it's stupid, but my opinion does not change on my favorite anime. Sorry! Anyway, it's THE best mystery/fantasy/cat-and-mouse game ever. The second arc which takes place after episode 25 (I won't spoil anything) is sort of less exciting, but is still very good and enthralling.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nOh, the gorgeous art! Honestly, like 80 percent of Death Note is pretty much them talking to find out the mystery, but the art style itself is PERFECTLY dark, modernly gothic, and gorgeously realistic. And when they do move around, or an action scene comes on? They go all out, and never skimp on anything. It almost seems like they have eternal budget to make each scene amazing. Hehe. Anyway, all in all the art is amazing. One of my friend's hated anime, saying that \"it's for children and the art is stupid\". I forever converted her using this show, Death Note. It's just awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nAmazing. They're all unique in their own ways, but the most enthralling and notable characters for me (WARNING-- this will sound cliche) are L and Light. Ugh, you've heard that a trillion times... but is it my fault that the creators made such unique, such interesting characters? They're just genius! L seems like the cool, smart type, but he's not strong in some areas, and has more weaknesses than you might think. He isn't rude, but he does show a softer side later on nonetheless. He's a really hard character to sum up. Light, on the other hand, is immature. An image of your little brother just popped up in your head, didn't it? Stupid, annoying, cries when he doesn't get something he wants, everyone has to give him everything, and he's such a baby. NO. Light is immature in a different way-- yes, he's a freaking genius. He is a master of logical reasoning. He acts mature in public and always has a trick up his sleeve. But he's immature in his mind, I guess-- his idea of justice isn't the most mature, and killing people doesn't make you God, Light. Just thought you ought to know!~ Anyway, it's sooooooooo entertaining to see him change. I can't remember the person who said this, and I can't really even remember the saying-- I just remember this. \"Power doesn't change a man but unmasks what's been there all along.\" (Yeah I can't remember it really, sorry, but you get the idea.) Yeah, it's fun watching him go from genuis, well-mannered high school kid to psychotic mass murderer who thinks that killing people will make him God. All the other characters are good, and it doesn't really have too many characters but not too little either. And each has their own personality. They're all interesting. A certain character in the second arc seems like a wannabe of a certain character in the first arc, but overall they're fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack~\\n\r\n...Wow. I mean wow. Some of the orchestral music is just rearragements of slightly older pieces, but does that ruin the mood? LOL. No. I have never laughed so psychotically at someone's death in my whole life. Not even in Higurashi. That astonishing music along with the perfect animation is just... Woooooowwww. The tracks that aren't orchestral are good, but not super noticed. The more I watched the show the more it stood out, but my first time round, only the choir chanting along ominously with the perfect set of instruments really stood out. And I mean REALLY. The first opening and ending were good, but not super memorable. The animation that went with them was epic though. The second opening and ending... Erm, I'm not a death metal fan. Let's leave it at that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Death Note is my top anime, no matter how much you make fun of me. It's just genius, and when I finished watching it I was delighted. It's pretty much everything I ever wanted in an anime, or anything for that matter. Fantasy, SLIGHT horror, mystery, psychotic characters, an... interesting ending. Gorgeous!\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to ANYONE... Um, unless you're a raving romance-loving person, there is no romance in this. Protest all you want, but Light doesn't love Misa. He's only using her and that's all he ever did. So if you like bright, happy, lovey-dovey anime, this may not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut truly, this is art and genius.\\n\\n\r\nYou just may want to try it.",

            "content": "Today I will be reviewing another favorite anime of mine (and many others), Death Note. Death Note did not seem like a title I would like, and I first thought the fanbase for this was just crazy. But one day I was bored and decided \"what the hell\" and figured I'd see what the hype was all about. I checked out episode 6 or 7 on Adult Swim on demand, and boy am I glad that I did. I got hooked. I thought this would be another series where I'd disagree completely with every other anime fan out there (i.e. Fullmetal Alchemist, Elfen Lied andand most Ghibli movies, anime everyone seems to love but I can't stand). Throw in my dislike for most Shonen Jump titles and you'll understand why I thought I'd hate this (although I now feel this show is vastly out of place among titles like Naruto, Bleach, and such. It's nothing like those shows). I'm just trying to say I didn't think I'd like this show at all, in fact part of me wanted to hate it. But it's so good I couldn't. You would have to be mad not to like this amazing show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note was animated by Madhouse, who almost-always seems to impress me. It originally aired in 2006 and 2007. It was directed by Tetsuro Araki, who is a director to watch out for. He is a master of storytelling and able to create a great amount of suspense with reletive ease. He knows what he is doing, and how to do it. Of course he was just taking what Tsugumi Ohba (story) and Takeshi Obata (art) had already created as a manga, and adapting it into a TV series, but he still proved himself to be a more then competent director. Toshiki Inoue wrote the screenplay for the series, and it's handled with care. Anyway Death Note is suspense/psychological thriller anime about how a smart high school senior named Light Yagami, finds a supernatural note book with the power to kill, and how he uses it to try and become the God of a new world. He plans to kill criminals all over the planet, in order to create a crime-free world in which he would rule. To kill a person Light needs to know the name and face of that person, then write it down in the death note. And that is just the first of the many complex and thought out rules of the death note. And the rules are not meaningless either, as they are put to good use and becomes important points of the plot. Light is later joined by the former owner of the death note, a shinigami named Ryuk (who just decides to watch the show, and doesn't take much action by the way. Very cool!). But as the police start to notice all these criminals dieing, they start up an investigation to get to the bottom of it. They are assisted by the brilliant and mysterious detective L to help track down this mass murder, and a battle of wits ensues. Not that I needed to tell you all that, as everyone and their mother probally knows this already. The paceing for the show is very fast, but somehow it all works. In fact it's something you learn to love. You never get lost in the details, although a lot is happening every episode. It's never too hard to keep track of who has the upperhand, or what this person is attempting to do and how. Anyway the concept in and of it's self is just brillaint. It's very original and very simple. Who says there's nothing unique and original anymore? Everything is just the same story choped up and changed around a little? Not this. There's some originality left in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs if this brilliant concept wasn't good enough, the series challeneges the viewers, both mentally and morally. What I mean is the series has so much going on, you really have to pay attention and follow the logic of the show intensely and actively. And you have to think about everything going on. It also asks us some great moral questions, and may even challenge your morals a little bit. Like for example is what Light doing right? I mean the world would be a much better place without criminals, right?And as he kills these people crime rates do drop all over the planet. But on the other hand he's killing people he judges to be evil, who gives him that right? He's not able to be held responsible to the people like the government is, and how many innocent people is he killing, by sheer coincidence or accident? I mean not every single person in jail, or labled a criminal is guilty. The government and media can make mistakes too. Is L right, for trying to stop a coldhearted, manipulative mass murderer? Because he goes to some real lows, stopping at nothing to try and capture this \"Kira\", the name given to the person killing all these criminals. He does some terrible things along the way, like having no problem sacraficing a criminal in order to narrow down his search, or placing illegal wire taps and other surveillance in people's houses! Invasion of privacy much? There seems to be no such thing as civil liberites to this guy. The ends justify the means, as long as Kira is caught that's all that matters. Same goes to Light in a way. All of that is much more then most series can say. But that's not even the best part of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series is the sheer thrill and excitement one obtains from watching the show. It's intense, dramatic and incredbly suspenseful. The thrilling nature of the show is really something else. Never before have I seen a show that relies so heavily on suspense, and not just any suspense, but very good suspense. The shows main suspense depends on the amazingly brilliant game of cat and mouse that develops between Kira (aka Light), and L. It's a sign of good storytelling when you worry about this character or that one, or wonder what's going to happen next. The status quo never remians the same for long, and the person who has the advantage can never seem to hang on to it. It's very smart how all this plays out. L is trying to find out who Kira is to sentence him to death. And Light is trying to find out who L is, to write his name in the Death Note to kill him. Whoever finds out who the other person is first wins. The story contains intelligent fast paced fast paced deductions, multiple dramatic scenes , strategies, and epic mind battles that will keep any viewer hooked for the long haul (as this is a 37 episode series, much longer then I'm used to anyway). There are also some great, well thought out plot twists throughout the show, that will come as a real surprise. Many of the episodes end on great cliffhangers, that make you beg for the next episode, and the show will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Also Death Note never relies on \"false suspense\", that is it doesn't provoke suspense to then end up with a red haring or creates suspense unintelligently (i.e. horror movies where a cat was what scared the character at first. That brings a big let down to the veiwer. Another example is a scene where the character can't manage to get his keys to open the door correctly when he's being chased by the villian/monster. That makes us want to hit the person, and makes us just plain dislike them. Plus it's just not very realistic and it's very contrived. These scenes usually damage a work unless they are handled with great care. However, Hitchcock could handle false suspense quite well. But of course most cannot handle it as well as Hitchcock. Death Note avoids \"false suspense\" completely, and it's for the better.) Death Note is a master of suspense, plain and simple. I doubt any other series (live action, anime or written works) will ever match up to it's ability to deliver suspense to the viewer. It is a rollercoaster of a plot, with great ups and downs, and wild turns and twists a long the way. And the conclusion (don't worry no spoilers) is incredbly dramatic, suspensefull, and more then satisfying. It ties up all the lose ends, and brings us down from our \"high\" of suspense quite nice. Also it's a very sad ending, that might impact you a little emotionally. In fact I rank the conclusion of this series as one of the best in all of anime (it's #2, right behind the exellent ending to Now and Then, Here and There). It will be hard to top the ending of this show! I was literally shaking with anticipation leading up the last moments of the show. It's a perfect bookend to the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the poduction values. They are godly! Let's start with the artwork and animation. The artwork is just perfect. Madhouse was a great choice for adapting the gothic style of the manga, and uses a great original style for everything. The color pallete is dark for this series, but not at all gloomy. In fact Madhouse seems to have used a great contrast of light and dark in this series, and made everything very easy to see, but still have a great dark look to it all (which is perfect for this as it's a very dark show). The character designs are also incredbly well done. They are very detailed and realistic looking. The older detectives looks great, the high school students look realistic, and the girls all look very good (many of them are quite pretty, yet still real looking). And I have to mention that the show has a hook in it for the gals. Many of the characters are clearly bishounen bait. The illusion of debth for the characters to move around in 3 dimensions is prevalent in this anime and very well done. As for the animation, since the show is mostly talking, walking and thinking, there's not much for them to animate. However they managed to make writing with a pen look amazingly cool and incredbly epic. That's a plus in my book. When there is an action scene, you can bet it's perfect looking. Car chases, shootouts, and dramatic deaths are all animated with great care. The music is another thing that will impress you. All the opening and ending songs are great tracks. Fun to listen to, and are very fitting. But the strengh of this series comes from it's brilliant background music. From intense themes, to more calm ones, to church like hyms (that fit with Lights idea of becoming a God) and dark tones, everything is done perfectly. The music is used to hold the suspense and drama and it's just amazing. The perfect theme is used at the perfect time, and they all sound great. It's very loud and noticeable, but this is a good thing. Death Note easily has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. It's not exactly soemthign most would listen to out of context, but it's quite good for the show. As for the dub, it's just another perfect part of this amazing series. The dub was produced at Ocean Studios in Vancouver, Canada. Brad Swaile gives one of his best performances to date as Light Yagami. He just nails the role in every way. The way he handles his characters inner monologues is really impressive. Alessandro Juliani gives L a quirkiness about him, that just fits perfectly. Soichiro Yagami, Light's Father, is played by Chris Britton who gives him a gruffy and older sound that fits perfectly. In fact many of the older detectives have gruffy sounding voices, and many of the younger ones have a youthfullness about them that makes you understand them. A lot of thought went into the casting of this show, and every single line is acted perfectly. It's a very fresh, and expertly done dub. An example of what dubs can and should always be. It's one of the best dubs of the last few years, and a personal favorite of mine. Only slightly beaten out by another Ocean dub, Black Lagoon. This is a dub everyone and anyone would like.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that praise you may ask \"well is it perfect then?\". Well not quite, but very close. There are many people who feel the second half of the series does not at all live up to the first. Personally I disagree with that completely. There is nothing at all wrong with the second half of the show. It's just as good as the rest of it. The series keeps up it's quality thoughout and has no filler. Just because there is a major change in the style of the show, does not make it any worse. It's just different, not bad by any means. In fact I found the show to build on it's self, in so the later episodes would have even more suspense then the earlier ones. So then what's the problem? Well many of the characters are not very well developed. Many are nothing but chess peices, being used for the plot, by the plot, and only needed to exist when the plot calls for them. (Where are they when the story is not moving forward? Who cares!) So there are a few 2 dimensional characters in the show. However the show seems to have purposely done this. It seems to have decided early on not to develop some characters, and so it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things anyway. In fact the show may be better for it in the long run. Instead of wasteing time developing character after character, this series would rather stick to the giant game of cat and mouse between Light and L, and focus on creating suspense. But many of the characters are realistic, believable and sympthatheic and that's enough for me. Their actions make sense in the context of the show, and never feel out of place. Sure some people would like more emphasis on the characters evolving over time then this show has, but the way this series handled it's characters did not bother me too much. A little bit more emphasis on a few characters would have been amazing, but I'm more then happy with what we got. I felt it had just enough character development as to not take away from the plot, so I'm not that bothered by this small \"problem\". Oh and there was one deus ex machina (I'll just say \"the rocket\" and leave it as that as to not spoil anyone) that didn't fly with me in the show. It felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner, and did something completely unrealistic to get them out of it. It pulls you out of the show a little bit. Although in the context of the what's going on and the setting it does make some sense. That's all that really bothered me about the show. The rest is flawless.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne note more note about the director. I first saw the anime, and then went and read some important parts of the manga afterwards (currently I'm reading the manga from start to finish). The changes the director made to the anime were done with great thought behind them, and I easily prefur them to the original. The slight changes really help the series more often then not, and the ending of the anime is vastly superior to that of the manga. They both have the same ending, but the manga goes on to show what happens afterwards, which is not at all needed. It ruins the punch of the series, and is not really that interesting. The series needed to stop at the right time, and luckily the anime knew when that was. After the last scene in the anime nothing else needed to be known. Going on and explaining more stuff is pointless in my opinion, and sort of ruins everything. Other changes, like the slight difference in the chronology of certain scenes are easily for the better, and flashbacks are used in more important scenes. The use of great camera angles, like those showing L vs Light, or many people at the same time during different things are exceptional, and something the manga lacked. The manga would show one thing at the time, while the anime would show mutliple things happening at once (making it much more exiting). I prefer the way the anime dealt with those scenes. The great use of flashbacks in the begining of each episode, cliffhangers at the end of an episode, and other changes to when things happen, helped to add tension to the scenes. Also I find that \"watching\" something is much more exiting and suspenseful then reading something. So if you want to have the most exitement and thrill out of this series, I suggest you watch the anime first. Then go back and read it to see where it all began. No offense to the original mangakas of course, as the manga is amazing on it's own. It's just a different experience to watch something then to read it. These are some signs of great talent for the director, so keep an eye on him.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Death Note is nearly a flawless effert. It's a smart show, that's very dark, intense, dramatic and exiting. The show is an example of how to create excellent suspense, and has one of the best endings in all of anime. The artwork and music is flawless, and the direction is very strong. The dub is a top-of the line effert by the Ocean Group, something sub-only fans would enjoy. There are some slight problems with character development, but it's easily overlooked. And one scene felt like the writers got trapped in a corner and wrote themselves out of it very unrealistically. But it is an excellent show. It's every bit of the hype. A smart show like this hasn't been popular since Neon Genesis Evangelion (a show the director admits to being a huge fan of), and I hope it's a sign of other smart shows to come. There really is nothing else out there quite like Death Note. Don't let the hype scar you off like it almost did to me. You just have to see this show.\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry the review is so long, but I wanted to do this series some justice)\\n\\n\r\n- Review copyed from my personal blog\\n\r\n- Original review posted at: http://predeanimereview.blogspot.com/2009/10/death-note.html",

            "content": "I must say that honestly I believe Death Note is the greatest anime of all time. It is the COMPLETE package. It is the only anime I ever watched that I could not stop watching. It really makes you think and it has soooo many good twists throughout the entire series. You never really know what's going to happen next.\r\nStory: I mean, it's so unique. What other series have you heard of with Shinigamis and notebooks that can kill people? And it really appeals to a lot of different tastes. It is suspenseful without being scary. And it is funny without just being a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Death Note's art is pretty amazing, but sometimes it seemed like the artist randomly changed. In a few episodes the drawings were semi freakish, such as the very last two episodes. But all-in-all, I must say that there is amazing artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay, by far, the best OP themes and ED themes every made in any anime. Maximum the Hormone has become my favorite band since I heard the Death Note OP and ED. No lie. Also, I really like the church music they play while Light kills people. It really adds to the mood of the show nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: FOR SURE a 10 when it comes to characters. At least in my opinion. Light has that sly characteristic where he is very good at hiding things and keeping secrets. Misa may be slightly annoying at times, but every show needs a relief character that you can just laugh at. L was that complete package character. He was cute and funny AND smart. And I loved how they said that Near and Mello together was like the complete L. That was a very good way to describe those two characters. And Matsuda has to be my favorite character. He is that guy that makes you laugh throughout the whole show and even if he doesn't have a MAJOR part, he was still important in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have never enjoyed any anime more than this one. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time I watched it. I laughed a lot in the beginning of the series and cried a couple of times by the end of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I must say negatively about Death Note is that the manga was better. But still, best anime ever.",

            "content": "(contains spoilers, read at your own risk.  YOU have been warned)\r\nThis review is strictly reserved for the critique of the second half of the show.  Most of us will agree the first half is basically flawless, so why concentrate your time dissecting something perfect?  Especially since  you can write a lot more based on the unbalanced second half.  \r\nI do admit that the second half isn't nearly as well done as the first half, mostly because they obviously shoe horned a convenient plot twist so that Kira would lose after all.  And in a way, i could see howthat pissed people off, me included. I agree with that sentiment; albeit, I don't think we should write off Near and his minions off just yet.  They are done very well with a very emotional and interesting past to them, enough so to keep them relevant and wanting to find out more, and you have to give it to them - the back story to L's and Near life make the second half worth it.  Another part that was very well done was the death of Kiras' dad. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is the second half panned so much?  To me it really feels like Near didn't live up to the expectation of L and that Kira was beaten so lightly, when he had to go around hoops against L.  Either way, I feel the second half could of been approached better or maybe at least reserved for an OVA or something later, but it definitely doesn't warrant the notoriety it gets.\\n\\n\r\nI guess my only major gripe about the second half is they got ride of the bad-ass opener for something not as bad-ass, but some b.s. emo-fashioned esque opener that was just straight up lame.",

            "content": "Death Note is a Japanese manga series created by writer Tsugumi Ohba and manga artist Takeshi Obata which was adapted into an anime and directed by Araki, Tetsurou and produced by Maruyama, Masao. It centers on Light Yagami, a high school student who discovers a supernatural notebook, the titular \"Death Note\" or \u201cDesu Noto\u201d. This notebook grants the ability to kill anyone whose name is written. The series follows Light's subsequent efforts to create a criminal-free world using this extra ordinary notebook, and the efforts of a detective known as L or (Lawliet L.) to stop him.\nDeath Note was first serialized in 108 chapters byShueisha in the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. The anime series aired October 3, 2006, to June 26, 2007. Consist of 37 episodes.\\n\\n\nDeath Note brings you to the mood of critical thinking and intelligence, which will make you think over and over again.\\n\\n\nIt has a great plot that insures you to get your characters from Point-A to Point-Z. \\n\nCreating a new world with your own hands isn't fair enough, bringing up the fact that no one has the right to judge anyone and that what is Desu Noto is all about.  Story relation with its own viewer is really epic; it permits you to solve the puzzle first before it reveals what really happens in the series.\\n\nThis is a good example of what is psycho thriller was all about.\\n\\n\nExceptional art for Death Note was implemented resulting into a masterpiece series when it comes to anime &amp; character illustration. Supposed to be that the anime story is in a classic theme still the latest art was implemented in a really nice way, also I love the art for some scenes when Yagami Light is talking to himself where he turns to be a red colour Yagami. Not only that, Lawliet L was the highlight for this series (for me) when it comes to the art section.\\n\\n\nSound, there\u2019s nothing really special here as usual hardcore music are being implemented when it comes to psycho and supernatural series. The one that caught my attention here are the voice actors/actresses they did a great job to personalize and to illustrates the visualization for each character. Lawliet L. was the most impressive here when it comes to voice acting. Performed by (Japanese) voice actor Yamaguchi Kappei. \\n\\n\nAbout the character well, I've already said it earlier that characters are impressive either personalization &amp; visualization. Each of them has a unique characteristic. Let say for example, Lawliet L. the way he moves is really strange and very intriguing, answering the phone and reading something in an unusual way spiced up the whole series. This also applies to \u201cNear\u201d as well which are very entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\nWell I really enjoyed this one, the fact that you are also involved with the story spice you up on what is going to happen next. You might get to the point that you want to play it in a fast forward mode.\\n\\n\nSo overall I gave it a mark of 9/10, which means it is almost perfect to me, because I've never scored 10/10 as many of us would not agree since we have our own preferences.\\n\\n\nWant to improve my review? Please comment your feedback on how to improve my review methods as I am reviewing this one based on my opinions only.\\n\\n\nJA! Domo!\\n",

            "content": "Death Note, what a ride.\r\nThis series is one that after watching i would most definitely recommend to anyone, the suspense and heart-stopping thrills that this program provides is unrivaled by most any other anime and leads the viewers to construct active thought processes on what they support and believe in when developing this stand-off between two different ideals on the state of the world and the lengths to which it is ok to truly think that you are making the world a better place. A real thought-provoker which maintains the attention of viewers and keeps them enthralled on the edge of their seats.\r\nStory (10)\r\nThe waythe story is developed in this anime is one of those elements which really makes it what it is, outstanding. Death Note is one of those anime where you really feel like you have to be paying full attention at all times so as not to miss anything which is going on. As previously mentioned, the story really engages the audience in such a way that they find themselves re-thinking the way they view the world and the associated belief systems that they have in place. I would agree with all those who say that that the first half of the show is the most exciting half, but this doesn't mean that the other half is automatically bad, in fact, it still has that same compelling style of story-telling and continues a well executed story all the way to the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8)\\n\r\nThe art in Death Note is not a pushover, while at first upon viewing the first couple episodes i was rather critical of the art, i came to see the art design brought into this anime as one which is extremely effective, and the use of a dark colour pallet helped to re-reinforce the \"dark\",\"evil\" plot and story and allow the viewers to immerse themselves in the life of Yagami Light and his interactions with the World around him.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7)\\n\r\nSo i am giving the sound in the anime 7/10 and this is even with me being someone who doesn't really understand the appeal of heavy metal or music where people just vent their rage. The first opening and ending audio tracks worked very well for me, (well at least the opening) but then the other tracks i found myself having to skip through them each episode because i couldn't stand them, but even so, if you are like me and can't stand that variation of music, don't worry! The rest of the anime is amazing\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10)\\n\r\nThe characters, along with the story, are just sensationally put together in a way that brings the audience into the story and allows them to see the views and ideals of different sets of people and their justifications, it is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i love so much about these characters, is that not only are they perfectly voiced by the voice-actors (especially Mamoru Miyano voicing Yagami Light), but trust me as someone who has watched this anime, you will come to both love and despise some of these characters, and even better, it leads to different viewers having alternate thoughts on who they support. The characters are all unique, interesting and original (like the battle between L and Light, showing two separate kinds of character) and further enhances the reason why the characters make this anime so thrilling to watch\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMy final score for Death Note is 9 out of 10, an amazing anime defined by it's unique characters and immersive story, if you are reading this review and haven't yet decided/started to watch it, please, just go do it. You won't regret it :D",

The story is great, Light Yagami,is a teenager that wants to change the world through a notebook by eradicating the world of crime, has a god complex and is an absolute justice type of character, (Like Akainu from One Piece) and is known to the world as Kira. L, a detective considered to be the world's greatest tries to prevent him from killing anymore criminals since it is still murder. It's L vs Kira, who willwin? Most of the time, it's just a cat and mouse game, you never know who will win and it seems at times in the show that Light is so close to getting rid of L and L is close to revealing the identity of Kira. The first opening and ending are some of my favorite in anime and they have great music that goes along with the story. One flaw with Death Note is that there is enough character development except for L and Light. There's average development for Misa and others, but nothing great. There was never a dull moment in Death Note, and all 37 episodes were great. Overall, I give Death Note a perfect 10 out of 10, and highly recommend it. But if it were me, I would have ended it at Episode 25, because the second season killed it.",

            "content": "I started off really liking the anime, with the cognitive back and forth between Light and L being the highlight. The rules of the Death Note serve as a game constraint pretty much like an elaborate game of Mafia. But when Light somehow loses his advantage of being invisible from investigation and became the most likely suspect, the anime starts to lose its charm. L's infinite resources, including technology, authority (to imprison without trial and whatnot) and manpower. \r\nThe second portion (I refuse to call this a 'half' simply because of how short it and rushed it was) was a bit of a let down.Near and Mello were simply not as interesting and many of their feats are bullshit. They should have gotten a fresher start trying to investigate Kira but they immediately picked up from where original L left off. \\n\\n\r\nDidn't like the heavy metal but to each their own.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters were shallow and akin to two-dimensional beings in a three-dimensional world. \\n\\n\r\nMy review is plagued by the rushed second half which was more vivid due to the recency effect. Really interesting premise but the writing became lazy later on. Worth watching but not rewatching.",

            "content": "This was my first anime I have ever watched and was an amazing introduction anime for me. I am now abit more familiar with anime now but this is probably still my favourite one.\r\nSound/Soundtrack: I have always said that if you do not notice the background music in a film then the soundtrack is doing its job. Not once was I distracted by the soundtrack,it fits in very well with the whole theme of the anime. As a big fan of the band Maximum The Hormone I can say I really appreciated the opening and closing of each episode.\r\nArt: I am not much of aartist but I think just about anyone can enjoy the art in Death Note. Rather than taking on a theme of its own it just tries to mimic reality and it does so beautifully. The art just adds to the already delightful experience of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character is solid and has there own distinguishable character. The chemistry between characters if very good but not amazing. Death Note does a very good job in showing heavy emotions like anger and sadness in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is defiantly where Death Note shines brightest. The already amazing plot line is executed flawlessly. Everything is well explained without lingering on anything for too long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Death Note might be very serious but it also knows how to have a little fun. One might be able to argue that there is little re-watch value and with valid points aswell. I have watched it twice (about a 2 year gap between) and found both times extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give Death Note the perfect score of 10/10",

            "content": "Death Note is the first anime that I have ever watched. At the time, I did not consider myself to be a fan of anime in the slightest, and it was my girlfriend that convinced me to give this show a chance. It did not disappoint, and it has changed my view on anime completely.\r\nI will try my best to keep this review spoiler free, not revealing any major plot points, which could ultimately ruin the show for those yet to watch it. \r\nI personally feel that the concept of Death Note is unlike anything I had seen created before, giving a good understanding tothe viewer about how too much power can corrupt any man. The way that this descent into madness is handled is brilliant, and although the change begins very early in the show, it increases towards the end. The entire show is essentially one big, exciting game of cat and mouse between main characters, Light and L. After a few episodes, you will begin to \"take the side\" of one of these main characters. The show does a fantastic job of providing both sides of the argument positives and negatives. The way that Death Note constantly surprises the viewer is mesmerizing, what you are expecting to happen rarely ever takes place. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Death Note are the real selling point of the show. Two completely unique characters, unlike many others in media today. We decide which one we consider to be the protagonist and the antagonist. Both believing that they are fighting for justice, giving these characters their conviction, both feel that they are in the right. Ryuk is a Shinigami, he is responsible for Light being given the Death Note, and throughout the show provides comic relief. I do, however, feel that Ryuk was a bit of a wasted opportunity, and after the first 10 episodes he rarely appears. The concept of the Shinigami World having Death Notes is an interesting one, and I am upset that we did not learn more about it. Later on in the show, we also get to know the character Near, who I feel is an under appreciated character. His personality is very unique, and the actions we see him carry out, in order to find Kira are interesting. He is often seen playing with toys, which depict characters from the show. The show also introduces many other characters, however none of them are nearly as memorable as Light and L. \\n\\n\r\nLike most people, I have to agree that the show begins to go downhill after episode 25. However, in my opinion, it does not become as awful as some people make it out to be. It is just not up to the same quality as it once was. I thoroughly enjoyed the finale, and feel that most of the loose ends were tied up. If the show were to have had a different ending, similar to that of the live action Death Note films, I feel the show would have received much more praise from viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this was the first anime that I ever watched. Due to this, I did not have a great idea of what was good art and what was not. After viewing the art of other anime series, I feel that Death Note has good art for its time of release. However, I do not consider it good enough to be a sole reason to watch the anime. The show has a dark, dull colour palette, matching the theme of the series. We are very rarely shown a landscape of something to be considered \"beautiful\". I found that the show mainly concentrates on the story and the character development. If this is something that interests you, you should love Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nFor those interested in watching this anime with the English dub, it will not disappoint. There is not a single character who's voice does not suit them. The English voices of Light, L, Ryuk and Near are my personal favourites.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel I would rate Death Note 9/10. Almost everything about it is perfect, however as mentioned before, it does begin to go downhill later on in the show. If the plot were to have been altered, so that the second half did not occur, I feel this would raise my score to 10/10.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead. If you want an anime filled with mystery, tension as well as mind evoking moments just like myself, this is perfect for you. Death Note is a compelling, well written and unique story able to combine story, art, music and characters to create a masterpiece like no other before.\r\nStory-10/10\r\nA truly outstanding story. Thrilling enough to have me off the edge of my seat at times. The interaction between the main cast, the dialogue and a considerable amount of plot twists was what made it so special. Even if the second part of the series is much weaker than the first one, it stillmakes you completely engaged to the story. The main character was what made it so exceptional, as he was unlike any others I had ever seen in other shonen manga. Light Yagami plays the role of the main antagonist, trying to outmanoeuvre and manipulate innocent people by killing them, just for the completion of his own goals. It adds more interest and tension to the viewers, as we slowly find ourselves questioning how an honour student becomes an A class serial killer in such a short time.\\n\r\nCharacters-10/10\\n\r\nAmazing characters, with an unforgettable main cast. The reason the second part of the story was considerably weaker was mainly because of L's replacement with Near, who I absolutely despised at that point of time. It just shows you how complex and mysterious L's character was, as his ''friendship'' with Light grew stronger. The game between a psychotic killer and a hero certainly makes you hooked on your TV screen, as it slowly makes you rethink which side you should choose. Like a game of chess, it's unpredictable, it mind boggles your mind until you make your final decision about who the winner should be. And when you find out who wins, you stare at the board in awe. That is exactly how I felt when L died, except for a moment I didn't stare in awe but in disappointment. I could never forgive Near for replacing such a character. But the positives about Light and L made me completely disregard everything negative about Near, and thus this is why I give the character section a perfect score.\\n\r\nEven if I find L's character to be better than Light's, I find myself questioning whether he is my favourite or not. The answer to this question changes every single day, as I really can't decide who is better between them. I would really like to choose L, but I always find myself picking up Light. That's because I can relate to Light more on a personal level. And also because villainous characters are kind of my ''fetish''.\\n\r\nSecondary characters are excellent. Misa's personality might be annoying for some people but I find her perfect as a comic relief character, at least for this kind of anime. As a shinigami, Ryuk plays a fantastic role, same with the Task Force members.\\n\r\nArt-10/10\\n\r\nFor a shonen anime the art is outstanding. The animation is probably one of the greatest points about the series, as not only does it capture the scenery perfectly, but it also makes every character move fluently. Despite the minimal movement, every action scene is animated perfectly. Epic scenes like ''I'll take a potato chip and eat it!'' will make you hyperventilate from excitement and pure satisfaction!!!\\n\r\nSound-10/10\\n\r\nLow of Solipsism, Kira's theme, L's theme, Near's theme and many many many others will always rest in my Ipod, in the Playlist titled : ''Greatest themes of all time''... nuff said...\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Death Note (as you may have guessed)... Before you call me a fan boy, (which I am) I must say that this anime is definitely in my Top 5. \\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\r\n1) Code Geass\\n\r\nThey are both too similar in way too many aspects. Mainly, Lelouch is the next Light Yagami with slight differences...\\n\r\n2) Hunter x Hunter\\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with Death Note. But this is too, one of the best shonen manga out there.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nOk I will say right now, this anime has one of the most griping stories I have seen in a long time.  Right from the start, the strikingly original plot sucks you in, to deliver a very satisfying story that will keep the viewer hooked from the start. Why is the story lower than everything else?  Well, lets just say the story kinda takes a turn for the worst about 2/3 of the way through, but pulls through in the end, delivering one of the most epic endings to anything I have ever seen\r\nArt: The art in Death Note actually is not utilizedthat much.  Most of this series is based on talking (Which is not a bad thing, seeing as the talking on this anime is actually much more exiting than the few action scenes in this show :P)  The few action scenes though, are really well animated and probably took up 90% of the animation budget, and its well worth it.  The character models look stunning, from the groomed, suave, genius Light Yagami, to the messy, skinny, detective with poor people skills, and dress attire resembling the modern day stereotype of an Otaku, they all look very well animated, and somewhat realistic (L's hair 0_0)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and closer themes of this series are all nice to listen to, and are a good precursor to this gripping series.  The music in the show is...well over the top is an UNDERSTATEMENT!  In most scenes there are just a creepy chant playing in the background, but when the series gets into one of its action scenes, the music switches to over the top, orchestrated pieces of goodness that redefine the word epic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Death note is an extremely gripping tale that will leave you glued to your seat through most of it.  Despite a few story problems, this series is a must-see for most anime fans, and will also even get not anime fans into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "Psychological thrillers are easy to write, but not as easy to like. A lot of what makes psychological thrillers work is making the characters act in a very believable and human fashion, which we don't normally see because the writers make the themes normally control the story and characters in psychological thrillers. This tends to ruin immersion a lot, especially when the purpose of such a story is to discuss the humanity behind their actions or lack thereof.\r\nThe trick behind psychological thrillers is to also avoid making the story as dark as possible simply for the purpose of being, well, as dark as possible. It'svery easy for them to slide into being too edgy for their own good, which not only ruins immersion by the viewers but also ends up contradicting the themes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a case where this is avoided...and played straight.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is undeniably tightly written and many of the tricks and red herrings are carefully played out over the course of the show, especially in the first two thirds. This works thanks to the fascinating perspectives on justice, morality and even religion present over the course of the show, which is brilliantly handled when focusing on the society at large and many of the various side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't work as well, however, when focusing these themes on the main characters. It feels like the show dumbed down a lot of character depth simply to make the pacing as addictive and fast as possible, which works if you look at what this show does on a basic level (as far as storytelling is concerned, it definitely knows how to hook the viewer) but it's hard not to feel like layers of depth were cut out simply to make the show as, well, thrilling as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the main characters, it's impossible to bring up the main characters without focusing on the fantastic rivalry between Light and L, which is very well explored and grows fantastically throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis does bring us to another important point that ends up being what prevents this show from being a masterpiece; the moral ambiguity that works so damn well on everything else fails when focusing on Light and L, and that is because the show avoids making you root for Light by making him as much of a megalomaniac as possible. Light is simply a tool to advance the themes, and while this isn't particularly bizarre for a psychological thriller it fails in a show so rooted in morality such as this one.\\n\\n\r\nLight is a prime example of a great idea for a character gone terribly wrong, and while he is certainly a great deal of entertainment to watch over the course of the show, there is no conflict he holds within himself despite that being, well, the nature of the show. This leads to a lot of inconsistent characterization, especially in the final third of the show where the show just wants him to be painted as the most evil person possible. Sure, watching him slowly but surely slide into madness was a lot of fun but I couldn't help but feel that it could have been handled a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is very distinct and pleasant to look at, with character designs being very distinct and the backgrounds looking great. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous over the course of the show, and the visuals look even smoother in the more tense moment of the series. Animation quality is solid and consistent and does a fantastic job bringing out the tension over the course of the show (despite the fact that you, the viewer, know all the information before the characters do). This show is filled with adrenaline and it knows it, and it works very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty rad as well, with some absolutely chilling choirs being played over the course of the show. The sound effects never feel out of place, and constantly and consistently fit the mood. The voice acting in both Japanese and English is top notch and it's hard to recommend one over the other, though I personally think the dub sounds better (simply because L sounds more like an introvert and Light doesn't sound as much like an adult).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Death Note is a highly enjoyable anime that unfortunately suffers from being very inconsistent in its presentation, doesn't succeed at being morally ambiguous when it matters most as much as it should have and has a considerably weaker final third than the first two thirds of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt is nonetheless a show I can recommend as among the best entries in the mystery genre as far as anime is concerned, and if not for anything else it certainly leaves a lot of food for thought. \\n\r\nI recommend it, but please be aware that contrary to what you may hear, it's not everyone's cup of tea (I swear I'm not making a reference to anything in the show) and a lot of the themes may offend some people, especially as far as religion in particular is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nThose who can look past all that will find a flawed but adrenaline pumping show rich in themes and symbolism and mixed in its execution.\\n",

            "content": "Death Note follows the story of a boy who finds a book with the powers to kill anybody he chooses. The anime becomes a hunt to see who can outsmart who is this thriller detective story.\r\nStory: The story was very well executed, it felt real and was very captivating from the get-go.\r\nArt: Was very stylistic in the sense of lots of sharp edges and muddy colours, made the show very dark and sinister. I especially loved the colours of blue and red to symbolise the different sides. Whether it was good and evil, right or wrong. Blood Lust or Cold heart, it's up to youto decipher. That's what art should do, make you think, which fits this show's narrative of constant thinking ahead and intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was perfect for the tone. Complemented the themes and atmosphere the show was trying to provide. Made it more thrilling. Lots of iconic OSTs that will stay with you after you finished the show for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: On the whole. the characters are very amazing. We aren't given much information on them, which in this case makes them ever so more interesting with trying to work them out. None of the characters are meant to be relatable, but in this case, it makes them so much more of a spectacle\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Speaking as someone who hasn't watched a lot of crime, or is into thrillers or detective type media, this was outstanding and very captivating. This anime will probably be a huge classic in the future and will stay with viewers for a long time.",

            "content": "First review ever so spare me ^-^ [Everything that sounds spoilerish is in the first episode]\r\nDeath Note is among the 'godly' realm of anime, right up there with Full Metal Alchemist, Steins;Gate, HunterXHunter and Gintama. \r\nThe thing that separates Death Note from the others is 100%; \r\nThe Story.[10]\r\nThe story, holy hell man, this is one of the only anime that makes a plot twist, hides it, and lets YOU discover it on your own. This story makes you question your own beliefs and can change your view on the world, and none of that was an exaggeration, I can assure you.\r\nBeing slightly in the realmof anime watching, you've probably heard about Death Note. Even if you haven't, Death Note has found its way into western culture, and not in the most desirable ways. The story revolves around Light Yagami, THE brightest student in Japan. He discovers a notebook named the 'Death Note'; written inside are the words; 'those whose names are written in this book shall die.' sounds like crappy chain mail from the late 90's right? wrong. The consequences of those 10 words reak havoc throughout Japan and the rest of the world. All because of a goddamn notebook that some lazy-ass Death God (Shinigami) dropped, to have some 'entertainment'. I am glad this isn't real because damn, its some scary shit.\\n\r\n[Manga] - compared to the manga, the anime trumps it. The manga had some story issues about halfway in and it got a bit boring for a few chapters, but the anime, they just gloss over the irrelevant shit, and they gloss well. Nothing is lost, and nothing is unneeded, perfect even.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art. [9.5]\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the art, you knew what everything was, everything was almost identical to how Takeshi Obata drew it. The *only* thing not giving it a prefect 10, is that there are a few scenes throughout the series where the characters just look really strange, like its only for half a second or something but yeah it's not noticeable enough to waver your thoughts on the amazing animation done in this anime\\n\r\nIn the first episode, the art comes of as incredibly saturated, very bleak and very plain. In my opinion I see this as how Light views the world around him and as the series goes on, it gets brighter and more vivid as more of the story unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound.[10]\\n\r\nHoly ambient batman. \\n\r\nTRUMPETS, GOTHIC CHURCH CHOIRS, HEAVY METAL. EVERYTHING IS HERE AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT, the score throughout the anime was perfectly written and especially throughout the battle scenes, it didn't feel intrusive, it just felt so natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters [10]\\n\r\nTo maintain my spoiler free [exc. ep 1] review I'm just going to say a few things. \\n\r\nRyuk; easily a hilarious necessary addition. Comedy is spot on and really plays the whole 'are death gods actually bad though?' card very well.\\n\r\nLight; INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENTLY written, he embodies our natural thought processes and seems like he does the natural, logical things anyone would do... \\n\r\nThe other characters that are revealed later on in the series are easily some of my favourite characters and I'm yet to see someone disappointed in how the characters are written in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this show, its philosophical, it provokes you to think about it almost every episode and its JUST SO DAMN GOOD. \\n\r\nIf you're hesitant to watch it YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON EVERYTHING, WATCH IT.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: [10/10] (Rewatch potential [10/10])\\n\r\nLastly; \\n\r\nImpact on The World:\\n\r\nDeath Note has been banned in several places, most reason revolve around the 'Makes students take an interest in death' chant. As with video games, scapegoats are aplenty and this anime & manga series, being the 'controversial' story it is, is no exception. This should not be a reason to not watch the show, I REPEAT, DO NOT MAKE THIS A REASON TO PASS ON THIS ONCE A GENERATION SHOW.\\n\\n\r\nThank You for reading my 'review/recommendation! Arigatoo Gozaimasu~ \\n\r\n-Zukosfireyass",

            "content": "In today's society, it's so difficult to find innovative, challenging and stimulating material that is also enjoyable. Death Note hits the nail on the head with it's highly appealing, informative, and complex storyline. It is truly unique in concept, and indisputably my favourite anime. Ever.\r\nI could certainly spout praise for the series all day, not to say it's ultimately perfect. \r\nObviously the supernatural subject matter throws reason out the window, but an element of realism is lost. The detectives chasing Light make huge leaps - killings during the day? MUST BE A STUDENT - and though this may be pinned on their amazing deductive skill,it seems a little implausible. \\n\r\nThere are minor plot holes, but this doesn't detract too severely seeing as it contains such a complex, overarching story - an audience is pleasantly confused.\\n\r\nSome emphasis on ideas is a little obvious; different views are sliced into the action with somewhat cheesy dialogue.\\n\r\nAlso, while the voice acting (English Dub) is usually consistent and indicative of the talented cast, we sometimes are subject to awkward transitions and vocal techniques that aren't behavioural of characters. Another thing I noticed (only because I have watched it sooo many times) was that actors of well known characters (Matsuda, L) voice minor characters such as news reporters and bystanders - but I suppose i'm being pedantic now.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that ends my list of what was not so good, the rest is good news, I assure you!\\n\r\nOne of my favourite things about the anime is the use of symbolism - the apple to represent sin (as in the Garden of Eden ordeal...), and the meta scenes where L and Light (and even other characters) are represented by different colours and openly fight each other. The creator's clever presentation of ideas allows the audience to search for a deeper meaning.\\n\r\nAnd this deeper meaning is certainly prominent. Each episode highlights philosophical ideas - mortality, justice, corruption of society, good vs. evil, morality, sin, and so much more. It leads you to think about the world; would we be better off without these criminals? Whose job is it to \"pass righteous judgement on the wicked?\" Does killing exile you from heaven?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are another strength of Death Note. Ryuk and Misa will make you laugh, Light will make you cringe, and the empathy and rapport we gain with the characters make us hope and suffer along with them. Undoubtedly, you will take a side. Kira, or the law?\\n\r\nI found myself routing for Light, his tactics, acting, and intelligence were pretty... appealing ;) Every action he would take, I'd be all like \"NOOO DON'T YOU'LL FALL INTO L'S TRAP!\" or \"OH HOLY JESUS YOU ARE A GENIUS\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply outstanding. Characters are proportional, environments are beautiful and detailed, setting is appropriate, colouring sets a distinctive mood, and the design is flawless and unique. The style is quite realistic for the anime convention - no crazy coloured hair or unlikely features - which really allowed focus on the ideas conveyed, and the seriousness of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think I can really explain why I love Death Note so much. Everytime I watch it, I just marvel at the genius and artful masterpiece that was produced. I definitely recommend it to anyone with a love for mystery and a mentally challenging anime.\\n",

            "content": "\"Death Note\" is one of those anime that achieved huge amount of fame as a manga, so its incredible success as an anime always had a feeling of inevitability about it. I first heard about it a couple of years prior to its release, when a few of my friends were reading the manga. Unfortunately for me, a couple of them discussing the \"Death Note\" manga right in front of me gave away a big plot point that occurs mid series. At the time I didn't mind, as I don't really read manga, but I was a bit peeved when I learnt about the animeadaptation. The information I had been made aware of is arguably the biggest turning point in the entire story, and I also remember my friends saying that they'd lost all interest in it right after that development. At the time, I was skeptical that one event could have such a big impact on the series, but now that I've watched the anime, I found that my friends were right all along.\\n\\n\r\n\"Death Note\" is an anime of two halves. Though saying that is a bit misleading since the two \"halves\" are unequal in size. The really good part of Death Note probably only extends as far as the first third of the series... and it's all downhill from then on. But, man, WHAT a good part it is! That section by itself is probably more than a match for the best parts of any anime I've ever watched, and is enough to catapult the anime into my personal A-list... and most other people's too, judging from its reception.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening episode wastes little time in setting up the scene, and though the premises may be a little gimmicky, and the dramatising occasionally over zealous (the main character Light writes with so much aggression and vigour, you'd half expect him to leave blazing trails of fire behind his pen), the intrigue and potential are there in buckets, and I was hooked straight way. \\n\\n\r\nThis probably isn't the first anime to ask controversial questions of justice and morality, of whether it's right for a person to take the law into his own hands and pass judgement onto others, but \"Death Note\" takes this concept and puts a fresh twist on it, and this twist comes in the form of the Light. Light is the protagonist of the show, but here's the catch - he's not the hero, he's the villain. He's a villain that unhesitatingly abuses that power that comes into his hands, and goes on a ruthless killing spree, all in the name of justice. And does the world become a better place as a result of his actions? It's a point that can be fiercely debated, but I actually think it does, and I think with some subtle changes Light can easily be portrayed as an anti-hero instead. Initially, he doesn't appear to be a completely bad guy, but power corrupts, and he seems to become less and less human as the series progressed, with his actions becoming more and more extreme. I think the series did a most excellent job at portraying his moral deterioration.\\n\\n\r\nLight's popularity amongst the rabid fan community is only matched (and perhaps even exceeded) by his opposite number L, the autistic detective prodigy, who is put in charge of the investigation to find the person who's been killing off all the criminals (don't worry, this isn't really a spoiler - this all gets set up within like the first 2 episodes). A fascinating character in his own right, L glows with a strange kind of magnetism despite being, put it bluntly, a bit of a weirdo. I get the feeling that L is more concerned with solving the puzzle and winning the battle of wits rather than bringing a criminal to justice. On the surface, Light and L are very different, however, underneath there are striking similarities between their personalities. Perhaps counter intuitively, they're on opposite sides of this battle *because of* rather than despite of their similarities - add their stubborn competitiveness to their similarities and you naturally get the effects of mixing two volatile chemicals together. In the interest of the anime, the two are like a pairing made in heaven. Sparks begins to fly immediately - even before the two meets face to face - and the series explodes forth at a demonic pace. About 8 episodes in, I was thinking to myself \"this is unbelievable... it's actually still getting better with each episode\". My friends shared the same sentiment - at the rate it was going, it was heading towards being the best anime ever by miles... surely something had to give.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately it did. Unable to sustain the astronomical increase in suspense and excitement, the anime soon peaked, and actually started going into decline before the Event-That-Was-Spoilt-For-Me... it's just that the drop was even steeper after that aforementioned event. Looking back on it, I guess it was inevitable, given that a lot of the fun parts came about because of the bizarre way the Death Note (the object, not the anime) operates, making Light fiendishly hard to catch. Once that trick is revealed, the anime was always gonna struggle to prevent the remaining story from becoming less interesting, even without taking into account the difficulty of matching the dizzying heights of the earlier episodes. Having said that, the revelation concerning the Death Note is not the culprit behind the anime's first sign of decline. The first decline was brought about by a development in the storyline that broke up the psychological cat-and-mouse game played between Light and L, a routine that had served the series so well up to that point. Instead, they went off to chase after some random villain that no one really cares about (this is also known as the Yotsuba arc). The whole mood of the anime changes for the worst from that point on. Not only had the tension almost completely broken, the anime also started fancying itself as some kind of cheap comedy, throwing in more and more \"comic\" moments, mostly involving that hugely irritating walking-fanservice-doll Misa Misa and that good-for-nothing Matsuda. Whilst previously, the occasional comic moments involving L seemed appropriate to his character and did not detract from the suspense, the new wave of comedy greatly grated on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe somewhat dull Yotsuba arc eventually ended, and was soon followed by the Event-That-Was-Spoilt-For-Me (not that I'm bitter or anything), and though the incident itself was executed extremely well (with the exception of the foot massage scene aimed to provoke high pitched screaming from the fangirls), the series really takes a nose dive after that. What exactly went wrong in the final arc? Well, it's hard to know where to start - \"Death Note\" pretty much deteriorated in all aspects: First thing to note is that both the opening and ending theme turns into screaming rage metal (or whatever pretentiously named genre that brand of \"music\" is classed as) songs (and I use that word loosely) that are painful to the ears. No doubt it's an attempt to make the anime seem more \"edgy\". What a disaster that is - it certainly made me more edgy, frequently putting me in foul mood even before the episodes properly started. After that, there's the story that becomes totally unbelievable. Granted, even in the beginning, there were occasions in the storyline that bordered on the ridiculous (the whole farce involving Light and his packet of potato chips for example), but in the final part the it becomes so \"out there\" that the whole series starts to feel little surreal - that monkey business involving a stealth missile that's untrackable by satellite and launches from some secret underground base is just... I'm actually at a loss for words that can describe how ludicrous that is.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's that set of oh-so-original new characters that gets introduced. Mellow and Near are just poor copies of L. What's with the \"eccentric habits\" that all these \"genius kids\" seem to have? With L, it all seems quite natural and original, but Mellow and L has to come along and spoil it all. Mellow's habit of munching chocolate is like a big sign saying \"hey look! Obsessively eating chocolate is my unique vice!\" Near is even worse, constantly playing with his toys despite his serious mannerisms. I mean, I can accept him playing puzzle games as those are mentally challenging to a certain degree, but... lego men?!? Whilst L's behaviour can be excused because of his childish streak, Near doesn't even look like he's enjoying playing with his kiddish toys. Like Mellow, it seems like he's only playing for the sake of doing something that would give him a distinguishing trait. Furthermore, L's methods for solving cases reminds me of Sherlock Holmes, because he explains every step in his thinking clearly and everything makes perfect logical sense. In comparison, Near is more like a character from some second-rate detective novel - a lot of the time he just seem to make mental leaps of faith without indicating how he made the logical connections. The overwhelming sense of intelligence and logic built up by the anime's fantastic early work starts to crumble at this point thanks to Near and his lucky guesses. Mellow and Near are just cheap copy cats that are inferior to L in just about every way - I had to nod in agreement when Light commented that they are nothing to compared to L. No doubt that, given the immense popularity of L, the creator attempted to replicate the success with these new characters. You know those bands that scores a huge hit with their debut single, and follow up with a couple of songs that are really similar to that first hit, but are no where near as good? Well, that's pretty much what Mellow and Near are. Just as those follow up singles often end up being flops, so too does Mellow and Near fall well short of capturing the viewers' imagination in the same way L did. \\n\\n\r\nNot only does the new characters fail to impress, many old characters got worse: I mentioned earlier that Lights seems to get less and less human... well, what I didn't mention back then is that he seems to get more and more stupid too (one of the main causes for the psychological warfare losing it's earlier potency) - maybe mentally duelling with Near's lack of logic caused Light to become more retarded. Meanwhile Misa Misa evolves into Ultra Annoying Misa Misa (I didn't think it was possible for her to get any more annoying, so hats off for achieving this epic feat), and L... err... through no fault of his own, L's image kind of got cheapened by the mere presence of Mellow and Near. Yeah, that's how bad they are.\\n\\n\r\nI guess all my ranting must have made the latter parts of Death Note seem absolute pants. But from a more objective point of view, it isn't. It did not fall much short of being decent even during the weakest points of the series. The series retained its strong dramatisation elements throughout. Epic background music aside, it often cleverly uses subtle sounds to create tension - one of my friends used one for his mobile phone ring tone, and everyone instantly recognised it... it just goes to show how powerful these little things can be. The fantastic use of colours to contrast between the opposing characters is still there, and the awesome artwork, especially the designs for the shinigumis, continues to impress. The disappointment is because the later parts fail to measure up against the lofty standard set by the first - the fact that it felt so bad says more about the utter brilliance of its first arc than anything else. By the sheer merit of the first arc alone, Death Note manages to justify all the hype surrounding it, THAT'S how good it is. If you haven't seen this yet, well, where have you been?!",

            "content": "When an anime leaves you feeling that you have obtained a heightened sense of intelligence after viewing it, you know you have a winner. Death Note is a masterfully crafted cerebral volley that may perhaps change the way you think. \r\nStory: Any good story can spread from a single well defined and provocative plot element, in this case, Death Note. The death note is a notebook, containing a set of rules and blank sheets of paper, which kills any name entered into it. The rules stipulate that with regards to various time restrictions, the person entering the name can also write a cause of deathas well as time and place of death, and other intriguing additions and exclusions. A shinigimi drops his death note on the ground near a school where a boy named Light finds it. From there, the story begins. I knew at this point that the concept had potential for huge success as long as the character controlling the notebook is reasonably complex and intelligent. But Light brought far more to the table than I had imagined. Additionally, the plot element that took me most by surprise was the relationship that developed between Light and his arch nemesis, L. As the story dictates, these two are intellectual geniuses in a league all their own. The \"cat and mouse\" analogy is a good way to describe there battles, yet does not adequately demonstrate the scale of cunning and cleverness utilized in their bouts. Few shows, anime or not, get me in that mood where I absolutely need to keep watching to see what one or the other is going to do next. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the story arguably overstays its welcome. This is both a blessing and a curse. After the climax of the first season, the second season feels a little bit more like an appendage of the first, rather than the second half of a series proper. Fortunately the show is so good that it welcoming to have more Death Note to enjoy. My problems were largely due to the death of a vital character, and the attempt that the story uses to make up for it. But they were minimal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Death Note is good. I would not go as far to say it is excellent, nor would I say that about the manga's artwork. However, the story does not particularly require the background scenery, action sequences, or even characters to be too extravagant. This is a cerebral adventure for the most part. A psychological battle between many minds. Still, the art perfectly captures intense decisive moments in the anime, successfully conveying the appropriate messages to the audiences. Also, we the viewers truly begin to witness darkness settle over Light, and was greatly enhanced through the visual work done in the anime version. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I did not notice the sound to bee too intrusive, which is good. I would not sing its praises either. What it does manage to do is an effective job highlighting certain moods in the anime that need to be conveyed for the audience to pick up on in a nonverbal setting. It never made any mistakes, confusing the tone of the story, getting in the way, or being absent when it should not be. Nonetheless, it was not the best. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This story contains my favorite character in any anime I have seen or manga I have read, \"L\". Along with L, Kira (Light) is almost as equally enthralling, though I'm sure some will make the reverse argument. The entire story line comes to rest on these two's shoulders, and they do not disappoint. I must admit, I am a sucker for intellectual thrillers, but I find it hard to believe that most people would not agree upon the genius behind these two characters. I am partial to L because he is a bit more mysterious, more self-assured, and a little more human than Light. But they are fitting rivals and you may chose which ever side you like. Their methods of solving problems and thinking critically are amazing tools, and may even start getting the audience to look at their every day lives with a wider scope of understanding and reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters for the most part do not play substantial roles in the plot. However there is a subgroup of 4 or 5 characters that remain relevant the whole story. These characters are less structured than Light and L, but they serve purpose to the plot line. One notable character is Light's dad, who also happens to be the Chief of Police, but that subplot did not bore me for too long, and I enjoyed its conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to take a moment to discuss the role of the Shinnigimi in the anime. I very much enjoyed the portrayal of Ryuk, Rem and the other Death gods. They almost have a glow of subtle softness, innocence even, when compared to some of the other characters. They can be used just like everyone else. They identify with the humans enough where we begin to understand them, but ultimately they are Shinnigimi and possess motivations we do not understand. This was a beautiful portrayal in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is my favorite anime / manga series, and nothing has come along in the past couple years to change that yet.",

            "content": "\"I'LL TAKE A POTATO CHIP... AND EAAAT IT!!!\"\r\nAhhh yes. The ever so popular Death Note. To be honest I never understood what people saw in it. I was kinda never able to bring myself to watch it thinking that it was probably boring and dull. Well, I was wrong. \r\nLet's start with the story then. It's simple enough, we have a bored psychopathic high school student (Light Yagami) who finds a notebook (called Death Note). It's not just an average notebook though, oh no. This one can kill a human whose name is written into it. Naturally the first thing I though was great he'sgonna kill everyone. However it turns out that Light is a man of principles and he wants to create a just world by killing criminals across the globe. Joining him is a shinigami by the name of Ryuk. He's a tall intimidating fellow, although he rarely gets involved in Light's matters. Actually the only thing he seems to care about are... apples. And so the duo sets out on a journey to rid the world of evil. The plot picks up from there and gets more and more interesting as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting and there are... phew, dozens of them. I'm not going to discuss each and every individual character because it would take me years to do that. Intead I'll sum up the three main ones. Light, L and Misa. Light, as I mentioned earlier is a high school student but he's not your avergage student. He is a genius, a prodigy. Brought in to capture him is L, another genius with an amazingly fast intellect. He can work out what you're going to say before you even think about it. Then we have Misa, a famous pop celebrity who also happens to posses a death note. She meets Light and finds out that he also has one. She falls in love with him and literally becomes his slave after that. I didn't like that development though. I don't mind a bit of romance and love but Light and Misa's relationship gets extremely repetetive and there is no development there whatsoever. A bit sad, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSound and art are absolutely amazing. I thought the sound was composed by Hans Zimmer himself. It's overly epic. It'll squeeze a few tears out of you, trust me. Art is super epic. It's like Bleach meets Dragon Ball. I never knew writing something in a stupid notebook could look so amazing. The pen becomes an instrument, and the person writing with it is... a composer and the music he creates shakes the entire world, nay, the universe gahhhh! Something like that.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words this is one hell of an epic series that everyone must see. But if you have read this far then you're probably wondering, if I like it so much then why did I give it a rating of 9 and not 10? Well, let me explain then. It's the ending. For an anime of this calibre, the ending is absolutely horrible. I'll be frank - it's crap. When watching the death note I was expecting a more meaningful ending. I don't know, some kinda of a recap on human history, some kinda of a philosphical explanation of  life narrated by the main character or something like that but... nada, the edning is completely meaningless. It will let you down a little, because you've come so far watching the series you'd expect some kind of a reward at the end. But instead of getting a tasty meal, you're left with leftovers. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore I had to lower my score by a point. Death Note is a great anime and deserves its high popularity, however because if its ending it will never be a masterpiece. All that said, I recommend this anime to everyone. It's very interesting and entertaining!",

            "content": "Fan rating: 5/5\r\nCritic Rating: 4/5\r\nOverall rating: 9/10\r\nDeath Note is hard boiled. It's not a mystery, because you know whodunnit. You follow the criminal's perspective. What is an antihero? Is it a hero with villainous qualities or is it just a villain who gets the story told from his viewpoint? Both probably.\r\nI think of Death Note as a study of narcissism induced by brilliance or just being a sociopath. In other words, we sometimes possess traits that by nature alienate us from people, leaving us to live in our own inner worlds. To some, mundanity is the death of the soul. Maybe we are such keenobservers of the human condition that we can't bare to constantly see the subtext of insecurities that plague every day conversation. Maybe we are just so smart we can't stand being around other people's stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nLight is a narcissist. He just is. He looks like everyone else, acts like everyone else, but this is a farce. Most guys like him are never seen for what they truly are.\\n\\n\r\nWe have no choice to believe that Light was born with something missing, that even a boy with a loving family, who grew up comfortable, can just be born wrong. We can't always blame the parents, or even society. Monsters are sometimes just born.\\n\\n\r\nHard boiled supernatural detective story. Light and L begin a game of one-upping that often seems like it's going to break but doesn't. It begins to seem this might be an infinite story. As Light commits his crimes; L puts him in positions that should be impossible,(and unforeseen factors intervene) but Light adapts , his plans becoming more serpentine in the process. Something has to give.\\n\\n\r\nLight's God Complex contrasts with Man's Greed. Light's genius contrasts with L's genius. Light's darkness really does overwhelm any light. Any character who truly seems to solve crimes from a sense of heart, a desire to make the world better, seems quite irrelevant. Only those who coldly see crimes as puzzles cause change. The rest are pawns, serving grand masters.\\n\\n\r\nI debate the second half of the series, and how I feel about the introduction of new characters. That's why I decked a point for the critic rating, but couldn't for the overall. Overall it's still just so perfect to me. Something had to change to justify the series length. Just as I was thinking Light vs. L needed to end, something happened to make the number of episodes make sense. Still, I wasn't rooting for them, and their back story needed more fleshing out for me. I was curious to their connection to a main character. While some may say the characters needed to be cut, I disagree. I think they represent the idea of cycling generations, of how nothing lasts forever and yet everything repeats. They represent how the next generation can build on the work of those that came before them, of how achievement does not often occur in one lifetime but over many. This is life. We all want to change the world, but sometimes we just pave the way for the next person to do so. You may be able to fight one person, but can you fight generations. When you've learned one enemy so thoroughly, how quickly can you adapt to another? You are the same, but your enemy suddenly changes. From a storytelling perspective, it seems these new characters have an unaffair and unearned advantage. But really, don't we all get to take something our ancestor's accomplished for granted?\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the minor episodes was one of the most brilliant case studies in storytelling I had ever seen. When Light needs to get the full name of his next target to keep from getting busted, a ticking clock begins. He has to get her name before she contacts his father. The writing is like something for the stage, written in carefully controlled beats, that ratchets up the tension. No explosions, no big twists, not even a big plot point, just a slow burning pace that left me wondering who I was rooting for.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending wasn't predictable until it happened. That's how engrossed I became. It pushed the proceedings into opera. The detective's great reveal was more than a genre convention; it was a god's lament.",

            "content": "The Suspense Is \"Killing\" Me ~ Can you sign my Death Note?\r\nDeath Note was the first anime that I have watched and from the first episode, I was enticed to watch more. The anime starts off with Yagami Light, A 17 year old student that picks up a notebook named the \"Death Note\". At first he thinks the Death Note's power to kill people is fake, but later finds out that it works. With this new acquisition Yagami Light has the power of god in his grasp, and uses it to kill criminals to make a perfect world without any crime. Killing criminals is okright? Well L Lawliet doesn't think so. L is like a Sherlock Holmes to me, when nobody else can solve the case you go to him to solve it. As the anime progresses L takes on the case and tries to reveal who the killer is while Light tries to find what L's real name is. (in order for Light to kill L he has to know his real name)\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery for Death Note was really impressing because it sets a mood of what the characters are going through and feeling. Speaking of the characters, they were also drawn impressively and according to their personalities. All-in-All the art was good, and gave more sustenance to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's up people? I just had to say that. No joke this is one of the songs from Death Note. The opening and closing songs was another thing that dragged me in and kept me watching more and more. The first opening and closing songs were made by Nightmare, which put a lot of passion into the anime. The second opening and closing songs were more intense, and you ask yourself why the makers of Death Note would switch the music up so drastically. It is a big change but it fits Yagami Light's pursue of making a perfect world and it also gives the anime a darker feeling. Where would Death Note be without the soundtrack? The soundtrack was very important in adding suspense and making the moment just right.\\n\\n\r\nYagami Light and L Lawliet or L however both intelligent are different individuals. Light the protagonist is under serious pressure. If he gets caught and is found out that he is the killer behind all this the penalty will be execution. Light shows different personalities because of this. When by L he is really calm. If he's not calm he will get caught instantly. When writing criminal's names in the Death Note he shows the psychopathic side of himself. Both of his personalities draw \"you\" the watcher in because you don't know if he will crack under pressure or if he will achieve the status of god in his new world without crime. L is a very lovable character because he has a sweet tooth and sits differently than anybody else but all at the same time he wants justice. His personality differs from Light's because of the actions he takes. Light kills and L does not. Light wants justice by killing and L wants justice by finding the killer. Light is more psychotic and L is more pure of heart. These differences bring them together for a battle of wits. The characters of Death Note although I have only explained 2 of them are all well based and planned out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Death Note a 10/10, it\u2019s one of my favorite animes because it has great suspense and it keeps the watchers on the edge of their seat wondering what is going to happen next. One of the best things about Death Note is that it can be a good starting anime for beginners or it can be for experienced anime watchers.  I recommend this anime for any anime watcher out there, Death Note is truly great!\\n",

            "content": "Synopsis:\r\nYagami Light is as perfect a hero as you could imagine--perfect grades, perfect public record, perfect looks--in every facet, his image is squeaky clean. \r\nThis all ends one fateful day when the Shinigami known as Ryuk drops his Death Note out of the realm of the afterlife, into Light's schoolyard. Light stumbles across it and reads the directions: write the name of the person you want dead in the Death Note--with their image in your mind--and they will die in the manner you have specified in this supernatural journal. Otherwise, if the circumstance is not specified in writing, the victim will, within minutes, suffer afatal heart attack. \\n\\n\r\nThinking it a stupid prank initially, Light puts it to the test when saving an innocent woman from being assaulted. To his horror, it works. Could ridding the world of criminals be this easy? \\n\\n\r\nInspired with a new renewed sense of justice, Light indulges himself completely in his newfound power, self-righteously declaring himself the bringer of a new, utopian future-- \\n\\n\r\n--one name at a time.\\n\\n\r\nReview:\\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime of the 2006/2007 Winter season, and perhaps of the new year (Nodame Cantabile, maybe?) Death Note carries story elements and an intellectual integrity that is more commonly seen in your collegeate literary classics than your usual Shounen Jump title.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have the Platonic \"Gyges' Ring\" scenario--in a discourse in Plato's Republic, the integrity of mortal justice is questions and sequentially deemed fundamentally flawed by sinful, finite capacity of man and their deeply ruooted sense of pride and self-righteousness. The lead character Light is the incarnation of this discourse, a once seemingly flawless character driven to obsession over the notion of becoming like a god. At first his intentions are decent--rapists, child molesters, serial killers--deserve to die, right? The world would be better without them, right? But putting such power into the hands of a mortal--as perfect as Light might be--corrupts, as history proves time and again.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying the Death Note is its original owner, the Shinigami Ryuk. Rather than being morally bound to Light or serving as a conscience or guide, Ryuk hangs around simply to be a spectator--proclaiming humans to be \"interesting.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhile this itself makes for an interesting plot, what really makes Death Note a top caliber series are the characters who cause an obstruction to Light's mission. Topping the cast is the fan-favorite L, whose character is just beyond description. A shady, mysterious, but somewhat eccentric genius, L is probably the only mind that could match the scheming Light. The cat-and-mouse power-play between the two young men is enticing and riveting, making you laugh (not for comedy's sake) and keeps you fixed on every frame, soaking in all the details and anticipating the next move. The adorable, yet tragic Misa is another owner of a Death Note, and becomes pathetically infatuated with Light and obediently does his bidding, while at the same time threatening his immunity to the task force tracking him down.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just within the first ten episodes or so. This series is simple enough for anyone to understand, but at the same time deep enough and clever enough for those looking for something really meaty to sink their teeth into. Additionally, this series offers something that not many other series do--a moral conundrum. What if we had a Death Note? Would we use it? How would we use it? Is it possible to use it without turning into what Light becomes? \\n\\n\r\nIts production values leave me with nothing to complain about. A top-selling series like Death Note, like Nana and other popular manga titles, have an obligation to its fans to give them something that is quality work. The animation is smooth, the character designs are loyal and really bring life to the characters. The music is fantastic, and some of anime's top seiyuu are among the cast, including Miyano Mamoru (Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club) as Light, Yamaguchi Kappei (Inuyasha from Inuyasha) as L, and Hirano Aya (Haruhi from The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) as Misa. You really cannot go wrong with this series. And this is coming from a Christian--I am not at all offended by this series, it is a fantastic philosophical and theological scenario.\\n\\n\r\nHow about looking at this series as social commentary? Any side of the political spectrum or anyone with any kind of religious affiliation can find hot topic issues that make for excellent discussion. This is a series that will make you think. It's more than just passive entertainment, though it is just what you make it. That's the beauty of Death Note. And fortunately, it shines bright through the ugliness that is undoubtedly to come to its characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I'll Take A Potato Chip... AND EAT IT!\" -Light Yagami\r\nThe 2006 Psychological-Thriller anime and the top 32 of the best animes in MyAnimeList, Death Note, is no exception and by far, the horrific masterpiece of the 21st century. Unlike any Detective, mystery animes out there like \"Detective Conan\", Death Note is the one who can make you going at the edge of your seat. It has tons of plot twists, the chase between good and evil is fantastic, logics and puzzles surrounding the story, and other good stuffs surrounds here. This is the darkest anime that I've seen thus far, and that's why, until now,this anime is still circulating the pop-culture today.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nThe story starts with the man named Light Yagami, a 17 High School Senior who is smart and intelligent and popular to women due to his looks. But, according to Light, he is already bored on his current situation right now, including his life, his school and even the world. Then, when he saw a notebook falls to the ground, he gets suspicious and tested it on his own hands whether this notebook is true or not. And when he use it, it was a surprise that the first guy who wrote on his Death Note dies of a heart attack, at first, it was a coincidence, but when he uses it on the second time because the group of thugs were sexually aroused by the innocent woman, one of the thugs dies. And with that, he is now currently trying to kill every single one of the criminals in Japan in order to restore the \"Justice\" in his own hands with his fellow Shinigami named \"Ryuk\", naming himself by the codename \"Kira\". But, when the mysterious detective named \"L\" interested about Light's mysterious killing behind the scenes, Light gladly accepts the challenge from L and the fight is on for who will get the right to fight for justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe tensions is the best in my opinion when a detective named \"L\" was been introduced to stop Light, AKA, Kira, from killing every single one of the criminals around Japan. Then, things are about to get a little bit interesting when Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, is a Bureau Chief of the police department and now L's Deputy Director. But, Light is also smart and intelligent in many ways, so in order to prevent L's for suspecting him that he is Kira, he do many preventable ways in order to keeping out of the limelight from L. There are so many things that I could say, this is very fantastic and smart. It was great, full of surprises, so many plot twists, and secrets behind Light's shadow as Kira. Everything in this anime is the icing of the cake with the cherry on top. Including some Logic and puzzles that could make you think what will happen next is really keeps me on the edge of my seat. And It was very fantastic to see those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, because of Light, there are no happy endings, I assure you, he's the enemy of the state, so there's no such thing as \"The Bad Guy Wins And The Story Ends\" cliche. If there was an anime that has that cliche, Death Note has not. It was good, And bad in both ways. Why? Good because the bad guy dies, Bad because of the story's ending. And like everyone around the internet who watched this anime, this explanation fron \"Knight_Sentinel\" from fanpop.com has a good explaination, and according to him:\\n\\n\r\n\"For one thing, I never really liked Near or Mello, I always felt they were pale imitations of L. Near didn't really outwit Light he just got lucky because of Mikami's mistake. If Light had to lose, it should have been to L and it should have been because of some clever trick not sheer luck. Secondly, given how original the anime had been to that point, the issues it had raised such as questioning what was right or wrong I expected something better than the standard cliched \"good guys beat the bad guys\" ending. Light did do a lot of questionable things(as most great figures in history have done) but he was trying to create a better world and it would have been interesting and in keeping with the highly original spirit of the anime to see him win.\"\\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, the story is great, the only thing that it was criticized about is the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDue to it's graphical nature and it's violence, the art and animation performed well in this anime. But the only animation that really caught my eye is the first opening sequence of Death Note, where Light depicted as the false god and the \"Pieta\" depiction of Raye Penber and his fiancee Naome Misura.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI've watched the English Dub Version of this anime, and the thing is, it was great actually from Light, to Ryuk, to L and others. All of the voice actors is the best in this English dub version. And as for the background music, it was a tense and gives me a lot of goosebumps in every single one of the episodes out there. And as for the OSTs, the only two themes that I like are the songs, \"What's up People\" and \"Zetsubou Billy\" from the Japanese metal band, \"Maximum The Hormone\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFrom Light's Anti-hero character to L. There are a lot of character development around here, and the characters here are perfect. I have nothing to say in this character section. So, it is a job well done for these characters here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime will always get you at the edge of your seat, it will gave you thrills and suspense about it and the revelations about who is owners of the Death Note and the purpose of this if somebody takes control of this diabolical notebook. So it is a job well done to MadHouse Entertainment and Tetsurou Araki (currently director of \"Attack on Titan\") for doing this wonderful work. The anime is great and it is the best anime of the 21st century because of the famous \"Death Note\" Notebook that circulating around the web. Including the important rule of Death Note is \"The Human whose name is written in this note shall die. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in mind when writing his/her name. This is to prevent people who share the same name from being affected.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict for this anime is a 9/10. The main bummer here is the ending of the story, that looks like it was in a hurry to quickly air the final episode. To be honest, it was good if MadHouse just told the fans to calmly wait for the final episode in order to set those things right. But anyways, 9/10 is enough to see this anime a well-done performance from MadHouse. It was fantastic!\\n\\n\r\nAnd I have the moral lesson of this story, and that was: \"Any gift or power can be used for good or evil, abused or praised, it's not destiny that controls those actions, it's our decisions.\"",

            "content": "Ah yes, Death Note. One of the few anime that I could understand that hyped. The popularity of this anime is not surprising, although I consider it's quality below that of the manga, which in many respects is better then the anime.\r\nWhat does surprise my about the popularity of this anime is the willingness and the amount of people that throw themselves over it, and the readiness to call this the best anime ever made.\r\nI'll agree that this is one of the better anime of recent years, and it's obvious that it's quite good, it even spawned a couple of similar anime (Code Geass comesto mind). However that's not to say that it's without faults, and the same goes for the manga, which has pretty much those same faults.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with the story is that the writer wanted to make it complex, and I do like what he did with it. It included some nice ideas like \"Doublethink\" (Read 1984 by George Orwell for what that means, and I really recommend that book. It's even clear to me that Tsugumi Ohba took some inspiration from 1984 and Brave New World) and had some good amount of plots within plots. However the story severely suffers when the complexity increases, even to the point that it becomes confusing of what happened with the story because of the overcomplexity of the story telling and all the plots going on. That doesn't quite happen with Death Note but it gets close to that at times.\\n\r\nAnother problem lies with the characters. Several of the main characters are given a beyond human intelligence, this causes several problems.\\n\r\nOne is that most of them appear as smug, arrogant, self-centred twats, which makes it hard to identify with the characters and at times completely propels the viewer out of the story.\\n\r\nA second problem is that at times the characters seem to posses information and knowledge that they couldn't and shouldn't know or have obtained. A good couple of actions couldn't have been taken unless the character taking them knew what another character is doing at that time or will do sometime in the future. Of course you can predict that someone could take that action but that takes an extreme amount of knowledge about that character and the circumstances that take place at that time. It's practically impossible to do that unless you can see the future or have read the script. This again caused me to fail to identify with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, let's get down to my scores.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is well written and well presented, it has a lot of depth and many unique items that have rarely been explored in anime, like the moral problem of having a villain type character as the main character.\\n\r\nIt however suffers from the afore mentioned problems of going the route of over-complexity and illogical actions of the characters that they couldn't have taken without knowledge of future events.\\n\r\nHowever, all in all the story is very good and the issues presented in it are quite gripping.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe artwork is of a very high standard, very fitting with the anime and the type of story. There is hardly anything that I can comment on it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nFitting with the moods, clear and good choice of voice-actors.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nAs said earlier, the super-human intelligence of the main characters are a major drawback on the whole experience. Another point is that the supporting cast is almost completely 2 dimensional, they have hardly any character development and can at most times be interchangeable, they just needed a character to take a certain action at a certain time and at most times it doesn't really matter which character takes that action. This causes the supporting casts to completely lack any depth since they are mostly there as puppets used for story progression.\\n\r\nMisa is especially annoying and useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nEven with all the above problems the anime is highly enjoyable and can easily draw in most viewers, even though it sometimes catapults them out of the story by inexplicable actions of the characters or downright stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI'd have to say that even with the problems it's still is a very good anime, and among my favourites of recent years.\\n\r\nA well presented story that has a good pace and hardly any fillers.\\n\r\nNice take on morality and a good psychological detective story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite good, even though it has some faults, but then again, hardly anything is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful. That way I can improve my reviews to make them better in the future.\\n\r\nThank you in advance.",

The plot is great, and there are so many unexpected twists and turns in the anime. It's got an over all dark atmosphere but if you ask me there are a few funny moments in there too. Not to mention the graphics are great.  I highly recommend this to anyone no matter what your tastes in anime are.",

I'm one of those people who hate Death Note because of it's potential to become a masterpiece but fell flat on it's face.\r\nI'm disappointed in Death Note because at first it was just simply amazing and cunning. Light the Main character was doing risky things at all turns and I never knew what would happen next. It had me on the edge of my seat with a bag of popcorn and full attention. The Opening and Ending was simply amazing as well. Everything seemed to be going gooduntil about half way in. The story started to just become horrible in my opinion and things didn't seem to make sense. I won't spoil anything but to me it seemed as though the writers got lazy and stopped caring.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly should have just dropped Death Note at that point but I kept watching for some reason.

            "content": "There is hardly any anime enthusiast who hasn\u2019t seen Death Note and it has more than enough spoiler-less reviews. But what I feel the need of for this anime is a full fledged analysis of its accomplishments. And so, here I am trying to do that very thing. And since I\u2019m going to have to point out several significant plot points and twists as examples, this review-esque prose will contain heavy amount of spoilers. If you\u2019re one of those who haven\u2019t yet seen the anime, I suggest doing so before reading this.\r\nA HUGE SPOILER ALERT!! AGAIN, JUST IN CASE\r\nDeath Note is mostly popular for itsthrills and moral ambiguity which are apparent to superficial views. But the anime has much more thematic execution than what meets the casual eyes. Having a brilliant and multilayered exploration of \u2018Justice\u2019, stagnation vs hypocrisy, commentaries on religion, society and so much more, Death Note is a densely packed thematic piece. Let\u2019s dive into the elaboration on how it explores these topics.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a common complaint about Death Note that the anime forces ideals through the viewers\u2019 throats. But the anime actually does nothing of that sort. It rather beholds many ideals through its characters to study those ideologies and evaluate them. It showcases the fallacies in their senses of justice. Light tries to rid the world of evil by becoming a murderer who kills bad people, L tries to stop Kira using some underhanded methods, Near cheats as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime compares between conflicting ideals to choose what is better. Light may be a hypocrite, but his hypocrisy is actually cleansing the world which is evident from the 70% drop in crime rate and the complete halt of wars. L, with his own sense of justice pursues Light/Kira using suspicious budget and unorthodox methods, which is hypocritical as well. L succeeded to close in on him until he tried having a criminal use the notebook in order to confirm the \u201913 Days\u2019 rule. He pushed too far with his hypocrisy with this and the world couldn\u2019t allow such hypocrisy overtake the one that is improving the world; and thus he was gotten rid of in episode 25, right before he could execute his plan.\\n\\n\r\nHaving defeated the greatest detective in the world, Light\u2019s megalomania and God-complex grew bigger and he became more conceited. He had planned from the beginning to force people into doing good deeds with threats, but he was sure to do it after his final confrontation with Near. If he won, he\u2019d have no one to stop him from forcing his ideals onto the world. This time, Light\u2019s ideal was more dangerous than it was beneficial to the world and so the world decided that it\u2019s better without him anymore. Thus, even though Near\u2019s hypocrisy was even bigger than L\u2019s, he defeated Kira, using that very hypocritical strategy.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last encounter of Near and Light, Near cheated by using the real notebook himself. When he found the notebook Mikami had hidden thanks to Mello\u2019s sacrifice, he used it in order to keep Mikami\u2019s actions restricted in the final encounter. By writing Mikami\u2019s name on the real notebook, he had him bring the fake notebook that Mikami made himself. Near lied when he said that Giovanni made a complete replica in a single night and it was quite obvious (as if anyone can perfectly replicate the whole notebook with all the names and death conditions in one night). There are more proofs for this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to read through the thorough explanation of this particular point (which is gonna be BIG), you can skip through to the sign I put up in capital letters to indicate the end of the explanation.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://animetropolisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/output_bxmgrn.gif?w=1000\\n\\n\r\nIf you carefully notice in that^ gif, when Near showed Light that Mikami also wrote Takada\u2019s name in the note, he (Near) used the notebook Mikami brought with himself, evident from the names of task force and SPK members. But he also claimed that the notebook is completely fake. So why would he show the notebook he himself claimed to be fake? Near carefully avoided opening the real notebook because Mikami\u2019s name was written in it and he couldn\u2019t risk the task force members seeing that for obvious reasons. This brings up the next question.\\n\\n\r\nWhy didn\u2019t Near just write Mikami\u2019s name and death condition on a piece of the notebook? The anime provides an answer for that as well. We see that Near asked Ryuk in the end if writing a name on a scattered piece of the notebook works or not. In other words, he wasn\u2019t sure whether doing that would serve his purpose or not. And he obviously couldn\u2019t take a risk on such an important event, therefore, wrote Mikami\u2019s name and specifics of death inside the real notebook instead of a torn piece of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of torn pieces, there is a complaint I used to have against Death Note\u2019s ending. Why didn\u2019t Light just suggest Mikami to keep a hidden piece like he does himself, only to use it for this final encounter? This complaint was resolved once I found out about Near\u2019s cheating and realized that he actually did suggest Mikami to do that. But as Mikami was restricted due to Near using the notebook, he played according to Near\u2019s scenario instead of Light's and used the fake notebook instead of the hidden piece. This possibility of a hidden piece is another reason why Near had to cheat in order to ensure his survival and victory.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t have any concrete proof of the existence of such hidden piece, it does make a lot of sense this way and Light\u2019s behavior backs up this argument. When he saw that nobody died and got exposed, Light first thought of the possibility that Mikami might have betrayed him, which is only possible if there was a hidden piece that Mikami didn\u2019t use. Later on, Light was screaming at Mikami to write down everyone\u2019s name even though he (Mikami) was already caught. While this was shown like a desperate scream of someone who lost his composure, it\u2019s actually him ordering Mikami to use the hidden piece because there was still a chance since Mikami\u2019s hidden piece wasn\u2019t discovered yet. Light trying to write Near\u2019s name right before that acts as an appropriate foreshadowing of it.\\n\\n\r\nNear using the notebook is nothing out of the blue. He previously did propose that he\u2019d be willing to write names in the notebook to test the rules, so it\u2019s not surprising that he did it in the final confrontation. Mikami\u2019s behavior was also weird and out of character, thus supporting the possibility of Near\u2019s cheating further. For Near, it was a last minute call that he had to make, or they\u2019d be completely defeated. After getting his hands on the notebook thanks to Mello\u2019s efforts, he couldn\u2019t overlook the possibility that a hidden piece could be functional and so had to cheat and restrict Mikami in order to ensure Kira\u2019s fall.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see Misa Amane standing on the edge of a high building\u2019s roof in the very end, clearly giving a sign of an upcoming suicide and her body language pretty much confirms it. While it\u2019s quite possible that she committed suicide after knowing of Lights\u2019s demise, her death can very well be Near\u2019s work. But as we know that she had forfeited the ownership and all, so why would she have to die? Well, while it is true that Near isn\u2019t sure about that and had to make sure that Kira is gone for good, there\u2019s another strong reason.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t sure if she could be useful to Light in the final encounter, but the possibility isn\u2019t zero. Then I came across this interesting video, which provides a pretty interesting theory regarding how Light could\u2019ve come out victorious in the final battle. While I don\u2019t agree with the context of the video, it gave me a new field for thinking. It's NEARly impossible to summarize the video here because I still have lots of other things to talk about. So I'll just link it here and I hope that the moderators would be kind enough to allow this for the sake of articulation.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/_j58ZQSf1vA\\n\\n\r\nNow, the reason I don\u2019t agree with this video is because it assumes that Light didn\u2019t actually make that plan (and I honestly don\u2019t blame the one who made the video for that, considering how subtle the anime is). While I don\u2019t know if the writers of the series had this plan in mind, but Light just might\u2019ve made that plan and act accordingly. And that is why restraining Misa Amane by using the notebook was a must. With that being done, there is now no way that Light\u2019s plan will be executed. It makes perfect sense this way and has enough hints as evidences to back it up, therefore I like to think that my interpretation is correct.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE EXPLANATION OF DEATH NOTE'S ENDING. WE CAN TAKE IT SLOW NOW xd\\n\\n\r\nIn case you forgot what we were initially doing with this explanation, we were looking up Near's hypocrisy and its importance. Death Note judged Near's hypocritical course of action to be better for its world than Light's since he became too megalomaniac. While it's quite obvious that defeat in this anime means rejection and victory means acceptance, the anime also provides direct evidence of this. The task force members were discussing whether Kira really is evil or justice in the latter part of the story, where Light said, \"if Kira wins, he's justice. And if he loses and gets caught, he's evil\". While this statement is a fantastic commentary on how the world works, it also proves that success means acceptance; and I love how it's perfectly harmonized with the narrative flow.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we get to the main thematic punch of the show, let's look at another way DN takes to explore the theme, through the deconstruction of \u2018Religion\u2019. It applies the basics of the idea of \u2018Religion\u2019 like the dogma, the ideal, the Messiah (Kira), the punishment for breaking principles (death in different ways), Messiah\u2019s miracle (the notebook) and even the Messenger Angel (with black wings) who brings the Messiah the news of his selection; in its own way to fit in the setting. But they\u2019re applied in a manner that extracts a different coherent essence from these elements that ultimately weaves into a different context, which makes this anime a successful deconstruction in essence. But that would all be pointless if it didn\u2019t bear commentaries on how fear is an asset used for strengthening religions. The deconstruction could also have been my mere overthinking if there weren\u2019t appropriately used symbolism and religious imagery connecting to the idea of religion, which confirms the intention of said deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\nBy going through all these, Death Note shows us that true justice doesn't exist and therefore every ideals of justice is filled with hypocrisy. But even so, the anime accepts them because these hypocritical justice is still better than leaving the world be. It tells us that a functioning hypocrisy is better than stagnant sincerity. Or so it seemed until the last episode where it turns the table. By having Light defeated, Death Note returns its world to its previous free form (except the world is much cleaner now).\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note, embodying \u2018utilitarianism\u2019, doesn\u2019t side with any ideal but rather chooses what\u2019s best for its world. And it tells us that stagnation can be the better choice as well, depending on the situation. What Death Note encourages, however, is having one\u2019s own sense of justice, as every other characters had displayed throughout the anime. The ending where Aizawa and the rest rejected Near\u2019s ways of doing things, and chased after Light as he tried to run away, that moment sealed the final deal. It culminates the entirety of Death Note\u2019s thematic journey.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note's story executes these thematic punches as if there's some entity or system that is evaluating the characters' ideals and overseeing the entire process. As if the anime has a consciousness of itself. A consciousness that controls what happens in the world, a true God. The anime is shown from the perspective of such entity and that's why the series has such overwhelming atmosphere all through. It's as if the consciousness is watching everything from the perspective that seems the most intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we viewers watch the anime through this perspective. In a sense, the anime is inviting us to be the judge of what this anime provides. It's also along the line of Death Note's main theme, having our own sense of judgement through considering the merits and demerits. Rather than forcing ideals through viewers' throats, this anime encourages to have our own, so I found the complaint I addressed earlier to be quite misleading. The theme is quite intricately explored throughout the series little by little.\\n\\n\r\nBut even after all these, I can't call Death Note just a theme driven story. It is both theme driven and plot driven. Death Note's story is never influenced by a deus ex machina device, but rather flows in its own stream. Each point of the story has a buildup and proper transition from its previous incidents. Even the most insignificant details are properly set.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Light meeting Naomi Misora in the police station when she was trying to get through to L may seem a bit too convenient. But it actually follows up the earlier events perfectly. Light needed to go to the station for gathering information on how the task force is reacting to the 12 FBI agents getting killed. And his father couldn't come home because of that incident as it made things complicated. So Light went there in the pretense of bringing him a change of clothes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Naomi Misora was there because her fiance was one of the 12 agents. The timing makes complete sense as she also took some time to investigate things and coming to the conclusion. Also it's not like she just went there exactly when Light went. By her conversation with the receptionist, it's obvious she's been bargaining for a meetup for quite a while. So even calling that convenient would be stretching it way too far and every other shows would be so much more guilty of plot contrivances.\\n\\n\r\nThat was just one example from the top of my head. Every bit of the anime is well thought to such degree. What makes it especially great is the fact that it's constantly climactic, which is quite daring and rare. Death Note is masterful at creating critical situations. There are several key moments and ingenious twists in every episode, making it a fast paced enticing experience all through.\\n\\n\r\nIts play of inevitability is one of the best in all of storytelling medium, as the story's situations are always so critical that the characters must choose the best or the second best plausible option because once chosen, there's no going back in the path. Loopholes in the supernatural rules, technical advantages, political power, using all kinds of resources they have, the characters in this anime proceed with the best or the second best course of actions available to them, in order to defeat the other and win. These tactics are clearly explained through either proper dialogues or subtle visual exposition. While those tactics are mostly unprecedented, logical and ingenious, the few strategies that were already on the table were modified and handled in a clever way in order to adapt to the anime\u2019s situations. It provides the two absolute best tactical showdown I've seen including the ending one that I explained earlier in this essay (the other one being the confinement strategy).\\n\\n\r\nWhile the value of the writing is already one of the highest, it becomes unrivaled due to how coherent it is to the theme. There are many routes for the story to follow and picking one of them while closing off the rest without any inconsistency and contrivance  is a challenging task itself. But Death Note elevates that challenge by several times by having the story follow a specific theme and executing it with absolutely masterful crafting. The brilliant handling of the characters' information/knowledge, improvising and strategies works so well for the theme but is never forced or manipulated in any way. There are cases where things don't always go as planned due to accidents or mistakes, but they're never contrived and they feel very natural when they happen.\\n\r\nIt's really perplexing how it does all these with proper transition from one point to the other.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a concisely stylized piece with expositions making even some silly parts look cool, but those silliness hold some serious points underneath. For example, that \"I'll take a potato chip and EAT IT!\" part was stylized as such because Light really was using the chips as a cover while skillfully beating L's surveillance system. One of the things that makes Death Note so constantly exciting is the fact that it chooses not to give much screen-time to unnecessary and boring points. For example, Light's decision to use the notebook actually took several days of consideration which is shown through some quick shots of him thinking about it and reaching enlightenment. Another example of this is when Near picks Mikami out of all the videos of Kira related programs, which may seem too contrived and fast while in actuality, the shot composition clearly implies that he gave a lot of time going through all the tapes before realizing that Mikami, the perfect choice for X-Kira appears in so many places.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has some very good use of metaphors and symbolism throughout. One of them being the lights, which is used for capturing the enlightenment I just mentioned along with some more in several other places. I literally wrote a whole article about some more visual and narrative cues from this anime in my blog. These fill up the holes in the story and the characterization. Coupled with the narrative perspective I mentioned regarding the atmosphere, these make the narrative and visual style of Death Note one of the top tier I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime where deaths, murders and police works are the main focus, people often tend to overlook some really striking emotional moments when talking about Death Note. Souichiro's last moments, the moments before Light's death, L's death, Naomi Misora's death are some of the obvious emotional moments, but parts like Aizawa's emotional crisis after leaving the investigation team, L having Light spill out why he seems suspicious from L's perspective, that foot massage, those moments on the roof, Aizawa and Ide appearing to assist the arrest of Higuchi, Light's defeat to Mello's gang, etc. were some strikingly emotional moments as well. The whole show was thoroughly impacting if we include the exciting points. The minimal exposition of emotions most of the time makes those few focused moments much more valuable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I said so far covers parts of Death Note's characterization. Each characters have enough consistent character traits and act human. They all show a wide range of actions and interactions while never betraying their character writing. There were subtle little developments to the characters which wasn't quite too much, and it makes sense since they're mostly grown ups and people don't quite change much. Light Yagami had the most development as he got more and more megalomaniac.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the characters have though, are fantastic interactions and mutual influence on each others. \u201cAlso, as soon as I said we knew he was in Kanto region, in defiance he made sure that his next victims came from within Japan, as if to say \u2018what are you gonna do about it?'\u201d- this explanation by L highlights how L and Kira were having such intriguing interactions before they even met each other. The development of their interaction is consistent and well written, which, while being a cat and mouse chase at the surface, has considerable psychological depth in its encounters.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, the characters of Death Note is not one of its stronger points. Madhouse did brilliant job with the production of the anime. Stunning visuals is accompanied well by one of the best sets of soundtracks in anime. One of Death Note's most impressive aspects is how it connects every one of its accomplishments with each other. The story writing, themes and characters are directly connected to each other, the theme connects to the narrative perspective which in turns connects to the atmosphere, which is also connected with the story's climax.\\n\\n\r\nIt's done so skillfully that the coherence itself becomes a godly feat of this anime. The directing is solid across the board, with some transcending directing choices. The clash of ideals is phenomenal. It has a stellar supernatural lore with perfect rules for the usage of the notebook. Every aspect of it is induced to make it more enjoyable, enthralling and ecstatically overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has some more really good feats but let's stop now, since we've already had enough. There are 10 works of storytelling medium I've come across that deserve 10/10 in my opinion and Death Note is one of them due to all these excellent feats. It's also one of my top 3 personally favorite anime. I'm thoroughly impressed by how ingeniously it handles everything. I consider Death Note to be one of the most intelligent pieces of storytelling medium if not the most intelligent. Among what I've seen so far, that is.",

Death Note plants multiple different emotions into your head and leaves you completely aghast by the end of it. I personally experienced many different feelings varying from, excitement, intensity, amazement, shock, sadness, pity and countless others. Although the story seems to have a pretty dull summary, Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata (creators of Death Note) constantly make you ask yourself another question and leave you begging for more. I enjoyed the show because of the intense catand mouse chase between two highly intelligent geniuses, the constant thrills during the show and the ending that left me at a loss for words and made me ask myself a hundred different questions. If you are reading this and still haven't seen Death Note I highly recommend you do, trust me you will not regret it.",

            "content": "Death Note will always have a special place in my heart, not only for nostalgia sake, but because i genuinely enjoyed it and one of the few animes that got me into anime. Now the Review.\r\nStory:\r\nIn simple terms it's somewhat of a chance between L and Light Yagami and who can outwit the other, putting each other to the test to eliminate one another. Kira (Light) wanting to be \"god of the new world\", while L sees him as a delusional teenager, who thinks he's a \"god\" but in reality just a criminal. Also they both hate to loose.\r\nI will say tho the first halfwas better than the second half, won't say why, watch and find out, but overall great story telling that keeps you on your toes and gets you invested.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow Death Note has some questionable frames that you've probably seen on the internet. But overall its fluid and easy to watch. Great detail on the characters and atmosphere. Also does a good job of portraying a \"dark\" mood when it needs, as well as internal thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nGreat VA for Light and L, BOTH english and Japanese. Banger openings throughout the series, especially OP 1 if you're into \"heavy\" music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYou're either on L's side and his sense of justice or Light Yagami. Or maybe you can't choose like when i first completed the series. Light and L are both very well fleshed out characters, similar too if you look deeper into them. As well as other supporting characters were good/fun to watch. Oh and how could i forget my Apple loving Shinigami, a weird folk to say the least but he is also enjoyable to see throughout the series, though it seems that he would be on light's \"side\" he really isn't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'd say there's a lot to enjoy here from the interaction and fued between L and Light to the story itself and how it's a mystery/Thriller done so well. As well as explores the physiological side of things from L and Lights sense of Justice. I really recommend this to newbies of anime, since like i once was you may see anime as this loli/ moe infested medium, which to a degree is lol, but great recommendation for Death Note. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Well here it goes, my first anime review. And what better way to start than with a series I hold very high in regards to my anime viewing experience. Yes, Death Note is definitely one of those shows that most people can get into (whether they are a seasoned anime viewer or not) with quiet ease. This is a show that you can probably convince some of your \"normal\" friends to sit down and watch without explaining too much before hand. I believe it's this accessibility that garners the respect it has in most anime viewers eyes. At its core it is a very cut-and-dry,good vs. evil story, something that many people enjoy in storytelling. Its not to say that every single person who watches it will enjoy it, (the theme of death definitely won't sit well with more sensitive viewers) but I'd be hard pressed to find any of the people I've recommended it to that come back disappointed after viewing it. It's definitely one of the few shows where the premise is actually upheld by the plot quiet nicely. Be for warned, this show does have an addiction factor to it, you'll probably want to move on to next episode as soon as the previous is finished. Now for a quick breakdown of the specs:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the show does have a very cut-and-dry, good vs. evil plot. You've got two main players: Light Yagami and L, and they are in an all out battle of the wits. There is a definite back-and-forth to their battle, each exchanging blows, one after another. This makes for a entertaining cat and mouse game for the series that I think many find appealing. But then the second arc starts, and something gets \"lost\" in between. Its not to say that the second arc doesn't have the same cat and mouse dynamic to it, but game definitely changes. However, it all comes together for what I consider a suitable end for the series. Overall its a great story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI feel like when it first came out, the art was pretty decent for the time. But it's not anything that people haven't seen before. They setting is mostly city scape anyway, so if you like looking at buildings I guess you'll have a hay day. It's not incredible, but not entirely crap either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOh boy does Death Note have a good sound track! I remember downloading lots of the music to my Ipod after watching this. The opening and ending songs are great! (The second opening being one of my favourites) The music definitely does its job setting the tone for the series\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nIf there is one part of this show that hits the nail on the head, it's characters. Every single character in this show is memorable, each with a personality different from the next. Hell, one of the best characters in this show (Matt) has almost no lines and probably has fans galore! The interactions between characters provide some of the best dialogue I've ever seen in anime. At the end of the day, characters are at the very heart of any show, and Death Note treats its cast like real people.\\n\\n\r\n~ Final Thoughts ~\\n\r\nDeath Note is a spectacular anime, whether you like it or not. I will admit, the second half is alot different from the first, but the overall experience is enjoyable. If you looking for a show to get friends into anime, this one is a gateway drug. A definite recommendation for anybody who wants see anime at some of its best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\n~}Out like a Scout{~",

            "content": "Story: 9/10. What i love about this anime is the utter mindfuck. This anime is unlike any other i have watched so far and that because its story and characters are highly unpredictable. This anime will definitely blow your mind with its complexity in the little details most people would fail to pick up immediately and the plot twists. One drawback i was able to spot (hence 9/10) is the fact that in one point the outcome felt forced. What i mean by that? Our main rivals were locked into a stalemate battle that dragged long. I believe the writer had to push things andmake an outcome. An other thing is that i was a little bit slightly disappointed by the ending. But that's ok. Nothing can be 100% perfect in this life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10. Some of the best characters ever in anime. Kira and L are some of the biggest rivals ever existed in all anime and any show. They are both interesting, intelligent, perceptive and cunning. Ryuk is a troll but he is enjoyable. Misa is purposely dumb but that's kind of cute in its own way plus she is being voiced by one of the best female voice actors there is. Apart from the main 4, there are many other introduced characters. Some of them don't stay long in the show but i didn't find even one of them boring.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10. All characters are excellently voiced and everything is perfectly executed. Soundtrack is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10. There was no moment of boredom i can recall. There was no episode without important things happening in it. Plot twists and exciting story elements everywhere combined with well fit music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10 I would recommend this anime to EVERYONE. Even people who don't even watch anime.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, I got a whole lot of stuff to say about \"Death Note\".\r\nUnfortunately, for the folks who actually liked this anime, I disliked it to the point of dropping it at episode 8. I realize this is usually a no-no; but there is no way I'm going to sit through drivel for 15 hours, after hating it for 3 hours already.\r\nFirst I want to talk about the stuff that was actually quite good.\r\nThe dialog is written well, and performed above average.\r\nAnd the artwork is above average.\r\nMost of the characters did not disturb me too much, including the character named L Lawliet. While many didn'tlike many of the characters; for me, most of the characters were something all too rare. \\n\\n\r\nTrue to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNext I want to unload on this thing about some minor problems and then get to why I really, really, really; learned to dislike the whole idea from an early point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, all of the music's awful. I like a nice tune. If the song has lyrics; I appreciate them sang with some knowledge of that art. None of that is in evidence.\\n\\n\r\nNext, while the dialog is very important to the creation and the development of the story; most of the time it takes up the same space as the background narration in a 1940's crime drama. Yuch!\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the main reason for why I hate this thing. Light Yagami, makes a lot of mistakes. Not only of the logical and rational kind; but he even lies to himself.\\n\\n\r\n1). Does he not abuse his 'Death Note'?\\n\r\n2). Does he not kill innocent people, in direct contradiction of his own stated principles?\\n\r\n3). Does he not kill innocents in order to throw suspicion away from himself?\\n\r\n4). Does he not turn the whole adventure away from his own stated goals of being a God on Earth, by delivering an ethically wholesome world; into a contest that ultimately makes of himself the very monster he decries?\\n\\n\r\nThese few are just the beginnings of this numbskull's hideous lack of deductive reasoning skills. How anyone can consider this fellow anything but the dumbest 'smart guy' in the room is beyond my ability to fathom.\\n\\n\r\nHe can be forgiven for the initial attempt to find him by \"L\", and that was to broadcast a news story that only got transmitted in Light's own city.\\n\\n\r\nBut killing the FBI agent Raye Penber after Light actually finds out the Raye has ended his own investigation and is going to close the case without pointing fingers at Light, is bluntly inexcusable. An incredible blunder, which would be and is, the cause of another 5 episodes at least, in order for Light to figure out how to salve the minds of at least a dozen people, and steer their concentration in another direction. The tragedy here is that if Light left Penber alone, half of the story would have not been necessary, and \"L\" would have been left with nowhere to go.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Light had a terrific opportunity he didn't even use (and couldn't after killing Penber); and that was to use the Internet and look up the official website for the FBI; and then take note of the pictures and names of the top 5 people that run the place; and then execute them. The FBI would have withdrawn from the case within hours, yanked all their personnel without warning; and left \"L\" wondering what the hell happened. Since most of those people probably were not nice people anyway, Light could have held on to his moral authority awhile longer. He became his own worst monster, by his own definition; because he would rather take up the contest with \"L\". Contesting with \"L\" was so much more fun, lives became so secondary.\\n\\n\r\nNot a great reason to lose one's own conscience.\\n\\n\r\nI am sick of thinking about \"Death Note\", and I want the World to know why I dislike it so much. It is NOT a bad show, as a piece of entertainment. But I cannot stomach a stupid idiot being presented by the show itself, and by other viewers; as some kind of great thinker.\\n\\n\r\nHe's not a smart guy. The viewers are much smarter than Light Yagami. All of you are.\\n\\n\r\nI give this thing a solid 6. If the art/sound was below par, Death Note would have received a 'never-before-used' 3 from me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The story is fantastic. There are flaws in the logic, but they aren't glaring enough to detract from suspension of disbelief or overall enjoyment. \r\nThe first arc (episodes 1 - 26) is the best, it does a great job setting up the rules, and hooking the viewer. The plans, plots, and mind games are all brilliant. They did an excellent job executing the scenes, character reactions, etc. Everything felt natural.\r\nHowever, the second arc (27 - 37) was not as good. The most glaring issue, in particular, was the terrible character development. One is an angsty teenager / I have a dark and tortured past cliche,the other is a boring androgynous copy/paste of L, that actively insists the thing that L only passively theorized without ever explaining her (?) reasoning, only \"I have access to L's case files\". It doesn't make sense because earlier on, all of that data was deleted in a tragic accident. It's weak. It doesn't have the same gripping suspense and charm as the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the second arc isn't nearly as enjoyable as the first, it does have some very good suspense at times, and a strong, satisfying ending that I am perfectly happy with. If you have seen Breaking Bad and Dexter to the end, you will understand my distinction between a good ending and a poor ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now I'll quickly overview the scoring points the site gave me. The site asked me to fill these out, so I feel an explanation is necessary for each. Note, however, that, and I'll only say this now because this is my first review on this site, they DO NOT represent my overall score. I didn't factor any of the below scores into my final score. I decided my final score before I'd even finished watching the show, let alone come here to review it. I wrote an explanation for that here: http://pastebin.com/8vzJvymf\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10. I very much enjoyed the story. From the moment L is introduced to the ending of the show, it was a wild ride. However, it was, by no means, perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. I have no complaints. The art doesn't blow me away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10. I don't care for the genre of music the show uses in its intros. It also clashes with the rather cinematic soundtrack used in the actual show. Feels very amateurish. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10. I would have given it an 8/10, but \"N\" and \"M\" were just terrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. I enjoyed this show very much, aside from little things that irked me. No reason to give it anything less than a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.",

            "content": "Presumably the most expected anime of the 2006/2007 Winter season, and the new year Death Note conveys story components and an intelligent honesty that is all the more generally seen in your collegeate scholarly classics than your ordinary Shounen Jump title. \r\nThe story is about the uprightness of mortal equity guy who successively esteemed in a general sense imperfect by corrupt, limited limit of man and their profoundly ruooted feeling of pride and grandiosity. The lead character Light is the incarnation of this talk, a once apparently immaculate character determined to fixation on the idea of getting to be similar to a divine being. Rightaway his plans are conventional -attackers, kid molesters, serial executioners -should bite the dust and die, correct? The world would be better without them, correct? Putting such power under the control of a mortal- -as immaculate as Light may be- -debases, as history demonstrates over and over. \\n\\n\r\nGoing with the Death Note is its unique holder, the Shinigami Ryuk. Instead of being ethically bound to Light or serving as an inner voice or aide, Ryuk sticks around just to be an onlooker -declaring people to be \"fascinating.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhile this itself makes for a fascinating plot, what truly makes Death Note a top bore arrangement are the characters who cause an obstacle to Light's main goal. Topping the cast is the fan-most loved L, whose character is simply past portrayal. A shady, puzzling, however sort of capricious virtuoso, L is likely the main personality that could match the conspiring Light. The feline and-mouse strategic maneuver between the two youngsters is tempting and arresting, making you giggle (not for comic drama's purpose) and keeps you settled on every casing, absorbing all the subtle elements and envisioning the following move. The delightful, yet grievous Misa is an alternate holder of a Death Note, and gets to be woefully captivated by Light and loyally does his offering, while in the meantime debilitating his invulnerability to the team following him down. \\n\\n\r\nThis is just inside the initial ten scenes or thereabouts. This arrangement is basic enough for anybody to see, however in the meantime profound enough and cunning enough for those searching for something truly substantial to sink their teeth into. Moreover, this arrangement offers something that relatively few different arrangement do- -an ethical problem. Consider the possibility that we had a Death Note. Would we utilize it? How would we utilize it? Is it true that it is conceivable to utilize it without transforming into what Light gets to be? \\n\\n\r\nIts creation qualities abandon me with nothing to grumble about. A top-offering arrangement like Death Note, in the same way as Nana and other well known manga titles, have a commitment to its fans to provide for them something that is quality work. The activity is smooth, the character plans are steadfast and truly bring life to the characters. The music is awesome, and some of anime's top seiyuu are among the cast. You truly can't have a better arrangement. What's more this is originating from a Christian- -I am not in any way annoyed by this arrangement, it is a phenomenal philosophical and religious situation. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about taking a gander at this arrangement as social analysis? Any side of the political range or anybody with any sort of religious connection can discover interesting issue issues that make for phenomenal discourse. This is an arrangement that will make you think. It's more than simply latent diversion, however it is simply what you make it. That is the magnificence of Death Note. What's more luckily, it sparkles splendidly through the offensiveness that is without a doubt to go to its characters. Enjoyment has to be 10/10 for me and I would recommend anybody to watch this.",

            "content": "Well Well Well .. Death Note ! Even my friends that don\u00b4t watch anime already heard this name somewhere ... it one of the most known animes out there .. for good reasons but also bad ones :D. (For who saw knows what i'm talking about). \r\nI don\u00b4t want to extend this, so i will make a short review and try to say everything that there is to say. \r\nStory: (9/10). Nice plot, consistent, solid, fluent. It is simple, but at the same time it is complex due to development attached to it. The plot is interesting, it looks nice, it looks fresh. It isn\u00b4tsomething over explored, but i felt that it's not that original though. Instead of weapons or big armies, or crazy stupid guys that usually are ugly and had a pretty messed up past, we have a student, a smart and looking good one, with a note. Well the wish to command the world isn\u00b4t something new, what is new is the character being so young, and the way that he pretends to do it. \\n\\n\r\nBasically this anime is based on a mental fight between a detective and our main character, Yagami Light(in the anime he gets the nickname Kira, so let's call him Kira). The all concept is nice for it self, plus with the interaction between the detective (who name is \"L\") and Kira we got a super interesting anime. Normal conversations or normal tennis games became Epic. I don\u00b4t want to tell you the why otherwise i would have to spoil.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10). For the year when it was made (2005), gosh the animation is even better that some animes that are being released now ! The glow of the characters makes them look pretty nice. They are not flat, they are well shaped, all look pretty normal but at the same time, as we go trough the anime we start to realise how peculiar the design is, and how cool it gets. The background is also nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10).  What a piece of art ! Such wonderfull soundtracks, such amazing OST that i got pleased just by hearing it. The sound here has the same effect that the sound on AoT has. It makes the action look tons times better, more epic !. Everything is good here. And what about the opening? The second opening it's okay .. it is related to the plot and it gives us an idea of how Kira feels about humanity. The first Opening? Jeez what a piece of art ! The dark theme, the metaphorical meaning, the lyric and even the music style fits perfectly in the action, in the plot, in the characters, IN EVERYTHING ! This is one of those animes that made such a  good work that when we look up to other animes we just make them look worst from what they really look like. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10/10). I'm getting tired to praise this anime but i have to do it. It is just outstanding. We have 2 main characters. L and Kira. Then we have a third one but no one gives a crap about it. Only 2 character. Although they were the best character i've ever seen besides Yuno. Great look, great development, great background story and, great interaction between them both that just make them even better. Basically both are super brilliant guys, but while Kira is organized and popullar, L is the oposite. I loved the contrast between them both, it just looks amazing. They both look like the same, but at the same time they look so different.. Each one has it's own personality and way to be, and they have special habbits. For instance L just can be sitting on his knees because it increases his brain capacity about 40% .. things like this that make them look so nice ! So original, so different from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)  What a failure ! That bad thing that i talked about right at the begining ? Well there it is. In the middle of the anime they made something that completely blowed up the anime. If it wasn\u00b4t for that part, the enjoyment it would be another 10/10 ... The first part, the first 25 episodes, it is just absolutely brilliant ! Brilliant i repeat. I couldn\u00b4t stop watching that, i felt sick i was totally sick while i was watching this. My eyes were glowing and my mouth was with a huge smile of admiration.. But .. it just gets lost. And personally, that end made everything even worst. This is based on my personall opinion. The end or it will be perfect, or if you are like me, it will suck for real. Some of my friends said that the end was trully amazing. For me .. taking in consideration what could have happened instead of what really happened, it was the WORST ending ever for me. It just makes no sense. Although it is a beautiful ending i have to say, it just didn\u00b4t pleased me. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes trated here are really serious and interesting. They are explored in a realistic way. I reccomend this show for everyone since it is at my point of view, a piece of art that everyone must see.",

The anime itself is showing us what could great power do to a human whose knowledge are godlike . Death Note make me watch the whole 37 episodes in one go . Enough said , its one of my memorable anime ever .\r\nStory:9\r\nThe story start with a highschool student , Light Yagami , who discover a book that contains the power of death . This book grant its user the ability to kill anyone whose face and names that the user know . That kind of powergive the user a big burden because human would always want more than just what he or she have . The story plot in Death Note were perfect . beside a few things that bother me a little , it deserve 9 from me\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe arts and animation are nice . Some animation are able to capture my interest . Some are just plain for me . But nonetheless , the arts does have a flaw but not much\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress were perfect . Nothing that stress me or anything . The OP and ED were flawless . It was so good that i instantly download it on my smartphone . A perfect 10 from me\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters did capture my interest . A few that capture my interest are Light Yagami himself , Ryuk , Lawliet L , Gelus and Teru Mikami . Teru is like L apprentice . Teru is almost as crazy as Light . While Light is too damn crazy if you ask me . The are also a few characters that almost capture my interest but it will just be a spoiler if i keep going . Every characters does have its background and a reason why it exist . So , a perfect 10 for the character plot\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nI enjoy the anime . No episodes that make me stop watching or anything . There are a few comedy but not enough to make you laugh . There was a drama for me at the end of the episode . Those who adore Yagami will understand . It didn't make me cry but it makes me feel sorry for Yagami and his father . Poor soul :'(\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nDeath Note brings joy in a maniac way . Where powers were given to a human whose knowledge are above mere mortal . Whose ambition is a bit nuts . Either way , Death Note is a must watch for me .",

            "content": "This review will be on Portuguese, if so you can translate to your language.\r\nDeath Note ( Desu Noto, \"Caderno da Morte\") \u00e9 uma s\u00e9rie de mang\u00e1 escrita por Tsugumi Ohba e ilustrada por Takeshi Obata, e que cuja adapta\u00e7\u00e3o para anime foi dirigida por Tetsuro Araki. A hist\u00f3ria centra-se em Light Yagami, um estudante do ensino m\u00e9dio que descobre um caderno sobrenatural chamado \"Death Note\", no qual pode matar pessoas se os nomes forem escritos nele e se o portador visualizar mentalmente o rosto de algu\u00e9m que quer assassinar.\r\nA partir da\u00ed, Light tenta eliminar todos os criminosos e criar um mundo onde n\u00e3o exista omal, mas os seus planos s\u00e3o contrariados por L, um famoso detetive particular. A s\u00e9rie \u00e9 baseada num one-shot que foi lan\u00e7ado pela Shueisha na revista Weekly Shonen Jump.\\n\r\nA s\u00e9rie tem 12 volumes de mang\u00e1s mas no entanto existe um volume chamado \"How to Read\" (Como Ler) que \u00e9 o volume 13. O volume one-shot representa o Volume 00. \\n\r\nTamb\u00e9m existe um \"aclamado\" volume que se autodomina como o volume 14( na minha opini\u00e3o)  que se chama \"Death Note Another Note: O caso dos Assassinatos em Los Angeles\"  - traduzido para portug\u00fbes. \\n\r\nBasicamente retrata o caso em que Naomi Misora e L trabalharam juntos. Possui 178 p\u00e1ginas e foi lan\u00e7ado em agosto de 2006 apenas no Jap\u00e3o.\\n\\n\r\nO mang\u00e1 foi publicado pela primeira vez em Dezembro de 2003 pela editora Shueisha na revista semanal japonesa Weekly Shonen Jump, at\u00e9 Maio de 2006. Mais tarde, a hist\u00f3ria do mang\u00e1 foi adaptada para um anime desenvolvido pela Madhouse e dirigido por Tetsuro Araki, composto por 37 epis\u00f3dios.\\n\\n\r\n//Com algum Spoiler a partir daqui\\n\\n\r\nV\u00e1rias publica\u00e7\u00f5es de mang\u00e1s, animes e outros meios de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam elogiado e criticado a s\u00e9rie, de modo geral. A s\u00e9rie foi banida na China devido a v\u00e1rios problemas com crian\u00e7as que alternavam os cadernos por se parecerem um Death Note. Tamb\u00e9m existe filmes feitos por americanos e por japoneses .Os filmes japoneses s\u00e3o uma trilogia enquanto que os americanos foram diretamente adaptados a partir do material do mang\u00e1 e n\u00e3o seguiu a hist\u00f3ria das adapta\u00e7\u00f5es dos filmes japoneses.Os filmes japoneses chamam-se..\\n\r\n- Death Note Rewrite (Basicamente conta a primeira parte do anime at\u00e9 ao L)\\n\r\n- Death Note Rewrite 2 - L wo Tsugu Mono (J\u00e1 este conta do Near/Mello at\u00e9 ao final do anime). Tamb\u00e9m existe mesmo \"Death Note o Filme\" que conta os eventos principais, Death Note The Last Name e \"L: Chance the World\" que \u00e9 o terceiro filme da trilogia japonesa(retratado diretamente da novel).\\n\r\nExiste 3 jogos baseados no anime e todos s\u00e3o para a consola Nintendo DS.\\n\r\nExiste muitas coisas que n\u00e3o percebi no anime como por exemplo...N\u00f3s sabemos que Kira era um psicopata, que matou inocentes s\u00f3 pra se mostrar o melhor, usando as pessoas erradas. L \u00e9 o melhor no confronto entre eles os dois, pois no caso KIRA trabalhou praticamente sozinho , e no geral foi Light quem precisou de ajuda.\\n\r\nAcho que isso n\u00e3o torna \"Kira\" melhor. Mas independentemente disso, queria saber tipo ouve uma altura em que Light e  L estavam a jogar t\u00e9nis, e durante o jogo, L descobriu que Light era o Kira, ou seja, trazendo isso para uma perspectiva real, acho que \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel descobrir uma identidade assassina de uma pessoa num mero jogo.\\n\r\nE no epis\u00f3dio 1 quando L amea\u00e7a Light do falso L (Lind L.Taylor) Light cai nessa armadilha, fazendo-se desmascarar no caso .Ou seja, o anime podia parar em 12 epis\u00f3dios, perfeitamente leg\u00edtimos, sendo n\u00e3o necess\u00e1rio Near e Mello. Tamb\u00e9m acho que a Misa foi uma personagem secund\u00e1ria que apareceu s\u00f3 para dar vida ao anime e dar aquele toque \"sexy\", porque no geral o anime \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de rivalidade entre Light e L, n\u00e3o era preciso na minha opini\u00e3o tantos epis\u00f3dios para provar isso. No entanto acho que, como o anime fez tanta fama penso que os 37 epis\u00f3dios encaixam bem no puzzle, porque existir\u00e1 sempre pessoas (p\u00fablico-alvo) do lado do Light e pessoas (como eu) do lado do L. Tamb\u00e9m acho que L n\u00e3o devia morrer no anime, porque a hist\u00f3ria baseia-se na justi\u00e7a e eu acho que justi\u00e7a n\u00e3o \u00e9 matar os nossos amigos ou entes-queridos porque isso n\u00e3o faz sentido.",

            "content": "Death Note is one of the most popular anime of the mystery thriller genre. It's often praised as a masterpiece and other times criticized for the latter part of the show (episodes 25-37) for taking the story onto \"not as well written or executed\" stage. Many people will tell you this can't be a true masterpiece because of this.\r\nI disagree.\r\nThe first 25 episodes were really well-paced and exciting, keeping me on my toes and thinking constantly. And then the remainder of the episodes were equally tense but this time you can enjoy the great protagonist after he has been fully developed. On the same note,yes, there are only two characters whom I consider interesting in the entire show BUT this shouldn't bother you, because the show is focused on the rivalry between L and Light, and it may even benefit from having everyone else just kind of exist and be manipulated by both L and Light.\\n\\n\r\nOverall?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best pieces of the thriller-genre to date. In my book, this holds a secure second place in my all time hall of fame, right under Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which I'm going to recommend to anyone who has been a fan of Death Note, Monster or any other resembling the two.\\n",

            "content": "Death note is a real masterpiece, this is my first serie where I cannot tell anything bad about.\r\nLet's start with the story:  Light Yagami is boy of 17 that is frustrated in how rotten this world is. When he has found the death note ( rules:  1) The human whose name is written in this note shall die. 2) This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. 3) If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing theperson's name, it will happen. 4) If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. 5) After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.) he decided to use it to make this world a better place. So he planned to kill criminals with it, to accomplish his ideal. but already after a few day's that he uses the death note, his ideal has changed into: that he will  create a new (perfect) world and that he will become the god that rules over it. But his goal becomes much harder to accomplish, when L (the best detective of the world) gets in his way. from here it is a battle of the minds between those two geniuses. the principle is simple: the first whose identity is revealed will die.\\n\\n\r\nI think you can start to imagine how psychological this is. The main question is \u201cwill light\u2019s noble goal succeed or will the death note turn him it the very thing he fight against?\u201d but this is only one of the great questions they handle. another great one is: \u201cIs Light a good person or a criminal himself?\u201d personally i don\u2019t had the feeling he was a criminal however i must admit when i thought about it clearly, i\u2019ve decided he was one because of these questions: \u201chas one person the right to judge over everybody\u2019s life?\u201d and \u201cis the death penalty a good way to punish?\u201d. Of course you have to decide yourself, what you think of him and his judgement. However i found him a criminal, I still liked his thoughts and the way he fight for his goal therefor I couldn\u2019t choose between light and L, since L is a wonderful character on it\u2019s own. I really like the way he handles and how he thinks about judgement.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about it is how you get sucked in the story. I\u2019ve watched the first 28 episodes without any stop and I would\u2019ve finished it, if i didn\u2019t needed to go to school that day. The way they make it exciting is unbelievable. The story as well as the music is built up so great that once you\u2019re over 5 episodes it gives you the feeling you can\u2019t stop. That doesn\u2019t mean the first episodes aren\u2019t good. I never was so excited from the first episode as this one. but as i said that feeling only grows while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some that says that the second part is worse and that it should\u2019ve stopped after the first. I personally don\u2019t think so, I like the second part as much as the first. The story circumstances have completely changed and there are new wonderful characters, what keeps it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThen one more thing, the drawstyle is magnificent. It really makes the characters who they are. And L is one of the most original characters (from design) I ever saw. \\n\\n\r\nSo in my opinion the plot was insane, the characters awesome, the background music good, drawing style very good and the enjoyment is the combination of all of these together.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of all of this I think this anime is a must seen. Not only a must seen for an anime watcher but one for everyone.",

            "content": "Have you ever thought about the way the world is now? Have you seen it in a positive light or a negative light? Have you ever thought about how you can change the world you're living in, for what you think is the better? Then one day, you find yourself with an unlikely weapon which you use to change the world.\r\nWelcome to one of the most critically-acclaimed anime in the world, \"Death Note\".\r\nThe story begins with Light Yagami, a 17-year-old high school student who is basically bored with his entire life. One day, he notices a mysterious, black notebook literally fall from the sky. Ofcourse, since Light is human, this particular notebook piques his curiosity. This particular notebook is labeled \"Death Note\", and according to what is said inside of the Death Note, anyone whose name is written in it will die. Light initially thinks that it's fake, but he discovers it's real after testing it out. Now, aided by the Shinigami Ryuk (who was the one who dropped the Death Note into the human realm in the first place), Light sets out to create a \"better\" world by using his Death Note to \"punish\" criminals. Meanwhile, as all of these deaths are happening, the police, aided by a man known only as L, try to catch the man behind the deaths, who are known to them as \"Kira\".\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I even need to explain all this, though. If you haven't at least heard of Death Note, I don't know if I can say that you're a true anime fan. (No offense intended.) It was through all this hype that I was finally tempted to watch Death Note myself. Now, after watching all 37 episodes, I know what all of the hype is about.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start by talking about the story. It's clear that the story is the strongest point of Death Note. It's a suspenseful story with lots of twists and turns. Although some parts of the story had been spoiled to me even before I started watching it (for example, the way it ends), that did not stop me from not being able to really guess what I didn't already know. Thus, I can't say I hate the story at all, even if some parts of it were ruined for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters. There was quite a number of interesting characters in this series, but were ALL of them likable? Of course not. In fact, some of Light's actions left me really hating him. Yeah, I just said I don't like Light, who is the protagonist whom the viewers are supposed to be following all of the way. Think about it, though; while it's great that he punishes criminals, he also makes the loved ones of those criminals sad. What's worse, he hardly feels any remorse toward them. Then, you've got L, who is basically Light's opponent. While I didn't know exactly what to think of him at first, I eventually grew to like him. What happens to him in the anime, which I refuse to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, really was a shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was rather well done; it really gives off the intense atmosphere there is most times. All of the opening and ending themes were pretty awesome, too, especially the first opening. It matched the anime very well for the time that it was the opening theme. I should probably mention that I was watching the English dub for Death Note. The voice actors did an excellent job, especially (believe it or not) Brad Swaile as Light.\\n\\n\r\nFor the amount of time that I spent watching Death Note, I can say that I greatly enjoyed it. It's a suspenseful police drama that is not all that predictable unless you were giving spoilers for it. I guess the series getting spoiled for me was what killed some of my enjoyment. Even so, the hype for Death Note is well worth it; I'd say you give it a try. Oh, and while you watch it, try taking a potato chip and eating it. (You'll catch the reference soon enough.)",

            "content": "I first came about Death Note when some of my friends started watching it and arguing who was better, Light or L? It got rather annoying, and for some reason, I planned to join in the argument by watching it... And also too see what makes Death Note \"this good\". Like me, I'm sure a lot people who have watched Death Note watched it because they were curious. Just a few warnings about the anime, there are some &ldquo;extreme writing&rdquo; elements in it that would make you think that the characters were training for the sport of writing or something, and that Misa&rsquo;s voice mayhurt your ears&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note&hellip; Certainly different from your normal plot. Simply put, a notebook that falls from the sky, is found by a student called Light Yagami. Now, just as anyone would think, once he saw the notebook, he instantly thought it was just a prank. But, just as humans would, curiosity got the better of him, and so he begins to see if it really is what it claims to be. What he finds surprises him, and he begins to use the Death Note &ldquo;for the greater good&rdquo; and begins using the alias &ldquo;Kira&rdquo;. The police start noticing patterns, they call on the legendary &ldquo;L&rdquo; to investigate, and find out who is doing these mass killings, and how. Things start to become complicated for both L and Light, when there is someone else also claiming to be &ldquo;Kira&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nNow, whether or not I have taken a biased approach to &ldquo;Death Note&rdquo;, I do not know. Death Note is said to be &ldquo;one of the best anime ever&rdquo;, and right now, I believe I can agree with that it is &quot;one of the best&quot;. Death Note is an anime with a very well constructed plot, with many twists and turns. The characters and events have been well thought through, with it being difficult to find many holes in the planning. &ldquo;Death Note&rdquo; keeps it&rsquo;s fast moving plot and storyline throughout the series and almost every episode ends with a cliffhanger, making you want more and more! One main thing does seem to disappoint me though. Once it became present that there was a second arc to the series, the tension and the excitement of the plot line seemed to drop (well for me at least) with the events occurring with Yotsuba Group. It seemed as though they may have just wanted to stretch the series for a bit longer, although it did pick up again with the introduction of &ldquo;Near&rdquo;. The ending however, I found a little disappointing, and a bit cliche though...\\n\\n\r\nAs much is hyped up about Death Note, it is not perfect. Now, the storyline, as I have said before, is very strong. It moves fast, and keeps you wanting more. The animation is exceptional. I do not believe that there is a noticeable slack in standard with the animation. The eyes and hair is detailed, character costumes and body shapes don&rsquo;t seem to be distorted, facial expressions seem appropriate etc. Sound? This, for me, seems to be it&rsquo;s only not so good side, although still very good. The soundtrack could have been improved in some areas with it for me starting to get a little repetitive&hellip; The &quot;godly singing&quot; gives a nice epic feel to it, however it does seem to feel as if it gets a little overused. The first opening and closings I think could have been improved, as it didn't quite seem to match the plot. The second opening theme songs some people may find a bit offensive, however it does seem to fit the characters and plot line better. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was still very good, and the voice actors fitted the characters pretty much perfectly, with outstanding performances by Miyano Mamoru, Yamaguchi Kappei and Hidaka Noriko, playing Light, L and Near respectively.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the anime&rsquo;s very good plot, art, sound and character developments and characteristics, I did not seem to enjoy it as much as I thought I would have, which may be due to having over-expectations, however, it still does deserve an overall 9.4 out of 10 and is arguably &quot;one of the best anime&quot; ever. Highly recommendable to those who enjoy crime-fighting with a difference, and also highly recommendable to everyone else! Whether I like L or Light better? Hehe...",

Also because I found the story to be completely ground-breaking compared to anything I had ever seen before. I literally felt like a caveman discovering fire for the first time.\r\nThe plot, the suspense, the excitement, the thrill...oh yeah, this anime is truly a binge watcher's galore. \r\nThe soundtrack is great and perfectly fit every scene in the anime. (It is a mixture of electronicindie rock and the occasional orchestra stuff for the epic scenes).\\n\\n\r\nFor people who are new to anime, I SERIOUSLY recommend that you watch Death Note first mainly because of the crime/thriller/super natural genre, which MAY be easy to digest by a wide variety of audiences. Also because it doesn't have that much fan service which an outsider may find a bit weird or off putting at first.",

            "content": "First off, let me say i'm didn't give this anime a 10. I wasn't completely amazed but people have different opinions after all and nevertheless i still think this is a show with few flaws and alot of enjoyment. It has a very nice feel to it and this is a great watch for those into the mystery genre especially. The show is hardly at times slow and usually packed with suspenseful and captivating moments, plenty of plot twists as well.\r\nStory (9). Right off the bat i'm going to say i think the story was the show's strongest asset. The whole tone in general isvery grey and morbid, and I liked that. The tone collaborates with the whole idea of the story very well without it being depressing or feeling dull. The story itself picked up very quickly, pretty much getting to the point in the first episode with little exposition or build up. This is done to make you actually want to watch the show and (plot twist) it works! The story evolves well and there are very high points which happen to be very suspenseful and actually at times made me nervous to see what was going to happen. There are alot of unexpected turns in the story, part of this is due to the very well executed character interplay particularly between Light (the main character) and L. I will say though, a few episodes felt a bit slow and i was slightly uninterested at times, however high points in the story made up for that indeed. Whenever i thought the show was losing me, it griped me right back in again. There were no real plot holes at all and rarely times when you could guess what was going to happen next, which is good and allows you to watch and enjoy with little thinking. There were some emotional moments as well as some dark moments, but the times where there was alot of build up and suspense were the the best aspect. The ending didn't set well with me, mainly because i wanted to see a different ending but even so i'm not criticizing the show at all for it because the ending was well executed and gave good subtle closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8). The animation is dated of course so i can't complain about lack of quality or anything. The characters looked good and real while being unique at the same time. The environments looked grey which set well with the story and tone. The show's aesthetic was actually really nice and i liked it. Death Note has a very nice feel to it where characters and objects have a omniscient glow and light reflect them which looks pretty. Tense moments are animated very well, even when all that's happening is a character writing down a name it looks just very good and fluent. Effects like Rain and dark clouds help to flesh out the dark overall mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) The soundtrack fit very well with the series, having a classic horror/mystery/thriller style to it. During intense moments the music was beautiful. during dialogue scenes or build up scenes the music is added in well, not eclipsing what's going on in the story but at the same time making you enjoy listening to it. The first intro song is in my opinion the best, it suited the show rather perfectly and set the tone well. The second is a complete change to a heavy metal style song. This does work but it isn't one of my favorites. The ending tracks are a bit forgettable, the second one worked well but I honestly don't remember the first. The voice acting of the characters is spot on, all of them are portrayed well and the general sounds are crisp and clean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7) The characters are my least favorite feature of the show in my opinion. This isn't a bad thing and doesn't mean i didn't like them it's just that i couldn't connect with them that much and some are a bit forgettable. I will say as the series went on some of the weaker links are fleshed out more and that was a good touch. All the main characters worked and played their roles well, Light, Misa, Ryuke, and L were all solid interesting characters. Light's intensions are made clear from the start and you see how his character changes especially at the very end. Ryuke is personally my favorite, showing he has no intrest in taking sides in the dilemma of the story is funny to see considering he watches these sometimes terrible things happen without a care. His constant giggling was funny to me, and he's just a likable presence despite being a god of death and all. Misa did he job well, she was another likable presence and she had her moments. I can't say i truly understand her goals but I didn't have problems with her at all. L is another of my most liked characters. His interplay and chemistry with Light is the best part of the majority of the show. The whole dynamic between them is very interesting to watch, and L himself is very weird. I guess weird is interesting to me, nevertheless i really liked him. A few of the characters introduced later in the series were my least favorite, to me they were just kind of annoying and I didn't care about them at all. In all honesty i hated them but it's not because of bad writing I just simply hated who they were if that makes sense. The side characters like I said are the weak link. Side characters usually end up being my favorite but in this case they were a bit forgettable. Matsura had his moments and i did like him but the rest were nothing special but were functional for the most part and weren't useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7) my gripes with the show are simple and not much...The characters could've been a bit better, and the story went slow to me 1 or 2 times. Overall though, i did enjoy it. I liked seeing the story progress and build up over and over and I liked seeing the match of wits between Light and L. The chemistry there between those two was spot on. The story developed for the most part perfectly and had a proper ending. Despite the fact i said it didn't set well with me, i'm over it and realized it was a suitable ending. Overall all the way through i rarely found myself bored and was most of the time invested in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo in all this was a great anime and i'd recommend it to ANY Anime fans. Other people in general as well. I plan on re watching this again and for 37 episodes it's more than worth the time.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helped, if you somewhat agreed with this give it a thumbs up (:",

            "content": "Intensity. Psychological. Ultimate anxiety forth-bringer. \r\nAN EXTREME GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE. \r\n      That basically sums up the masterpiece which is death note. I was drawn to this anime initially, due to it's IMMENSE popularity. And let me say this now, it certainly lives up to it's reputation. \r\n      First off, the story begins in a very intriguing way, which captures the audience's attention, immediately. The use of a mixture of divine intervention and attractive art, which is the backbone for this anime, proves to be very wise on the author's part. This allowed fora much larger pool of audience to be drawn from; Fantasy lovers: check, Horror gremlins: check, Action junkies: check, those who crave a mystery, and a tale which flexes the brain muscles: check, AND even the romance addict, fan girls. All of these elements are present within the anime, leaving no anime connoisseur unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\n       In every anime, there is a protagonist, and antagonist. In my years of an anime-lover, I've noticed that the bigger the fan-base is for each character, the more popularity it gains. Every watcher is quietly (or not so quietly) rooting for his or her preferred character to prevail, which in turn creates a much larger impact when important events occur. This is precisely the tact of Takeshi, and Tsugumi-sensei (writers of Death Note). The first few episodes are centered around our main antagonist, Light Yagami, (or protagonist, in his eyes), following the development he creates with his plans of utilizing the Death Note to create a better world. Kira is born. Many watchers, such as myself, are drawn out by his ability to bring to light /no pun intended/, our deepest thoughts, subdued by our sense of human morality. Finally, BAM\\n\\n\r\n      This mysterious character known as L, appears. If you are like myself, your response to his presence was sour, to say the least. \"An obstacle in Light's path!\" something along those lines. OR, you could belong to the category of people who were waiting for someone to knock this sociopath off of his high-horse. Nevertheless, as the story progresses, you start to get a feeling of attachment toward both characters. Not sure of whether you want our beloved antagonist to be caught, or melt into the temptation of Light's false sense of justice. This intense clash causes one to jump out of their seat with anticipation, heart beating faster with every episode.. unconsciously taking on the mind of a criminal. \"Will I be caught...?\" \\n\\n\r\n       This spectacle of a plot continues on for the entire anime, even with or without, one of the main characters. *no spoilers* xP All of this accompanied by a very intriguing sound track. I'll admit, the music is rather repetitive, but the reason it received such a high score from me, is due to it's amazing adaptability to the mood. It fits quite well, and adds to the suspense. \\n\\n\r\n        A teaser for all my lady, romance-lovers out there ~ (males welcome ;) The art is VERY good. Excuse the morbid appearance of the shinigami.. But the main guys, are quite the eye-candy, and excuse me for saying this, but look fairly nice together as well. BUT, that is for a different time. There is also, sprinkles of romance, not gender-biased.. Hehe, keep an eye out for that. \\n\\n\r\n        Overall, Death Note is an AMAZING anime. The only reason it did not receive a 10, is due to some minor fillers, that somewhat diverted my attention from the main plot, but nothing that caused too much a damper. Murdering, although we all know is wrong, this anime makes us ponder on what true morality is. Any show with that sort of influence, is definitely worth watching!",

            "content": "I found Death Note to be of exceptional quality, both in animation and in it's content from beginning to end, and when I say \"end\" I'm referring to episode 25. As far as I'm concerned, episodes 26 through 37 simply aren't relevant, especially when said episodes only serve to either dumb down the premise or even perhaps the viewer with a sort of \"shock and awe, look at me and my overly predictable plot twists!\" It also doesn't help that the most interesting and intelligent aspect of Death Note isn't even present at the series conclusion, but rather replaced by an extremely annoying, younger knockoff, and don't even get me started on the 'other one' and his stupid chocolate bars!  \\n\\n\r\nIf Death Note would have concluded at it's logical closure point it would be greatly deserving of the mass amount of hype it's been able to generate (despite it's terrible television ratings here in America). But alas, the logical closure point was ignored, and thus the series ended on a rather (pardon my French) shitty closure point. \\n\\n\r\nI guess what bothers me the most is that there was so much potential to be had in Death Note, but in the end it was squandered for mediocrity. Not only is the official ending extremely rushed, it also leaves the viewer completely unfulfilled. Summed up, &quot;You mean to tell me that I waited 37 episodes for 'that'?&quot;  \\n\\n\r\n...my sentiments exactly  \\n\\n\r\nHad I'd been reviewing only the first 25 episodes 9's (perhaps 10's)  would have been in order. I guess the best advice I can give to the viewer is this; Death Note is a 25 episode long series ;) \\n\\n\r\nOn a related side note, seeing as I'm somewhat of a music snob, I can't help but comment on the atrocity that is the second opening theme of Death Note. I'm not against loud screamy music, not in the least bit, after all I avidly listen to bands such as Orchid and Ampere for Christ sake. However when it comes to Nu-Metal garbage like the opening theme in question I simply can't stomach it. All things considered, it is amusing how the f-bomb is dropped several times during said song, a much needed comic relief (why is cursing broadcast on TV so damn amusing?) much the same as the poorly executed blast beat during the final few seconds.",

            "content": "Death Note Review\r\nTHIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Death Note revolves around a 17 year-old boy called Yagami Light and a Shinigami, whose name is Ryuk. In the Shinigami World, Ryuk was bored and then decided to throw his Death Note to the human world. But what does this notebook do? Well... \u201cThe humans whose name is written in this note shall die.\u201d\r\nOn the human world, Light catches the notebook, but at first, he thinks it\u2019s just a joke. Despite that, he takes the Death Note, and goes home. \r\nIn order to see if the notebook is real, he writes the name of a manwho took eight people (including teachers and students) hostage. After 40 seconds, the man died. \\n\r\nAfter that, Yagami starts killing all criminals he \u201cknows\u201d, and then the police and the world best detective, L, join forces to catch Light, who is later called \u201cKira\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly think this is probably one of the best animes I have ever watched. This story is just unique and wonderful and to be honest I don\u2019t think that there is anybody out there that actually does not like Death Note. It\u2019s not my favourite anime, but it\u2019s almost. \\n\r\nThe fight between L and Kira it\u2019s just too amazing and brilliant. Tsugumi Ohba really did an wonderful job writing this. I give the story a 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOk, I don\u2019t know what to say about the art. I really like it. I think L is the one who is better designed. And Ryuk, too. The Kira\u2019s evil look just makes him a badass. There\u2019s not much that I can say about the art on this anime, because, well, you know, I\u2019m not an artist, so the only thing I can do is appreciate it. Therefore, I give the art a 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nTHE SOUNDTRACK ON THIS ANIME IS JUST TOO FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!! Every character has an awesome theme. My favourite one is Ryuk\u2019s theme. PERFECT. L\u2019s one is good, too, but, RYUUUUK!!! I also think the seyuus are perfect for ach character. The best seyuu, in my opinion, is Miyano Mamoru, who role plays Light. After saying this, I give sound a 10/10, as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is the best part on this review. I\u2019m going to talk about three characters.\\n\\n\r\nYagami Light: He\u2019s my favourite character on this anime. I prefer him as L. I know his methods are not good, and I honestly think he shouldn\u2019t make justice by his own hands, but watching him towards the anime, just made me realize he\u2019s just too perfect. Yes, perfect. He got insane and completely crazy by having power. It\u2019s like the people nowadays get when they have money: crazy. Light felt that, being such an intelligent person, he would always won. And that\u2019s right, he\u2019s intelligent as hell, but he didn\u2019t won. Which obviously makes me sad, I wanted Light to win. Evil never wins, and that\u2019s a shame. Sometimes things aren\u2019t all sweet and pink. But he couldn\u2019t win in this case. He would get killed by Ryuk at any time, even if he had won. Despite all this facts, Light\u2019s just THE man.\\n\\n\r\nL Lawliet: I love L. I really do. When I first watched the anime, I didn\u2019t like him that much, but after reading the manga, I almost like him more than I like Light. I was really sad when he died, but at the same I was happy cause that would give a chance to Light to finally win and be the God of The New World. Unfortunately, both of them died. Such a big loss to the anime world. L was incredibly intelligent, and he knew, since he met Light, that he was Kira. He just didn\u2019t have enough proof. And it\u2019s kinda sad, cause he saw Light as his friend. I don\u2019t know if he meant it when he said it, but it\u2019s sad, anyways. \\n\\n\r\nRyuk: I just wanted to talk about Ryuk cause this guy is my second fave on the anime. I like him to much. On the last episode, the things he were saying while writing Light\u2019s name, almost made me think he kinda \u201cfelt\u201d for Light. I mean, they were together for 6 years, they went through so many things together. Light learned with him. Ryuk learned with Light. I know he\u2019s is just a Shinigami, and Shinigamis represent pure evil, but... Rem felt for Misa. Jealous felt for Misa. Couldn\u2019t Ryuk have felt for Light, even though he\u2019s not that kind of shinigami? It\u2019s what I think, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe others character are good as well. But I have to say this, I HATE Near. I HATE HIM. Despite, I give the characters a 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI watched this anime in three days, so I really enjoyed watching it. 10/10 obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAfter everything I\u2019ve said here, everybody can understand I give Death Note a 10/10. I really like the anime. One favourites of all time.",

            "content": "It's strange, don't you think? How in a world filled with otaku that crave action or moe, and sometimes both, that possibly the most popular anime out there is Death Note, a psychological thriller that spends 90% of it's time talking. Perhaps it's because it's a product of Shonen Jump, or maybe because of the directing style of Tetsuro Araki, or maybe because the anime itself is just that good. After all, over the years we've had plenty of anime trend and take up the majority of discussion on forums, Steins;Gate, Sword Art Online, and probably the biggest being Attack on Titan, but Death Notehas stayed a major anime in the community for 7 years now. So now the questions are, why is it so popular, and does it deserve it's popularity? Let's see if we can find some answers.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with the introduction of Light Yagami, a genius high schooler who's completely and utterly tired of his daily life, finding it dull because of how easy the work he does is to him, and frustrating because of the \"rotten\" state of the world. One day his life changes completely when a black notebook with the words \"Death Note\" on the cover falls from the sky. He picks it up and reads that by writing the name of anyone in it while picturing their face, that person will die in 40 seconds of a heart attack, unless a cause of death is also written down. He originally tosses it aside as a twisted joke, until he tests it out for himself, and in a clever case of \"curiousity kills\", the Death Note appears to work and he's now convinced that it is real. The Death Note actually came from a Shinigami, or \"death god\", named Ryuk, who was just as bored as Light and tossed the Death Note into the human world for fun. Now wielding immense power in his hands, Light takes it upon himself to kill all the criminals of the world and create a new world which he stands as a living god. After making a name for himself under the alias Kira, this case catches the attention of Interpol and the world famous detective, known only as L. Now the battle is on between Light and L, as they both use their intellect and resources to try and find out the others identity and win in this battle of good versus evil. Though whether justice is Light, L, or simply whoever wins, is left up to you. One thing i can say about Death Note's story, that i so rarely get to say, is that the idea for it is quite original. Yes there are other anime out there that have very similar feels to them, such as Code Geass or Gankutsuou, i've yet to see an anime that took the idea of \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" to such extreme and creative levels. Concept aside though, this is a psychological thriller, specifically a game of cat and mouse, and Death Note never fails to deliver with it's twists. It seems as though every episode ends with a cliffhanger making you want to tune in to the next episode as quickly as possible to see what happens next. Even so this only works because of the rivalry between Light and L. I'll get into it them more in the characters section, but it seems these two are able to make such a seemingly dull story into an adrenaline fueled thriller, despite the anime being mostly dialogue. Actually, the anime is at it's best when it's focusing on the dialogue, particularly L and his uncanny ability to see the importance in everything, including things i wouldn't have even assumed were important until L pointed them out. In the rare occasion that the show does choose to show a shootout or a car chase i just want it to finish so i can get back to the talking. Light however proves to be quite clever himself as he's able to use the Death Note's many rules, and when i say many i mean enough to write a book on, to form long complicated plans, that when revealed you can't help but feel a sense of awe. The rivalry between these two is what made this show, which leads me to bring up the matter of it's last 12 episodes. Around that point, the battle between Light and L ends, for major spoiler reasons, and a new battle starts where it left off between Light and L's two successors, Near and Mello. Now anyone who's talked about Death Note knows about the infamous reputation that these last 12 episodes have, and quite frankly, it's not untrue. While i don't find them as bad as everyone else, i still enjoyed them to a degree, they are a major letdown compared to the show's first 25 episodes, with Near and Mello turning out to be disappointing replacements for L, and Light no longer having anyone of worth to bounce off of. Luckily, the ending was able to save the show. While i know that some people disagree with me, and prefer the original manga's version of the ending, i couldn't help but be amazed with how well they were able to end it and conclude the game between Light and L, and just how fitting it was. But there's also the issue of the game itself. The game between Light and L is that of good and evil, but is transformed more into that of a game of chess, with everyone else being used as pawns and the murder being played off as almost horrifically fun, and despite me not having any issues with this, many others are bound to be turned off by the idea of it. Still if you can get past that, then the story of Death Note is airtight and heavily engaging.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note was done by studio Madhouse, who's name is quite well known amongst anime fans for it's, mostly, high quality of animation, with Death Note being no exception. The art for this show is very pleasing, being pretty yet dark and gothic, tons of shading and detail to both the characters and the background designs. The animation is usually very simple but nice. Death Note is mostly a talking head anime, with characters just standing around and having long dialogues and monologues, and sometimes both at the same time, yet there's such precision to every small movement that they make, it's actually quite impressive. However, every now and then, the animators are basically given permission to go nuts, and go nuts they do, with fluid, fast, and erratic movements, adding a sense of chaos to the show, very nice looking chaos mind you. This is most likely thanks to the director Tetsuro Araki, famous for other works like High School of the Dead, Guilty Crown, and most recently Attack on Titan. He adds a bombastic flair to the show that could never be found in the manga, really taking advantage of the fact that it's animation rather than just adapting the manga to a T. But what really makes him and his works, Death Note being no exception, standout is how well he knows his audience. He purposely puts over the top scenes in his shows knowing that the viewers will turn them into gifs and memes and share them through sites like Tumblr and Twitter, unknowingly bringing free publicity to his shows. Death Note seems to take advantage of that more than any other anime of his though, the over the top reactions, the obvious repetition of scenes, and of course, the famous Potato Chip scene. Some people may look at this as manipulation, but i look at this as the show standing out and taking full advantage of the privileges it's given, which is always a plus. The only issue i have, is that while the show still looks good, the animation is kind of dated now, but you can't really call that a fault of the show, just the times.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know it seems like every anime out there nowadays seems to think that nothing could possibly make for a better soundtrack than a good latin choir, Death Note being no exception. In fact, basically every song in this show is a latin choir, and you know what, it works. They do nothing short of put even the smallest even on some grand scale that keeps your attention in place, though i will admit, it does become a bit overused. The only two notable exceptions to this being the themes to Light and L, with Light's being sinister sounding electric guitars to represent his passion and L's being haunting sounding pianos to represent his cunning and precise nature. There's also the OPs and EDs of the show, with the first OP, The World, and ED, Alumina, being by a Japanese visual kei band called nightmare, and while they were great and fitting sequences, i couldn't help but be annoyed at times by the whiny tone of the vocals. The second OP, What Up People, and ED, Zetsubou Billy, on the other hand are done by a Japanese metal band called Maximum the Hormone, and despite popular opinion, i prefer these over the first sequences. The screamo lyrics are not only fitting, but also just different from most other anime, making them stand out as memorable and even catchy. So with a well done OST to match the well done art/animation, the only thing that could bring the production values up even more is good acting, and Death Note does not fail to deliver. Death Note is 90% dialogue, so the only way this could work is with talented actors, which both the English and Japanese tracks do not fail to deliver. For Light we have Brad Swaile for the english dub, and while he has issues at first, seeming to try to match the Japanese track, he eventually finds his own footing and really owns the role. But despite Brad Swaile owning the role, his Japanese counterpart, Mamoru Miyano practically invented it. Mamoru Miyano is a pretty big deal among Japanese voice actors, playing a wide variety of roles and absolutely nailing everyone of them, and Light is among one his best performances, capturing all the passion, the intensity, and the charisma that Light incorporates. For L we have Kappei Yamaguchi for the Japanese track,. He plays a more monotonous L, which adds a layer of intelligence while simultaneously creeping you out, which does fit his character. But unlike Light, i'm going to go with the dub performance for L played by Alessandro Juliani, who seems to encapture the role perfectly, blowing away Yamaguchi's performance, giving a sort of musicality and nuance to the character, capturing both what L says and what L truly means. The rest of the cast is done well on either track so you can't fail with either dub or sub for Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThroughout it's 37 episode run time, Death Note provides a wide assortment of characters, from detectives, to other criminals, several Shinigami, the members of the Wammy House, and one bubby, yet annoying, pop idol. But they are hardly the focus, and are more present to add more allies and enemies for Light and L to play around with. There are some standout roles like Ryuk, acting as the in house audience member with a front row seat to Light and L's battle, Light's father Soichiro, who encompasses the ideal of what justice is, and even Matsuda, the idiot detective with the heart of gold, but they rarely act as the focus, and therefore get far less attention compared to Light and L, leaving them underdeveloped and lacking any true depth. It should also be note that Death Note is a tad bit misogynistic when it comes to their female characters. There are really only two female characters that actually play a large role in the game between Light and L, those being Misa Amane and Kiyomi Takada, both of whom's roles are to fall in love with Light with no reason, and do whatever he tells them two without any second thought. Though the worse offender is easily Misa, who is full on obsessed with Light to the point where she would allow him to kill her if that pleased him, which added to the reasons of why she is often hated by Death Note fans everywhere. But enough of the side characters, let's get to the real meat of the show with Light and L. Light is intelligent, handsome, and charismatic, but also manipulative, arrogant, and kind of an outright bastard. It's often argued what kind of person Light really is, a hero, a villain, or an anti-hero, and if he's a villain, whether it's the kind of person he always was or if he was corrupted by the power of the Death Note. I personally think that this question can be summed up with a quote from historian and moralist, Lord Acton. It goes, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.\". What i'm getting at, is that no one is ever truly good or evil, it simply depends on how you look at them, and whether their actions meet the ends. At least, that's how i interpret it. Me personally i look at Light as a villain that was able to kill even those closest to him without a second thought and even go so far as to taunt those that fell victim to him, but others may find that his actions were justified and his goal was pure. L is, in many ways, the exact same person as Light, despite appearing to be his complete opposite. L is a notorious liar, and despite fighting on the more just side, often sees this as a game. He's an accidental sociopath, meaning his being was corrupted by the nature he grew up in rather than being born the way he was, often selfish, but knows better than to allow others to see the true him. He encourages his allies through talks of justice but never truly believes in what he says, he mourns when one of his allies dies but more out of fear that kira is closer to catching him rather than actually feeling remorse. He's in many ways, just as bad as Light, but far easier to support because he's fighting on the side of good. Despite the battle being good versus evil, neither of them could be called good because of their desires, but neither of them could be called evil because of the ends that their actions meet. It's actually quite gray. Yet while both of them are psychologically complex, emotionally they are rather simple. Neither of them really changes throughout the show, except for Light becoming more extreme and unstable, and are highly underdeveloped. There's also the matter of what the true nature of Light and L's relationship really is, but honestly i'm not going to even justify that idea with a response. Let's just say, that fujoshi have quite a bad habit of assuming that guys in anime that fight and have a habit of clashing, tend to swing the other way, and they've imposed their ideas far too much on Death Note. To wrap it up, all of the cast is interesting and entertaining in their own way, and Light and L are fascinating characters to explore, but you'll end up a bit disappointed if you go into the show looking for complex characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) Overall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a very fun anime to say the least, that grabs you and never lets go from the start until the explosive finale. The second half though, leaves a lot to be desired, and the characters were a bit too cold at times for my liking. Despite absolutely adoring Death Note on my first viewing, after gaining much more experience with anime, i've found this story done better particularly in Naoki Urasawa's Monster, which i can easily recommend that anyone check out if they enjoyed Death Note. Still, i must admit having a soft spot for this show, and for what it is, it's a great psychological thriller for the teenage audience. So i recommend that any anime fan out there check it out, and i also recommend it as a gateway anime for you new fans out there. Anyways, that's all for now, til next time.\\n",

            "content": "*FOR THE VERY FEW OF YOU OUT THERE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ANIME JUGGERNAUT, SPOILERS FOR DEATH NOTE. ALSO, THIS REVIEW WILL BE HUGE, BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME\"\r\nLet's flash back to 2006. Anime at the time was a decently popular entertainment medium with a few great hits that many internationals know. However, we never really got a global phenomenon from the anime industry. A pair of shoes came on at around the same time, and one year later, that pair got an English dub that showed the world the true power of anime genius protagonists and the effects they would have on our worldas we know it. One of those was Code Geass, which was amazing, but had but a brief run in the spotlight meaning that despite being so popular on MAL, it would never truly cement its mainstream status the way a Shounen Jump anime adaptation would. Speaking of which, his show Death Note, was the other, more successful brother of the two, even if MAL scores say otherwise. This show originated as a Shounen Jump manga, and judging by Bleach and Naruto, that meant instant stardom, and now Light Yagami and his black notebook of death is the most popular anime of all time, and an anime who's worldwide phenomena juggernaut status would only be challenged twice. One by SAO, once by Attack On Titan. Well, now to the present. This show is officially a classic. Now, how well does this killer hold up? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nLight Yagami is a genius student in high school. One day, a black notebook literally falls from the sky, and in doubt, he tests it out on some criminals currently trying to molest a girl a few hours after class, only to find out, it works. It turns out, it was like a rock being thrown into stagnant water. Ryuk, a shinigami from a realm of shinigami (creatures who created and posses Death Notes) dropped it on purpose waiting for someone to pick it up and \"change the world\" because he's bored. Soon, the police realize how horrible such a thing could be, and call up the world's greatest detective, L, who quickly reveals the city where this killer, now called Kira, is. It soon becomes a figurative chess match between the two as many police members due to Kira's book, even if some methods are a bit cruel on Light's end. Soon, he gets scouted by Misa Amane, another Death Note wielder, only he is reluctant to have her on board, but decides to use her for this whole ordeal, ready to kill her if he doesn't need her anymore. Soon, after deciding to erase his memory, he and Misa are locked up and mentally tortured for days before joining up with them, as this group of corporate assholes is up to some shady business, and after that sidequest is finished, Light ends up re-encountering his Death Note and regains his memory, and with that, proceeds to finish L off. So, ok, good story. It was a fun little figurative chess match, even if the last few episodes up to that point felt like a tedious sidequest involving corporate assholes for the sake of an antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nWell, apparently, the original mangakas wanted to end it there, but due to fan demand, caved in and created a lackluster 12 episodes to cap it off. A few years later, after somehow having the world under his fear-mongering thumb, and not getting caught at all, he is still working with the police. Apparently, L has two apprenticed known as Near and Mello, who go off to do their own thing to catch the Kira. Mello kidnaps Light's sister and kills kid dad, while Near takes a more analytical and chess player like role. Ultimately, they were still sorta working together. A new Death Note user named Teru Mikami joins Light's cause and looks like a perfect member, only until the ending. Somehow, Near and his men managed to barge into Mikami's room without anyone knowing, switched his Death Note with a fake, in a hackneyed attempt to lure out a super genius like Light, AND IT WORKS!!! Also, Light was never smart enough to come up with a backup plan like he always does, and ends up being exposed, shot, and eventually killed by Ryuk's own Death Note! I'll get to how badly the ending betrayed the characters of the Death Note users in the characters section, but the ending is just bad! I mean, it is so egregious that it is literally one of the worst endings I've seen to date. Sure, Death Note had a decent story, but the ending was so bad. It felt like they had no reasonable way to kill Light, so they took the easy way out. It didn't entirely ruin the story, but the last 12 episodes managed to make a watered-down sequilitis story that bogged everything down overall, instead of waiting and then making this last 12 episode arc into a sequel. Well, we have what we have, and overall, not too shabby, ending aside.\\n\\n\r\nLight Yagami is a villain protagonist and let's be honest, while he was kind of interesting in the first 25 episodes, 26-37 make him lose all of his charm. He was power hungry and had a god complex, but had a decent set of morals that decayed the more he was immersed in his cause to save the world. Some say the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the first 25 episodes managed to do that brilliantly, and we probably wouldn't mind if he won since despite being morally questionable, he still has some morals about family and was interesting. The last 12 episodes make him cocky, lethal, toxic, and more power hungry than ever, ruining his credibility as a likable character. The ending was a real slap in the face for his character though. He became SO COCKY, that he never bothered to use Misa as a sure-fire backup, gave himself away so easily that way he could gloat if he won, and overall, failed to have a reasonable reason to be defeated. However, he at least died with more dignity than in the manga, so I'll at least give it that. Ryuk is a snarky, narcissistic, creature who admits that he is only working with Light into Light screws up. He makes for some decent comic relief. L is an interesting genius with odd quirks, and a morality that can sink if need be. He also has a sweet tooth, and is kinda kickass, more so than Light. I like the way he died, since he died at just the right moment to jumpstart our hype back up after the fullness of episodes 18-24, and had a reasonable and epic send off. The officers are good people and decent characters as well, but for the sake of time, I will only be talking about four other people. Misa starts off as calculating, and also a good planner when it comes to hooking Light. She doesn't show any of that off afterward, becoming just another Yandere-ish jealous girl that always kisses up to Light, and while I didn't dislike her, I can see why many do. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the worse supporting cast. Teru Mikami, is a bad-guy fighter; always has been. He didn't care if he got hurt. As long as he stopped injustices around her, and grew to hate his mother when she tried to convince him to stop lest he got hurt by some bully. Now, he is crazy, with his epic pen writing skills, and a true immersion with his cause. This causes him to be rather gullible and stupid near the end though, and the fact that Kira like his pawn/ex girlfriend only to find how he did that too and at the exact same time, made me really dislike him after I already hated Light for doing that. Mello, is an asshole. He is always at Near's throat, is blackmailing Light by holding his sister hostage, and is just a muscle asshole because an interesting antagonist in Death Note is a foreign concept. Near... I hate Near. He is literally a watered down L who uses are rally stupid method to somehow come out on top. Plus, he worked with Mello to do his thing, actually using Mello as a pawn, and he's a really good liar. So, yeah, not amazing, but a decent cast nnetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThis was done by Studio Madhouse and if you know Madhouse, you know how good they are at their projects. They went for a more realistic look combined with a more digital art that the early 2000's have plagued the industry with, and this show pulls it off rather well. When they try getting some trippy and odd imagery there to make a visual statement, they also succeed very well. The character models don't always look amazing though, but the art is well done nonetheless. Plus, the dark lighting in the final episode really adds to the tone of it, even if the finale sucks. \\n\\n\r\nOP 1is a very good and memorable OP that really fits well with the narcissistic and almost nihilistic tone of Death Note. It's a great OP. OP 2... How do you describe the insanity? It is literally a screamo. I don't like those too much, but the lines are so easy to misconstrue, it gets hilarious towards the end. It's beyond self-indulgent in its own madness, and man did Maximum the Hormone have fun with this one; it's crazy as sin. ED 1 is just ok. Decent for the show it's attached to, but nothing more. ED 2 is awesome. It really brings the edgy and nihilistic tone to the forefront in an awesome song called \"Zetsubou Billy\" by Maximum Hormone (who also did OP 2), the band responsible for Freiza's theme. The dub, is also solid. Sure, the voices aren't really stand-out, and I could swear Misa sounds different in the last 10 episodes than the rest of the show, but overall, they gave a good performance. Also, Light is voiced by the guy who did Setsuna from Gundam 00, or more hilariously, Rock from Black Lagoon. Make of that what you will.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Death Note deserve all the hype it gets? No, not with that final cour it doesn't. However, it is definitely a respectable global phenomenon with some creative and exciting plans, some mostly good twists, and a sense of tension that is rife throughout its first 2 cours. I just wish that the last 12 episodes didn't exist for they turned a great show into something lesser Even still, some of the music is rest and the visuals are certainly some of the best of the late 2000's. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Death Note is the most popular anime ever in the West. Over 1.5 million people have seen it on MAL alone, and I'm sure the general public has had many an outdated meme thrown in their faces, whether they watch anime or not. If you hadn't heard of it by 2017, it got a very poorly-received live-action film only on Netflix (thankfully). It was my first anime, too. So, I thought I'd review it, even though no one's going to even see it buried under almost 800 reviews.\r\nDeath Note, if you don't know already, is about a bored teenager who finds a notebook and decidesto kill every criminal in the world with a heart attack by writing their names down. And he wants everyone to know that he's doing it, so they all die abruptly and suspiciously. Each case taken on its own yields nothing but a stroke of bad (or, perhaps, good) luck, but each case taken together spells M-U-R-D-E-R. All caps lock. Light believes that in order for crime to stop, and for the world to be a better place, there has to be a strong enough deterrent for even the most desperate to hesitate about turning to crime. And somebody has to do it, right? Somebody's gotta get their hands dirty.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is one of those rare stories that follows what many consider to be a villain protagonist. Light's actions seem to come from a good place: stop crime and bring about world peace. But in order to do that, he kills criminals who are serving their time. Not too far in, L, the world's greatest detective, comes in to challenge the unknown phenomenon known only as 'Kira', and he challenges Light with his own brand of justice. And that's where one of the three key aspects of Death Note's formula comes into play: Morality.\\n\\n\r\nThe viewer has to decide who to side with: L, or Kira? They're both enigmas who let their work speak for themselves, and they both believe in completely opposed ideas of justice and harmony. Even Light and L's personalities and character are juxtaposed. This directly coincides with the second element: the cat-and-mouse game. Kira doesn't back away from the challenge, and in fact, tries to draw them closer together so that they can decide who's right. It's a constant push and shove of scheming, deceit, destruction and mind games. The series uses its supernatural premise and mystery roots concurrently to generate really clever and entertaining plans either for Light to progress his plans, or for L to trap his prey. It just keeps getting better and better as the series goes on. This brings us to the third and final major element in the Death Note formula: escalation.\\n\\n\r\nKira kills people at a certain time, in a certain way, for a certain reason, and L hones in on him further and sets up even greater measures. From tailing him to setting up cameras, and on and on until things can't escalate any more. And then something changes, and the cycle repeats. It's a very effective way of establishing dramatic stakes and ensuring that the story is always progressing. But for the same reason it's so good, it's exactly why the series crashes and smolders in the final act. It just keeps escalating, seemingly without end. Things get completely crazy and out of hand, even for a supernatural story, and the clever schemes become complete ass-pull monstrosities. The suspension of disbelief is hanging by a thread by the last few episodes, which is a damn good thing, because they bring it to a conclusion before it can get any worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe last segment, while thematically the most interesting and diverse, is definitely the weakest in terms of dramatic stakes, novelty and plot development. It goes off the rails, so to speak. It's kind of meant to be like that, thematically, but that doesn't make it any more entertaining or interesting. By that point, the whole cat-and-mouse thing is getting played-out and the supernatural elements have all been explained, so viewers are forced to wait for the series to end for an entire 12 episodes. The tonal shift feels pretty bonkers and unbelievable, too, which doesn't help things. But that's not the only lacklustre part of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nThe first act is definitely the most consistent and interesting, purely for the diversity in setup and character. It's very fresh, and rolls all of its myriad elements together into a tense and gripping drama...for the most part. Death Note is rather single-minded in its approach to story-telling. It focuses almost exclusively on Light to the detriment of other characters, which reflects badly on the series later on when it wants us to care about side characters who probably make up about 10-15% of the total screen time altogether. It feels like the first two arcs should be much longer, while the last arc should be much shorter; like an epilogue to a long story. The problem isn't even that the show focuses excessively on Light, as much as it is that it focuses too much on a certain aspect of Light.\\n\\n\r\nThere are essentially two versions of Light for us to see: Kira, who spends as much as his time as possible scribbling down names and talking to his Shinigami, Ryuk, to learn more about the supernatural phenomenon. And then there's Fake Light, where he's suave and cool and smart; a normal high schooler with lots of friends and high exam scores. Responsible and hard-working. I really wanted to see more of Light as an actual person, rather than a representation of ideals and as a plot device. We only see normal highschooler Light, as himself, about two times in the entire series. Right at the beginning, and right at the end. Despite being the main character, he really doesn't have much of a character besides: \"Stop crime. Kill criminals. Beat L. Become God.\" And it's kind of annoying when we see that L has some character to him. We get flashbacks, subtle hints and clues about the kind of life L has led and how he has become the man he is today. Of course, we don't get much, but it's substantially more than we get from Light. \\n\\n\r\nI get that Light is meant to kind of be a stand-in for \"anyone\", but he's also super smart and super cool and super not average. And the show tells us this almost constantly. And trying to set up a moral quandary between L and Light is kind of a raw deal when we don't even get to see much of Light's characters and can only really side with the ideas and his schemes. Death Note is mostly a good drama, but it really does a disservice by its characters. Most of them. Weirdly, some of the minor major characters get a ton of care put into their characters and backstory. Like Misa. And even some of the one-note Shinigami - but Ryuk gets only slightly more than Light. Actually, that's kind of a lie. The show does focus on him to some extent in the final act, but it's mostly pretty stock-standard and written poorly, so I'm going to ignore that.\\n\\n\r\nI can't believe it's taken me this long to even mention the absolutely exemplary Art, Animation and Music. Because it's exemplary. Really good. Without its OST, this show wouldn't be half of what it is. The music is so tense and devilish, and you can almost feel the darkness exuding from it. The OPs are kinda weird and bad, and I have no idea about the EDs, but everything else is great. Oh, and this is one of those rare anime that you should definitely watch in English dub. Light's VA is very good. Also, the art is amazingly good for being 11 years old at the time of writing, and the animation is smooth as silk when it wants to be. I've seen Death Note about 4 times, and I still absolutely love the design of the Shinigami...and also L. L's pretty cool, too. The other minor characters are kinda standard, unfortunately. I think the design was actually at its best in the final act, which was a real waste. But no matter what, Death Note always looks and sounds good.\\n\\n\r\nThe one last thing I want to talk about in Death Note is its themes, which it sets up and explains rather admirably. They're simple enough, but debated enough times throughout to give you a clear idea of what the author is trying to say. And if L and Kira's confrontations aren't enough to drill the point in, the last act exists to make it clear to anyone that's still on the fence. I actually really like the final act thematically, because it's the one aspect that remains consistent and coherent throughout, and it never forgets what it's trying to say. It's kind of hard to actually say what the point of Death Note is, because that would spoil a whole lot of it. It's something best experienced first-hand. If I had to say, they'd be something like, \"What is justice?\", \"What is evil?\", \"How do you create a perfect society?\", and \"How do you stop crime?\" I really wish that they were explored in more depth in the first two acts, but if that would make it anything like the final act, then I'm more than fine with two entertaining and dramatic acts with somewhat unexplored themes.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a long ride, but it's largely an entertaining one with a very addicting pace and more than a few clever tricks up its sleeve. It gets a tad too ambitious toward the end and drags on for far longer than it should have, but in the end, it ties things up neatly, and answers all of the important questions, but leaves some things dangling intentionally. Death Note is unfortunately kind of anemic in the character department. The plot is interesting enough to keep you hooked, and none of the characters are overly annoying (until the last act), but I can't say I really know a lot about any of the characters in Death Note. It's all business, unfortunately. But hey, if nothing else, Death Note is pretty to look at, and the OST is glorious. It's worth the ride, but definitely not as solid, diverse, nuanced or even thematically tight as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nNot to poke the tiger or anything.",

            "content": "For being the most popular show here on MAL and other surveys. Not only has everyone and their mother seen this show... most people rate it an 8-10 and put it in their top 5 list. Needless to say my expectations were high for this show, for all I knew this show was going to be the best anime I have ever seen. However, to my disappointment, it was not. \r\nLets start on the things that I enjoyed. For a show made in 06/07 I thought the animation was pretty good, and being how it was my first time watching nearly 11 years after itaired I would say it held up pretty well for its time. The music pieces in this show vary. The songs used in the OP were edgy and memeable in my opinion, and I couldn't help but laugh every time I heard them by how serious they tried to take themselves with them. However, sifting through the garbage you will find some pretty good pieces. I remember the first time I heard Low of Solipsism and listened to it for at least 40 minutes on repeat. \\n\\n\r\n(Continuing good things) *****Minor Spoilers******\\n\\n\r\nAs the story follows Light Yagami the same way Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a good guy does evil things for good and you get to see the main character deteriorate into something you kind of hate. I personally love the idea of show and the story type that I just stated. With that being said I was at about episode 9 and I thought to myself \"Wow this show is great, everyone was right\". Unfortunately, the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nI will try my best not to pin point every scene that I disliked, while also not being super vague here. Since I will be referencing things that happen HERE IS A MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, and with that being said I will start my rant on what I hated about Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts out with Light being creative with the book but leaving a reasonable way for L to to have an idea to who/where Kira is. A good example is the first kill Light made, and how L determined the area based on where it was broadcasted to. A really fun and reasonable game of cat and mouse. Later, when there are 2 Kiras he automatically knows that there are now two people being Kira. My problem with this is that he throws out all other options to have the plot armor.. er anti plot armor? to prove to the audience that he is the best detective ever. As for him locking on to Light, I don't have a problem with this. The way he handles the situation is actually brain dead. \"You think im the killer?!?!? Let me go WAY out of my way to prove it to you that im not.\" Where the smart option here is not to try to prove your innocence so much that it makes you look guilty. Just an opinion on my part.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show goes on the assumptions that L makes start to hold less and less ground. The show begins to sound alot like kids arguing when they are play fighting. However, the show is not bad at this point... until episode 26. L was most people's favorite character, and while I didn't think he was great his replacement was near pitiful. I believe the show said that Near \"studied the case\" before taking over, but the fact that it seemed like he knew every thought pattern that L had for justifying his judgement was insane. At this point they pretty much made a less likable character to pursue Light that needed even less logic for his accusations.\\n\r\nFrom here on out I absolutely despised the show to put it lightly, the final few episodes seemed to be an all out war against Yu-Gi-Oh to prove that they could make their characters have more plot armor than any other show in existence. The once fun and reasonable arguments made turned into literally \" I predicted that you would predict that I would predict that so I did this\" -*\"Oh yeah? Well I predicted that you would predict that I would predict that so I predicted you would do that so I did this HA\". \\n\r\nAlot of people say that they saw this when they were young and it has always been one of their favorite anime. im not sure if its because of my lack of bias towards this because im not watching it through nostalgia goggles that makes me not appreciate it so much. As the show went on for me I seemed to literally enjoy it less until it seemed like a job for me to finish. Maybe I missed out on some key things because of it? Probably not, overall the anime is a 5. What started out with great potential eventually ended as what I would consider one of the biggest let downs that I've seen.",

            "content": "Well, Death Note. A name pretty much everyone who watches anime knows. This series is great and will keep a viewer interested almost nonstop.\r\nStory: The story is completely original and was one of the coolest stories ever. A 17 year old finds a notebook that kills the person of whoever's name is written in it. Sounds legit. The story is honestly very cool, but it can be confusing at some points during the middle of the series. But, one complaint I do have is the weakness of the second season after a tragic event. Pretty much every watcher can agree the second season was OKcompared to the first. But, the pros here outweigh the cons. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very well done. All the characters look clean and crisp, and the backgrounds were drawn in amazingly. Overall, the art is great. Not much to say in this section.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Ok, I loved the sound in this show A LOT. The first opening was cool and sweet, showing us pretty much every character that appears in the first season. The second opening is Japanese screamo witch is also freaking awesome, and this time, showing us every character in the second season.  The BGM was all very cool, and each main character had several themesongs and all of them fit the corresponding characters perfectly. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were the best part of the show. Light was a cool character although he honestly was a jerk to everyone. All the other minor characters were very cool and I liked them. Then...L. By far my favorite male character in any anime series. He is the coolest character in this show and almost anyone can agree on that. L's students, Mello and Near were okay. I liked Mello more because he was violent, and Near was...strange. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I give this area a 9/10 because the second season really lacked for me compared to the first season, and I guess my expectation for the second season was too high. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Death Note is a must watch for anyone, anime lover or not. The story draws you in very quickly and continues to until the very end. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review of Death Note ^-^",

            "content": "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. - Friedrich Nietzsche\r\nDeath Note is a thriller of the highest order, I'm sure Dean Koontz, Stephen King and Naoki Urasawa are proud of Tsugumi Ohba's accomplishment within the genre of supernatural/psychological thriller. I also saw somewhere on the web that a person listed Death Note's genre as chess master, I feel that is a fitting description as well. \r\nWhen I watched Death Note the first time the only animations I had previouslyseen were a Gundam and Initial D; that is to say I had no idea what anime was about. Boy was I taken by surprise by the very dense philosophical questioning the watcher is subjected to. I felt as though the questions of morals and values, of right and wrong, were intense enough to allow for personal growth in the audience. We know reality TV doesn't lead to personal growth but the same can be said for most fiction. Point being that it is a rarity to see television that can be a catalyst for psychological or philosophical growth, thank you Death Note for keeping it real within the realm of the unreal.... fiction.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Death Note, I was displeased with the ending, but let us be honest. It only could've ended one way, and so that is the way it ended. \\n\\n\r\nBest Attempt at being Spoiler Free.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The beginning is flawless, dark and smooth. As the story becomes more complex it becomes more desirable until \"N\" No one likes \"N\". There is even redemption to \"M,\" but none for \"N\". I didn't love how it all ultimately went down, but I am of the belief that it had to happen that way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Very Good, no coomplaints\\n\\n\r\nSound: Both English and Japanese Voice Actors were on point. English Voice Actors were really on point all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Light, L, Ryuk, Misa Misa and others were all fantastic. But no one likes \"N\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Excellent, drags at the end, but still excellent and definitely worth seeing through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10, a top anime, I don't think that's a refutable statement \\n\\n",

Light, the criminal and L, a very well known detective.  Light gets his hands on a Shinigami's death bookand whoever's name is written in the book dies.  L wants to find the identity of the person who is behind this all, i.e. Light. But Light is much smarter than this and catching him is not easy.

            "content": "If you watch anime, I highly suggest that you watch Death Note. It is a story about detectives, serial killers, Shinigami, and apples. With such an outrageous premise, you might think that Death Note is kind of ridiculous or that it might have sloppy storytelling. No, Death Note is a clean, dark, and serious drama.\r\nI give the story a 10 out of 10. When I was watched Death Note, the story went where I thought it would go. It was predictable, most stories follow a certain flow. But when it counted, Death Note would swiftly take a turn and take the story in a placethat I did not expect and I loved it. There was never really a moment in the story where I would think \"Well, that was kind of dumb\". No, if anything I constantly thinking \"What's going to happen next?\" or \"What's happening?\" followed by \"WOW\" or \"I didn't expect that\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unique and memorable. I give them a 10 out of 10. Light is a genius student who over the course of the show becomes more sinister and deviant. As you watch the show, you'll just start to think \"Is he really going to win?\" There is also the young and intelligent detective,  L, who is the antagonist of the anime. L is a genius who is in a constant mental war with Light. And like Light, you are going to ask yourself, \"Is he really going to win?\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable show. Death Note is pretty much just a battle of minds between Light and L, but the way the show carries and presents the battle, you'll enjoy it as much as you would a physical fight. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is a 10 out of 10. Sure, it's not perfect. But whether you love it or hate it, you have to admit that Death Note is an important part of anime and the otaku culture.",

            "content": "Death Note is one of the best series of all time. I won't say it's absolutely the best (for example I liked Higurashi no Naku Koro ni better), but still on top.\r\nImagine chess and then add awesomness, and you'll get Death Note. This is the best way of describing it. But now I'll end glorifying this serie and try to describe why it's this good.\r\nThis anime contains of two parts, and you'll know when one ends and the other begins. I will call them halves. I liked the first half way better than second. It's like this for me: at first I couldn't believe it'sthis awesome. Main character  does whatever he wants  with style. And then second genius gets introduced making this anime even more awesome. I lived from one episode to other, can't wait what they'll do. Then another important character gets introduced. Just for the couple episodes around this event this serie deserves being on top of the best anime list. But then there's one accident, we get a few rather boring episodes of not knowing what is happening and a couple of them without this tension and stuff. Then we finally get what we'd been waiting for, there's about two \"old style\" episodes, and... accident ending the first half happens. I didn't like much anything after it. We get two more characters, but they're just lame. And this anime goes like this, without the old tension nearly to end. I'll be honest - I stopped watching this serie few times, but returned to it there. And there's the end: three last episodes that are just too good. They're like all epicness that second half should have got released there. If anybody had made a serie this good and with 12 episodes, the world wouldn't bear the amount of awesomness, and would end. I personally thought Death Note has 36, not 37 episodes, and when 36th one ended on cliffhanger I nearly got heart attack. Seriously.\\n\r\nThe first half and the three last episodes are the reason why this anime is scored so high. Go. Watch. Enjoy.",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nHow far would you go for justice? Would you throw away your ideals if you had the chance to \u201ccleanse the world of evil\u201d? What even are your views on justice and just how far would you go if you suddenly had the chance to make those thoughts come true. As it has once been said before, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a man when he has nothing, give him power and that\u2019s a true test of his character.\u201d\r\nDeath note is an anime that can be classed as a mystery, thriller type show but in actual fact it explores many more themes. It is a show that willchallenge your sense of morality and will make you answer some very tricky questions as to what extent you can justify them in certain situations.\\n\r\nShort summary\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a notebook that falls out of the sky and our main protagonist, Light Yagami, just happens to chance by it and picks up the notebook. This is no ordinary notebook however, as it is proclaimed within the notebook that whoever\u2019s name is written in the notebook shall die as long as certain rules are met. This notebook is known as the \u201cDeath Note\u201d. One other thing is this, when you pick up the death note only you can see the death god to whom the book belongs to. Ryuk is the death god aka Shinigami, that Light can see and he is one of the most sly of the Shinigami. While quirky and jumpy on the outside, he is really quite dark and uncaring, as you would expect from a Shinigami. For Ryuk the events that unfold are all really just a cure for his boredom.\\n\r\nLight Yagami himself is a university student and ranks amongst the best in Japan and is an aspiring police detective with a strong sense of justice, his own father being the police chief of the Japanese police. Light tests out the notebook to find out that it actually works and from this point on, he believes that he is the chosen one, the one who must cleanse the world of evil, even going as far as proclaiming himself to be god. He starts off killing smaller criminals and eventually begins to upscale his targets, at which point the killings cannot go unnoticed and this is where the main plot starts to pick up.\\n\r\nSomeone needs to find this killer, but when he can kill using simply a notebook, it isn\u2019t so easy and many detectives give up. There is one detective however who keeps at it, introduced simply as \u201cL\u201d, and the rest of the plot revolves around how Light and \u201cL\u201d are locked in a battle where Light tries to keep killing, while \u201cL\u201d has to figure out who he is. The scenarios that follow are extremely satisfying and at points awe-inspiring as both men are pitted against each other in a battle of wits and guile \u2013 often resulting in some very unexpected situations. This game of cat and mouse is enthralling, in fact calling it \u201ccat and mouse\u201d might give off the wrong sort off idea of how the whole finding the killer situation pans out. Put plainly when both your own father and L are after you, it adds a different dimension to the whole scenario. For most of the anime, Light and L are usually in contact and it is here that the unique twist kicks in. It\u2019s as the saying goes, when you\u2019re looking for something, you may look far and wide, but you will always miss the things right and front of you and this saying has some bearing on the show. Where other detectives would be left dumbfounded and unsure of themselves, L instead comes as a breath of fresh air, completely different to the typical detective and so much more quirky (with an undying love for cake). L is a man who knows to look at a situation from almost every angle and combined with his razor-sharp instincts, he is a man to be feared once he is after you.\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSince the show is spread over 37 episodes, there is plenty opportunity to really flesh out each character. Death note achieves this straight of the bat, Light and L are both extremely well developed throughout the show. However on top of that, the other key characters such as Light\u2019s father, Misaki, other members on the police task force and even the Shinigami themselves are all extremely well developed and help to mould the story as it goes along. What is really helpful however, is that each of the different characters fulfil their roles extremely well, each of them add their own twist to the story and are often instrumental in the way things pan out. There are people from all sides and all allegiances and the way they are scripted, it means there never really is a dull moment. In fact calling them side-characters feels like an injustice, in Death Note, the show really is made by the entire cast.\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very rock heavy and involve loads of screaming. It\u2019s mostly down to personal taste but I found them to be ok, except at certain times I found the shouting to be a bit much and as a result found myself to be skipping the OP pretty much every episode. The music that is used to enhance the scenes however is great, it does the job and does it well and that\u2019s all there is to it. Many scenes actually tend to omit the music and focus on the sharp, witty dialogue and in a way the lack of background music works much better, helping to hold the tension in the air.\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFor a 2006/7 anime, the art style is rather nice. The colours aren\u2019t too in your face nor is it overly dreary-given the overhanging dark theme, they\u2019ve balanced it just right. The characters themselves look fairly realistic for an anime and the backgrounds are always very detailed, giving you a much fuller and richer experience.\\n\r\nOverall Satisfaction\\n\r\nThe show was certainly one of those which leave you completely empty at the end and wanting for more because it was just that good. It\u2019s a classic show which will give you the \u201cvoid\u201d. The story is really what drives this show and it\u2019s one of the best, most original shows you can find out there. It\u2019s one thing having a good story though, and it\u2019s something else to execute it perfectly.\\n\r\nTukky 12",

Kira (Light) is a person who thinks that death is the ultimate solution for crime. L is a person who thinks that criminals should be tried then imprisoned, and just thinks of Kira as a lowly murder. The perspective of the story is told from Light's view, but you will get to see from L's perspective from time to time. About little over half way through something happens and the plot takes a turn for the worst until the last two episodes. The lasttwo episodes were simply, epic. Now that word is over used a lot nowadays but, I am confident that you will think so too.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGreatest art style I have ever seen, amazing detail. Awesome character models.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot only are the last two openings awe worthy if you like metal, but the music in the anime perfectly sets the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll characters  are designed well and each have their own unique personality. Misa is the happy-go-lucky girl with a feeble mind, but makes up for it by being Kira's girlfriend and greatest worshiper.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said before the story is the absolute best until blank Dies. It just gets boring for this portion of the anime, but the ending makes up for it all. And my favorite character is introduced during this period.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nRegardless of the dry period, this is my favorite anime ever.

And even then there will be quite a few things that still have you puzzled.\r\nThe main character, Light Yagami, a stellar high school student, comes across a notebook called the 'Death Note' dropped by a shinigami named Ryuk. The whole story is of Light's image of creating a world cleansed of all evil using this notebook, and the detective L's attempts to prevent him from doing so. Because after all, is it just and is it right to kill other peoplewho are labelled as 'evil' in order to create a 'non-evil' world? And surely the person doing so is 'evil' themselves?\\n\\n\r\nDealing with the illogical and slightly dark side of morals and ethics, Death Note is a fast-paced story that will have you puzzled at times, and having to rewatch episode after episode just to understand what is happening. But I guarantee you will enjoy every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, composed by Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi, is perfectly matched to this anime.

What is lacking in action is more than made up for with intelligent story telling, and a very psychological intense scenario. A high school kid finds a note book, if he sees a picture, and knows their name, he can write it in the book and kill them, and write how it will happen. This power corrupts. The story gets intense as they call in a special investigator who is as witty and intelligentas the killer. The two battle in a chess match of death.\\n\r\nFor sure this is one of the best anime to hit the shelves in the past 10 years. If you are into intelligent story telling, and character driven anime, I highly recommend this. This is a very cool dark and Erie series. Perfect for us weirdos.

What I also love about this Anime is there is no antagonist or protagonist. There's no set 'good guy' or 'bad guy'. It's like you, the viewer, get to choose who's side you want to take. \r\nJust like with sports. Here a lot of people say 'Cubs or Sox?' well for me it's 'Kira or L?'\r\nThe story kept me interested and if I ever missed an episode of Death Note when it first aired I wouldfrantically search for it on the internet and watch it. If you miss one episode of Death Note and don't watch it, you might not get a clue whats been going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very amazing as well. I love how L turned out although at some points I wish he could have been better drawn. Light seemed to look good all the time though, same with Ryuk. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise it's good but I was hoping for more of a rock type soundtrack if you get what I mean. Mello's theme is my favorite mainly because it includes well....COOL GUITAR STUFF....YEAH.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. We have Light who turned out to be surprisingly evil. I liked him at first but then he just got...too insane for my liking. And then there's L. Most girls seem to like L because he's 'hot' or 'awesome'. I for one like L because of the way he thinks. It's just so freking amazing how he thinks and takes apart every little piece of information.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you don't watch this Anime or at least briefly see one clip of it, you're totally missing out. Death Note has claimed number one Anime in my heart and I hope that this review will be enough to convince someone to watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Intro: Are you a fan of M. Night Shyamalan or movies with cool psychological and intellectual story elements? If so, you've come to the right place. A lot of people tell me that Death Note is one of their favorite anime and after finally watching it, I finally understand why. Not my personal favorite or even in my top twenty, but I had a lot of fun watching this anime. It's a pretty unique story with fun characters to watch as they progress and grow. Now that that's out of the way, let me begin my review. I'll try my best to restrain myself fromrevealing key information and spoilers, but I might not be able to stop myself. You've been warned! \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n     The story begins with our main character Light Yagami. An overly intelligent high school senior in Japan who's unbelievably bored with life.\\n\r\nOne day, as he looks out the window from his class, he sees a mysterious notebook drop from the sky titled \"death note\". He picks it up and reads the instructions when he gets home. The instructions say something along the lines of \"if you write a person's name, that person will die\". That's the main thing you'll need to know. Soon after using the death note, Light meets Ryuk, a shinigami or demon from another world. Ryuk then explains to Light Yagami about the rules of the death note and Light eventually takes on a super cheesy god-complex or alter ego known as Kira. By using the death note, Kira kills criminals and those who are judged as evil according to Kira. Alright, so when I said the story \"was unique\", I might have been semi-exaggerating. The truth is, the whole demons interacting with the human word has been done over and over in anime, but I did take into account that this anime came out in 2006 so I gave it some slack. Anyway, as far as the story goes, be prepared for a lot of surprises and pay attention to detail. This is not an anime for those of you looking for cheap entertainment. Even though the story was thought provoking, there were a few times where situations got repetitive and dull. There were also times where I could guess plot twists before they were revealed. Overall, good story, but bad rhythm. Some episodes felt really long and some felt too short. \\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10): \\n\\n\r\n     Before I say anything about the art, keep in mind AGAIN that this anime came out in 2006. So, it's not super beautiful, but it has its moments. For example, I really enjoyed scenes with blood and gore. All the characters were really nice to look at and the colors in every scene were evenly distributed. The moods were set appropriately for almost every scene. Also, I really enjoyed the color schemes for when Light had his inner monologues. I also really enjoyed the art for the intro and outro of every episode. Overall, pretty good art. \\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10):\\n\\n\r\n     I think this might be a tricky category for this anime only because the background music got cheesy some times. I love dramatic music, but it became a little too much to bear at times. EVERY TIME Light had an inner monologue, there would be dramatic music playing super loudly. Sometimes it distracted me from what Light was saying. As far as character voices go, I watched the dub version so I can't say much about the Japanese dubbing. The English dub was amazing though. Probably some of the best English voice acting I've heard in a while. As far as the intro/outro songs go, they were really nice to hear. Overall, pretty good music and voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10):\\n\\n\r\n    Another tricky category to judge. Our main character Light Yagami was awesome at first, but eventually got annoying and crazy. I liked him all the way up until halfway through the season. He's an extremely intelligent character and you'll see him overcome some harsh situations. You'll be rooting for him for awhile, but you'll eventually get tired of him. The other important characters like Light's father and Light's girlfriend are pretty rad, but they don't do much in the series. Light's girlfriend is pretty important to the plot, but she's such a dumb bimbo at times that I just want her  to go away. Light's father is probably one of my favorite characters, but I absolutely hate the way the series uses him. Another important character is \"L\", a private investigator who tries to bring Kira --  Light Yagami's alter ego --  to justice. Overall, decent characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10):\\n\\n\r\n     Despite some of this anime's obvious flaws, I enjoyed watching almost every episode. I was hardly ever bored and when I was, I just pulled through and kept watching. And honestly, the resulting episodes were extremely worth it. Almost every episode plants a seed for later episodes by foreshadowing certain characters, events, objects, etc. There's also a recap at the beginning of every episode so you don't have to watch the whole series in one sitting. Overall, I enjoyed this anime A LOT. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10):\\n\\n\r\n    To be quite honest, the only reason I didn't rate this anime any higher was because it got repetitive, obvious and dull sometimes. Not only that, but it was really noticeable when that happened. Anyway, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something intellectual to watch. I had fun watching this series and I don't regret watching it in one sitting.",

            "content": "Story Summary:\r\nThe story in death note revolves around Light Yagami, and outsanding student (smartest of Japan) who is pretty bored by school. A Shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk drops his Death Note in to the earth world. The Death Note is a notebook in which you can write names to kill people in whichever way you like. Light finds the book and tries to use it to kill every criminal in the world to make the world a better place. Soon, the best detective in the world mysteriously named L finds out about the killings, and sets up a task force to catch thekiller. After that it becomes a battle of L finding Light and the other way around, containing all kinds of plot twists, and never stops entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story revolves around a few set main characters, the side-characters switch constantely through the story. Although the plot-twists sometimes go a bit to far in my opinion, that's about the only negative thing I can say about the story. The suspense is amazing, as the plot-twists keep you on your toes as nothing is impossible. The battle between L and Light is a battle of two extremely smart people, and therefore lots of really smart plans are plotted which adds to the suspense even more. This makes the anime very exciting, from beginning to end. Also I must say that it's outstanding that the story is evenly good all the way, it has no ups and downs.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are one of the best, if not the best I've ever seen in a series. Dead-on quality animation combined with extreme eye for detail. It clearly shows the expression of every person, which gives you a clear idea of what they are feeling and thinking. A great example of this is Light when he is handling the notebook; he looks really angelic when he talks to others, but when he's on his own he looks like the devil.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting\\n\\n\r\nOriginal: The voice-acting in the original are done beautifully. Light and L express the emotions very well. Again Light has the possibility to sound very angelic, but when he's alone he speaks of his \"new world\" with a lot of evil sounding passion. The other side characters are not all as well done as the main characters, but no one is annoying or bad. In general the voice acting differs between some of the best I've ever heard and just very good.\\n\\n\r\nDub: The Engish dub is not as good as the original, but that does not make it bad by any means. Light takes a bit of time to get used to, but when you are he's still pretty good. L is dead-on, and so are some of the side characters. In the end I recommend the Sub over the Dub, but if you want to watch subs (because you watch at night, or you have problems with reading or anything like that) I wouldn't say you shouldn't watch it at all, just get the dub.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound in Death Note is the best sound I've heard in anime. The sound always adds to the suspense. Also it's never annoying or in the way of the story or visuals, it just perfectly fits in.\\n\\n\r\nRe-Watch Value.\\n\\n\r\nThe re-watch value of death note is there to some extend, however it is one of the weakest points of death note (not that that says anything). You surely want to see the series another time, however not more than once or twice. The reason to rewatch it is because you can only see the real beauty of the story after the second time, also you'd want to rewatch it because of the ingenious plans the main characters make. However the problem with the story is that the plot twists and therefore the tension is gone after the first time.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend everyone to watch Death Note. Even if you are not an anime fan, you're probably still going to like it. If you haven't seen it (which is unlikely if your on this site) go watch it. NOW!\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________ ______________________________\\n\r\n(c) of review @ DVH.

I know the 1st part was definitely the better of the two but the 2nd was also very good. In the end they could have done without the 2nd part, but by no means was it bad. I actually enjoyed it nonetheless, overall better than most anime series that I've seen.\r\nPutting that aside the overall story is unique and enjoyable. If you like stories of geniuses competing head to head ina battle of wits you'll love the crap out of this. It makes you think and it jumps out and surprises you again and again, if you are one of the people that figures out one of Light's many plans before it is revealed, you are one of the few and you will feel like a genius as well. That being said the replay value on this is shot down to a solid medium.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is one of the best of any anime I've seen. There's not much to say about sound, it fits. The openings and closings are good too, but the 2nd one is a little much even though it kind of fits. The art is fine especially for it's time but nothing special. I will say this though. These are the tallest anime characters of any anime I've ever seen! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10, you will not find many anime that will fit the 10/10 category in my books for this. It's one of those shows that will have you intrigued until the end. Even the 2nd part not being as good as the first will have you wanting more. Don't let the fact that the 1st part was a little better discourage you from enjoying the 2nd part as well. That being said you can just as easily stop watching in the middle because the 2 halves are split into almost completely different stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

Light is an exceptional character which believes that his way is the only way to \"righting the world\" and toward the end, you really start to want him to succeed. The story line has many little (or not so little) strategic moves that is almost representative of a game of chess. The constant mental battle between Light and L really keeps this anime on its toes, at least in suspense wise. I highly suggest this animeto anyone out there looking for something different then just your regular battle anime, for this anime requires you to sit down and use your brain.",

            "content": "It really makes me happy to see a show with an interesting premise like Death Note take over the West by storm. It's something that breaks the norm and gets people to think rather than just to entertain. However the more pessimistic side of me underneath the surface makes me draw a skeptical eye towards something with a premise such as this that's actually this popular. So is it good? Despite how flawed and open ended that question is, yes. However it's a very tricky type of show to watch depending on your expectations. I went into the show and started watching it hoping tofind an interesting gem about ethics and the implications of death. However as the show progressed it took off in a far different way with bits and pieces of the Note's philosophical implications scattered unevenly throughout. Given the fact that the initial premise was set up well enough to make both of these aspects of the show work, it's conclusion was underwhelming, and it's first and foremost a supernatural mystery thriller.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is first and foremost a police story, not one about ethics.  It starts out as a story about a boy with a god complex and ends on the same note without much catharsis, but what's sandwiched in-between goes above and beyond the average mystery thriller. However instead of figuring out a mystery throughout the course of the show, it's all about the mental tension and conflict between the characters instead. It breaks the norm from other shows similar to it and focusing on Light trying to one-up everyone over solving the Kira killings.  This not only broke the norm but kept Light and L's mental battle interesting in the first half. Granted most of that happened through chance and internal monologues that ultimately don't uncover much, but Light and L's thought processes around the case were the most compelling part of the show, and I was surprised at how much creative power the writers put into each character. But I'll refuse to call the show a game between minds. The processes themselves are what interested me, not what plot they brought forward. While much of the plot is fun to watch much of what happens is all a little to convenient to be taken 100 percent seriously. Calling Death Note a show about mind games is like calling a lottery ticket a sodoku puzzle; it uses chances and coincidences to move the plot forward instead of taking a strand of evidence found by the characters and having the plot unfold from that. The chances and coincidences made the show interesting and compelling to watch, but the climax is just a boring game of jenga. Many of the plot devices don't lead up to a lot, and I was hoping for more answers about how the Kira killings were affecting society at large. I also wanted to know more about the Shinigami realm, because if they can put rules in the Death Note does their realm have rules too? Both were interesting aspects of the show that would have evened out all the creative brain that the show had with a little bit of message and heart.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of surface level stuff, Death Note is a very aesthetically sound show. It knows what it wants to do with it's art and sound and for the most part it does it really well. The characters designs are all creative in their own way outfit-wise and facially, and for a show that boasts quite the large cast of characters you always see more than once, this makes the aesthetic great through and through. Other shows tend to introduce more and more characters and their designs are generally carbon copies of each other or mirror characters from other shows, which make them feel like a weaker clone (for example L and Near) of the original than an entirely new character. And for a show in an urban setting where costumes and characters are more 'normal' it's noteworthy that the creators don't recycle character ideas often. The normalcy of the character design choices also makes the presence of the not-normal Shinigami even more even more jarring to the characters and the way the gods of death move the show along. They also make brilliantly mysterious and dark urban setting of the show grittier. The feel of the setting adds an extra layer of depth to the dark subject matter of the show. Even during the daytime and in the business meeting scenes there's an eerie filter over everything despite the obvious light sources.  However while the art and character design is good at reflecting the dark nature of the show, the choir singing during the action scenes was very cool but far overstayed its welcome. The music in the show isn't much to be praised, but the second intro is so good and plays reflects the chaotic nature of the second half of the show so it almost makes up for the repetitive background music.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I really did like the characters. For me many of the background police officers and L were well defined as people. L is by far the most reasonable and fleshed out character in the show who is the most grounded in the reasons for is actions and why he's so peculiar. The fact that he doesn't get out much and is smarter than all the other characters is clearly established, makes the most sense, and makes him the most likeable character in his peculiarity. Same goes for Ryuk, he's a well defined, delightfully simple, and has a very Tim Burton quality to his character. However my problems with the characters lay in Light and Misa, as to why anyone would call either likeable is beyond me. Light in particular irritated me. He has this plan to be a god, but why? Its hard to not think of him as an angsty teen sociopath and possible Atlas Shrugged-thumper without giving him reasoning and introspection behind the more controversial killings of people who want to get in his way. It's even harder to like a character like that, let alone watch them go on said merry way for 37 episodes without some eye rolling. However the positive that both Light and L share is that they both have a full arc and are backed up by supporting and background characters that are simple, but aren't just names on paper.  The problem is that I can't say the same about major players in the second half like Mello and Near, who serve as inherent antagonists rather than interesting contributors for the story's sake. The imagery of the toys and trains did good to represent Near's childlike mind and brilliance, but like I said before there's all brain and no heart to he and Mello's rivalry. So while some of the characters are good, they don't bear full arcs that are relevant to the overarching story, and make the second half of the show significantly weaker than the first.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Death Note is flawed it's by no means a bad show. It could have been fleshed out far more and far exceeded with the brilliant supernatural drama that it tries to get across. The flaws of the show don't outweigh the pure originality invention engine that it is. The problem it suffers from is reaching for the cookie jar without taking the necessary steps to reach to the top of the refrigerator. Instead likes talking about how it's going to do it rather than taking the climb, but the plotting and talking sure is entertaining.",

            "content": "SPOILERS\r\nI'm disappointed in the ridiculous worship this anime series has gotten.  The problem is that the story has WAY too many fake contrivances.  Moreover, it suffers from perhaps the most common failing when a writer tries to write a story about geniuses...  Because the writer himself is not a genius, he will necessarily fail at coming up with believable strokes of genius.  Instead you get contrivances.\r\nWould a genius really think the way to make Earth a paradise is to implement the death penalty for all crime?  No, a genius, or even any pretty smart person, would realize that crime isa symptom more than a problem, and the harm from crime is frankly trivial compared to the harm of unfair allocation of world resources (so that millions starve while others throw away millions of tons of food each year), wars based on misplaced nationalism and prejudices, poor educational systems that spawn societies full of people who do not have the critical thinking skills needed to make democracy work as it was intended, and rampant environmental destruction, to name a few.  Seriously, no \"genius\" is going to come into possession of Death Note and then dedicate himself to wiping out crime.\\n\\n\r\nA number of really serious contrivances have to take place for Light to actually becoming the prime suspect of being Kira.  I mean, seriously, he can kill by writing a name down with absolutely no physical evidence linking the death to himself.  It is literally the perfect crime.  It should have been impossible for him to come under suspicion.  Even if the first few deaths led investigators to focus on an area of Japan, that is still thousands (tens of thousands?  Hundreds of thousands?  Millions?) of people.\\n\\n\r\nOr the contrivance that Light's father happens to wind up working on the international team to stop Kira?\\n\\n\r\nOr the crazy contrivances needed for L to go from viewing Light as the prime suspect, to then suspecting a famous model of being the prime suspect, then deciding neither is Kira, then Light and the model wind up dating...  Seriously?  Your two prime Kira suspects are a couple, and that does not make you suspicious?  \\n\\n\r\nHow about the way that, in a world based totally in science like ours, when L and the cops realize there is a magic book that can kill if you write a person's name in it, all they can think about is catching the guy who has the book?  Wouldn't this require a HUGE amount of soul-searching, re-thinking everything you thought was real and phony?  Is the real mystery here who is using Death Note to commit murder, or HOW THE HELL IS THERE A MAGIC BOOK THAT KILLS IF YOU WRITE A NAME IN IT?!!!  Somehow that conversation never comes up.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and basically every conversation between L and Light, it is as if Light is screaming \"I'm Kira!\"  Seriously, if you ask some one if they are Kira, and they answer, \"Well, if I was, I sure wouldn't tell you, right, so I guess the question is kind if pointless...\"  Uh, yeah, that guys guilty.  That's not how innocent people talk.  Every conversation, Light says stuff that is absolutely what you would expect him to say if he was Kira toying with Light, not if he was Light who was not Kira.\\n\\n\r\nNo one bats an eye that this friggin' HIGH SCHOOL student is suddenly dating a celebrity model?\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the odds Light and L both are tennis gurus?  I mean, there are a lot of sports to excel at.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the heck is wrong with the model chick that she actually surrenders half her life to find Kira, and when she does she then agrees when he wants her to sacrifice half her remaining life again to further his plans?  What are the odds the finder of the second Death Note is going to be so incredibly ripe for jumping into slavish cult-like devotion to the first Death Note holder?  I'd imagine that personality time is VERY VERY rare.  Yet as it turns out Light basically NEEDED her to be like that to get himself out the ridiculous jam that he became the prime Kira suspect in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cat-mouse game between L and Light was not \"genius,\" it insults your intelligence because is so fake and contrived.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and am I the only one bothered by Light's total lack of libido?  He's a teenager.  A top model is worshiping him, and all he can think about is his Death Note plans?  There is no explanation given for his total lack of libido or passion.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, if you watch, you'll notice that L and Light basically talk the same, in the same kind of faux-smart-person way.  The writer could not even come up with two distinct voices for them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had a couple things going for it:  I very interesting, original and edgy premise; a high amount of wish-fulfillment (gee, main character is smartest kid in Japan?  check  Adored by model?  check  Had special powers?  check...  And add to that a very slick production.  Oh, and it 's quite short. \\n\\n\r\nWhen an anime series has only 37 episodes and people admit it really starts to drag somewhere in the 20's... Well, that basically confirms that this is not a deep anime, nor one that can stand the test of time.  It is a flash in the pan.  Now, when an Anime goes hundreds of episodes and is getting better, and fans are crushed when it ends....that can be called a great Anime.  \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is crap, and if you like it, you probably have not seen much anime at all.\\n",

Of course, they became hooked- it's impossible not to.\r\nLight believes that the world is rotten, and so vows to create a world without evil, using his 'Death Note'. The mood of the series is dark, and it follows the chilling battle of wits between Light, and a detective known only as 'L'. The sheer brilliance of both characterscreates a mind game that will have you shaking with excitement as strategies and plans unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also challenges ideals/moral values and you'll have to think hard about your idea of justice as you pick a side- or are unable to.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative I can think of is that it felt forced after the 25th episode, but don't let that stop you from watching- it truly is an incredible series.\\n\\n\r\nNote: watch with subtitles- the English voice acting simply isn't as good as watching in the original Japanese.\\n\\n\r\n*The Verdict* Death Note is a dark psychological thriller and you will enjoy watching characters make impossible deductions and work their way out of impossible situations. By far one of my favorite series, I absolutely recommend Death Note as a must see.",

            "content": "\"No matter how gifted you are, you alone cannot change the world...\"\r\nWhat if you could? What if you were given the opportunity to change the world? How would you go about doing this? It could go either way, you could change it for the better, or for the worse. However, at first this question seems unrealistic, very few people have been able to do it. Just like the quote says, a single person cannot change the world. In most cases, this is true. You'd need the help from thousands of people in order to make something that has a lasting effect on the entire world.It's a good scenario to run through in your head, but that's all it's really good for, a mind game.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, every once in a while, someone will attempt to make a change on the world. For example, Adolf Hitler was able to take control of Germany and cause one of the most devastating wars on humanity, all because he had the idea he could change the world. There are others, too. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Alexander the Great... these people were extraordinary. Granted, Adolf Hitler didn't exactly help the world in any way, but he was given the opportunity to change the world, and he did.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the perfect example of this question I have brought up. A story about a student in Japan who has been given the opportunity to change the world, for better or for worse... I present to you, Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nEnter our main protagonist/antagonist (whichever way you want to go), Light Yagami, a teenager who has realized that the world we live in is full of evil. Murder, rape, theft, any kind of crime you can think of, the world is full of it... and then one day, he finds a notebook of death, that causes the person who's name is written in it do die. Seeing his opportunity to change the world and become a God to everyone, he starts his journey to rid the world of evil, one name at a time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is one you can't just multitask to. You need to watch and listen to it well in order to understand what's going on. It's complicated and detailed, but it makes the story that much better. Full of twists and turns, love and loss, partnerships and betrayals, Death Note has it all. A truly unique and original story, with an ending that will leave fans satisfied or upset. Either way, this is Grade A screenwriting.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note was brought to us by Studio Madhouse, and let me say, this studio gives anime a realistic point of view in terms of artwork and visuals, which is a nice change from other anime with cool, yet unrealistic, art styles. The characters were designed with realism and perfection, and the scenery had a dark, yet satisfying feeling. A good break.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dub VS English Sub... I must say, that in terms of the English Dub, Death Note has one of the best casts you can find in America now a days. Each voice actor and actress fit their roles perfectly, giving off a feeling that they were born to play their characters. It makes me want to hear more of their voices in other anime, especially Alessandro Juliani, who voiced L. He has very few roles, but he played an excellent L. As for the subbed cast, I can honestly say I prefer the dubbed, even though both versions were quite well done.\\n\\n\r\n4 characters will be talked about in this review, due to the fact that I probably wouldn't be able to talk about any more than that amount without giving too much about the series away. First off, we have Light Yagami... spoiler alert, HE'S KIRA! Light is a genius, which makes him the perfect role of the God of the \"New World\". He has every criminal investigator after his head, and he's been able to figure out how to stay out of their line of sight, and he is excellent at doing so. Next up is L, or Ryuzaki if reading the letter \"L\" is too tough on the eyes. Ryuzaki is the #1 criminal investigator in the world, being able to solve every unsolved case he's been faced with. Within a matter of episodes, he's able to pinpoint what location Kira might be hiding in with very little information. A good match against Light if I do say so myself. And then there's Ryuk, the Shinigami who dropped the Death Note that Light now possesses. He is, in my opinion, the comical relief in this dark series. His love of apples and terrifying, clown-like appearance, makes me enjoy seeing him every time he comes on the screen. Not to mention he kind of scares the crap out of me. I like that in a character. And then, there's the one character I had a problem with, Misa-Misa. A supermodel with the same power as Light who is just begging to be hit whenever she comes on screen. She was a key character in the series, and I'm okay with her role in terms of that, but frankly, she was just so... annoying. Without her, Light might have had a bit more trouble keeping out of trouble with the police, but at the same time, she causes about as much trouble as he would without her... Other than those few minor things, the list of characters in the series were all excellent.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note, without a doubt, is an anime that should be watched by both anime lovers, and those who don't care for anime but enjoy a good mystery/supernatural series. A great and detailed storyline, stunning artwork, great voice acting, interesting characters, and 37 episodes of pure excitement is what makes Death Note a keeper if you ever see it for sale on Amazon. I guarantee a lot of Death Note fans will agree.",

But I just had to give it a chance. Because all my friends were watching the anime. And so I watched the first episode.\r\nThe story got me! It isn't about someone with a notebook just killing people, no, the whole essence of the story is about morality. When is someone good and when is some a bad person? If you get divine power, would you use it to clean up the world by people youjudge to be bad? And is killing bad people a bad thing to do? At first I thought it was a good thing to do. In the begin you follow the deathnote-owner and you totally understand his thoughts and i kind of agreed with them. But when the policeman simply called 'L' came in the picture I began doubting the ways of Light (the name of the guy with the deathnote). \\n\\n\r\nDeath Note makes you think about morality and just keeps getting better. Altough some people don't think the ending is cool, I did. I can't spoil too much so I'll just say: the ending might be dissapointing, but for me it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nSo what's so oustanding about the characters? Everyone who plays his part in the serie is just so freaking smart. Light and L try to outsmart eachother with exciting plans. There's not much action in this anime, more ratio. But I wouldn't call that a bad thing, since the ratio just left me with a happy grin on my face!\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to every anime or manga lover who doesn't necessarily needs a lot of action in his anime.",

            "content": "Many anime fans consider Death Note to be one of the best anime of all time. I am not one of those fans. I feel that while Death Note is a good show, it has some very glaring issues. I have no problem with the people who love this show, but I am simply going to cast my opinion into the mix. I will try not to spoil the show too much, but I will have to divulge a few plot points of varying importance to get my point across. These spoilers will mainly occur within the story and charactersections of this review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (Potential Spoilers): \\n\\n\r\n     For the 3 of you who don't know Death Note's story, Death Note takes place in the present day. One day, a high schooler named Light Yagami finds a notebook on the ground called the Death Note. This book allows the user to kill any person by just writing the person's name down. There are other rules and stipulations, like having to know the person's face, but that is the gist of it. After using this book a couple of times, the owner of the book, a shinigami named Ryuk, meets up with Light for an exposition dump. Armed with his notebook, Light goes on to rid Japan and the rest of the world from crime. Light becomes known as Kira, and becomes know all throughout the world for killing criminals. Eventually, the mass killings attract the attention of a world class detective named L. L decides that he is going to catch Kira, no matter the cost. The show ends up becoming a game of cat and mouse between L and Light, where you are never really sure who the cat and who the mouse is. \\n\\n\r\n     After reading this synopsis, you're probably thinking, \"This show looks pretty good, what is so bad about it?\" And you're right, if this was the entire show it would be pretty amazing. IF it was the entire show. At the halfway point of the show, Light gets his memory of being Kira wiped. He then teams up with L to beat a new Kira. Most of the drama and intelligence from the first half disappears during this arc, and is more lighthearted and funny. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is a bit big of a tone shift. If I wanted to watch a lighthearted and funny series, I would go and watch something like that. But for a show to go from a darker show to a much lighter one is a bit jarring. Eventually, Light does regain his memories and we are treated to a very satisfying conclusion. Or it would have been if it was the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n     L eventually gets replaced with a new character called Near. Near attempts to capture Kira as well, but his battle against Light is just not as entertaining. Near just comes across as annoying, and is nowhere as To cut to the chase, the third arc that ends off the series isn't very good. The series tries to go back to the drama and intelligence the first arc had, but fails miserably. There isn't much to like in this part. The ending of this arc and the entire show is a cop out very underwhelming. The losing party in the ending loses not because the other party outsmarts the other, but because the plot demands it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show's plot starts off really well and deteriorates over time. The first arc is really good, with a ton of intelligence and drama. These qualities are lost over time, and lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The story gets a 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n     The art in this series is alright. It has a nice, muted color pallet. The character designs are pretty good, especially L's. The art commands a suprising amount of realism, and adds to the atmosphere of the show. The art was not the focus of this series, and it didn't need to be. The art gets a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n     The music in this series is pretty good. The openings are both excellent, even if the second one is quite silly. The background music is also very good, with L's theme in particular standing out. The background tracks added a lot to the thoughts and inner dialogues of both L and Light. The sound gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (Potential Spoilers):\\n\\n\r\n      One problem I have  with Death Note is the lackluster characters. L is the only one who has actual depth and develops throughout the series. I will be describing each of the important characters and giving my opinions on them. \\n\\n\r\nLight: My biggest problem with Light is that he has only two real qualities, he is smart, he is egotistical, and he is evil. Throughout the entire series, we see his intelligence in his battle against L and Near. We also see how evil he is, as he evades capture even if he has to kill people. He also always brags about how he is a god and how smart he is. Other than that, he has nothing. You could say he has compassion since he kills criminals, but he more does it to make himself feel like a god. He even says that he is trying to make a world where he is a god. His motivations never change. Light may be entertaining to watch, but he lacks much depth.\\n\\n\r\nRyuk: Ryuk is the shinigami who owns Light's notebook, and he says he dropped it in the human world just have some fun. Ryuk likes to have fun, and does not care what happens as a result. He is often used for comic relief, but can be sinister at times when his apathy of others is shown. Ryuk was a pretty decent character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisa Misa: Misa is a model who gets a Death Note as well, and uses it to help Light. Her entire character is that she is an airhead who just wants to help Light. Many people find her to be incredibly annoying. I didn't mind her, but she wasn't interesting to watch. She basically is pretty bad all around.\\n\\n\r\nRem: Rem is the shinigami who gave the second Death Note to Misa Misa. Rem is a pretty lifeless character, however, she is hellbent on protecting Misa. Rem would do anything to help Misa, and her entire character is based upon that.\\n\\n\r\nNear: Near comes into to replace L in the hunt for Kira. Near main goal is to surpass L and show how smart he is. and he is indeed a cool, calculating, and intelligent person. However, that is basically his entire character. He shows no other real traits throughout his time. he also is not as entertaining as L is. I was never super engrossed when Near was thinking and solving problems, or at least not as engrossed as I was with L's thinking. Overall, Near is pretty shallow and not very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nMello: Mello is Near's... brother? I don't know. The two of them grew up together. Mello grew up in the shadow of Near, and basically insanely obsessed with surpassing Near and capturing Kira before him. Mello eventually kinda works with Near, but not really. Mello just didn't really have a lot to him.\\n\\n\r\nSoichiro Yagami: Light's father and one of the police officers working with L to capture Kira. Soichiro is a bit more fleshed out, as he sanctimoniously wants to capture Kira but doesn't want to find out that his son is Kira. He is very devoted to his work, and puts all his effort into catching Kira. He's an alright character.\\n\\n\r\nMatsuda: Matsuda is one of the police officers looking to capture Kira, and basically serves as the comic relief. He has a little development at the end when he is angry that Light is Kira. There is not much as else to say.\\n\\n\r\nAizawa: Aizawa is one of the police officers looking to capture Kira. We find out that he has a family. He wants to capture Kira, but he doesn't want to leave his family alone if Kira kills him.  This leads him to leaving the Kira Investigation Team for a while before coming back. He is probably the only member of the police force to suspect Light of being Kira. Aizawa is a decent character.\\n\\n\r\nL: I saved the best for last. L is by far the best character. He is extremely intelligent, and it always entertaining to hear his deductions. However, he also has his quirks. Unlike Near, who is always cold and lifeless, L knows how to have some fun. He also experiences the most development as a character. He ends up becoming friends with Light when they work together, and ends up not wanting to find out that Light is Kira. However, it is heartbreaking when Light doesn't feel the same way. L basically saves the show from complete mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters get a 5/10. While L is a joy, the other characters don't compare as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n     The first arc I found very enjoyable. Light and L's mind games were extremely fun to watch. It becomes less enjoyable when Light and L begin to work together and the show gets lighter. At that point, the show becomes more focused on comedy. In the final arc, any semblance of enjoyment I had was snuffed out. The show tried to emulate the first arc but could not compare.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\n                Death Note started off great, but worsens as time goes on. The characters and stories vary in quality, with the story and characters of the third arc being dreadful. The music and art do their job well, but are nt masterpieces. Overall, Death Note gets a 6/10.",

That was one hell of a transition, from watching Dragonball as a kid, to delving into the cerebral universe of Light and co. Simply put; Death Note is a sophisticated journey through the human reactions to Godly power, its characters range from phsychotic to completely logical, yet all of them have an array of diverse motives.\r\nThe story itself is consistently brilliant, too often you'll be watching a series and know almost exactly what's going to happen. That never happens in Death Note unless they want you to. Art is realisticbut not stunning, voice acting is above average at worst and great at best. \\n\r\nI may be biased because of the nostalgic value of it being my first real anime, but Death Note will be making you think long after the finale wraps-up. Not just about the plot points, but also about what you would do with that kind of power. The moral questions raised throughout the series are a layer of sophistication that few TV series, never mind anime alone, have.\\n\r\nThe great thing about Death Note is that it never shoves that sophistication in your face, it never becomes obnoxious and still has a healthy amount of action. \\n\r\nI know I'm putting hefty praise on Death Note, but it deserves it. I've run out of adjectives, so I'll end it here.\\n\r\nSublime series. Go see it.",

You want to see some L x Light foot action? Well, you're a sick bastard, but yeah, it's in here.\r\nAs far as the plot is concerned, the basic premise is this. A shinigami named Ryuk is bored with life living in the shithole shinigami realm, so he decides to drop a death noteinto the human world so he can watch some bitch ass losers get jocked on. Model student Light Yagami finds the death note lying on the ground and passes it off as a bad prank, but takes it home anyway. He soon discovers that the shit is legit, and that he can kill anyone he wants, in just about any way that he wants, just by writing their name down in the death note and imagining their face while he does it (along with a slew of other rules which come into play). Light's only desire (revealed to you through a series of cheesy \"I WILL BE THE GOD OF THE NEW WORLD\"-esque lines) is to use his new found power to bring about a peaceful world. The only thing standing in his way is ace detective L, who is dead set on wrecking the shit out of whoever's responsible for the recent string of criminal deaths.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, just, the first arc in general is badass as hell. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, and it sure as hell isn't apologizing for being over-the-top. Xanatos Gambits will be pulled, psychological mind games will be played, cheesy lines will be shouted, names will be written into notebooks in intense manners while ominous Latin chanting goes on in the background, but this is how shit gets done in the Death Note universe, and I'm not complaining. However, the biggest problem this anime has is that the second arc blows in comparison. The previous problem Death Note had with pacing only gets worse after the time skip. Everything grinds to a halt, and the decrease in writing quality leads to serious Flanderization problems. Everything just feels rushed and tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are well done. I think the character designs were made to appeal to yaoi fangirls, but it's forgivable. Sound is done nicely as well, although both OPs and both EDs are pretty terrible.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, you'll most likely only really care about Light and L. Both of them go through sufficient character development. The main problem is that the other characters are just sort of there as plot devices waiting to be utilized, and most of them either don't develop at all or develop unrealistically (Matsuda comes to mind). A lot of the careful development the characters underwent in the first arc was totally fucking wrecked in the second arc though, because the writers started making everyone act out of character to further the plot along. Mello and Near were hardly in the story long enough to get fleshed out, and Matt was introduced and then got stomped by haters in like two scenes. I mean, was it really necessary to even write him into the plot to begin with? Surely his place could've been filled by some random goons or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it may have its flaws, and it's definitely not the greatest anime ever, but it's still pretty fucking cool.",

            "content": "Death Note.  One of the most well-known animes in existence with its unique storyline, unique characters and overall plot.  ...I hate this series.  \r\nStory (8/10): For those of you who DON'T know, Death note is basically an anime featuring a crazy man that self-proclaims himself as god and a detective that can make Sherlock Holmes his bitch, chasing around each other with overly complicated plans with insane amounts of resources, trying to find out each other's identities so they can bring the other person to justice.  While for the most part this anime does do well with its concept of itscat and mouse chase, it falls very flat with its final 8 episodes by changing one of the key characters and making it drag out in the most BORING way possible.  While there is fairly good pacing, the anime does stretch itself too much sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): First is Light Yagami.  As the \"protagonist\" of the series, (I use protagonist lightly), he starts out as a very bored character.  Until one day, a magical notebook with the ability to kill people by simply writing their name down falls from the sky, his life changes forever.  With the mindset to be god and bring all evil villains to justice, (oh, the irony), his personality drastically changes to a more chaotic evil.  And finally, we have L.  As the \"antagonist\" of the series, (Again, lightly.) L always has a calm way of approaching any situation, and does not hesitate when he finds a potential clue.  With an addiction to sweets, L is a rather interesting character with the uniqueness that he holds.  Beyond these 2 main characters, the rest of the cast is filled with generally well-done supporting cast that mainly play a role as the 'toys' for the main 2 characters to use and play around with, so that they can succeed in their goal.  Overall, the quality of the characters are more well done then what I have seen in previous animes that I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8/10): As many people may know, the art style in Death note is a very high point.  With a more, 'realistic' feel and a very dark scheme of colors in the very detailed background, death note becomes a more standout anime from an art point. Next, sound.  For sound, Death note has a very interesting soundtrack from it's energetic first opening to its somewhat softer first ending, and its taken by surprise second opening.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (3/10): Now, just by the rating for personal enjoyment alone, I know for a fact that I will get a lot of hate.  If you must, post a comment.  As I had said in the beginning of the review, I don't like this series.  The main reason?  My brain CANNOT understand what the hell the characters were saying.  For the most part, Death note is mostly dialogue and in order to understand what exactly the characters were saying one MUST read or listen to every part of the plan as the characters are explaining it, in order to fully comprehend what they are precisely explaining.  If you're an idiot like me, it basically means that you have to listen to them talk and just watch on to see their plan in execution.  For me, this series was really boring and I was painfully watching every second of it to finish it.  I would recommend this to people who want a unique experience with a completely original anime or, to people who have a higher IQ then I do.  (That really shouldn't be hard to achieve.)",

            "content": "Death Note... The most popular anime, Death Note... The controversial anime that some consider overrated, others consider average, and a lot of people, the greatest anime ever. After watching 400 anime, I am going to declare that Death Note is one of the greatest anime ever. I'll try not to spoil anything at all about this masterpiece, but if I accidentally do I apologize in advance. Oh and if you don't like \"themes\" and \"AP Lit symbolism\" far-fetched crap, then I'd say you may not consider Death Note a masterpiece like me. I literally like a loser analyzed the entire story, and found it quiteamazing and symbolic, but if you just want pure enjoyment, Death Note isn't boring, but isn't all that exciting either. \\n\\n\r\nBefore and after you watch this anime, you must consider what you believe life, death, justice, and evil truly are. As people grow up do they experience events that change their views of the world that we live in? Is this world rotten or pure? What makes a person evil, receiving the power to kill? Or were people just born with hatred? Can't we just live in peace without any crimes...? Is the death penalty a fair form of punishment to those who have committed a crime? What makes a \"crime\"... a crime? Is it worse to fail at something or never attempt it in the first place? To what extent do you shape your own destiny, and how much is down to fate? Well, Death Note has it's on perspective on all of these questions. The anime starts off with a Death God, Ryuk who is bored of \"his world\" (Hell? Heaven? Nothingness? We never find out, it's for the viewers to decide where the dead, or death gods live/exist) and purposely drops his Death Notebook into the human world in search of something entertaining (escape from everyday routine, another team). Light Yagami, a genius high school teenager, who views the world as boring, unjust, and filled with corruption/crime conveniently finds the dropped Death Note which can kill anyone whose name is written in the notebook. After confirming the notebook's true power, Light vows to use the death note for \"justice\" and he sets out to cleanse evil, and create a new world where only \"good and pure\" people will live in.  How will he decide if a person is good and pure? Who knows, those terms are different per everyone's belief, but one thing is certain, Light truly believes that HE is justice. But once the government (police) notice that all the criminals are dying one by one, they catch on that the death's aren't natural and that someone is murdering them. Here comes L, the world's most genius detective, Who claims that HE is justice... And L sets out to catch the murderer and protect the world from \"evil\". Now, is Light truly an evil person because he's murdering people? Do you think L is a pure person because he's working under the law? The plot is designed to make the viewer decide for himself/herself. And so, the godly \"Justice\" Vs \"Justice\" chase begins. Who will win this ingenious death chase... Justice? or.... Justice?\\n\\n\r\nThe story relates to many stories from the bible, such as \"Adam and Eve\" and the story of Judas Iscariot (You don't have to be christian to understand the message behind these stories). Not only is the plot unique and interesting, it's the most deepest story I have ever read (Symbolism, for example the use of the forbidden fruit, representation of the main characters names, and crow feathers on Ryuk, the Death God). Light mostly represents Adam. The Death Note is the forbidden fruit. Ryuk, the Death God is the serpent. When Light wrote in the Death Note, kind of like taking a bite of the apple (shown in intro), his eyes were opened, knowing good and evil, and he was deceived into thinking he could be like God, And just as Ryuk warned, Light would not live a happy live for making that mistake, thus, the fall of man due to sin (Book of Genesis). He also can represent Satan (masqueraded Angel of Light, Father of Lies, etc...) and even Judas to a degree. The color symbolism in the anime was intriguing as well. The way Light's hair and eyes become red, L's hair and eyes become blue, and the black/darkness of Ryuk. The anime is exciting and epic without any actual fighting at all!!! After every episode, the main characters, Light Yagami and L Lawliet leave me dumbfounded. If you actually pay attention to the thought process that goes through their heads, you are in for a roller-coaster ride to GENIUS-Ville. I know a lot of people that have watched Death Note started to dislike the anime after episode 25, but the plot continued to amaze me as Light Yagami continued to fulfill his crazy dream. Sure, it seemed like Light Yagami was now just trying to survive instead of actually eradicate evil from the world and serve justice... But it's in human nature to want to survive before worrying about anything else... Death Note is the only anime that I've found NO plot holes that affected/turned the direction of the plot. Did I mention that the pacing of the story is perfect? There's a nice balanced start, followed quickly by \"brain games\" which eventually creates a grand climax, and then the \"downfall\" in the end. All in all, this plot delves into a deep psychological game between 2 geniuses who have the power to change \"justice\" in the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is so amazing. Not only does the anime delve deeply into each character's mind process, and background, but also each character is a symbolic character that symbolizes a hero/villain (Are they both heroes? Both villains? One-One? That's for the viewer to decide depending on what they viewer believes is \"right\"). Although Light Yagami and L Lawliet are enemies, facing each other in a legendary psychological battle, we understand the friendship and companionship that develops in the dark between them. Also, the viewer has no choice but to cheer for both sides, because both Light and L want to change the world for what they believe is \"better\" (neither are trying to ruin the world, and neither are annoying, they are both geniuses). On the other hand, the other main characters Misa Amane, a popular pop-star, and Ryuk the Death God are both important and very symbolic characters that the plot uses in order to show the innocent and disgusting side of human nature. Sure, Misa has an high-pitched squeaky voice and can be annoying a lot of times, but her chemistry with Light Yagami and her importance in the story is just... amazing. Misa is another character who exemplifies the term \"human nature\" and really the loss of innocence and purity. Ryuk's just as important as Light and L... In fact, Ryuk is really the one dictating the entire plot. Ryuk is the invisible figure that spectates how our human world revolves every day, and we, the audience throughout the anime see through Ryuk's perspective of how interesting, yet repulsive we humans are. Misa and Ryuk have some symbolism going on as well. \\n\r\nRyuk giving Misa an apple from the Shinigami world, which Ryuk claimed tasted like crap was pretty symbolic. This is referring to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The evil witch tells Snow White that the apple is a magic wishing apple, which can make all of her dreams come true. However, the reality is that the apple is poisonous. Get it? Misa bites the apple by using her own Death Note, and falling in love with Light, but that \"apple\" (death note) is \"poisonous\". Hence her fall.\\n\\n\r\nL mainly represented Jesus. He came, served, cared, and wanted to protect all people, without discrimination. He was odd and unsocial, as opposed to Light, who was beautiful and quite popular. Very few actually trusted him, though it's understandable since he never reveals his true identity to anyone. He even cared about the very people who hated him and betrayed him. I must mention that the church-bells ringing in L's head throughout the anime really beguiled me, it was really symbolic. \\n\\n\r\n\"I am Justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil. I'm the one that will become the god of a new world that everyone desires!!\"                   \\n\r\n                  - Light Yagami\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain why I find Light Yagami very intriguing: Often in great literature, the main character is an morally ambiguous archetypal \"hero\" whose failures send a message towards the viewers, which is just what Light Yagami is. Now, I see Light Yagami as 3 things. He is 25% Jesus, 25% The Devil, and 50% So very human. 25% Human inside of him is a naive dreaming teenager who is bored of life, and disgusted with the way human beings are living nowadays and wants to make the world a better place (Same as me). Why is he naive? His dream to kill all vermin (criminals, and people that get in the way of his dream) and become a god is impossible. That's something that cannot happen in reality, but his temptations got the best of him. Why is he disgusted with the way humans live? Have you seen all the murders? Rape? Injustice being served? Crime is flowing along like there's no police anywhere. Following the law? Please, think about it. If justice follows the tight law, how will it ever put an end to evil? Here's where I pity and relate to Light sort of... Well then again, what is evil?... How can we get rid of it? Light will show you in his own way. The other 25% Human is a psychopathic murderer who will kill anyone in his way, why? Because he wants to survive, just like all humans do. He is a psycho, no doubt. But it's human nature to want to live and achieve your dream. He has a dream to change the world and he won't just let anyone interfere. Now, the Jesus figure, he wants to become the God of a New World, pass righteous judgement on people, and make the world a safer, better place to live in. He wants humans to finally evolve into their greatest potential stage. He wants equal freedom, no corruption in politics, a justice system where justice can actually be served (clearly in today's society, justice is not being served well). He wants to be the protector of the world, unfortunately humans are mortals, there is a limit to what we can do. The Devil figure, he was corrupted by power and became evil, there's not much more to say. He was willing to get blood on his hands and kill, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his own life (unlike Lelouch in Code Geass). All in all, his character really fascinates me, the stories from Adam & Eve, Betrayal of Judas, and all the other deep motif stories included in his life has me memorized. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe most fatal thing a man can do is try to stand alone.\u201d \\n\r\n- Carson McCullers\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voices for this anime were great. I usually like Sub- Voicing for anime much more than Dubbed, but in Death Note's case, they were both great. Not only was the voice acting great, but the entire soundtrack was GODLY. Go and listen to \"Low of Solipsism\", and \"L/Light's Theme Song\" and you'll see what I mean (EPIC). They also fit the dark mood of the anime perfectly. Now, the openings for the anime were certainly strange and unique. Some may dislike them, but I loved them as they were symbolic in their own way. The lyrics in the first opening, were along the lines of \"I'll show you a new world\", and the second opening, \"Is your life boring?!\". You'll understand why those lines are symbolic if you watch the anime. The animations in both openings were very symbolic as well. In the 1st opening, there was a picture of Light on top of the world, biting an apple, which later changed into a Death Note (Adam & Eve reference). Not only that but Ryuk had crow feathers that left blood stains (Crows represent bad luck and death) and around Light, there were white roses (represents purity and innocence) that quickly turned into red roses (represents death). Furthermore in the ending, Ryuk was sitting on a tree alongside a thousand crows, and crows wait for a person or animal's time (death) to come, just as Ryuk sits around and waits, during almost the entire story, to see when Light's time of dying will come (Once again the \"Light\" name symbolism, A Death God is waiting for \"Light\" to die out). Then in the 2nd opening everyone going crazy and glass breaking (Chaos, Unbalance, Corruption). The soundtrack/openings is arguably the most epic, and well-fitting music in an anime ever... But most importantly, the symbolism in the music/opening was brilliant! The art is old style art, making the entire anime seem even more realistic in a sense. My favorite type of art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI cannot explain to you in words how much I've enjoyed this anime. After every episode, I was left speechless and dying to see more. When the anime ended, I could not believe it (By the way, the ending is great, and very realistic... Serves a life-lesson about temptation and not being able to go back after getting blood on your hands). Let me just say that no matter what kind of anime you like, you will not dislike this anime, unless you are living proof that a man can live without a brain. And it's pointless for me to write anything else insulting of people who dislike Death Note because it will take haters the rest of the century to figure it out. As you can clearly see from how much I've enjoyed the anime, I can officially say that it's a Must-Watch, once in a generation show. Don't miss out, and I hope you found this review convincing at all, because it'd truly be a shame if you missed out on a masterpiece such as Death Note. Do your life a favor and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nAfter you watch the anime, make sure to think about all the questions I mentioned at the beginning of the review. and think to yourself what you believe is right/wrong, what the \"morale\" way to go at things are. No matter what religion you believe in, think about your role in life, and what will happen to you after death. Perhaps Death Note will change your perspective on things like it did for me... Or... I may just be over-thinking things... Anyways, if you haven't seen it, just watch it and judge for yourself..",

            "content": "Death Note features a deeply engrossing plot which comes across largely as an isolated battle of ideologies. What starts off as a suppressed story of a school-boy elevates to a battle of epic proportions with your tension verging on the overbearing. As the series progresses, it slowly loses the great momentum with which it rose and settles for a beautiful yet modest climax. Death Note is a celebration of the human spirit which deserved well more than the climax it has - however, it will continue to scour the top tier of anim\u00e9 for the sheer quality of its deepest thoughts and questions raised.\r\n> Charactersketch: 9/10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe series rides on it's brilliant character sketch - see how the characters ride on their highs and fall steeply in their lows - contrast the various characters introduced and explore the series through their eyes.\\n\\n\r\n> Music: 9/10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nDeath Note has music that brings out the emotions behind a scene better than words ever can. Quite simply put, the background music deeply settles the events portrayed in the series in your mind.\\n\\n\r\n> Animation: 9/10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nMany scenes of this series hinges on the brilliance of plot portrayal through it's animation - a job done well by it. Simple animation without excess clutter greatly helps in absorbing the rich plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\n> Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nDeath Note's progression,  considering the force it started out with, is disappointing. It begins to feel increasingly forced and unplanned as you progress into it, and the later episodes certainly lack the elegant grace of plot revelation that the initial ones had. Averaging the scores of the episode through the series would roughly result in an 8/10 for the enjoyment that it provides.\\n\\n\r\n> Overall: 9/10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nDeath Note is very often first suggested by anyone mildly into anim\u00e9-watching to an anim\u00e9 newbie. This is not without reason - the sheer brilliance of portrayal of distinct ideologies and the techniques used for the same are a stand-out feature of Death Note. Watch how excelling in the above parameters helps Death Note to transcend from a mere fight between humans to a towering battle of ideologies.\\n\\n\r\n> Re-watchable: YES\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe first half of the series has a high re-watch value. However, the series begins to lose re-watch value after that.\\n\\n\r\n> Why should you watch it?\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nDeath Note starts off with a bang and sports a finesse unrivaled by most other anim\u00e9, which quickly engrosses you in the plot. For the above reason, Death Note is a great anim\u00e9 to watch for those who haven't watched anim\u00e9 before. Death Note features legendary mind-games which are a treat for those who like to think.",

            "content": "This may not be my first review, but this is my favorite. Why? Well because it is my favorite anime series of all time. Death Note is a beautiful blood bath of death and suspense. This anime has kept me a fan since I started watching till I burned out on it 3 years later, and it only took a week away before I was back watching the epic tug-of-war storyline that keeps twisting and pulling you back in. This anime is the best suspense anime I have ever seen. The characters are so well made that you start to truly pick sides in theconflicts just from their ideals alone. The Art work is amazing at conveying the intensity of this anime. From the insane laughter and craze of Light, to the calm and collected thoughts of L. You will love the characters, even the idiots. Death Note's music boosts the intensity of every single moment and it holds true on that statement even after you've finished it. L's theme gives you this instant feeling of drawn out suspense coupled with this deep thought provoking sensation. Also this anime holds the record for having my favorite OP or ED and that is Zetsubou Billy by Maximum The Hormone, this song is my favorite for it's metalcore and heavy metal sounds. The concepts and story of this anime are so crazy that the best way to describe them is a roller coaster without breaks. Everything is creative and suspenseful, and by any characters death, you will feel for the character. I highly recommend this anime to ANYONE. This anime is a gem in the anime world, and anyone who hasn't seen it, I feel sorry for you. You are sorely missing out on a wonderful experience. \\n\r\n-Farewell readers.\\n\r\nLove Darkness_Knight",

            "content": "\u201cThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d - Aristotle. \r\nIn Death Note's case, much, much greater. \r\nOn the first day, Billy learned to ride his bike. On the second day, he learned to ride it with only one hand on the handle. On the third day, he could ride it without any hands. After that, riding without any hands is all he wanted to do. The thrill and excitement was overwhelming and he could not go back. \r\nHailed as one of the best anime of all time, Death Note deserves to be on a list of \"Anime That Nostalgically Blind Us\". Formany people, it's their first exposure to the wonder of anime or at least the first one to take them on a high-octane, wild ride. Just like Billy, many viewers become enthralled by Death Note because it showed them the joy of riding a bicycle with no hands. It's one of the most well-crafted anime in history, but like every show or movie, it isn't without its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 13/15\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note's plot is deceptively simple: \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\"...and a genius highschooler happens upon this notebook and decides to take God's judgment into his own hands by killing off criminals. Throw in equally genius detectives, dozens of additional Death Note rules, and lots of dramatic flair and you have a bona fide cat-and-mouse game wrapped up in an engrossing psychological thriller. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is over-the-top but fits the adrenalized tone perfectly, aside from a few questionable lines (e.g. potato chips) that might have gone a bit overboard. Careful pacing from start to finish of each episode and melodramatic dialogue make for a rapidly accelerating rollercoaster. The latter half of the ride gets a bit bumpy with certain plot points, but the writing stays on point from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nOften times, people talk about how large a show's cast of characters is or how much death there is as if that alone serves to improve the story. As one might imagine, Death Note has quite a bit of death in it. The problem with death in stories is that it typically serves to create emotional turbulence within the viewer's heart, but it's very difficult to achieve this without taking the time to develop the character before killing him/her/it. The bulk of the journey, Death Note hits the spot, creating very interesting and volatile dynamics between characters. It falters towards the end by introducing far too many pivotal characters for one to digest so quickly. By the final episode, the show does pick up the pieces to construct a fairly satisfying conclusion, but perhaps not upon the same solid foundation it began with. \\n\\n\r\nVISUALS - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Death Note stood in the top tier of animation when it aired. In terms of the fluidity of things happening on screen (i.e. FPS), it's still better than many anime airing at the time of this review. To reiterate, not in terms of resolution since it isn't natively in 720p or 1080p, but just talking about pure animation in the same way that Cowboy Bebop still trumps many modern anime in fluidity and detail. Studio Madhouse is well-known for their skill in creating very intense and suspenseful scenes through simple changes in camera angles and light distortion effects, both of which Death Note is a prime example of. Some people may criticize the liberal use of color filters and the tweaking of characters' hair and eye colors, but this was purposefully done to create the exuberant drama and suspense that are cornerstones of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack crackles and pops with the twists and tension of each episode. It knows when to come in loud and boisterous and when to simply flow along with a quiet or somber scene. There's a variety of electronic and orchestral tracks with multiple versions of many of them depending on the tone and pace at certain points in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to talk about the music without mentioning the voice acting that compliments it greatly. Everyone from the main to the supporting characters have been cast very well. In such a tumultuous and suddenly evolving anime, the voice actors succeed in expressing an array of emotions that produce meaningful, thought-provoking moments of silence in between all the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\\n\r\nHere is an anime that takes a simple premise and expands upon it tenfold and in multiple dimensions of thought. Aside from the mind games it thrives on, it poses some real questions about morality and power. Complete with superbly consistent and fitting animation and a soundtrack that compliments it with its boldness and subtlety. One might almost be able to look past the few rushed and questionable plot points and lapses in characterization, but they must be taken into consideration. Certain parts of the show, namely the first half or so, do have a clearer sense of direction and tend to stand out more than the others, but it's important to weigh the entirety of the show on the same scale.  \\n\\n\r\nTOTAL - 33/35\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: Point systems are far from perfect and shouldn't be taken at face value or compared between anime alone. To get the full picture, the review should be read since it contains the reasoning behind the score and that reasoning may not resonate with everyone.

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming)\r\nStory: 10/10. The interplay between Light and L's manipulation games, as well as the suspense that builds in not knowing who'll emerge victorious, will have you on the edge of your seat for the first 25 episodes. The show starts to drag after Episode 25 into the 30s, and unfortunately the introduction of Near and Mello as Light's adversaries marks a drop in the show's quality. This doesn't affect the story and overall narrative that much, but whereas L relied on actual deductions and skill to trap Light at times, it seems (atleast in the anime) Near acted on huge, illogical leaps of faiththat opened up many plotholes in the show and, in the end, didn't replicate as well the interesting psychological warfare in the first 25 episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10, not much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Great music and great voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Light and L made for one of the greatest psychological battles in fictional history. We had two genius characters fighting in an all-out war to come out on top, and we saw each one concoct brilliant plans to fool the other; Light's charm, charisma and cynicism would help him weasel into L's proximity to avoid suspicion, but L's inability to trust yet longing for someone to confide him really added a depth to the battle that occurred between Light and L. Unfortunately, the Light vs Near dynamic is very unfitting and offers little; it isn't necessarily bad, but it's nothing like Light vs L. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. From start to finish, I was eager to see who would emerge victorious and how. Although the last episodes of the show did drop in quality, they were still enjoyable for me for the most part; however, I don't think this is an excuse objectively for the show, and I feel if Near had been a more interesting adversary with better executed plans, this show would be a 10/10. Unfortunately, although I considered by experience with this show perfect, it really isn't the perfect show despite all the popularity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. If the show had ended at Episode 25 or had made better use of Near rather than rely on plot convenience to have him best Light, I would've considered this show a 10. Unfortunately, these flaws hold back Death Note from being a masterpiece. That's not to say it isn't an engaging psychological ride from start to finish, but it's pretty clear Episodes 1-25 and Episodes 26-37 are just different rides, and the former definitely showcases the best Death Note has to offer in terms of genuine psychological warfare between two brilliant minds trying to entrap the other.",

Instead of abusing it's power for his benefit, he uses it to start a killing spree against known rapists, serious law offenders such as murderers, and other low-life scums. Near the end of the series, he gets rid of most of the crime in his country, crimminals are scared of even commiting the simplest petty crimes due to the power of our protagonist, but at the cost of our protagonist's own karma and personality, basically becoming the very same thing he tried to avoid.",

So if you don't mind the spoilers you should check that. \r\nStory: Deathnote is about the best character of all time, Light Yagami. He finds a notebook and inside, it states \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\"\r\nDeathnote is one of a kind really. Very few stories I have seen come close to it, not even FMA:Brotherhood. It has great pacing thanks to the 37 episodes giving it the chance to be a true adaptation of the manga. Nothing feels rushed. Originally I had read a bit of the first manga volume and had the ending spoiled by my friends. This did not ruin anything. The story has great build up in every moment to that final point. The writing of it is superb and the concept is amazing. \\n\r\nThe show has lots of exactly as planned moments.*1\\n\r\nEnding thoughts*2\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is done by Madhouse who have made quite a few anime. The show looks good for 2006 and looks like the manga. \\n\r\nI would like to give special mention to the Second Ending which contains the best animation Madhouse have ever made. \\n\r\nIt's top quality in short. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I am one of those people who prefers the dub of this to the sub. It feels more natural to the characters appearances.\\n\r\nAs for music Nightmare provide the first Op and Ed which are wonderful to listen to.\\n\r\nThe second Op and Ed is made by Maximum the Hormone. The second Op is a mystery to me. As for the second Ed it is beyond perfect.*3\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack music there are quite a few repeats but these are mainly L's and Light's themes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Light Yagami is the perfect model student. As the world\u2019s greatest serial killer known as Kira.  \\n\r\nL is the mysterious detective hell-bent on arresting Kira.\\n\r\nThe character development is excellent. You start to understand Light's thoughts. You will start to support him or root for his downfall.*4\\n\r\nYou go inside of both L and Light's thoughts as they think their plans through. *1\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite having the ending spoiled for me I didn't see what happened/how it happened. The build up to the point was what was important. \\n\r\n*1\\n\r\n*2\\n\r\nIf you had this show spoiled or not it will not affect your enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Deathnote is my favourite anime and I doubt that will change. It changed something inside of me yet I don't know what. My life felt empty when I finished it.*2\\n\r\nDeathnote is a near perfect anime with stellar art, sound and story. It is one that will go down as a great with the likes of Neon Genesis, FMA and Code Geass. \\n\r\nOverall I would give Deathnote a 10/10. I would recommend it as a person\u2019s first anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor legal streaming you go can go to Netflix for the UK. I can not confirm but I believe you can stream it on Hulu for the US. \\n\r\nAlternatively you could buy the DVD or the Blu Ray that is been released (I believe). In addition I would recommend getting the Death Note Manga which can be bought in volumes of 1 or Death Note Black Edition which includes 2 volumes totalling 6 books for \u00a310 each.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnything on from this point will contain spoilers for the show and my personal thoughts and feelings of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n*1 Exactly as planned: These moments occur quite a bit. The most memorable being Just According to Keikaku. This is when Light has regained the Deathnote and tricked L into thinking he is innocent. During this point character development takes place between L and Light. \\n\r\nBefore this happens Light does not explain his plan other than that he wants to get rid of the Notebook.  He then flashes back and explains how he will prove his innocence.\\n\r\nThe main one is the ending showdown. In short Light tried to trick Near into thinking Mikami had the real notebook but it was actually a fake. He explains this in the final episode after proclaiming \"looks like I win.\" It was working until Mikami made a fatal error in revealing the location of the real notebook. \\n\r\nThere are other plans in the show as well. \\n\\n\r\n*3 Ending 2 \"Symbolism\": I have interpreted the 2nd Ed as Light's rise to being a God with the literal Stairway to Heaven. The elevator scene has great build-up and shows his rise to the heavens as God of the new world. But only for him to fall to the ground. \\n\r\nSide note: The flipping of the notebook, writing the name and seeing Light in the watch is beyond amazing.\\n\\n\r\n*4 Kira: Kira is the \"mass murderer\" in Deathnote. His real name is Light Yagami. My normal thoughts on him would be that I would disagree with him because I don't think we should have a death penalty. But I didn't. I supported for Light because I realised this is the only way to clean the world. \\n\\n\r\n*2 The End of Kira: So the ending happened. I watched it just last night. Yes as the title says, The End of Kira, his downfall, his death.\\n\r\nWell firstly I should say the only change I can recall from the manga to anime is the ending being changed slightly. \\n\r\nIn the manga Light gets shot and begs Ryuk to write the SPK and Taskforce's names down. (Just got the book at so I can quote it.) So yes. Light gets shot and is now crawling on the floor away from Taskforce. He is begging Misa, Mikami and Takada to write their names down. He eventually reaches the feet of Ryuk where he says \"Sure... I'll write it.\" And then reveals he was talking about Light. Here Light insanely shouts \"I DON'T WANT TO DIE!\"and has a flashback to when he first met Ryuk. Subsequently Light dies of a heart attack 40 seconds later. \\n\r\nThis is different to the Anime ending which you should have seen. Light peaces out and dies on some stairs. \\n\r\nWhen I first watched I will admit I felt sick. It was a pathetic end for an amazing character. I assume you would have been disappointed if you didn't know beforehand. But was this foreshadowed? Ryuk told Light he would write his name in the Deathnote. \\n\r\nAlthough I prefer the manga ending this one was complete and well done. \\n\r\nThe performance by Brad Swaile in this episode was excellent. \\n\\n\r\nDeathnote is a masterpiece. Nothing will come close for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "This anime took me a while to really get around to and I do regret not watching it earlier.....somewhat. This anime started off very slow for me to a certain degree due to the fact that I did not understand how the story would expand on the context of the deathnote. However, once i got through a few episodes I simply could not let go of it. It got really emotional at points where i had not anticipated, and the overall feelings i had towards the characters were raw and very real. \r\nI found myself pulled into the story itself which made me feel likei was in the world where my name could be added to that worrisome Deathnote. I sometimes find my mind wondering when watching television and start doodling about with stuff around me, but this show basically took hold of my brain and forced me to watch it seriously and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, though sometimes my emotions and energy were taxed heavily, it felt like running a marathon and winning it. You tire from the running and need to pace yourself but once you cross that finish line you feel quite satisfied with yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters I found that I got really attached to them, especially Light and L, be it in a good or bad way, and they evoked very genuine feelings in me,especially some of the more human explorations by them which did not necessarily relate to the action of the show, quite surprising and funny at times. The secondary characters all have such big personalities and their interaction really gives this show some of its most epic and compelling moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are very dark and dreary which is quite perfect for the premise and action of the show, which also makes for very complementary and juxtaposed situations involving the characters whose actions are highlighted by it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Deathnote as it provided such an immersing experience and such great characters and story. However, I would advise watching it in a paced manner, when it gets too much for you just stop for a bit and watch teletubbies or something, and then get back on the horse, its really worth finishing that race!!!!",

            "content": "This anime.\r\nIt had all the makings of a classic and if I act biased, I might as well give it 10.. And trust me, episodes 1-26 were a masterpiece! After that, it went a little downhill.. And my hatred towards a certain character compelled me to give it a 9.. Let's take a spoiler-free look at each of its components..\r\nSTORY :\r\nAbsolutely loved the premise.. Writing a spoiler-free review is difficult enough, but I'll make it easy.. The story was so gripping that I watched around 20 episodes without major breaks.. The cliffhangers were excellent and still give me goosebumps.. The problem is, after episode 26,the story takes a dramatic shift which I didn't like at all.. 9/10..\\n\\n\r\nART :\\n\r\nGood art here.. Nothing too special, but nothing awful either.. 7/10..\\n\\n\r\nSOUND :\\n\r\nA very good soundtrack.. It made writing names on a notebook feel like the end of the world! The sound made for some exciting moments and it enhanced certain memorable scenes.. 8/10..\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS :\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Light Yagami and L Lawliet, are quite frankly, two of the greatest characters in anime history.. They're the driving force behind this anime's greatness.. Ryuk, the Shinigami, is a great (and much needed) addition to the anime.. Those newly introduced characters sucked though! Other side characters don't stand out much but those 3 are enough for me to give it a 10/10..\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT :\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime thoroughly! I can watch it again and again and still not get bored of it.. Its that enjoyable.. The enjoyment level decreases after a certain event in the second half though.. 9/10 for this one..\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL :\\n\r\nThis is the first anime I watched with a passion.. I was absolutely invested in the story! So much in fact, that I wrote some politicians' names in my Death Note.. True Story.. Its a roller coaster of all sorts.. The second half pales in comparison to the first half but don't let it bother you.. I wholeheartedly recommend this anime for everyone to watch..\\n",

But then I gave it a shot and I loved it. When I got the real idea of Death Note I was minded blowed. I love this anime so much.\r\n~STORY~\r\nThe story was well planned and very unique. I liked everything. The only problem I had was the parts when a few people started talking about political stuff which bored me. But I know it was part of the story soit was okay. Overall I loved the story plot. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~ART/ANIMATION~\\n\r\nDeath Note has one of the best art/animation I had ever seen. I give a lot of credit to the animators, they did an amazing job. Everything was beautifully animated. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nI loved the Death Note OST. Especially the second opening, the song is one of my personal favorites. The music gives a lot of feeling to every scene. From an average day to a very dramatic insane moment. The dub was well done also the sub. So you don't have to worry if the dub is horrible because it's not. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\r\nEvert character was pretty good for their role. The only problem I had was that some characters were forgetful. But the bottom line is I liked every character, even Misa. Yes I think Misa is a great character and she is adorable. With Light I think he is insane, which is a good thing. And L is the best characters out of all of them in my opinion, I kind of developed a small crush on him. 10/10  \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nI enjoyed Death Note a lot that I would re-watch it again and again. I would definitely recommend it to people. I loved everything of Death Note, except one part which I'm not telling because I would be spoiling a part of the show. Over all you should go and watch Death Note.",

Leave a comment if you know WHY I like this anime. ;)\r\nStory 10/10\r\nDeath Note is a fun anime, that's one thing for sure. I liked the plot a lot, just because the idea that such a notebook would excist, is awesome as hell. The pace was perfectly done as well, and every episode ended just where it should end.\r\nArt 9/10\r\nThe most of the characters have a great design that fits them well. The background is dark and sort of depressing, and that fits the seriesgreat as well. I still give 9 points, because it was not completely perfect but still great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is for the Japanese dub, although I watched the English dub. and if I am honest, the Engelish dub would get 10 points. The Japanese dub had just too less emotions, and the voices didn't fit the characters well. L's voice in the English dub was just perfect. I loved the music, and that's why I still give 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI will be short abou this. I JUST LOVE FRIGGIN L AND LIGHT AND RYUK AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR DESIGN IS SO PERFECT AND THEIR ACTIONS ARE SO UNPREDICTABLE BUT STILL SO SUITABLE! Their actions are suitable with their designs, let I say it like that xD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI had fun the whole time with this anime. And all the jokes are timed so well. Just enjoyed the fact of the notebook with the rules that come by. It's so exciting!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a anime worth your time, that's for sure. :)",

I came to this conclusion, no this anime needs a better third act and as much as the first two acts where masterfully crafted it wouldn't be enough on its own. Other than that this is by far one of the best anime ever created ( in my opinion ) Just the amount of moments it had me glued to the screen at the edge of my seat, captivated by what might happen next is enough for me to recommend this anime to nearly anyone.

These are the animes, that want to keep me watching into the early hours of the morning. A dark anime, that blends really well.\r\nStory - The basic storyline starts of like this. Light Yagami is a 17 year old boy but he is extremely intelligent for his age, so intelligent in fact that he has helped NPA (National Police Agency) solve multiple cases. Anyway, he does find his life boring but one day, he stumbled upon a diary (or book whatever you wanna callit) called the Death Note. At first he thinks the Death Note is just a joke after reading the rules. But all that changes, after he sees the Shinigami (Death God) named Ryuk appear before him.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art presentation is superb, while it may be a dark anime, it does have colour, but not these bright and vibrant colours. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound is great, everything works with the particular scene, there are no out of place tunes. The sounds consists mainly of the keyboard, guitar and high orchestral latin, gothic music for the intense, edge of your seat moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Okay, now I might carry on in this section. Like I said before, Light Yagami is very intelligent, and he wants to rid the world of evil by using the Death Note to his advantage. On the other hand, there is L. This is an interesting concept, Without spoiling anything, Light Yagami can be seen to people as the anti-hero of the series, but L believes what Light is doing is wrong. Yeah I will stop myself there, before I go on and on ranting and adding spoilers :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I throughly enjoyed this anime from start to finish, every little twist and turn added in, the unexpected thing happen every now and then, just makes this show that much more epic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - From episode 1 to episode 37 was one helluva thrill ride. So many suspensful things pop out at you and really does a great job at making you feel closer to Light and L. You get to see things from there perspective and they are characters, you end up caring about and get a better connection between the two. \\n\r\nThe only real grievance I had with the show is the ending....which is debatable even to this day. I won't say why, watch it for yourself :)\\n\\n\r\nPerfect 10 from me :D",

            "content": "This is my first review so I apologise for the quality of it :3\r\nDeath Note is, without a doubt, one of the best anime ever created.  It tells a unique and enjoyable story, to the likes of which I have not seen with any other anime of the same genre. I feel I can confidently say that it is one of the best anime out there, if not, then without a doubt one of the best I have ever seen.\r\nStory:\r\n The concept of the story is rather simple, a notebook falls from the sky with the power to kill whosever name is written init (there are some rules but the anime tells you about those).  Yagami Light, who gets this unearthly power to kill, hopes to use the notebook to rid the world of evil and create a Utopia on earth with himself being God.  In this Utopia there would be no evil, only good, but can we say that this is right? Should people who have wronged be allowed to live? Or can they be reformed? Death Note gets the viewers to think about questions just like this, which, in turn, makes us challenge our morals. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the main focus of the anime isn\u2019t to judge our own morals. The way that the story is told and the pure genius of the plot always keep you on the edge of your seat, the strong game of cat and mouse that Light Yagami must play with the greatest detective in the world, L. Due to both of them being geniuses, it isn\u2019t an easy task for one another to persecute each other, and due to their characters you will want to cheer for one or the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of the story declines once we reach the second arc of the anime, which although also in the manga, seemed like a way of dragging the story out more than it might have needed, but I can\u2019t complain too much as it was nice to get away from the stalemate between Light and L.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLight and L are by far the most interesting in the anime, they are both geniuses and have certain characteristics that make you like one more than the other. Light is very charismatic he is able to execute his plans with much confidence and determination without over reacting too much if something were to go wrong. L on the other hand is\u2026 strange and despite looking rather unintelligent, he is quite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nWell, what can I say? Madhouse people, Madhouse. But in all seriousness the art is brilliant; it\u2019s gives off dark vibes which really go with the concept of the story.  The animation is also very well done, despite there not being all that much to animate, I would imagine the most animated scene was a car chase, this isn\u2019t a bad thing, just the anime does consist off plans on trying to outsmart each other so there isn\u2019t much to animate. By far my favourite scene was\u2026 THE POTATO CHIP SCENE. That was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was amazingly done as well, having opera which fitted perfectly with Light\u2019s ambition to become the new God of Utopia. With L having music which I can only describe and being \u201cpolicey\u201d I don\u2019t know it just sounded like something you\u2019d hear on a police show or something. I can defiantly say that without the music I don\u2019t think that I would have given this a 10/10 I\u2019d possibly give it an 8 or 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the first anime I ever watched, outside of Naruto, and it was one of the anime that really got me to watch more anime. I loved the story, always keeping you thinking and on your toes, the characters were brilliant, personally I preferred L, I think that Light\u2019s character changed in a way that I didn\u2019t like as much by the end. However I highly recommend this anime to anyone of pretty much any age, although it can get quite confusing in places. You also don\u2019t have to worry about it only being in Japanese this anime has been dubbed in pretty much every language\u2026 So go watch it!\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 10/10 \\n",

            "content": "Imho Death note is a Masterpiece. Very thought provoking.\r\nStory/Plot: Most of you have probably read the synopsis so thats  already taken care of. Death Note is a very thought provoking anime and the story just keeps you intrigued through the whole series. The thing i love about it, is how it views on both the protagonist and antagonist's perspective and way of thinking. Another thing is that you really have your own opinion on who is the protagonist or antagonist depending what moral you support. It just keeps you on the tip of your chair wanting to know who is right or who iswrong if there even is a right and wrong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Funny thing is the characters remind me alot of Tom and Jerry how they two always bash and go at each other sometimes the cat driving the mouse into a corner and sometimes the mouse driving to cat into a corner. Its very interesting on how the two characters think so alike and have the same intentions of justice yet have different methods sometimes written either bad guy or good guy on their face. You're always going to cheer for the one who you believe is right and since Light and L are both equally intelligent & think alike it just flares up your curiosity on who's perspective is justice.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: I think the sound track is just amazing how it blends in with the story so well and creates such a Death note like mood and atmosphere somethings sounding like gibberish opera LOL . I loved it and thought it was literally one of the main reasons why i loved Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for me is very good though its not something amazing but at least they don't have the ridiculously huge eyes that scares the jeepers out of you or the tremendously long exaggerated legs. Another thing is people don't walk around in hot pink hair and people viewing it as normal though sometimes you just gotta love purple. The author did an outstanding job on drawing the characters of how Light and L can loo kand act so different yet are so alike. The characters are drawn sort of darkish if you know what i mean just not like happy go-getto and i thought that it really matched with the theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Death Note was very enjoyable for me up until the second arc that is but that's out of the question. I don't think there's another anime out there that just blends so well together like Death Note does and although some part just repeats the strategies used its very amusing watching Light and L try to win over the other without even knowing each other in the first place. You should definitely at least give it a try I promise you won't regret it and if you do then I don't know you LOL thanks for sitting through this awfully long and at parts boring review!",

Manga = breathtaking, Film = groundbreaking, Anime = phenomenal.\r\nDeath Note the anime is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time.

            "content": "This anime though. Honestly, I truly enjoy it. This may seem weird but I love both the protagonist and the antagonist. Yagami Light is a very erudite student that was bored with his life, waking up to the same old thing. He picked up a book that fell from the sky called the Death Note and was amused by it. He didn't actually think that the book might work but what the heck, he started writing a criminal's name and the criminal was killed. He was taken aback by the result and experimented with other criminals. As good as he is, he eventually became obsessedwith the book and was getting pleasure by killing other people, thinking he was doing justice to the world by eliminating bad guys. L, on the other hand, is also a very interesting character. He might be just as smart as Light. Looking at his appearance, you wouldn't believe that he is the legendary L. Both of them befriended but at the same time, they are rivals. An anime wouldn't be perfect without a main female character and in this anime, that girl is Misa. I wish I could tell you more but I might as well accidentally give you spoilers. One thing I could guarantee is that every episode will leave you wanting more and more. To say that this anime is overrated would be a crime because Death Note deserves every single recognition it's getting.",

            "content": "Death note review (9.5/10)\r\n(This aims to be a spoiler-free review. However, if included, any explicit spoilers will be in a marked off section at the bottom of the review.)\r\nStory:\r\nDeath note has a quite original concept behind it; a book in which you can write peoples' names to kill them. Death note is a mature, intelligent anime which displays a battle of wits between the main characters. You get thrown straight into the story with in 5 minutes and the action really does not let up for at least 10-15 episodes. \r\nThe engaging battle between Light and L dominates most of this period, starting with anepic opening encounter. This conflict is made so good by the detail and logical approach with which each of the two make their plans and how their thoughts are conveyed to the audience. There are some great tense moments with unpredictable and clever uses of their resources as well. It is clear that both are geniuses to be reckoned with and both have the same goal, to find out the other's true identity. Furthermore, both characters are made to be likeable (some people would disagree for Light) so that you are not really sure which side you are supporting, especially as the main character, Light, is technically the evil side.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes some interesting twists, coupled with introductions of new ideas and characters. Most of my favourite episodes were the ending episodes of each arc which were made to feel really intense.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 25 episodes almost equal my favourite anime series I have watched so far. The story has a near perfect pacing, not becoming repetitive at any point and it brings together a lot of interesting concepts. The last 11-12 episodes were weaker. The pacing was slower and less detail was given into the plans and logic of the main characters. And the dynamics between the characters was less enjoyable. It was still a good run though just wasn't as perfect as the start. The ending was a bit disappointing and was probably the worst execution of a battle between the main characters in the series, which had so much potential in the circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are well written with their motivations well set out and their weaknesses subtly shown at different points in the series. Light with his superiority complex, seeing as himself as a worthy God, fit well with his goals to judge the world. Ultimately most of the time he had the intelligence to back up his arrogance and his central goal stays quite consistent. \\n\\n\r\nL presents himself as one who has a strong sense of moral justice, which spurs him on to try to solve the case. However, his methods of investigating perhaps show a different side of him and at times it does seem as if he is a detective to get a feeling of fulfilment by solving cases. Even though Light and L are very different there are clear parallels between them, which is most evident during the middle few episodes. The secondary characters are focused on less but you still feel emotionally connected to them and understand their feelings and most of them play important parts in the series, each contributing to at least one major plot event. There is not much character development in the series but different aspects of each character are explored in more detail in different arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Light and L are two of my favourite anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and art:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is spectacular and fits in very well with the setting and events of the series. L's and Light's theme have multiple remixes, all of which set the scene well and kyrie and low of solipsism are a few more of my favourites. The art style is nice and the variation of the drawing of Light at different times and circumstances in the series is great. L's character is a great presence to have in any scene and you always understand the emotions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I consider the other categories in my rating, the most important thing for me is my subjective enjoyment of the series (which does somewhat depend on the above sections). During both my first run and my rewatch I wanted to continue to the next episode straight away almost every time.The cliffhangers and plans which span out over at least a few episodes makes it easy to rewatch, allowing further analysis and appreciation of how well written said plans are.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, I believe death note is a true masterpiece and deserves a 9.5, even if its last episode run is a bit weaker. Anyone who enjoys a thriller with supernatural plot points or an epic adventure with psychological aspects will enjoy this anime!\\n",

            "content": "~ Evil deeds will be punished, this is something that should be. ~\r\nDeath Note.\r\nIt's a cult classic, widely beloved show, that holds a large sway in the otaku community. It is in essence,  an extremely vivid and well thought out story that redefines the meaning of the \r\nword \"justice\"...\r\nSpawning from the simple, supernatural/fantasy themed idea that by writing down somebody's name that you could cause them to die, comes an extremely intricate and entangled story that documents almost faultlessly, a psychological showdown that can be remarked as nothing less than epic. \r\nIt's quite common for people to have imbued preconceptions of Death Note dueto its prominent media showcasing. Myself included entered this 37 episode series with relatively low expectations, and needless to say from my overall mark, that i was completely wrong...\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note.\\n\r\nIt's anything BUT simple.\\n\r\nWhile the premise of having a human wield that fateful notebook, and therefore wield a responsibility equal to the mass to Earth itself may seem quite straightforward... This show is simply genius in the way that it NEVER runs out of new revelations, discoveries, countless, countless, countless deaths, and countless, countless, countless plot twists to leave you breathless. (kind of like the breather you're taking now after reading that long sentence) Death Note is a great example of a show that is easy to underestimate. While it seems obvious that from such a responsibility-oriented premise, a theme of chaos and corruption should emerge, Death Note instead takes a more unique approach, and puts YOU in the front seat.\\n\\n\r\nIt couldn't possibly use any more dramatic irony to empower you. To familiarize yourself with the rules of a God of Death. To familiarize yourself with with your friends, your enemies - You become death itself. And therefore particularly during Death Notes early phases, the complexities of baring such a power begin to envelop you. While on the one hand justice is to be fought for, on the other is the moral obligation to never kill a human being. Death Note thrives on the concept of conflicting morals. The endless friction between two mastermind forces fills the show's atmosphere with unending frustration and tension that genuinely can be felt, and related to.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an psychological war. So expect ample plot twists...\\n\r\n\"Who's the good guy?\" That is a question that will likely baffle you even after seeing everything, so does it really empower you at all?\\n\\n\r\nAs i mentioned earlier, it's the sheer amount of interesting, thought-provoking content, as a result of a premise that could be summarized in a sentence that really stood out for me. The seamless integration of all of the perspectives and information down to the tiniest detail fit together perfectly - like in a beautifully intricate mystery. This brings the far fetched story down to Earth, down to a much more relatable and appreciable, realistic level that can easy resonate with a wide audience, anywhere from the technical grounds of super-weapons, to much grayer areas of morality itself.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the game of chess between two geniuses, of arguably equal levels - and so one of the best aspects of Death Note is its complete unpredictability, which coexists with the twists of fate, to make it a level and heated battleground that always keeps you on edge.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its repetitive nature it fortunately strays far from being bland, and like a crescendo, it always seems to be trying to reach some form of climax - which never seems to fully emerge - and so the escalation in tension and complexities continue. Even more deviously deceitful and obscure techniques become part of the tribulations, and one minute it may seem that the world is with you, the next, you're lying unconscious underneath it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so Death Note really does possess an overriding \"GENIUS\" aspect to die for. The story is as i say, really well thought out, whereas the characters is perhaps where i come to see one flaw... And this is kind of light how Shingeki no Kyojin is one-dimensional in the way that it puts an entertaining plot through the gears of production - covering the main progression non-stop. \\n\\n\r\nWhile i'm obviously not promoting the use of tangents here, that fact is that Death Note never seems to take a break from the suspenseful mystery solving. This is why i really enjoyed the very first phase best for it being the most down-to-Earth, \"everyday life\" styled. Whereas towards its conclusion, the heavy atmosphere is quite relentless, and leaves little space for non-professional character development. Nor for the viewer to catch their breath. Obviously this is the most common war of them all in a lot of media mediums - that of Story vs Characters, and it's impossible to get the perfect blend - so for the most part, Death Note is still something of a masterpiece in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEyes?\\n\r\nEars?\\n\r\nSure they're good elements to consider for a review too, though i like to stay away from formulaic, rigid technical summaries... You'll be pleased to know that Death Note has some respectable audiovisuals. While strictly \"new anime\" viewers may take an episode or two to appreciate the art style, and while metal/death metal haters may not agree with the OPs. The presentation is colourful - where needed, and bleak, dark... where needed. Its main strength is the Story by far!\\n\\n\r\nI found Death Note thoroughly enjoyable, as it's one of the single most vivid, betrayal and deception infused, psychological wars out there, to which only one can emerge.\\n\r\nWhich one?

            "content": "So, I was recommended this anime by my friend who's quite a weeb. Even though he kept telling me to watch it, I still avoided it and man I was so wrong to do it, I always thought anime can't be interesting as Real shows but this show went over all my expectations in the terms of story. Anyways, I've done too much chit-chat so I'll start writing my review now. It's Quite short tho cause I'll be just focusing on three things. Story, Art and Music.\r\nStory\r\nThe main dish of this anime was its beautifully written story. Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata have explained theconcepts of this anime and manga in a lucid manner. Most of the animes fail to adapt and manage many complex things of the actual source. But, this anime has beautifully caught everything that was presented in its manga from that little potato chips scene to Light's way of thinking. Both the characters L and Light has a different definition of the word \"JUSTICE\"\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt's art was not that different from all the other animes though I guess it was one of those first animes to use those blue-red effects, It was quite appealing to my eyes, tbh.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThe opening of this anime pretty good to hear and I think it fits to the theme of the anime. The background music that played during the intense moments were pretty dope and it kinds of gives you some intense feeling while it plays.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When the Devil rebelled against God, he was cast out of Heaven and made to suffer in Hell. When Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they, too, were cast out of paradise and exiled into a life that ultimately culminates with death. Though ostensibly dissimilar, the sins of man and the Devil are, in fact, the same: they desired to put themselves on the level of God, and for that they were punished.\r\nIn many ways, this is the basis of the Faustian archetype. A man desires to become God only to find himself destroyed by the story'send. If you think back to all the characters from all the media you've consumed who have had god complexes, you'll find that few, if any, turn out to have a happy ending. I'm reminded in particular of Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\" -- the story of a brilliant man who sold his soul to become god on earth only to find himself dragged to hell at the story's end. The Faustian archetype is not an antiquated one, however. I like to think that Paul Thomas Anderson's \"There Will Be Blood\" is, in many ways, a Faustian tale. I also like to think that \"Death Note\" follows a similar Faustian vein.\\n\\n\r\nNow after walking the horse around the barn about five times, I arrive at \"Death Note\" -- one of the most popular works of anime ever made (according to myanimelist right now, actually, the *most* popular anime ever made). Spanning 37 episodes, \"Death Note\" tells the story of Light Yagami, an exceptionally intelligent Japanese high school student who one day stumbles across a notebook that claims to possess the power to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. Light takes up this newfound power with tremendous gusto, swearing to eliminate the wicked, build a better world, and proclaim himself the god of this new world. With countless soon dead, an urban legend soon crops up around the unknown perpetrator as authorities and civilians alike bequeath him the title \"Kira.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've never been a big fan of magical realism. The premise is rather fantastical, to say the least, and the megalomaniacal Light doesn't seem like the sort of guy you'd sympathize with -- though as the story progressed I did grow to pity him. Despite this, however, \"Death Note\" succeeds by way of its meticulous, masterful plotting and the staggering battle of wits between its two main characters -- Light, who I've already mentioned, and L, a genius detective working to catch Kira. Seeing the two of them duke it out as they consider, reconsider, devise, revise, and enact their schemes is a thrill to watch. A solid cast of supporting characters accompanies them, but the real ticket in town is this battle of two cerebral gods. Without them, this story falls apart, and they're both so masterfully crafted that they make sure this never happens.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as much as I hate to admit it, Light is by far one of the most brilliantly conceived characters I've ever encountered. I loathe him, despise him, sympathize with him, and pity him in equal measure. His boundless intelligence and astonishing charisma would elicit the support of many, but the power of the Death Note brings upon a descent into sociopathy that is by turns tragic and infuriating. For a man who aspires to be God, he really seems to encompass only one side of the essence of God. How does that old verse go? \"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away?\" If God exists, He is, in many ways, both creator and destroyer -- the one who gave birth to this world and so will take it to death. Indeed, God often seems like a rather contradictory figure -- creator and destroyer, an arbiter of both justice and mercy, light and dark, kind and cruel. Light, however, captures only one side of that dichotomy: he never creates, he rarely shows mercy, his very name belies his true nature, and he develops so little regard for human life that the mere suggestion of kindness from him is laughable. And yet, one can't help but wonder what he would have been like without the Death Note's corrosive influence. Hence my introduction with the Faustian stuff. A man who wants to become god slowly corrupted by his own ambition. His tragedy is a compelling one, and it's a tremendous testament to the writing that I can't call him outright \"evil\" -- merely misguided and so corrupted.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a tremendous work that has earned its popularity. I can't go into any further detail regarding Light's character and my thoughts on \"Death Note\" without spoiling anything, so I'll refrain from writing anything further. That being said, if you haven't seen \"Death Note,\" I would advise that you do so immediately. Chances are, you'll enjoy it; even if you don't, it's one of those things that just shouldn't be missed given its notoriety. You'll more likely fall under the former than the latter, though.",

            "content": "Death Note is perhaps one of the most popular anime ever created. It holds the top place right now on this website as the most popular show. For a large number of people, Death Note was the gateway series that led to them becoming a fan of anime. Generally, the only people who watch anime and have not seen Death Note yet are people who just haven't got around to watching it. So the question is, what makes this series so special, if can indeed be considered special at all?\r\nThe premise is perhaps the most attractive feature of the show; the power to kill withoutbeing detected. While this alone could be a central concept to be explored throughout the show, Death Note takes a different route. In the first episode it is established that the protagonist, Light Yagami, will be using the book to initiate his own version of justice upon the world. However, in the second episode the real story begins; a detective named \"L\" arrives to foil Light's plans. Thus begins one of the most intense and entertaining, back and forth, cat and mouse chases as Light tries to get rid of L while L does everything he can to find Kira (the name the people give to the invisible murderer; aka Light). \\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever read a Goosebumps book, an Agatha Christie novel or a similar kind of \"page-turner\" book, Death Note would be the anime equivalent. The ending of each episode feels like a cliffhanger and it will compel you to keep watching until you find yourself marathoning the series. There are twists and turns in every episode and due to how convoluted and complex Light's and L's plans are, each episode feels unpredictable. With the show being presented mostly from Light's point of view, there is no real good or bad guy. Instead, Death Note aims to entertain its audience by showing the methods Light uses and his thought processes during his attempts to defeat L. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes of the show take a backseat to the mind games between L and Light. The technical aspects of Death Note really enhance the show. Even the most simple events are portrayed in the most intense and dramatic manner. For example, writing names in the death note is depicted similar to striking with a sword. There is plenty of imagery used to depict the mind games between Light and L; most of which are accompanied by an internal monologue from Light. This gives an epic feel to what is essentially a guy thinking to himself. As for the sound, the voice acting is spot on and the soundtrack is appropriate; especially the use of the choir during Light's scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOne minor issue Death Note has is its supporting cast. While they do enough to be interesting, at times they bend too easily to Light's or L's will or are too naive to question either character's motives. The biggest issues in the show come in the last ten episodes. There are new characters introduced that are weak copies of L (eccentric detectives), the pacing is a mess and some of the better characters of the first two thirds of the show are almost forgotten; the most notable being Ryuk. This does not mean these episodes are not worth watching or that the show is ruined. It is just a drop in quality that is quite unexpected. The final conclusion to Death Note is still just as memorable and as high quality as the first two acts.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is one of the most accessible anime created. It is not deep and it never tries to be. It doesn't try to answer any questions about justice and it won't force you to support either of the main characters. The series manages to create a story that is gripping and suspenseful from beginning to end. For anyone who wants something entertaining and straightforward, or simply wants to watch something to get into anime, this is one of the best shows to watch. Will this be the best anime ever? For most people, no. But, it is almost guaranteed to be satisfying as a crime thriller and that is all that it was ever meant to be.",

I'm not going to explain the story, considering you should already know it. The soundtrack in Death Note is amazing! You should listen to it when you have the chance. Or just watchthe episodes again and listen to the amazing background music.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is incredibly enjoyable if you are interested in supernatural, psychological anime. I, for one, am one of those who are interested in psychological, supernatural anime. I will watch others, but I'm most interested in those ones. I haven't watched much anime, but I began my journey of anime not long ago.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note's characters are all, uh... I don't know. Light Yagami, for one is the anti-hero of the story. Some call him a crazy sonuvabitch, but I call him the anti-hero. Light is bored out of his mind, so what does he do?\\n\\n\r\nKill all them criminals.\\n\\n\r\nBadass, if you ask me. Now, in anime, the one thing I admire most is the badassery of the characters. Now, before any further information... I don't know if badassery is even a word. Ryuk is one of those characters who are just awesome and you don't really know why. Misa is pretty annoying, but lovable... I think. Or likeable. One of them. L is probably the best character in the entire series, Matsuda, the others, I don't really care about the rest of the task force. But, I have to admit, Aizawa is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nNow, enough chitter-chat, thus ending my review. This is my review, I haven't really wrote a review for an anime yet, but this is my review. Overall, I think I'd probably give this a 10/10 outstanding, wonderful, marvelous anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow keep calm, grab a death note, and kill some criminals!\\n\\n\r\n~ Deusen Moose",

You see Light pick up the book and later shinigami's starts fall from the sky i mean you couldnt imagine it different. But than it evolves in a great triller. And even after the 26 episode you still see mastermind battler between Light and N. To put it short you are mind blown for whole anime.\r\nL (Lawliet):\r\nthis is dedicated for you L. You are the real MVP.Through the anime L never cease to amaze me. His first scene already tells you that he thinks more like a alien than human. He finds out Light like a walk in a park. And even i didnt completely belive it. But when i checked again what he sad i was just stunned. Everything made sence. What im trying to say is that L is in my opinion the best character in his category (mastermind). We never knew much about L and in anime you never see flashbacks or memories of L. But thats not the problem cause as long L is alive you just wanna watch him. Every cutscene of him is like the best cake in the world. And even after he died he left behind another L but that one has more white hair than him probably older (jk is N dont hate him)\\n\\n\r\nL's dead to all the fans out there:\\n\\n\r\nDeath note is not all about L. Even tho i just compliment him for 5 minutes its just not all that anime can give. Think like that: L was fighting Light. They were both smart just that L had the police power and could do much more than Light. Light on the other side couldn't afford mistake's. But Light has advantage death note. L has the police, Light has super powers. And we can all agree that L won the battle he won it all before his death. What coverd Light was his dad. If he wouldn't be around Light would die in  12 episodes and that would end death note. But in the end L dies witch leads us to N. So his death wasn't in vain. Or to be more straight anime couldnt continue. If light wouldn't find death note and would be stuck with L forever anime would never finish. So don't be butthurt cause L died\\n\\n\r\nTnx for wasting your time or reading",

The series gets you hooked from the very beginning, which is something that, surprisingly, not a lot of anime (in my opinion) can do.\r\nFirst of all, the two main protagonists in Death Note are by far the best characterized and well made characters ever made in anime, EVER. Two geniuses, one an anti-hero and one a detective, make up one of the most dynamic and interesting rivalries I've everseen.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is extremely unique and is pretty damn good considering it came out all the way back in 2006; there's truly nothing like it. The story keeps you interested all the way through it's 37 episodes, even after a huge twist in the middle that damn near rips your heart out. It's practically impossible to stop watching since this anime does psychological thriller SO WELL. It has such an amazing soundtrack to fit with the theme and the setting the show gives off, and is just really the cherry on top of the cake. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a MUST SEE, especially if you are someone just getting into anime. Now, I do not believe there is any perfect show, so that's pretty much why I didn't give this thing all 10s across the board, but this is a legendary series that almost anyone can watch and enjoy. 9/10.",

            "content": "Death Note\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nDeath Note is a popular anime and it is easy to see why. It is a quality show that has plenty of character development, a complex storyline, good animation, a quality soundtrack, and a realistic setting combined with supernatural aspects. The show involves a lot of death so the immense popularity does somewhat surprise me, but then again, Attack on Titan is one of the most popular anime out there, and it involves just as much death and maturity.\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are a lot of positives to the show. The characters and their development make you feel strongly towardthem, whether it is love or hate. The Shinigami in the show are interesting and enjoyable to watch. The line between good and evil is difficult to see at times in this anime. Who is the hero and who is the villain? I found myself asking that question repeatedly throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You want a unique story that will have you hooked from the first episode. This is not just a quality anime, but a quality show of any type.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You do not have the patience for a 37 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Be prepared to pause before and after the commercial breaks. They show the rules of the Death Note.",

            "content": "Death Note definitely deserves all the praise it gets. I don't think it's overhyped at all. Albeit, the premise is a tad bit unrealistic. But that didn't prevent me from enjoying the anime. It's not like the show prides itself off it's realism. It's about a notebook that kills people, for fuck's sake. I respect the writers immensely, because they acknowledge that the premise is unrealistic. And by simply doing that, they turn a totally bullshit scenario into something more familiar. They use total fiction to invite more thought provoking and realistic ideas. So even though the literal plot might be a bit void ofrealism, it still manages to be filled with tropes that are intimate to real life. What I'm trying to say, is that by using a ridiculous premise (a notebook that kills people) and equally ridiculous characters (a 17-year-old genius who wants to play god), the show's plot eventually tells us, that in the end, no matter how good your intentions originally were, you're still just a bad person doing bad things. \\n\\n\r\nThrough all this, this very unrealistic anime presents itself as an examination of the very realistic idea of human morality and what makes us \"good\" people. It's truly a deep anime, so much so that its meaning can be debated for hours. That's why I think Death Note is not overhyped at all. Underneath its shallow, cheap action-y surface, Death Note raises questions of ourselves and humanity's strive for god-like control. \\n\\n\r\nPhilosophical nonsense aside, it does have its flaws in the conventional department. The soundtrack can sometimes be distracting. The animation style is sort of show-y, and sometimes I wished for a bit more subtlety. And the voice actor for Light sometimes put an odd emphasis on phrases for absolutely no reason, which was distracting (especially during dramatic scenes). And in later episodes, I began to question the quality of the plot arc we were going through, and what purpose it had to the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: What I can say for sure, is that it was a really enjoyable ride. I mean, what else can you expect from an anime staple?",

            "content": "(EDITED: OH MY GOSH I WAS SO TERRIBLE AT WRITNG/SPELLING/TYPING A YEAR AGO, I am so sorry) \r\n  I absolutely loved Death Note to be honest, even though the story got....less exciting after a certain episode further into the show. I thought that the fact that is was a psychological battle between Light Yagami who seems to be a protagonist in the beginning completely turns around and you soon figure out he was an antagonist. I also loved this series because a notebook which has the power to kill just by writing their name down, come on. That's awesome. Now L comes a fewepisodes in and is a major detective... but no one actually knows what he looks and or sounds like, working in the shadows of justice. (Sorry to all Light ((Kira)) supporters no offense intended).I quite liked it! It was very interesting! When I first saw Death Note I didn't want to watch it, thought it would be awful. I ran out of anime to watch and i finished it within a few days. I've re-watches the series multiple times and enjoyed it every time. I cried on a few episodes as well but not everyone is as emotional as me. Why I like it? It leaves you wanting more the way everything happens in the story, and way the characters relationship's develop further into the show.\\n\r\nSo Overall\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe story line kept me attached to the series I couldn't stop watching with all the twists, kept me on the edge of my seat :D\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI personally thought the artwork was outstanding the backgrounds were detailed for the most part and the characters were just amazing!\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI loved the music they would play throughout the episodes but sometimes...they would play it... Just a little to much, and the voice-acting was great I loved both subbed and dubbed but personally I prefer the dub. The voices fit them a bit better in my opinion.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI LOVE the characters! They develop relationships, crash, and burn them. The way the characters grow throughout the story just completely intrigued me! My favorite character honestly is L. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I said I love Death Note its just an amazing anime! If you haven't watched it I HIGHLY recommend it \\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nNot perfect for me but very, very close.\\n",

            "content": "Oh the great Death note what hasn't been said about this anime?... To be honest Death Note in my opinion its everything people said and more. \r\nThe story starts out simple, but later you will have to pay a lot of attention to details as things become much more complicated and a bit harder to follow. That might be a problem for some people, but like a said if you really pay attention you'll be a lot more interested in this characters and get familiar with them. Personally, I found it to be really interesting the way the story unfold, and came to an end.\r\nTheArt and Sound in Death Note its beautiful and dark really following the concept of the anime and giving this characters a perfect atmosphere. I really like the way the drawing from this characters was and how the attention to details was on both the characters and environments. The sound of Death note its made of Heavy Metal for both the openings and endings and ambient noises as background music. The music fits very well and give the anime a sense of sorrow and bleakness.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in Death Note are very interesting themselves, but mostly you'll be focusing on two characters Light Yagami AKA Kira and (L) both are very interesting characters, but I happen to like (L) more as a character. I found (L) to be very smart and kind of funny at times in a very sarcastic way. Also, he was a very determent guy who always came with great ideas and He wasn't afraid to face Kira himself. Light Yagami on the other hand was pretty much everything that (L) was and more. While (L) had a very lonely personality; Light was also a very lonely guy, but he was also very successful with chicks. I also like to add that I really hated Light, but for all the right reasons. He was using everyone around him and he didn't care about anyone. His sole purpose was to become the god of the new world he will create, and everyone who opposed will suffer the consequences. For all those reasons I hated this character, but in the way he did things made it all that much interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say I did enjoy this series a lot and most of this enjoyment came from the well crafted dialogue. Yes, there was also some action here and there, but what made this anime was its excellent and intelligent dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if there is anything wrong I can say about the show its probably the fact that there was a few episodes that weren't as good around the middle of the show, but that is a very minor complaint and nothing to take away from the experience. I also thought of that perfect world Light try to create and how wrong it will be because no matter how you try to change the world it will never be perfect. One example will be Religion and how each Religion wants to create this perfect world of peace, but there has been a lot of wrong with Religion as they have created a lot of wars, and also you see how each of then criticize each other even if they followed the same god.Good and Evil will always exist  and corruption its something that will always exist, we see it in: Politics, Religion, Wars, TV, on the Streets its everywhere. I know I deviate from this review on this last paragraph but I wanted to compare real life experience with the concept of this anime. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this show and by the end of it I was very satisfied with what it has offered me and the way it concluded. We humans can make this a better world, but we can never change the nature of every individual.",

            "content": "Captivating from the first hit, death note is a thrilling, exciting, huge mind game, and we get the front row seat.\r\nIt\\'s funny how a regular school person like Light Yagami finds a notebook that happens to kill anyone\\'s name that you write in it. What\\'s also fascinating is that you can even alter how the person dies. With this being known, Light finds a new hobby when obtaining this notebook, and gets a great idea: Why not cleanse the world of all of the bad people?! and create a new world with only good people that he can judge. Really, he wants to become &quot;God&quot;.\r\nItsounds absurd, but throughout this series, he seems to appear that way in many aspects. When he encounters people like L, who try to spoil his plan of a new world, it gets even better, you don\\'t want to stop watching it! Anyone that wants to watch a good anime, this is definitely worth watching, and from my opinion even re-watching. I will admit.. at some points the whole &amp;quot;killing people for a new world&amp;quot; plan gets a bit drawn out, but then new characters like Near, and Mello join the scene to complicate, and make Light\\'s plan even more interesting to watch. Shinigami Ryuk, who is the owner of this notebook is bored.. and loves eating apples.. he wants some entertainment, and he\\'s got it with Light!",

            "content": "You like brilliant plans? You like plot twists? Many times shows will have one, which is pretty much the serving size for the entire series for the main plot. Not Death Note. Death Note has a huge supply of brilliant schemes and they're thrown at you every episode. They do not skimp in this area!\r\nWhat can I say, whenever i talk about epic animes or someone asks me my favorite, \"Death Note\" is always at the tip of my tongue. Now I am aware its shortcomings in a couple of points, but I really can't knock down the entire series for them for a fewpoints in a couple of departments.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, let me say that there seriously needs to be more animes like this. Where they unfold amazingly genius schemes and tantalize your brain, not just \"oh hey let's fight using my super powers and once we kill the evil enemy with my hidden super duper super power at the end for the big boss and done deal\" That formula is getting so old, while there is a severe shortage of shows of the kind of ingenious mind-bending strategic style that Death Note is (which some call the genre of \"bran-fuck\").\\n\\n\r\n(To those also noticing the lack of \"brain-fuck\" series, may I direct you to One Outs, Akagi, Kaiji, and possibly Umineko Nakukoro no Ni)\\n\\n\r\nBack to Death Note. The show isn't so much about shinigamis as much as it is about the intellectual battle between one trying to kill while not getting caught and one trying to catch the killer. To make things more interesting, the two end up working side by side to catch the killer! So you can surmise just from the setup the kind of intellectual tidbits the killer will have to do as not to give himself away, and yet still go on with the killings, and deal with his pursuant. As the dance progresses, the ante and stakes get bigger and bigger just as the level of moments that make you say \"wow that's brailliant.\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, you can compare it to Dexter, the TV series, but Death Note delivers intellectual candy at a faster pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime runs a bit deeper than just unfolding juicy tactics, which I am supremely biased for, if you can't tell already (haha). The characters' endeavors themselves pose philosophical questions to the audience: \"Are humans, capable of weilding so much power and not going corrupt, even if you take a super smart, competent specimen, and he has noble aspirations to stat off with?\" Granted it's all fictional, but the series is more than just sweet strategies after another. It touches upon many other deeper themes of the morality and capacity of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe plans Light hatches to gain leverage on L, as well as the strategies L throws at Light will have you piqued and thinking.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the negativity and criticisms I have that does not give this series a perfect mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit unsatisfying. They also drag it out 20 more episodes than they should have, and in the 2nd half of the series, the wellspring of brilliant strategies clearly dries up. From the perspective of the producers and writers, it's understandable that they would want to include the extra characters, as well as possibly drag the series on for more episodes, but imo, it becomes very DBZ-like (in terms of the quality of episodes due to the decision to drag it out) in comparison with the first half of the series. There is a movie version of Death Note, and you will find that ending extremely satisfying. I always fantasize, \"what if the anime series was cut in half, and had the movie's ending? sigh, that would be the perfect series.\" And i really probably would give it perfect scores (in the appropriate departments).\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe Intros and endings, as well as all the in-anime suspense music paint the feeling extremely well. you'll just have to experience it to know what i'm talking about. Just know that they fit well and are very good. \\n\\n\r\n2nd intro theme. i'm not a fan of death metal at all, but i can see sort of the connection with light at this stage. If you read the lyrics of the first ending, Alumina - Nightmare, they depict a guy who decides do things with his own power, his own way, having been broken (no absolute truth) and confused. He's still holding onto his ideals. One cannot help but draw the connection to Light. The 2nd death metal intro song, however seems to paint Light's more depraved state, having gradually deviated from his just world ideal, and more enticed by being the ruler of the world (for power and to be god) as well as the victory of outwitting and eliminating L. But maybe i'm just mad and reading too much into the songs. =]\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, despite critical decisions for the series that drags it out, resulting in fallen quality than what it started out with, i still give this series high marks overall, for the first half was truly amazing, and the story is great. It's merely the execution that faltered a bit. I can't knock it down too much for that. It just prevents it from getting perfect marks.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why did I give 7 to Death note and placed it under my favorite anime?\r\nSimple...\r\nepisodes 1-25 = rate 10, episode 25-37 = rate 6, average = 8, but due to extreme rate failure, extremely boring and unimaginative episode, it doesn't deserve 8.\r\nTherefore, its 7.\r\nStory\r\nIts great, really. Anyone watching this anime can clearly see it has one great story with lots of upsets and wonderfully made events. Its never boring to watch it, because something happens all the time. And episodes 5-24, and constant \"conflicts\" between L and Light are so good I couldn't stop watching those episodes.\r\nArt\r\nNothing much to say. Nothing special, not bad, notawesome. Death scenes are somehow repetitive. Not too much blood, I like it, its heart attack as #1 death reason in here after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to sound. I did like the soundtrack for first 20 episodes, at least the intro song, didn't like the later song at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (possible spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it gets really fun. L is one of the greatest characters ever, and even though I hated him for his methods, I really missed him in later episodes. It simply wasn't as fun without him. Misa is standard woman in love, kinda confusing, but nicely done overall. Light is my favorite character in this anime, and for many reasons: 1. He is smart 2. He understand that sacrifices are required sometimes  3. Did I say he is really smart?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI will not comment this one. Every person has its own sense of enjoyment. As I said in the beginning, I loved episode 1-25, and really didn't like 25-37.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt is a great tv show. Definitively a must see. Some late episodes just ruined it for me, it just wasn't it in the end, it was boring and it didn't keep me begging for more like first episodes. Once again, it is important to know this is my own opinion, so many people will disagree with this, that's normal.\\n\r\nIf this was split into 2 parts instead of one with 1-25 being first season, and 25-37 second season, it would be great original with bad sequel, this way it is just another great anime ruined by late episodes.",

            "content": "Death Note tells the story of Light (Raito) Yagami, a seventeen-year-old genius whose life drastically changes when he chances upon the Death Note. The black notebook, despite its unassuming appearance, has the deadly ability to kill, requiring only a name and a face. Dropped in the human world by the bored death god (shinigami) called Ryuk, the Death Note proves itself a most destructive weapon when Light decides to use it to kill criminals, intending for himself to be the god of the new world he will create \u2013 a world purged of evil.\r\nDistinguishing itself from the run-of-the-mill stories of heroes who possess hearts ofgold, Death Note introduces Light Yagami, the cunning young man who will stop at nothing to make the world a better place. Light is intelligent, disgusted with how the world is turning out, and bored out of his mind. That he seeks to punish the wicked using the Death Note is a noble intention by itself, but his method of passing judgment is hardly orthodox, and gains the sympathy of neither the police nor his adversary, L.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying opposite Light (at this point dubbed Kira by the public), L is the mysterious detective in charge of the Kira investigation. World-renowned for his unparalleled ability in solving cases (and taking only those that interest him), L takes Kira head-on, and challenges the latter to a mind duel \u2013 a clash where the one who is found first pays with his life.\\n\\n\r\nFast-paced, suspenseful and gripping, Death Note sets the bar high for the anime of the generation. With its compelling characters and well-contrived plot, Death Note keeps its viewers on the edge of their seats each time Light tries to draw the suspicion away from himself while trying to find out just who exactly L is. Light, despite the terrible things he has done to get away with what he's doing, doesn't fail to deliver with his strategic mind and measured smiles. L, despite his peculiar, deceptive appearance, never lets down with his likewise brilliant counter-offensive. Both manipulative, cold and calculating - Light and L dare each other with an almost childish, egotistical desire to win. It's the striking combination of similarities and differences between them that makes their characters believable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nYet, without this already compelling rivalry between Light and L, Death Note still manages to fascinate. Through the development of Light's character alone and the presentation of his choices when he takes possession of the Death Note, the series shows the ultimate peril of having the Death Note: It can destroy the one who holds it.\\n\\n\r\nThe realistic portrayal of Light and his descent to madness in search of justice is an interesting perspective to consider. That Light begins as an innocent and virtuous young man illustrates that some evil come forth through good intentions; and that some good, through bad. Those same virtues and ideals, no matter how good they are, ultimately caused Light to choose the path he treaded and take the course of actions that he did.\\n\\n\r\nThe death god Ryuk, with his odd sense of humor and obsession with apples, does not fail to make light of the grim atmosphere in the series. In a direct contrast to his considerably good nature, he fittingly ends the series by writing Light's name in his notebook. With this, he keeps his promise that he will take Light's life when the time comes.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note ends in a cruel loop; Kira was born because of a death god's whim, and Kira dies because of the same god's whim. While not intended to symbolize anything, these circumstances underscore Light's unsuccessful attempt to become a god himself - because from the very beginning, his fate has been in the hands of the same god he wished to equal.\\n\\n\r\nWhat he wished to change changed him, and ultimately, Light Yagami lost himself to the Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Note is a remarkable glimpse at the human folly, a look at the nature of man and a twisted concept of justice that sprung from the righteous ideals. Prompting its audience not only to choose sides, it also initiates one to think and reason with himself for or against the alternatives that face the characters in the series. Thought-provoking and a very intelligent watch, Death Note is undoubtedly genius at its finest, and while it does not answer its questions about morality and murder point-blank, it imparts with its audience a message worth thinking about:\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute power corrupts - absolutely.",
