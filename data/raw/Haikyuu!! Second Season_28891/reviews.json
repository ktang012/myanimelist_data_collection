            "content": "This is my first review ever and I absolutely loved the show, so expect this to be very biased.\r\nStory: The story is the best one you can get from a sports anime. Of course there's nothing complex, such as a great mystery or an awesome plot full of twists and something like that. Nevertheless, it's still awesome and original. We actually get some background on almost every character, even the less important ones. Our main characters are a yin-yang duo: they are opposites of each other, and yet, they become a single destructive weapon for their team. We also have Hinata's ambition on the LittleGiant and the rivalry between Tobio and Oikawa. But overall we have a typical shounen plot: a lot of action given by a group of friends trying to become the strongest. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't have much to say about this because I don't understand too much about drawing and art style, but Haikyuu!!'s one of the best i've ever seen on a shounen anime. The style is unique and very well made, you can see the mark of the mangaka on each character despite the fact that they are all very different. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is very good. Every scene has a song which fits perfectly. Each track is able to get us in the mood for the specific moment, being it sad, funny or exciting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here's the best part of the show. Haikyuu!! has incredible characters on every team. This is not that kind of show where we care only about the protagonists. We actually love all of the players and the teams. It's hard to decide which one we want to cheer for. The character development is something amazing. We see how Karasuno's pinch server who used to be a shy and weak boy become something essential for his team, while growing his confidence and pride. The relationships between team members is also very well executed, like the one of Hinata and Kageyama or even with opponents, like Hinata and Kenma. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Extremely exciting to watch. I get goosebumps on every game and I almost cry with the flashbacks. The animation studio is godlike and each movement flows like magic on the screen. Haikyuu!! is also funny and is full of \"chill out\" moments that make us smile. The background stories, the side characters talking on the bench, everything is just amazing to watch. One of the best shows ever, it never gets boring.",

            "content": "As you probably already know, competitive spirit, teamwork, communication, and perseverance are all common themes that unite the sports genre as a whole. Therefore, to truly differentiate one show from other similar shows, scriptwriters need to engage the audience in a remarkably new and refreshing way.\r\nI think for some people, this show is able to connect with them on some deeper, meaningful level. The way that this show engages with its audience is truly something else. The way Karasuno interacts, the way they crack jokes, and their never-ending drive to succeed \u2013 it makes you feel excited. It\u2019s as if you are there physically withthem, cheering the underdogs on as they take on the world around them.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I appreciate how some individuals who were disregarded in the first season are now given much more depth. Consider Tsukishima, for instance. After losing to their ever-so-favorite rivals, the Karasuno team is rebuilding as a team and honing their skills by attending training camps. It is during this when Tsukishima\u2019s time to shine came. In a single episode, we learned why Tsukishima is so deeply affected by his brother\u2019s betrayal and why Tsukishima is such a lone wolf. Thanks to a push by his close friend Yamaguchi, Tsukishima finally learns the true meaning of teamwork, and, from this, he begins to participate in team-building activities (i.e. playing mini-games against with other schools in the training camp). In the first season, you know he would never ever do something like this. It is very fortunate that Tsukishima decided to change; if he didn\u2019t, he would never have been able to hone his skillset, which becomes especially important during the spring qualifiers. Another example: Ennoshita. He becomes a key motivator for the team. He has some big shoes to fill, and he would never have been in this position if it weren\u2019t for Daichi.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I really liked about what Haikyuu is how the antagonists (i.e. Karasuno\u2019s rivals) are also characterized. How many shows out there have you watched where you have had one-dimensional villains (or antagonists or bad guys or whatever you want to call them) that you couldn\u2019t relate to? Too many, right? Fortunately, Haikyuu breaks away from this by giving a lot of the antagonists some serious backstory. Most of the time we are able to learn what volleyball means to the rival, what kind of a team player they are, and why the match means so much to them.\\n\\n\r\nBut there\u2019s only one major downside that I can think of: there\u2019s an obvious imbalance regarding the characters. Haikyuu has a tendency to characterize just one individual at a time. People who were given a decent amount of screen time during the first season (e.g. Nishinoya) are suddenly ignored this season; others (e.g. Hinata and Kageyama) decrease in significance. On the other hand, some of the second year benchwarmers still get no screen time. It\u2019s a shame, really. If the show were able to balance out its characters better, we would have been able to understand better how the team operates as a whole and see much more team synergy as a result.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving onto the plot \u2013 the plot is more of a mixed bag, to be honest. Yes, it\u2019s exciting to some degree, but the pacing of the plot is not Haikyuu\u2019s strongest point. It\u2019s rather sluggish, and it\u2019s usually due to the following factors:\\n\\n\r\n- The characters talk a lot. Like a lot. Imagine you and your best friend talking. Multiply that by 10.\\n\r\n- They all think a lot too. They are trying to anticipate their opponents.\\n\r\n- The characters are given a backstory.\\n\r\n- Characters are trying new flashy moves. Groovy.\\n\r\n- Sensei is playing the \u201cI\u2019m new to volleyball please explain everything to me\u201d or the \u201clisten to my wise words\u201d role for you.\\n\r\n- The team that Karasuno is playing against is surging ahead in number of points, and the characters are trying to think of a way to fight back.\\n\r\n- Or they\u2019re literally just hitting the ball back and forth endlessly. Who\u2019s going to get the point? \\n\\n\r\nThis constant pattern causes each major match drags out over 2-3 episodes. I\u2019m not entirely sure if this is necessary \u2013 although they are all technically well-incorporated, there is a point when you become impatient and want to know what the results of the match are. As for non-matches, there is sometimes extraneous information that really serve no purpose in the context of the show. I wouldn\u2019t say 10 minutes of eating BBQ after a nice, long training camp and male volleyball players commenting on the superficial looks of the high schools\u2019 assistant managers was necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s plot armoring. I really hate to say it, but for shows like these, plot armoring is inevitable (would you want to keep watching a team that keeps losing? Unless you\u2019re a diehard fan, I didn\u2019t think so), so it really is a question of how well-balanced it is. It is easy to say, \u201cYou know, they deserve it, they\u2019ve been working hard as a team\u201d and allow the underdogs to keep winning consecutive matches. Fortunately, for Haikyuu, plot armoring is heavily restricted to what is absolutely necessary. For instance, Karasuno doesn\u2019t have to win every practice match (as an audience member, however, I know you\u2019re secretly praying for them to win. Don\u2019t worry, I did that too) and good thing they don't \u2013 otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have been able to learn from their mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNow briefly for one more positive thing about the plot: there's humor and it's well-incorporated throughout the show. Haikyuu would have been utterly flat without it. The way the characters interact and make fun of each other came off as very natural. It kept the ball rolling, especially when things got extremely sluggish.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were all excellent. Animation was done very well by Production I.G (see Ao Haru Ride, Kuroko No Basket, and Kimi ni Todoke), although nothing was truly that remarkable. For sound, the OP was very moving and embodied the whole competitive spirit. Voice acting was decent too for the context of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo is it the best sports anime ever? Eh, debatable. It has a lot to offer in terms of characters and will keep you on your toes, but the show is terribly paced. Given this, if you thoroughly enjoyed the first season, don\u2019t worry; you will like the second season too due to its similar execution.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that\u2019s all out of the way, it was a fun ride when it lasted. I can\u2019t wait to see what the third season has in store for us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: B\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.",

            "content": "The sports genre..  if you're not a fan of it then it can't be helped but GODDAMN how much you're missing out. Most people don't start watching anime with the sports genre and even when they dive deeper into the vast sea of anime genres, it is one that usually is missed out.\r\nNow how does Haikyuu, a simple series mean that you miss out a lot?\r\nWell, a lot of sports genre is usually thought the same way as battle shounen where \"friendship is magic\" since many times in sports anime, as well as in Haikyuu also, shounen genre plays a great role. Even toughthere are some moments that give you the shivs, make your hair stand up or get you super thrilled by a game, that's just one part of what makes Haikyuu so amazing. The real awesome parts are the most memorable characters, their individual in-depth development and the great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything new. A team sport: our main characters are obsessed with winning and want to make it to the nationals with their team. This is the basis for many team sport or solo sport game. It's just executed so well that you forget that it is kinda generic. While Haikyuu's storyline revolves around their team progressing towards the nationals, the ultimate goal, it is not the focus point of the story. In other sports animes, like KnB (Kuroko no Basket) or DnA (Diamond no Ace) where the team aspect is important they focus more on the skill aspect rather than, like in Haikyuu, the team synergy/team synchronization.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progressess the team evolves. Sure their individual skills grow as well but that's beyond the point. One of the main characters, Hinata Shoyo, is a great example of that. The only time when we have focused on his individual development and skill growth a lot was in one or two episodes. Before that, we were given a quick flashback in the beginning of the first season of how he became what he is now. The first seasons' story as well as the seconds' focus on the combination plays of the team more than Hinata's solo growth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nthere are two main art styles here. The shounen artstyle, very riveting and intimidating which makes your heart throb. The other one is the more comedic artstyle, which is actually used quite a bit. One great plus of the show is how they use these two styles together. Because of the nature of the main characters, the comedic artstyles can be used everywhere. Because one of our MC's is so hyper and energetic it creates many great opportunities to use both artstyles. And when it comes to the former one, the shounen style, it makes everything extra exciting because we normally see our main character used in the more comedic artstyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character that our story focuses on, is Tobio Kageyama. As he is seen as Hinata's partner throughout the series, he is characterized on the contrast side to Hinata. Where Hinata is energetic and easy-go-happy, Kageyama is more silent, serious and intimidating most of the time. Because he is the counterpart to Hinata and is the complete opposite of him, you can almost guess it, when he is normally used more in the shounen style, and suddenly used in the comedic style.. it is super hilarious. These two create one hell of a combination which benefit from each other in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhile other shows usually use quite flashy colors *looking at you KnB*, Haikyuu actually is one of those series where the color differentiation is not that flashy. Sure you can make the argument that Hinata has different colored hair than anyone else and one member of the core team, Nishinoya, has one part of his hair way different than the other but that's about it. It isn't used as generically as in KnB (it is the easiest one to compare this show to xD). \\n\\n\r\nThe general artstyle of the show, how the characters are drawn and what kind of backgrounds there are is very simple but still unique. I just love the way Haikyuu looks like.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI guess there is not much to say about characters anymore. The one and only being that Haikyuu really explores one or two players of the opposing team always. To some of the antagonistic characters we are given a full detailed backstory and Haikyuu really does that well. In the long running series it's always great to have a full in-depth backstory to every main- and side character (well at least to the bigger side characters). \\n\\n\r\nWhat really is the advantage of this show is the fact that you can't hate anyone (at least I couldn't). Every single character is made so lovable, so interesting in their own way or relatable that they just seem to stick in your head. It is rare for team sport games to have memorable side characters since they usually are shown only for a little while and are not given much of a perspective. This is what separates haikyuu from every other sports anime. The second season of this show is the prime example of this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe shounen aspect of this anime really brings out the greatness of the voice actors/actressess. Be it Hinata's screaming \"give me the ball!\" Or the whole team giving the simultanious \"bring it on\" it is always a great moment that really highlights the characters themselves as well the team aspect and Haikyuu's own athmosphere. During the intense matches there are always playing these 'shounen type' songs which really lift the athmostphere to to max. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't only during the games that the sounds are great. When giving a flashback, or Hinata and Kageyama are riling themselves up for the upcoming match, there can be heard awesome music playing in the background. So the soundtracks and voice actor/actress performances are alwyas top notch but what really highlights the most Haikyuu's sounds are the openings. The opening songs are probably one of the most intense, mood lifting and hyping song you could've hoped for. \\n\\n\r\nYou are most likely familiar with One Punch Man or Fullmetal Alchemist. Their openings are really the ones that get you riled up. They set the mood and get you ready for the epicness that is going to be unfold. Haikyuu rivals if not for some, exceeds these two. Haikyuu's openings, be it from season 1 or 2, are the best to get you ready for the show when it comes to the sports genre. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\\n\\n\r\nMost of you who are reading this probably are a fan of sports genre. Then you should know that sports genres' anime are really enjoyable, especially when there are lovable characters and epic moments to share. These are what Haikyuu offers to you. Great characters, awesome shounen moments, intensive games featuring aspects from comedy to drama. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series and can proudly say that this is one of my all time favorites. As far as a single season by itself, it did pretty frickin' well. You can easily see that from MAL's score. Throughout the season it was always in the Top 20 highest rated of all time. When the season ended, no surprise, a sudden increase came, and now it is almost rivaling a place in the Top 10. That's how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this series?\\n\\n\r\nFan of sports genre or not, yes. Absolutely yes. This is a great show to start the sports genre with or if you're familiar with it, why haven't you already seen this? Sure KnB was probably more popular but this is what sports anime should be like.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 11/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review comes from someone who actually plays volleyball, so my opinion is god ;)\r\nHello everyone, it\u2019s your family friendly, volleyball playing, review writing member of the MAL community here, bringing you what is known as a \"review\u201d. I hope I can do the series proper justice and be fair to the quality of the show while also conveying the series from the perspective of someone who is passionate about the sport. This review is going to be pretty unconventional and non-structured, so I\u2019m sorry about that, do your best to follow along with my style of reviewing.\r\nTo start, I want to say that Haikyuuis not a complex show. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but if you\u2019re going in expecting sophistication and subtle themes to be brought up in a thought-provoking manner, you\u2019re not going to get it. If you\u2019ve watched season 1, you generally have a pretty good idea about what you\u2019re getting into, but if you haven\u2019t (not sure why you\u2019d be reading this if you haven\u2019t lol), don\u2019t expect anything more than a really good shounen. Not an FMA or HxH type shounen, but still great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems I had with the first season and in my review after the show had begun airing, was how basic it was. The moves they were doing weren\u2019t that significant if you\u2019ve ever played volleyball, and nothing was very noteworthy or impressive, yet they were treated as such. This seriously put me off at first and I couldn\u2019t get over it. Now, however, I\u2019ve come to tolerate it much more than I did before, so I won\u2019t get into all of the technicalities I had previously listed out because I simply don\u2019t care anymore. Well, except one that needs to be brought up. The whole \u201cKageyama putting crazy spin on the ball so that its momentum stops and Hinata hits it\u201d is illegal. A set ball is not legally allowed to get more than about 3 rotations. Anything more than that and you\u2019ll get called on a double. I\u2019m not even going to bring the stretching of physics into it, but it shouldn\u2019t matter. The set has no practicality and is completely illegal. I don\u2019t know why this was included and it does bother me a bit, but if you didn\u2019t know it was illegal, it probably didn\u2019t bother you at all, so this is mainly a personal gripe.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the middle part of this show, I began to get a little bored. There were a lot of matches that started to blend together and I was craving for something to change. I was even considering dropping my score to an 8 because of it. This is probably only a problem if you were watching it as it\u2019s airing, week by week. I imagine that a marathon would help make each part more distinct because you\u2019re being fed it faster and can thus make the distinctions more easily. Anyway, this issue I had was completely shattered in episode 23 and 24. These two episodes were phenomenal. For sake of not spoiling anything, I won\u2019t go into detail, but the final match they played, specifically how it ended, had me sitting on the edge of my chair throughout. The very final still-frame scene gave me chills. The build-up was great, the final play was appropriate, the atmosphere was perfect, and everything in the 5 minutes leading up to it were nearly flawless. I was extremely impressed.\\n\\n\r\nIn this season, each major character was developed to a much greater degree than in the previous season. This is probably because we had already been introduced and familiarized with them, so it was now possible to go into depth with each of their personalities. I really appreciated this and it was much improved from the first season in which only Hinata and Kageyama received a serious amount of backstory and motive explanation. The side characters (meaning the people on the opposing teams that received at least a considerable amount of screentime) were very appropriately handled. They didn\u2019t get much depth, but they didn\u2019t need to. They\u2019re outsiders after all. It would be weird to give them so much development seeing as they don\u2019t affect anything about the story at all aside from one match or a practice session. It was very realistic. I can say from personal experience that during club season, you do pay attention to certain people more than other people and you gravitate towards watching their matches because you think they\u2019re good, have an interesting playstyle, are an athletic freak, or any other reason. When you play these people you want to do as well as you can, subconsciously trying to impress them, even if you\u2019ve never spoken to them in your life. This is what happens for Hinata and Kageyama quite a bit, and to restate, it really captured a realistic feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stellar as always, but this is Production I.G. we\u2019re talking about, so that\u2019s to be expected. The slow motion shots looks great, it\u2019s fluid throughout, and everything is high quality, so you\u2019ll find no complaints from me. Similarly to the soundtrack, however I must say that nothing truly stood out for me. With the OST, everything is solid, but nothing is exemplary. It makes the show better, but it doesn\u2019t go above and beyond, which is certainly all right. Not every show needs a grammy nominated soundtrack accompanying it.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the comedic aspects of the show to be spot on. I cannot tell you how many times I had to pause the episode, take a screenshot of whatever was going on, and then send that screenshot to my friends in Skype, usually pissing them off while I\u2019m laughing throughout the whole process. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a comedy critic or expert or whatever, but I\u2019ve listened to a lot of standup comedy and I can at least say that I can usually weed out good comedy from bad comedy, and while this isn\u2019t necessarily the most witty and clever, it\u2019s absolutely better than most of the shows that try to do the same thing. It was almost always hit and rarely miss.\\n\\n\r\nTime to bring it back down to earth for a minute though. I have heard many people say that this anime got them into volleyball, either playing or watching, and I have to warn you guys. Haikyuu volleyball is not like real volleyball. Haikyuu is a lot more exaggerated and precise because it\u2019s an anime. You can\u2019t capture the complexity of the sport or the sheer amount of things going on around you and the chaos of volleyball in an anime. Just as an example, there are many times in real life where you get a great set, you go up to hit, and you just hit the ball into the net or straight out. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times, your average player does it a lot too, and it commonly happens to even the best players. These simple mistakes just aren\u2019t present in Haikyuu. If you want to see what high-level, real volleyball is like, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEB96RVl_Ww (if you don\u2019t care about all the warmups or the preliminary commentary, skip to 7:30).\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve sufficiently summarized Haikyuu, so I suppose it\u2019s time to wrap things up. With this show, there just aren\u2019t a lot of things that you can point out as problems. The pacing in the middle, sure, the lack of complexity or depth, maybe (but it\u2019s a sports shounen, don\u2019t come into a show expecting something you know you won\u2019t get), and the OST, maybe, but that\u2019s about it. My problems with the volleyball playing itself and the fact that I dislike drama is exclusive to me, so others may not have these issues. Everything else ranges from very good to outstanding leaving little room for criticism. This is the most overall enjoyable and well-made show to come out in the past 2 season, which says a lot considering the fact that we\u2019ve been bombarded with One Punch Man and Erased hype throughout each. When all's said and done, Haikyuu is a show that you should not miss. I\u2019m looking forward to watching season 3 when it comes out.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. If you have feedback of any kind, please tell me, I\u2019m always open to conversation.",

            "content": "Just one more point. You take a deep breath in, trying to truncate the overwhelming anxiety infiltrating your own body. Your pulse quickens and your mouth feels like gritty sandpaper, all while trying to keep your body from collapsing out of sheer exhaustion. The raucous cheering from the crowd serves as nothing but a muffled backdrop to the sound of your intensifying heartbeat.\r\nJust one more point. It's your turn to serve. Countless nervous eyes upon you, the florescent gymnasium lights oppressively beat your feeble body down with rays of warmth. The thought of the win or loss being on your shoulders causes your legs toquake with fear. Your arm feels like jello as you throw the ball up, sweat running down your forehead and stinging your eyes as you struggle to track it in the air.\\n\\n\r\nJust one more point. As you smack the ball your hand begins to throb, your heart begins to beat louder as you tirelessly contemplate the quality of the serve you just made. Will it make it over the net? How easily will they receive it? I wish I would've hit it harder. I should've used a jump serve, but I wanted to be conservative. All these thoughts run through your mind as the ball sails through the air. \\n\\n\r\nJust one more point. THIS is the glory that is Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nIntensity may only be a nine letter word, but the plethora of emotions derived from it are unquantifiable. Anger, doubt, fear and adrenaline are all feelings that stem from being placed into an intense situation, and perhaps no anime series sheds light on this phenomenon better than Haikyuu. I've seen a handful of shows struggle with trying to balance moments of suspense with plot or character development. What some writers fail to realize is that the synergy created from combining the two elements together, births an even more remarkable method of storytelling. The hype factor in Haikyuu season two is unreal, and the writers checked off my list of issues from the first season one by one as the show went on. Edge of your seat action, coupled with enjoyable/developed characters and stunning visual sequences helped this season of Haikyuu storm to the top of my favorites after a jaw-dropping final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis season picks up right where the last left off, and while most teams would be struggling to pick up the pieces, Karasuno is banding together to become even stronger in the Spring tournament. It was refreshing to see Hinata actually open his eyes (both literally and figuratively) when it came to execution, and he got proper technique training from one of the best in the biz. While many may be quick to toss aside the episodes at the training camp, I believe those episodes were critical in the development of the story. Hell, they even gave us backstory on Tsukishima... turning from a sarcastic know it all to a rather redeemable character. The relationship between Kageyana and Hinata is as polarizing as ever, and their chemistry as teammates constantly evolves as the series continues.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of Haikyuu is the character development of Karasuno's opponents. Why must we constantly be flooded with vanilla antagonists having virtually no backstory, and a motive with no justification? Many bad guys have a reason for their behavior, thus having this information presented to the viewer deepens the conflict and adds feelings of empathy. Haikyuu mends this chronic error by delivering sufficient backstory to even the most insignificant character. On the contrary, this could also be seen as a shortcoming due to the overwhelming amount of characters the series already contains. A delicate balancing act is concocted but I feel overall Haikyuu remains in the green here. A few new characters were introduced, including one black haired enigma (who I can't remember the name of) filling in for the captain who seemed to come out of nowhere. I relied on the flashbacks to cover my mental gaps on that one.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I appreciated the story progression, the middle third of season two is a tad slow. Due to the seasonal episode structure you pretty much knew Karasuno would make it through the first few rounds, so it was difficult to get attached to any of those matches. Also, due to the sheer intensity in most of the second season, the comedy took more of a backseat then in the first installment. Not a major complaint, just more of a blemish if anything. The writers buff the show back up with a remarkable ending, with episode 24 being one of the most memorable of all time for me. The way each character strained to get every percent of use out of their body was inspiring, and the final exchange between teams was epic.\\n\\n\r\nThough I haven't actually played volleyball before, I can speak for the amazing use of sound effects throughout the series. The squeaking of sneakers, and thuds from players hitting the gym floor were spectacular. It took me back to my days in high school while playing indoor sports. Not to mention the palpable atmosphere created by the roaring crowd and pumped up teammates. The series isn't entirely focused on one character, but how they fill each other's voids or weaknesses. Through quality writing and vivid visuals, the matches themselves are a sight to behold. This is some of the best art in modern anime, and not necessarily from a technical perspective, but from the ability to prompt emotions out of the illustrations. The hype factor is off the charts.\\n\\n\r\nI can only imagine how fun it must've been to be in the recording booth with some of Haikyuu's voice actors. The amount of screaming they do throughout the series would burst any normal man's vocal chords. Both openings were intense and added excitement each time I turned on my computer to watch the show. I didn't care much for either ending, but these seem to be hit and miss for me these days. The rest of the music was seamless, transitions seemingly invisible. Smooth transitions and peppy, fast paced tracks to go along. \\n\\n\r\nWatching the crows grow together was a delightful experience. Although I enjoyed the first season, I didn't have as high of expectations for season two. I was completely knocked off of my rocker with this one. I urge those of you who haven't had the pleasure of watching this gem, BELIEVE the hype... Embrace it, and enjoy the ride that is Haikyuu!",

            "content": "Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu.\r\nWith most sports anime, the pacing of the storyis hard to bear. In some shows, a match can last nearly half a season. With Haikyuu, it never felt this way. Each episode had a succinct amount of storytelling and the pacing was perfect. From the training camps they attended, to the matches that were played, every episode was a thrilling ride that always managed to be satisfying. One of Haikyuu's biggest strengths is how it properly sets up each story arc with the necessary back stories to each character. This type of information provided is exactly why this show is so good. It gives you the \u201cwhy should you care\u201d for nearly every aspect of the show. Haikyuu also mixes the elements of a story masterfully. Comedy, action, shounen, it's all there and perfectly balanced. Comedy was put in at the right times and had me rolling on the floor on more than one occasion. The action is thrilling in the big matches and the shounen aspect of \u201cimproving\u201d is so engraved in the viewer, it just feels so good to root for Karasuno.  The attention to detail in the story is by far one of the best of any shows I've seen and it truly makes for a great watching experience. \\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G has done a great job with the animation for Haikyuu. The animation quality is top-notch and most importantly, consistent. In fast-paced action scenes, the animation becomes incredibly intense, but it's very well done and gives a much needed \u201coomph\u201d for climaxes in the story. Character design is varied and unique as well. Far too often in other anime shows, the characters all look alike. Haikyuu does not experience this with its large cast of characters that are appealing and uniquely designed.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu's voice acting, background music and OST are, like the rest of the show, great. The OP and ED are fitting for the theme of the show. The background music in scenes are also utilized very well. Some other shows try to force insert songs in scenes that do not fit well but Haikyuu does not suffer from this. Haikyuu's OST is near perfect and manages to help emphasize the emotions experienced in the show. Google Haikyuu's OST and prepare to be blown away (or just listen to it while watching). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Haikyuu are most definitely its strongest point. I briefly mentioned this earlier, but Haikyuu fully develops each character in the show. The characters all grow throughout the series. None of them are 'perfect' from the start and altogether gives it a certain type of realism. Most people like to root for the underdogs and that's essentially the same feeling you get from Haikyuu. There is no 'Gary Stu' as each person has their strengths and weaknesses. Even the seemingly perfect Oikawa Tooru has his own weaknesses in that he is not a 'prodigy' but someone who worked his way up. I also appreciated that each character in the show has an impact. For example, Yachi, the manager, is not someone who just stands on the sidelines cheering Karasuno on. Haikyuu shows you her back story as well as her perspective. This greatly adds to the storytelling and to her character in general. Same goes for Tsukishima. His backstory is fleshed out and tells us why he acts the way he does. Each character is important to the overall story and is truly a 'cog in the machine' for Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nMy initial thoughts upon seeing the preview for the first season of Haikyuu is that I couldn't possibly find volleyball interesting. Now, 50 episodes later, I can't fathom how I'm going to wait for the third season. Haikyuu is not 'perfect' and of course has certain elements like 'they can't be losing all the time' armor plot. But again, Haikyuu is a fictional anime with the sole purpose of entertaining you. In this case, it is very much about the journey, not the destination. If you only care to look at the small conveniences that a story may take, you'll miss out on everything else that makes it great. For me, Haikyuu was an enjoyable show that I looked forward to watching every Sunday. With fully developed characters that you can care about, a great OST and masterful storytelling, Haikyuu is worth your time as it is an excellent example of just how entertaining anime can be.",

            "content": "The second season of the Haikyuu!! surpasses the first one by having more creative \u201cfunny\u201d moments, longer screen time for the secondary characters, and impressive plot/character development. I\u2019m sure many of us watch anime out of enjoyment but having an anime that is motivating & inspirational will eventually leave a deeper impact \u2014 I\u2019ve started running after watching Hinata and Kageyama run during practice, no jokes. \r\nThe strongest element of the show is hands down, the characters. Not only do we focus on the achievements of the main protagonists but we also get to see more of the \u201csecondary\u201d characters in the show (I hatecalling them secondary because I feel like they\u2019re all equally important). You cannot watch Haikyuu!! and not want both teams to win because you see how hardworking and talented each team is.\\n\r\nI must say, the creator is a genius for coming up with such diverse group of characters, artwork and story. In addition, the animation team did an excellent job bringing the manga to life and keeping it real. I hope everyone gives this wonderful anime a chance and experience all the goodness it has to offer.",

            "content": "\u201cLa semplicit\u00e0 \u00e8 la suprema sofisticazione\u201d or, in english, \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\", one of my favorite quotes from Leonardo Da Vinci.\r\n(Hi human! This \u201creview\u201d will cover the 3 seasons WITHOUT spoilers, sorry for my mediocre english)\r\nMy character development:\r\n2 WEEKS AGO: i don\u2019t get how people can write long parragraphs just about one anime, they are so good, i wouldn\u2019t find so much things to say.\r\n1 WEEK AGO: I would love to review this show! I have so much thoughts i want to express!\r\nHi! I have to say, this is my first review here, so if you want you can run away from itAHAHAHAH. Really i don\u2019t mind if you won\u2019t read aaaall of this because it\u2019s boring, i wrote it especially for me (cathartic purposes). But PLEASE! Give this show a shot. PLEASE!! You won\u2019t regret it (hopefully). PLEASE!!!\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 9/10 (AND MY OPINION ON THE SPORT GENRE LIMITATIONS)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, its Premise is cliche and not \u201coriginal\u201d. Actually, is the Apotheosis of Simplicity: basically an underdog tale. You all have watched something like this at least once, right? yes and No.\\n\r\nIt may be cliche, but i took some cinematography classes, so i\u2019m a strong believer (like, SUPER STRONG BELIEVER), that is for 90% the EXECUTION what makes a show/movie/whatever worth and great, not its premise. A theorically interesting premise can end up being shit, or vice-versa. So, i want to \u201cexplain\u201d why Haikyuu!!, despite having a cliche premise, not only succeeds, but excels (for me, obv) in its genre and in general too. The universe the story takes place in doesn\u2019t glorify volleyball, nobady is gaining Super Sayian power ups to make things more extraordinary than they need to be and the major climactic payoffs can be something as simple as \u201cone payer learning to block one smash\u201d. This may seem simple but Haikyuu proves itself with HOW it executes these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSport genre: who critices Haikyuu!! for being cliche and predictable, really doesn\u2019t get how HARD to execute is the sport genre. No lying, this might be worst genre to handle for a mangaka, because of hoy difficult it is to maintain it interesting for a long time, and particularly it\u2019s the work of a God regarding Haikyuu!! which is a fucking long-runner, meant to have hundreds of chapters. This genre has a lot of limitations and restrictions that other genres don\u2019t. The characters in Haikyuu can\u2019t travel around the world exploring new and interesting places like other genres do. It\u2019s really hard to draw a lot of volleyball matches and make every match look \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d from another, because the setting (field) is always the same and so are the volleyball possible moves. It must be hard for a mangaka not to be repetitive in drawing a large amount of matches, but matches can\u2019t be eliminated because the genre requires them.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not a flaw per se (unless this is a detective story), but it\u2019s better if something is surprising, right? Of course. Unfortunately, in the Sport Genre (long-runner) the predictability simply CAN\u2019T BE TOTALLY AVOIDED because of the genre.\\n\r\nPlease, think about it: if you make a show where the formula of one loss equals elimination, losing means no championship, and without it there is no show. So, it\u2019s near impossible for the protagonist team to lose because as i said before, if they do there is no show. You have to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!IN CONCLUSION!!!!!:\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to create a TRUE sense of tension in this genre\u2026 BUT.\\n\r\nBut Haikyuu!! is actually able to provide an amazing feeling during the matches in a way that is utterly brilliant and makes it one of my favorites anime and piece of medium of all time.\\n\r\nHow does it? Haikyuu creates tension by GIVING THE OPPOSITE TEAM A REASON TO ROOT FOR THEM, breaking the cliched \"Protagonist/good \u2013 Antagonist/bad\" theme. Yes, Karasuno is favored team, but opposite teams aren\u2019t portrayed as mean and rude \u201cvillains\u201d bump in the road on the way to the top.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu gives them amazing traits, quirks and a decent development that once everything is reveald makes you question: \u201cWho I REALLY want to win?\u201d\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Haikyuu stands out, it not only makes you care about the teams Karasuno is playing against, but this attachment creates a new sense of tension that it\u2019s alright and makes you forget about the almost inevitable defeat.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what i\u2019m trying to say is: the unavoidable trait of \u201cnever losing\u201d, nearly impossible to get rid of it, makes the sport genre an incredible difficult genre to create amazing tension in, BUT instead of doing the impossible eliminating this all together, Haikyuu puts this element in the farthest corner of your mind, and doing this means that Haikyuu is able to BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SPORTS GENRE.\\n\\n\r\nTHE RIGHT EXPLOITATION OF A LONG-TERM PLOTTING:\\n\r\nThings are casually shown or mentioned in earlier seasons that show up later and may even evolve into major events. It's a sort of quiet foreshadowing -- you see it as part of the current happenings and don't even realize how significant it will become in 30 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY:\\n\r\nHonestly, it\u2019s hilarious. The perfect balance between comedy and \u201cdrama\u201d. The goofy moments never undercut the seriousness or break the tension. It was always a hit and rarely a miss.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: i was in the bus watching one episode, the none of the characters did something and\u2026 i couldn\u2019t help but laugh HARD, bur REALLY. I usually laugh \u201cin the inside\u201d or i smile at best. It\u2019s so rare i actually LAUGH for fiction, but that time i couldn\u2019t really stop and everyone stared at me like i was crazy. One of the most awkward moment in my life :\u2019(\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS: 9.5/10 (My cinematography teacher was right: You DON\u2019T need complexity to be great)\\n\\n\r\n(Super small detail: Haikyuu has 0 (really ZERO) fanservice with sexism and sexualization. The female characters here are traited with RESPECT unlike the 99% of anime in existence where the girls are constantly portrayed with huge boobs that make other girls jealous of them. Strong positive.)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a really lazy person, REALLY. I never liked sport, doing it or watching it. But THESE CHARACTERS are the reason why now i could accept to play some volleybal \u201cmatches\u201d for fun, instead of avoiding them. The characters, the author, the anime and the producers of it really love volleyball or at least respect it, and it shows a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMany times they accomplished to show and talk about volleyball stuff like roles and moves in a kinda poetic way that truly made me understand deeply the passion for this sport, and how is not the \u201csingle\u201d that matters the most, but the whole team.\\n\r\nAs i explained, the key here is wiritng characters that we GENUINELY CARE ABOUT, to the point where we become as passionate as they are for archieving their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nFinding characters compelling naturally makes us care about whatever they care about. So they are basically using empathy as a narrative tool. That\u2019s why ultimately the stake doesn\u2019t matter, if it\u2019s the fate of the universe or a simple game of volleyball. \\n\r\n\u201cStakes\u201d aren\u2019t proportioned by the magnitude of the \u201cdisaster\u201d, but by the importance of it in THE EYES OF THE CHARACTERS. There are many movies about distruction, but we just are disconnected from all the explosions because the characters don\u2019r care about (or maybe we don\u2019t care about them).\\n\\n\r\nBut WHY did we end up CARING about these characters to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe because they are endearing to watch (Hinita\u2019s enthusiasm, Kageyama\u2019s smugness\u2026), but this may be very subjective about which types of characters i like or not. So, is there something OBJECTIVE that explains why the majority of the viewers care about them? YES, there\u2019s an objective reason (i will explain it the art/animation section).\\n\\n\r\nJust like many other anime, Haikyuu has a semi-huge cast of secondary characters: the Karasuno players. But unlike most of the others, these characters are not underdeveloped. Actually, Haikyuu might have one of the most well-assorted and brilliantly handled cast of characters. They are not the most complicated or layered ever seen, but this has never been a requirement or a \u201cparameter\u201d to judge the quality of a piece of medium.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is, of course, special in some ways, BUT he is not the one who saves the day nor most talented one (and will never become). Is he good at volleyball or strong? \u2026Ehm. But he is necessary in a way that is masterfully handled by the author, despite him not being objectively \u201cstrong\u201d in a conventional way. But he is necessary for the team, and NOT ONLY HIM.\\n\r\nUsually, teammates are often forgotten or only used as pawns in sport shows, but in Haikyuu NO ONE IS LEFT OUT.\\n\r\nEach temmate in the cast is given a role, a strenght they build upon and grow as people because of, and most important, just like in real sport teams, they are all connected to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is also given a good amount of personal development as well corresponding to the role on the team.\\n\r\nEVERY PLAYER has its own very moment to shine and show his ability, and, most important, every player is necessary for the victory.\\n\r\nAnd this happens not only with the protagonist team, but the ANTAGONIST TEAMS as well (Episodes 16 of S1 and 23/24 of S2 are the peak of it and true masterpieces). Also the \u201cmain\u201d antagonist (Oikawa) is a genuinely well-written character and it shows in the 2 seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, the interactions between the players of the protagonist team feel extremely genuine and realistic, but even better are the interactions between them and the antagonist teams: their personalities reflect in each other and thus creates interesting social situations or funny banters.\\n\r\nHaikyuu always keeps you interested merely because you see two sides of the story. You know the struggle and passion of both the protagonists AND the antagonists. The screentime of them is not given too minimal to feel uninteresting and not given too much to where it feels overbearing. So, the protagonists success is even more rewarding and exciting when they beat someone with an equal amount of work and passion. This show and manga truly shows the importance of characters in a story. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters of course want to get better at volleyball but on top of that thay are also dealing with adolescence, expectations of each other and of themselves, self-esteem issues, school life and uncertainty of the future. CHARACTERS OF HAIKYUU DON\u2019T MERELY CHANGE, THEY GROW.\\n\r\nWhat is so damn impressive i show Haikyuu manages to give this meticulous traitement to a cast that spend the majority of time playing or talking about volleyball.\\n\r\nSo far Haikyuu has had 60 episodes and all of the characters still feel oddly fresh. That\u2019s because the show knows when to focus on which characters that way that everybody get the time they need to find their place within the narrative.\\n\r\nOf course writing and directing are both strong elements when it comes to crafting characters that we care about, but let\u2019s not forget that ANIME IS A VISUAL MEDIUM. Is there anything in Haikyuu\u2019s visuals that makes us care about the characters even more? YES.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: 11/10 (Very important FOR VALID STORYTELLING REASONS)\\n\\n\r\nWell, the show does a lot of different things with its visuals: the simplistic cartoony moments for comedic purposes, the \u201ci can\u2019t believe this is not an anime film\u201d levels of animation, and there are some visual metaphors too (crows).\\n\\n\r\nBut, what does Haikyuu do visually that is UNIQUE TO IT IN THE VISUAL PRESENTATION?\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER DESIGNS\\n\r\nThe style that they are drawn in really unique, they look different from every other anime which suffer from \u201cSame face Syndrome\u201d. Haikyuu\u2019s designs manage to look very distinct while still looking like anime characters. And\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-EXPRESSIONS (the most important thing)\\n\r\nFacial expressions in animation is one hell of a challenge.\\n\r\nUnlike real faces which have THOUSANDS of different details and lines, anime characters consist of just a few. This could called the \u201cSame Expression Syndrome\u201d. In anime, most of the times it just feels like there has been used templates for each emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: if you ask a hundred different people to smile, you don\u2019t get five different types of smiles, you get a HUNDRED. Every person looks slightly different when they express an emotion.\\n\r\nAnd Haikyuu has managed to showcase this in the animation. When Haikyuu\u2019s characters express an emotion it doesn\u2019t feel superficial or like it is drawn off of a template, it feels real! Like a REAL person is emoting something, like the expression is UNIQUE TO THEIR CHARACTERS, and that is INCREDIBLY ENDEARING. Distinct and believable facial expressions help selling a character\u2019s emotions (like Hinata\u2019s stare in episode 1).\\n\r\nThe expressions of Haikyuu\u2019s characters speak volumes of who they are and they make us remember them long after the game is over.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing to say, the sound is good and of course it makes the show better, but it\u2019s not an important aspect to me unless it is very good or very bad. Also, the voice acting\u2019s are just fantastic and \u201cgive life\u201d to the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, ENJOYMENT: 11/10\\n\r\nThis might be the most enjoyable show i\u2019ve seen. And as i clearly explained (hopefully!), Haikyuu is a great show that makes you care about the characters for subjective but also objective reasons, that exploited animation and visual storytelling to present visual metaphors, and that has a \u201ccliche\u201d story with such a masterpiece of execution, despite all the limitation of the sport genre that i mentioned preaviously.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is an anime that should not be passed up, it is one of my most memorable shows for creating tension in innovative ways in a genre which i preaviously thought to be impossible, as well as making a diverse team where everyone has a role to play and feels like a genuine sports team. And this is why i recommend this show to literally everyone. Of course i can't guarantee you will love it as much as i did, but it surely will be a good time because this show is really hard to hate.\\n\r\nI know nobody will read this fucking long stream of consciousness, but somehow if you decided to watch this show because of my \u201creview\u201d (or whatever reason), feed me back, it\u2019s always a pleasure to share opinions about such a great and important (for me) piece of art.\\n\r\nP.S. I won\u2019t write reviews again, this was terribly exhausting ahahah",

Seeing them go through bootcamp, struggle to find their own groove. Watching Hinata and Kageyama find a new super quick. Watching the 3rd years overcome the fact this is their last year. The story behind the other teams they played, the back stories of the aces too were well thought out and unique.\r\nArt - 9/10\r\nI've seen better but this was very good especially when it mattered.\r\nSoundtrack - 10/10\r\nIt's perfect, the OP and ED, the OST gave the most sophisticatedatmospheric mood within a sports anime. I couldn't stop feeling in awe of how well it fitted into the scenes, the plays and the overall atmosphere. What's so good about the soundtrack, it both sounds good on its own and perfectly in sync with the mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nEVERYONE got airtime. Do you know how rare fairly distributed airtime on an anime is? And now an anime has it, it made everything so much better. The back stories were great, the triumphs of Tsukki and Yamaguchi were awesome they really came into their own.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyed it, I have NO COMPLAINTS.",

            "content": "To be honest at first i dont like volleyball that much but when i gave haikyuu!! a try it seriously made me want to watch it more. so here's my review. This is my opinion so you dont have to argue with me. XD\r\nStory : All i can say is wow it met my expectations. These guys i love the team they are fun, silly, and awesome characters.  I enjoyed most of the parts which were funny also. I like how they say the story of each member. So we can understand them more. We have Hinata dreams to surpass the \"Little Giant\" whichis from the team he joined. A lot of action to look forward to with the determination and help of his teammates \"Karasuno High School\" to become the strongest and best.\\n\\n\r\nArt : I dont know much about what art is but one thing is the Animation of the anime is good. and also every look of the players. Looks really the same as the manga itself. Some anime tend to change the looks of the characters\\n\r\nfrom the manga which is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSound : the sound in each events in the anime blends in quite nice. Especially in some moments were there is an Intense Match between the teams it gives you excitement. And goosebumps. Other parts also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Every character in the anime is awesome. Its not a one man spotlight. We see the whole characters improve from the matches they played. And also made some new weapons to use in their matches. The characters are funny, awesome, entertaining. And also we get to see the team's development to be the best in the league and relationship to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Overall I extremely recommend to watch the anime.  It gave me a big thumbs up. Funny, Entertaining, Awesome characters to look forward and how the 'Karasuno High School Volleyball Club' improve from every problems they encounter. It never made me boring and it never gets boring!",

            "content": "Before we begin, I'd like it to be known that this series of Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) has been highlighted as my favorite show for quite a long time. How exactly is this a big deal? Despite the ratings that I give to almost every anime being generous, I would have to say that this one is well worthy of the rating-scale at 10. There comes too of the saying that I am, in actuality, a very meticulous person when it comes down to watching a show; I'd prefer the shows that I've watched to be meaningful, containing some underlying message that may be served as amoral\u2014 and yet at the same time, I'd also like them to be absolutely thrilling to the bone, in other words, interesting/enjoyable enough to maintain my attention throughout the whole episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the main review. Please be mindful as there may be MINOR SPOILERS up ahead.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, we continue to follow the tale of Karasuno team taking on the obstacles in order to reach for the top.\u007f That's it; that's the whole story put into short. However, it's how they took on the obstacles that significantly places an imprint on how the tale is executed. Asides from the main characters, we could see various supporting characters are also struggling with their own issues as well.\\n\\n\r\nSince the beginning of the first season, we could see that the series is bundled up of several things\u2014 and they've made sure to include a few matters that are or could be inevitable in real life, such as the importance of exams. It's an understatement that the story does mainly revolve around set of emotions, the challenges taken up by people, and how they respond to/cope with their current situation. What I like about the overall story is how realistic at times this series can be: like how people deal differently with their losses, that talent is something that is nurtured, etc. Furthermore, in the second season, we get to see some more of the supporting characters having their screen time and tidbits of their background.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while those things I've mentioned above are happening, regardless, they still managed to make them related to volleyball as how it should be\u2014 to which pinpoints the fact that they did not get sidetracked from their main plot line.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) even more unique is how they explained the volleyball game exactly works which includes the basics, and the tactics/techniques on how to do each move. Throughout the whole seasons, they have also shown that teamwork and communication are the key factor within the game. But most of all, they had done a particularly good job in conveying their messages; one example being that no team is guaranteed to be more invincible than the other; no individual is better than the other.\u007f\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint that I have here, however, is that there is a lack of small injuries that could be inevitable when it comes to playing volleyball in reality. As a volleyball player myself, I've always come out of the volleyball practice with few injuries, and I had a sprained finger for few times. It's quite baffling that they didn't mention any of this as volleyball is a game full of risks, what more with mainly hands, but then again, if exercised and played with enough caution and in a proper form, it's possible to come out of the game unscathed. Still, they should have mentioned this\u2014 in fact, the Mangaka should have mentioned about the possible risk of breaking a finger or a hand.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there were also few moments within the anime that feels unnecessary to me, including a few ones that are unrelated to volleyball, but I realized it's these little things that make the show and its story more believable and realistic. After all, the world is not thoroughly centered around volleyball. I'm glad that this series had also displayed that at few points.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat is a show with a story line that has potential but with butchered up characters? Horrible. On the other hand, what is a show that seems to have a boring story line, but has characters that are written well? The opposite. As much as characters do share the same important role as the story line, characters\u007f play a significantly higher factor in becoming a great story. No one would want to watch a show with an interesting plot but all of its characters are written so badly, they basically ruined the potential of the show. Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) is fortunately, and definitely, the latter.\\n\\n\r\nHaiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) showcases that the supporting characters in here also get as much support as the main characters. It doesn't matter how minor or insignificant they are, in the end, they've brought something to make the show have more purpose. Perhaps this is one of the few things that the series is trying to highlight; in one of the early episodes, and since the first season, we could see that the supporting cast got to have their own screen time. But wait! This may be a coincidence, but they've also put in a message that supporting characters do matter. This can clearly be seen in the episode where Hinata Shoyo, the main character, told to Hitoka Yachi, whom is a supporting character, that even the supporting characters can fight.\\n\\n\r\nQuote taken out of context: \"Townsperson B can fight too!\" [ From Hitoka Yachi to Madoka Yachi, her mother. ]\\n\\n\r\nMoving further, all of the characters in this show are quite impossible to hate. Or at least, I found it impossible to hate. I could have disliked a few of them but as time grew, I found myself to become fond of them. In general, every single character here has a personality of their own and there are those that share a few similar traits among them. Now that I look back, there's not a single character in this show that has uniquely stood out from the rest; it's as if they were all equally unique altogether. Yet at the same time, each character has their own quirks and perks that made them distinguishable from the rest. If you think long and hard enough about it, it could be safely deducted that these characters are quite a paradox. Hinata and Kageyama, for an example, may seem like they're complete opposites of each other when in truth, they share many similarities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is evident in this series. Overcoming fears, handling insecurities, going through conflicts, effort in order to become a better person/player\u2014 it's right there. I'm pretty sure that by now, you've all noticed that I'm mostly talking about the characters but that's because, and I repeat, they are the MAJOR key factor in a story. The progress of the character development is at the right pace; not too slow nor not too fast, otherwise, the off-pacing will make it seem unrealistic. By the end of this second season, you could see that our characters ( especially the ones in our protagonist team, Karasuno. ) are different compared to before. They've changed but not completely enough for us to notice right away. And it's not just them.\\n\r\n\u007f\\n\r\nI'd love to say more about the characters, because really, they're all superb in their own way. Honestly. I love all of them.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art & Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not that unique, but it's enough to make it seem decent which is also a factor ( but not much ) to make a great anime. The background noises are subtle often times, and depending on the atmosphere of the moment, the soundtracks fits the mood suitably. The voice acting of the characters are quite great, they've done a good job in expressing themselves! On the other hand, the opening and ending songs are all nice as well, catchy even, and in my opinion, they are better than the ones used in the first season.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think it's very obvious that I enjoyed Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) a lot. From the small and fleeting moments, to the sad ones, to the ones where hilarity ensues, and some more; this show is comprised of a lot of things. Truth to be told, even with this quite long review I put here, it still can't do much to express my love for this anime series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 OVERALL: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this anime, please do give it a try! But that is only if you're willing to do so. I, myself, admittedly felt bored in the first few episodes of Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) but it really depended on my mood that time around. On the other hand, to those who have already finished the first season but has yet to watch the second\u2014 then I recommend this season to be watched. \u2665",

            "content": "To Whom It May Concern: The following review will be an unbiased, honest & systematic review that's just to the point. I will refrain from spoilers to the best of my ability. This critical review is mainly intended for people wondering whether to watch the second season since they finished first or for newcomers who are for some odd reason wants to start this anime for second. Please don't be the latter. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nHaikyuu!! Season 2 attempts to refrain from being just another sports anime while still incorporating most of the tropes throughout the entire season. The story, being simple as it is, continues fromfirst season and never really becomes complex. This is a very straight forward shounen style anime that motivates you. We have the struggling protagonists fighting against odds/antagonists/self to achieve their dream. The pacing in the first half of the season is really slow. The show really tried to develop almost every player on the volleyball team in the first half. Each of them learning new techniques to harness the power to unite for a common goal. However the second half it started picking up pace but it felt like the matches became monotonous. It's really cliche how they handled it and went about presenting it. If I watched in a weekly fashion, I would've just abandoned it or wait till the entire season ended. Atleast they didn't have any filler episodes and the comedy has a natural feel to it since most of the time it's not too forced. If there is any merit, the last few episodes of the show really delivered top notch story that will keep the viewer wondering what will happen next. So alas, the ending was satisfying and it resolves the minimal plot holes this show has. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are most if not all relatable characters so everyone can connect to their own counterparts. They present each character with a particular flaw and overtime shows how to overcome such flaws. This season, the characters become more fleshed out and they provide a better foil for the two main protagonists. Each of them finally have their own unique personality. So they become more likable. However, this case is only true for the major handful of characters. Everyone else, including the antagonists, are just a duplicate with minute changes, making them not so different from one another. To be blunt, there aren't any memorable characters that stick out except maybe the main two protagonists since they sort of give off the Naruto & Sasuke vibe from the first Naruto series. Maybe the creator of the show just wanted to do that for easy success to attract target audience, who knows. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at the technical aspects!!\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 & Sound 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime is fully hand-drawn, no CGI or blends and it really gives the viewers the closeness and nostalgic feel for this show. The animation looks crisp and the action sequences are really well drawn. Like most sports anime, this anime also abuses the slow-mo action shot of the final shot but it doesn't do it too much. It manages to figure out the just amount as the show progresses. They really like to accentuate tense moments. However, being a show that has a lot of minor characters, it faces the traumatic consequence of new characters being drawn almost identical to the main handful characters only to be differentiated by a small detail. Fortunately, this show has good opening and ending songs. The background score isn't extravagant. It's simple and the acoustic string instrument based scores gives this anime the push it needs. Also, a big kudos for the voice actors, they do a phenomenal job!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a shounen anime, the show delivers. The characters are fun to watch and the secondary characters are great caricatures. The show exemplifies the whole theme of the power of friendship and team building pretty well. The slap-stick comedy provides a nice laughter. Even the fan service is very tastefully done. Not too much to complain about since I binged it. It's not addicting, it's just fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnywho, overall, I would give this show a 7/10. The show isn't just fine or really great, as die hard fans hype it out to be. It's just a damn good show (provided you binge it and not watch it on a weekly basis) albeit it's ever present flaws. Would I rewatch it? Not really. However, I don't regret watching it. So I guess that's something to be hopeful about if YOU decide to watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, feel free to share your opinions/criticism with me. I don't bite. I hope you find this review helpful! Sayonara! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I made an account just to review this show and how crappy I thought it was.\r\nStory- 4\r\nIt's a sport anime. Now I love sports anime; I've seen the most popular ones of the genre and some of the lesser known ones like Over Drive and Softenni. I came to Haikyuu!! with some pretty high hopes after all the positive reviews the show got, but I still can't think of anything that set sit apart from all the other sports animes.\r\nWeak yet skill protagonist? Saw that in Kuroko no Basket, Eyeshield 21, and Yowamushi Pedal.\r\nSecondary protagonist that starts of somewhat antagonistic? Saw that in Daiya noAce, Eyeshield 21, and hell, even Naruto. This trope has been done to death.\\n\\n\r\nFormerly strong main team that has fall from power? Saw that in Daiya no Ace. \\n\\n\r\nThe exposition itself isn't just what bothers me. I've seen each of these tropes many times so seeing them again is rarely a deal breaker. What IS a dealbreaker is how this show somehow manages to complain all of those tropes into this mishmash of a show. \\n\\n\r\nTHh way the plot moves forward makes it soooooo predictable. Character wants to complete in national level tournament, teams gets close to finals, team loses to elicit sympathy from the audience, team agrees to participate in the conveniently placed 2nd tournament a few months after this one, team wins matches and replays previously introduced teams to create a surprise final boss, team beats final boss and everything is super!\\n\\n\r\nYes i'm well aware that KnB used a formula similar to this one but it get s a pass because the execution was so much better. \\n\\n\r\nI liked shows like Eyeshield 21 because the team wasn't awesomely powerful. They were a ragtag group of misfits that weren't presented like they could always win. Having only one chance to make nationals make it seem a thousand times more interesting when the characters lost.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great at moments during matches. I have no notes for the art or animation. The only thing that really bothers me is when a character is presented as attractive but has the same jawline/eye shape as almost every other background character.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6 \\n\\n\r\nHinata's voice was annoying. I didn't find the little sounds he made cute either. In other news, the first op and second ed was cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 1\\n\\n\r\nOH MY GOD HERE WE GO\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest problem with this show. I could not relate to any of these character except on the most basic level. Only, like, nine characters had a good personality or at least an interesting take on one that's been done before.\\n\\n\r\nI could describe all the major characters using TVTropes alone:\\n\\n\r\nHinata- Adorkable. Determinator.\\n\r\nKageyama- Tsundere.\\n\r\nSawamura- Team Dad.\\n\r\nSugawara- Team Mom.\\n\r\nAsahi- Broken Ace.\\n\r\nNishinoya- Keet.\\n\r\nTanaka- Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass.\\n\r\nTsukishima- Deadpan Snarker.\\n\r\nYamaguchi- Shrinking Violet.\\n\r\nOikawa- Jerk with a Heart of Gold.\\n\r\nIwaizumi- Vitriolic Best Bud.\\n\r\nAone- Gentle Giant.\\n\r\nKenma- Brilliant but Lazy\\n\r\nKuroo- Jerk with a Heart of Gold.\\n\r\nLev- Unskilled by Strong\\n\r\nBokuto- Keet.\\n\\n\r\nThere it is. That's the base amount of personality from all of these character. I'll admit that some characters had an interesting take on their generic personalities but it wasn't enough take make me like them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 2\\n\\n\r\nBesides the animation and 2 of the themes, I found very little enjoy as I sat through this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI added up my scores and they average out at 3.5. Taking out the two 6's a gave for art and sound and it averages out to a 2.25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: After their bitter defeat against Aoba Johsai, the team carries on through training with the same determination. A summer camp filled with new and strong opponents becomes the catalyst for Karasuno's evolution. When the evolution is complete, Karasuno forges ahead to the Spring High with the same goal as always-to go to nationals. \r\nArt/Sound: The new characters this season are drawn perfectly, and the voice actors assigned to them do very well in portraying the characters' personalities. In addition, the 4 OST's do well to set the mood of the anime. The opening songs/videos give viewers a feeling of perseverance and determination that usuallycomes during a match, while the ending songs/videos conjure up a feeling of bitter defeat/grim determination that usually comes to the near conclusion of a match. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In this season viewers will be introduced to new players from new teams, some of the highly anticipated players being the rowdy, charismatic, and immature Bokuto, his younger but more responsible and mature setter, Akashi, the flirtatious and fun-loving Terushima, and the choleric yet extremely skilled Kyoutani to name a few. In addition, we see some regular cast members like Tsukishima and Yamato go through a dynamic change. As far as the story goes, there aren't any unlikable characters; they are relatable, endearing, and funny. Every shout of victory and shout of frustration of the characters is echoed in the viewer. The term 'antagonist' is used very lightly because they aren't evil, they are just as hard-working and generous as the protagonists. It just so happens that every team is in it to win it, and when all is said and done there can only be one victor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Every episode is worth replaying. There were moments of drama, but it would be balanced with comedic relief. If you want to watch a show that's light and doesn't require psychoanalysis, then this is one of them.",

            "content": "\"Some people want it to happen, Some wish it would happen, Others make it happen.\" - Michael Jordan\r\nHaikyuu freaking second season. There's this term called escapism, it carries a negative connotation with it because the assumption is that one is running from reality through some medium. Lots of time, as anime fans, you may browse through endless sites saying \"aw man anime is escapism\" or some bullsh!t like that. However, sports can be looked at the same way and nobody bats an eye, very hypocritical of the world today isn't it? Many athletes, whether professional or recreational have a different persona when it comes tothe sport they play, and it may very well be their true nature. Sports is something that one can participate in to forget about everything else, it clears one's mind. I like to draw this parallel between sports and anime as I watch Haikyuu because what I see from it is a great look into an athlete's psyche. Just like people watch shows, movies, play games, etc, to remedy boredom or stress, athletes take the same approach in their respective sport. As an athlete myself, everything about Haikyuu was amazing in terms of team, psyche, and attitude. Haikyuu does a great job at targeting a sports audience while keeping it simple enough a simpleton can follow. It doesn't take understanding of volleyball, although there is some implied knowledge, to get across to viewers. However, Haikyuu does suffer with a lot of meandering between characters, scenes, and in the worst moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you aren't aware, this is the second season, so if you're reading this I'm expecting you finished the first season. We start right after the loss to Aoba Jousai, and as you can tell the team doesn't look so great after taking that HUGE L. But fear not, these guys are motivated to no end because of that loss and we go on their little journey of going to nationals. Second season is definitely a lot less focused on the volleyball action, rather wayyyyyy more exposition than necessary for a simple plot. The problem with this second season is the crazy influx of characters, which many were significant for like 1 minute an episode. Lots of screen time was devoted to these imbeciles and often times it happened during the volleyball action scenes, which takes away some of the adrenaline and instead slows down the pace of the viewer and the show. This rather unrealistic approach is a turn off because many times, whenever a flash back occurs it's highly predictable the result. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a big issue throughout Haikyuu because these scenes could be upwards a minute, and that is just too much precious time to take away from the action. In the case of Haikyuu, there wasn't enough FANSERVICE. I'm talking not enough VOLLEYBALL! Too much thinking, too much spoon fed context that viewers can catch on with. It's good that we get to dive into what an athlete's psyche, but I believe Haikyuu took too much time to go into EVERY character. It's a little ridiculous because scenes late into second season are incredibly inducing, with extreme tension and then flashback boom: predictable and takes away from the experience. However, Haikyuu does a great job of bringing the viewer into it's setting, almost like the viewer can be at the bleachers watching alongside the fans. It's immersive and fun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters took a nosedive that I didn't appreciate. A lot, and I mean A LOT of characters are introduced. And you can probably guess from that last statement that MANY were one and done. Many side characters seem to fill the plot convenience whenever necessary and it once again takes screen time away from the Karasuno team, who arguably is the most interesting team. Our two main slugs are no longer the stars of the show it seems, with lots of emphasis going on the side characters. This is a problem because the first season did a great job displaying how two polar opposites can come together and play a sport well. This season is...too lackluster. But there was great characterization for most characters, i guess due to the flashbacks that flesh them out. Also Yachi is like the most useless character ever. Her arc was just pathetic, I mean she is barely fan service if that's what the writers were thinking of adding her for. She's comparable to Nunally from Code Geass, just being plot device. She had some personality, but Haikyuu would be the same without her. Overall, the Karasuno group was a good cast to follow, with their chemistry together, the nice senpai's, the dumb and overreactive 2nd years, the polar opposite freshy (both pairs), and a playful coach to boot. They got a lot less screen time, but doesn't stop them from kicking ass!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation could be sooo much better, if the volleyball scenes were played out in succession. Many times its just different angles with the ball going down and someone diving for it. A bit repetitive in that department. The facial features were great though, whether someone was mad, sad, or indifferent was very distinguishable and comical as well. The character design is up to the viewer though, whether one thinks its good or not, but Haikyuu does a great job depicting volleyball as real as possible, although I can do without the pauses in midair. That just doesn't happen hate to break it to anyone interested in volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nSound is great. OST is amazing and sound effects are great. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu is a great sports series, it has many elements to the show that makes it good like it's characters, storytelling(half n half), and charm. While the first season was stronger on focus and characterization, second season has more exposition for those that love the funny interactions between characters. It still is intense as it was in the first season and able to bring you into the audience. If you play volleyball, this is a must watch. If not, it's definitely try to get as much out of the first season because second season has implied terminology and diction. It's still informative, but don't look at it like its how to play volleyball because it's whole lot harder than it looks.\\n\\n\r\n\"I've failed over and over again, and that is why I succeed.\" - Michael Jordan",

            "content": "The \u201csecond season\u201d for a lot of anime series tends to bring out amazing set-pieces, better story progression as well as the fact that, since the show was successful in the first place, the viewers would love to see more of it. Haikyuu: Second Season is a hidden gem that I loved for the first season, but this second season especially, for the first 13 episode and beyond held a special place in my heart because it was this show during Fall of 2015 that literally brought me back up to speed in terms of my education and just real life struggles. The mental impactit had on me during the first half of the season is something I can\u2019t really share, but I can give you a glimpse of what to expect from the second season of this phenomenal Sports/Shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season ended with a cliff-hanger where, Karasno saw the end of their inter-high tournament at the hand of one of the powerhouses of volleyball, Aoba Josai. This specific event sets precedence for the second season where Karasno has to make a choice to either get better as they practice more, or evolve the current style of play to something that can stand up against a powerhouse. New teams and characters are introduced in the series and for the first half of the season; it\u2019s ALL about CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  THIS is how you do character development. Showing the characters struggle to improve in the game with the emotion and tension that come with it. Each character that the show focuses on had some part in that struggle and the way it was portrayed in the anime was nothing short of amazing. To me personally, it was something really relatable at the time as I myself was going through some struggles during the first half of the season. They weren\u2019t the same but the crux of it was essentially relatable.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, Production I.G. knew exactly where to spend their budget and how to make full use of it. The animation is nothing short of outstanding and something that should be considered High-Quality. The fluidity of movements from the hair all the way to the full body movements and action scenes are done with precision work and something the company should be really proud for. This is quality animation and nothing less. As for the soundtrack, it\u2019s amazing and fits the mood perfectly and if I had the opportunity, I would buy and listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that Haikyuu second season is a real master piece. It has a full on training arc with major character developments, a thrilling tournament to boot and great lessons and struggles for people to learn from. The animation is top notch, the OST is freaking amazing and the story is overall progressing smoothly and greatly. I really hope you got something out of this review and I wish if you checked out the first season to check out the second one as well. The great news is that the THIRD SEASON has been announced so we can all look forward to that!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10 (Master Piece)\\n",

            "content": "Do you think sports anime are corny?\r\nAre you curious to watch one sports anime?\r\nDo you hate anime that has an exaggerated superpowers and there are random electricity coming out of their eyes or Sharingan is activated in the middle of the game? (Don't get me wrong. I love KnB).\r\nTHEN WATCH HAIKYUU!! DAMN IT! IT'S SOOOOO GOOOOD.\r\n*Ehem* Anyways, if you're reading this review and you haven't watch season 1, well, here's a synopsis.\r\nOne guy named Hinata loves volleyball and dreams to be the ace of one team (Ends up being a decoy). During his middle school, he had a volleyball club but, it had no membersat all. He had a rival named Tobio Kageyama a.k.a. the King of the court. He's called the king because of his selfishness and bossy attitude towards his teammates. When they were high-school, both rivals are now teammates. This is where their journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nOn this season though, this will tackle on how Karasuno will get back up again for the second time.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the second season is really just character development as a team on how they'll get back up. What I like about the story is that it's not only about the matches. Sure, the matches make a big impact on the story, but they also give time to develop the characters outside of the matches like their training. Haikyuu is very light to watch and it seems like you're watching a slice of life anime except there's sports \"feels\" on to it. This anime gives so much time on character development and it maybe boring for some, but not for me. The humor on this anime is also outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where the matches kicks in for the Spring Tournament. Honestly, there was never a match that disappoint me. Every match really has a big impact to it (The last match on this season is still the biggest though). Sure, they show a minor match just to see that Karasuno will advance (minor spoiler right there), but it's not just some any minor match. There's a lesson to it. This is where I was VERY IMPRESSED. Even minor matches has a big impact not only to the characters in the story, but pretty much to every sports players out there. I thought it was very heart-touching. I sound corny, but it's true.\\n\\n\r\nI gave story a 9 because despite all its greatness, it still hasn't concluded, so maybe if the next season will conclude and its greatness is consistent, maybe it'll get a 10/10. The characters though are a 10/10. Despite the huge cast it has, almost every cast are memorable and that is because they really give time for each cast to shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great though, it's art style is where I have to get used to. But hey, I'm used to it already. I mean, this is the second season already. What matters is on how fluid the animation is and they're consistent like Kuroko no Basket (Not surprising considering that they have the same studio). There are so many memorable moments on this anime and one of those reasons has something to do with the animation. The soundtrack for the second season is really good. There are some light soundtrack while there are some epic soundtrack. There's this one soundtrack where I really like (I don't know what's the name) where the bass guitar goes crazy and it really pumps me up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very enjoyable anime and season 3 is already confirmed and will air this Fall of 2016. I can't wait! If you haven't watch Haikyuu, watch it now! Seriously!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is on par with Baby Steps except Baby Steps has romance and it's only 1 v 1 (Tennis). Both anime have great character development and great matches in different ways (Read my Baby Steps review if you're curious). So, if you're looking for an alternative for Haikyuu, go watch Baby Steps. It's underrated and it seriously needs attention.",

            "content": "Listen, you might prefer One Punch Man or Death Parade or Your Lie in April or what have you, but this was my favorite anime of 2015 by far. (I know it went into 2016 but technically it's a 2015 show) \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nLike the first season, the second season's storyline is very simple. Karasuno wants to do well in this tournament and get to nationals. Typical of the genre, nothing too special or new. \r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThis was the thing that made season two so great for me, and there was no way I could give it less than a ten. With a simple plot anda simple goal, this series ends up being very character-driven and this season especially makes that crystal clear. At one point fairly early in the season, the character development parade begins for a multitude of characters and it is absolutely glorious. Of course, it helps that the characters are interesting and fun to watch, too. By the end of this season, you'll only love the characters more, including characters you didn't know you loved at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is a little rocky sometimes, but overall it's pretty great. The art style is the same as the first season, and it still works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are all phenomenal, and they all serve their purpose. The openings are catchy head-bopping tunes that get you hype for the episode while the endings make you not want to wait another week. Being the nerd for this show that I am, I've listened to both volumes of the soundtrack, and it covers a wide range of genres, instruments, and feelings to fit the moment (*cough* that one scene in episode eight *cough*).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEvery Saturday for six months starting in early October 2015, I would get home from my piano lesson, put a pot of mac and cheese on the stove, and settle in for a ride, and that was the highlight of my week. This show made me laugh, it made me cry twice, it made me ship things because I'm trash, and most importantly, it made me happy and it was a feel-good series most of the time. I looked forward to every new episode from the minute I finished the last one, and it was an extremely fun six months that I would repeat in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis series isn't full of deep themes about the nature of humanity or stunning visuals or a dark and gritty storyline, but there's a lot to appreciate. From the fitting theme music to the cute designs to the varied and lovable cast of characters, the second season of Haikyuu!! goes above and beyond the first's achievements and you'll definitely find something to fall in love with.",

It really is deserving of all the praise and attention it gets. Watching this team dig themselves up from the bottom of the barrel to a point where they're actually a formidable powerhouse is stunning to watch. As always, this anime lines its story with wonderful narration as well as exceptional animation. Getting riled up over sports is not something I do often, but you can't help it when you watch Haikyuu!!\r\nAs far as individual character growth this season, it was outstanding. Not only did literally everycharacter develop at least one new skill, the entire team developed together as well. It truly is inspiring to see these characters grow and change. It's also a testament to the quality of the anime itself that they can add in so many characters while still maintaining a degree of backstory and development for each of them. \\n\\n\r\nI'd still recommend Haikyuu!! to anyone who enjoys a good story that melds with great characters. It's one for the ages.",

            "content": "This is my first review ever and I absolutely loved the show, so expect this to be very biased.\r\nStory: The story is the best one you can get from a sports anime. Of course there's nothing complex, such as a great mystery or an awesome plot full of twists and something like that. Nevertheless, it's still awesome and original. We actually get some background on almost every character, even the less important ones. Our main characters are a yin-yang duo: they are opposites of each other, and yet, they become a single destructive weapon for their team. We also have Hinata's ambition on the LittleGiant and the rivalry between Tobio and Oikawa. But overall we have a typical shounen plot: a lot of action given by a group of friends trying to become the strongest. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't have much to say about this because I don't understand too much about drawing and art style, but Haikyuu!!'s one of the best i've ever seen on a shounen anime. The style is unique and very well made, you can see the mark of the mangaka on each character despite the fact that they are all very different. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is very good. Every scene has a song which fits perfectly. Each track is able to get us in the mood for the specific moment, being it sad, funny or exciting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here's the best part of the show. Haikyuu!! has incredible characters on every team. This is not that kind of show where we care only about the protagonists. We actually love all of the players and the teams. It's hard to decide which one we want to cheer for. The character development is something amazing. We see how Karasuno's pinch server who used to be a shy and weak boy become something essential for his team, while growing his confidence and pride. The relationships between team members is also very well executed, like the one of Hinata and Kageyama or even with opponents, like Hinata and Kenma. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Extremely exciting to watch. I get goosebumps on every game and I almost cry with the flashbacks. The animation studio is godlike and each movement flows like magic on the screen. Haikyuu!! is also funny and is full of \"chill out\" moments that make us smile. The background stories, the side characters talking on the bench, everything is just amazing to watch. One of the best shows ever, it never gets boring.",

            "content": "As you probably already know, competitive spirit, teamwork, communication, and perseverance are all common themes that unite the sports genre as a whole. Therefore, to truly differentiate one show from other similar shows, scriptwriters need to engage the audience in a remarkably new and refreshing way.\r\nI think for some people, this show is able to connect with them on some deeper, meaningful level. The way that this show engages with its audience is truly something else. The way Karasuno interacts, the way they crack jokes, and their never-ending drive to succeed \u2013 it makes you feel excited. It\u2019s as if you are there physically withthem, cheering the underdogs on as they take on the world around them.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I appreciate how some individuals who were disregarded in the first season are now given much more depth. Consider Tsukishima, for instance. After losing to their ever-so-favorite rivals, the Karasuno team is rebuilding as a team and honing their skills by attending training camps. It is during this when Tsukishima\u2019s time to shine came. In a single episode, we learned why Tsukishima is so deeply affected by his brother\u2019s betrayal and why Tsukishima is such a lone wolf. Thanks to a push by his close friend Yamaguchi, Tsukishima finally learns the true meaning of teamwork, and, from this, he begins to participate in team-building activities (i.e. playing mini-games against with other schools in the training camp). In the first season, you know he would never ever do something like this. It is very fortunate that Tsukishima decided to change; if he didn\u2019t, he would never have been able to hone his skillset, which becomes especially important during the spring qualifiers. Another example: Ennoshita. He becomes a key motivator for the team. He has some big shoes to fill, and he would never have been in this position if it weren\u2019t for Daichi.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I really liked about what Haikyuu is how the antagonists (i.e. Karasuno\u2019s rivals) are also characterized. How many shows out there have you watched where you have had one-dimensional villains (or antagonists or bad guys or whatever you want to call them) that you couldn\u2019t relate to? Too many, right? Fortunately, Haikyuu breaks away from this by giving a lot of the antagonists some serious backstory. Most of the time we are able to learn what volleyball means to the rival, what kind of a team player they are, and why the match means so much to them.\\n\\n\r\nBut there\u2019s only one major downside that I can think of: there\u2019s an obvious imbalance regarding the characters. Haikyuu has a tendency to characterize just one individual at a time. People who were given a decent amount of screen time during the first season (e.g. Nishinoya) are suddenly ignored this season; others (e.g. Hinata and Kageyama) decrease in significance. On the other hand, some of the second year benchwarmers still get no screen time. It\u2019s a shame, really. If the show were able to balance out its characters better, we would have been able to understand better how the team operates as a whole and see much more team synergy as a result.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving onto the plot \u2013 the plot is more of a mixed bag, to be honest. Yes, it\u2019s exciting to some degree, but the pacing of the plot is not Haikyuu\u2019s strongest point. It\u2019s rather sluggish, and it\u2019s usually due to the following factors:\\n\\n\r\n- The characters talk a lot. Like a lot. Imagine you and your best friend talking. Multiply that by 10.\\n\r\n- They all think a lot too. They are trying to anticipate their opponents.\\n\r\n- The characters are given a backstory.\\n\r\n- Characters are trying new flashy moves. Groovy.\\n\r\n- Sensei is playing the \u201cI\u2019m new to volleyball please explain everything to me\u201d or the \u201clisten to my wise words\u201d role for you.\\n\r\n- The team that Karasuno is playing against is surging ahead in number of points, and the characters are trying to think of a way to fight back.\\n\r\n- Or they\u2019re literally just hitting the ball back and forth endlessly. Who\u2019s going to get the point? \\n\\n\r\nThis constant pattern causes each major match drags out over 2-3 episodes. I\u2019m not entirely sure if this is necessary \u2013 although they are all technically well-incorporated, there is a point when you become impatient and want to know what the results of the match are. As for non-matches, there is sometimes extraneous information that really serve no purpose in the context of the show. I wouldn\u2019t say 10 minutes of eating BBQ after a nice, long training camp and male volleyball players commenting on the superficial looks of the high schools\u2019 assistant managers was necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s plot armoring. I really hate to say it, but for shows like these, plot armoring is inevitable (would you want to keep watching a team that keeps losing? Unless you\u2019re a diehard fan, I didn\u2019t think so), so it really is a question of how well-balanced it is. It is easy to say, \u201cYou know, they deserve it, they\u2019ve been working hard as a team\u201d and allow the underdogs to keep winning consecutive matches. Fortunately, for Haikyuu, plot armoring is heavily restricted to what is absolutely necessary. For instance, Karasuno doesn\u2019t have to win every practice match (as an audience member, however, I know you\u2019re secretly praying for them to win. Don\u2019t worry, I did that too) and good thing they don't \u2013 otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have been able to learn from their mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNow briefly for one more positive thing about the plot: there's humor and it's well-incorporated throughout the show. Haikyuu would have been utterly flat without it. The way the characters interact and make fun of each other came off as very natural. It kept the ball rolling, especially when things got extremely sluggish.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were all excellent. Animation was done very well by Production I.G (see Ao Haru Ride, Kuroko No Basket, and Kimi ni Todoke), although nothing was truly that remarkable. For sound, the OP was very moving and embodied the whole competitive spirit. Voice acting was decent too for the context of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo is it the best sports anime ever? Eh, debatable. It has a lot to offer in terms of characters and will keep you on your toes, but the show is terribly paced. Given this, if you thoroughly enjoyed the first season, don\u2019t worry; you will like the second season too due to its similar execution.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that\u2019s all out of the way, it was a fun ride when it lasted. I can\u2019t wait to see what the third season has in store for us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: B\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.",

            "content": "The sports genre..  if you're not a fan of it then it can't be helped but GODDAMN how much you're missing out. Most people don't start watching anime with the sports genre and even when they dive deeper into the vast sea of anime genres, it is one that usually is missed out.\r\nNow how does Haikyuu, a simple series mean that you miss out a lot?\r\nWell, a lot of sports genre is usually thought the same way as battle shounen where \"friendship is magic\" since many times in sports anime, as well as in Haikyuu also, shounen genre plays a great role. Even toughthere are some moments that give you the shivs, make your hair stand up or get you super thrilled by a game, that's just one part of what makes Haikyuu so amazing. The real awesome parts are the most memorable characters, their individual in-depth development and the great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything new. A team sport: our main characters are obsessed with winning and want to make it to the nationals with their team. This is the basis for many team sport or solo sport game. It's just executed so well that you forget that it is kinda generic. While Haikyuu's storyline revolves around their team progressing towards the nationals, the ultimate goal, it is not the focus point of the story. In other sports animes, like KnB (Kuroko no Basket) or DnA (Diamond no Ace) where the team aspect is important they focus more on the skill aspect rather than, like in Haikyuu, the team synergy/team synchronization.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progressess the team evolves. Sure their individual skills grow as well but that's beyond the point. One of the main characters, Hinata Shoyo, is a great example of that. The only time when we have focused on his individual development and skill growth a lot was in one or two episodes. Before that, we were given a quick flashback in the beginning of the first season of how he became what he is now. The first seasons' story as well as the seconds' focus on the combination plays of the team more than Hinata's solo growth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nthere are two main art styles here. The shounen artstyle, very riveting and intimidating which makes your heart throb. The other one is the more comedic artstyle, which is actually used quite a bit. One great plus of the show is how they use these two styles together. Because of the nature of the main characters, the comedic artstyles can be used everywhere. Because one of our MC's is so hyper and energetic it creates many great opportunities to use both artstyles. And when it comes to the former one, the shounen style, it makes everything extra exciting because we normally see our main character used in the more comedic artstyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character that our story focuses on, is Tobio Kageyama. As he is seen as Hinata's partner throughout the series, he is characterized on the contrast side to Hinata. Where Hinata is energetic and easy-go-happy, Kageyama is more silent, serious and intimidating most of the time. Because he is the counterpart to Hinata and is the complete opposite of him, you can almost guess it, when he is normally used more in the shounen style, and suddenly used in the comedic style.. it is super hilarious. These two create one hell of a combination which benefit from each other in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhile other shows usually use quite flashy colors *looking at you KnB*, Haikyuu actually is one of those series where the color differentiation is not that flashy. Sure you can make the argument that Hinata has different colored hair than anyone else and one member of the core team, Nishinoya, has one part of his hair way different than the other but that's about it. It isn't used as generically as in KnB (it is the easiest one to compare this show to xD). \\n\\n\r\nThe general artstyle of the show, how the characters are drawn and what kind of backgrounds there are is very simple but still unique. I just love the way Haikyuu looks like.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI guess there is not much to say about characters anymore. The one and only being that Haikyuu really explores one or two players of the opposing team always. To some of the antagonistic characters we are given a full detailed backstory and Haikyuu really does that well. In the long running series it's always great to have a full in-depth backstory to every main- and side character (well at least to the bigger side characters). \\n\\n\r\nWhat really is the advantage of this show is the fact that you can't hate anyone (at least I couldn't). Every single character is made so lovable, so interesting in their own way or relatable that they just seem to stick in your head. It is rare for team sport games to have memorable side characters since they usually are shown only for a little while and are not given much of a perspective. This is what separates haikyuu from every other sports anime. The second season of this show is the prime example of this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe shounen aspect of this anime really brings out the greatness of the voice actors/actressess. Be it Hinata's screaming \"give me the ball!\" Or the whole team giving the simultanious \"bring it on\" it is always a great moment that really highlights the characters themselves as well the team aspect and Haikyuu's own athmosphere. During the intense matches there are always playing these 'shounen type' songs which really lift the athmostphere to to max. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't only during the games that the sounds are great. When giving a flashback, or Hinata and Kageyama are riling themselves up for the upcoming match, there can be heard awesome music playing in the background. So the soundtracks and voice actor/actress performances are alwyas top notch but what really highlights the most Haikyuu's sounds are the openings. The opening songs are probably one of the most intense, mood lifting and hyping song you could've hoped for. \\n\\n\r\nYou are most likely familiar with One Punch Man or Fullmetal Alchemist. Their openings are really the ones that get you riled up. They set the mood and get you ready for the epicness that is going to be unfold. Haikyuu rivals if not for some, exceeds these two. Haikyuu's openings, be it from season 1 or 2, are the best to get you ready for the show when it comes to the sports genre. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\\n\\n\r\nMost of you who are reading this probably are a fan of sports genre. Then you should know that sports genres' anime are really enjoyable, especially when there are lovable characters and epic moments to share. These are what Haikyuu offers to you. Great characters, awesome shounen moments, intensive games featuring aspects from comedy to drama. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series and can proudly say that this is one of my all time favorites. As far as a single season by itself, it did pretty frickin' well. You can easily see that from MAL's score. Throughout the season it was always in the Top 20 highest rated of all time. When the season ended, no surprise, a sudden increase came, and now it is almost rivaling a place in the Top 10. That's how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this series?\\n\\n\r\nFan of sports genre or not, yes. Absolutely yes. This is a great show to start the sports genre with or if you're familiar with it, why haven't you already seen this? Sure KnB was probably more popular but this is what sports anime should be like.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 11/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review comes from someone who actually plays volleyball, so my opinion is god ;)\r\nHello everyone, it\u2019s your family friendly, volleyball playing, review writing member of the MAL community here, bringing you what is known as a \"review\u201d. I hope I can do the series proper justice and be fair to the quality of the show while also conveying the series from the perspective of someone who is passionate about the sport. This review is going to be pretty unconventional and non-structured, so I\u2019m sorry about that, do your best to follow along with my style of reviewing.\r\nTo start, I want to say that Haikyuuis not a complex show. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but if you\u2019re going in expecting sophistication and subtle themes to be brought up in a thought-provoking manner, you\u2019re not going to get it. If you\u2019ve watched season 1, you generally have a pretty good idea about what you\u2019re getting into, but if you haven\u2019t (not sure why you\u2019d be reading this if you haven\u2019t lol), don\u2019t expect anything more than a really good shounen. Not an FMA or HxH type shounen, but still great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems I had with the first season and in my review after the show had begun airing, was how basic it was. The moves they were doing weren\u2019t that significant if you\u2019ve ever played volleyball, and nothing was very noteworthy or impressive, yet they were treated as such. This seriously put me off at first and I couldn\u2019t get over it. Now, however, I\u2019ve come to tolerate it much more than I did before, so I won\u2019t get into all of the technicalities I had previously listed out because I simply don\u2019t care anymore. Well, except one that needs to be brought up. The whole \u201cKageyama putting crazy spin on the ball so that its momentum stops and Hinata hits it\u201d is illegal. A set ball is not legally allowed to get more than about 3 rotations. Anything more than that and you\u2019ll get called on a double. I\u2019m not even going to bring the stretching of physics into it, but it shouldn\u2019t matter. The set has no practicality and is completely illegal. I don\u2019t know why this was included and it does bother me a bit, but if you didn\u2019t know it was illegal, it probably didn\u2019t bother you at all, so this is mainly a personal gripe.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the middle part of this show, I began to get a little bored. There were a lot of matches that started to blend together and I was craving for something to change. I was even considering dropping my score to an 8 because of it. This is probably only a problem if you were watching it as it\u2019s airing, week by week. I imagine that a marathon would help make each part more distinct because you\u2019re being fed it faster and can thus make the distinctions more easily. Anyway, this issue I had was completely shattered in episode 23 and 24. These two episodes were phenomenal. For sake of not spoiling anything, I won\u2019t go into detail, but the final match they played, specifically how it ended, had me sitting on the edge of my chair throughout. The very final still-frame scene gave me chills. The build-up was great, the final play was appropriate, the atmosphere was perfect, and everything in the 5 minutes leading up to it were nearly flawless. I was extremely impressed.\\n\\n\r\nIn this season, each major character was developed to a much greater degree than in the previous season. This is probably because we had already been introduced and familiarized with them, so it was now possible to go into depth with each of their personalities. I really appreciated this and it was much improved from the first season in which only Hinata and Kageyama received a serious amount of backstory and motive explanation. The side characters (meaning the people on the opposing teams that received at least a considerable amount of screentime) were very appropriately handled. They didn\u2019t get much depth, but they didn\u2019t need to. They\u2019re outsiders after all. It would be weird to give them so much development seeing as they don\u2019t affect anything about the story at all aside from one match or a practice session. It was very realistic. I can say from personal experience that during club season, you do pay attention to certain people more than other people and you gravitate towards watching their matches because you think they\u2019re good, have an interesting playstyle, are an athletic freak, or any other reason. When you play these people you want to do as well as you can, subconsciously trying to impress them, even if you\u2019ve never spoken to them in your life. This is what happens for Hinata and Kageyama quite a bit, and to restate, it really captured a realistic feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stellar as always, but this is Production I.G. we\u2019re talking about, so that\u2019s to be expected. The slow motion shots looks great, it\u2019s fluid throughout, and everything is high quality, so you\u2019ll find no complaints from me. Similarly to the soundtrack, however I must say that nothing truly stood out for me. With the OST, everything is solid, but nothing is exemplary. It makes the show better, but it doesn\u2019t go above and beyond, which is certainly all right. Not every show needs a grammy nominated soundtrack accompanying it.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the comedic aspects of the show to be spot on. I cannot tell you how many times I had to pause the episode, take a screenshot of whatever was going on, and then send that screenshot to my friends in Skype, usually pissing them off while I\u2019m laughing throughout the whole process. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a comedy critic or expert or whatever, but I\u2019ve listened to a lot of standup comedy and I can at least say that I can usually weed out good comedy from bad comedy, and while this isn\u2019t necessarily the most witty and clever, it\u2019s absolutely better than most of the shows that try to do the same thing. It was almost always hit and rarely miss.\\n\\n\r\nTime to bring it back down to earth for a minute though. I have heard many people say that this anime got them into volleyball, either playing or watching, and I have to warn you guys. Haikyuu volleyball is not like real volleyball. Haikyuu is a lot more exaggerated and precise because it\u2019s an anime. You can\u2019t capture the complexity of the sport or the sheer amount of things going on around you and the chaos of volleyball in an anime. Just as an example, there are many times in real life where you get a great set, you go up to hit, and you just hit the ball into the net or straight out. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times, your average player does it a lot too, and it commonly happens to even the best players. These simple mistakes just aren\u2019t present in Haikyuu. If you want to see what high-level, real volleyball is like, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEB96RVl_Ww (if you don\u2019t care about all the warmups or the preliminary commentary, skip to 7:30).\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve sufficiently summarized Haikyuu, so I suppose it\u2019s time to wrap things up. With this show, there just aren\u2019t a lot of things that you can point out as problems. The pacing in the middle, sure, the lack of complexity or depth, maybe (but it\u2019s a sports shounen, don\u2019t come into a show expecting something you know you won\u2019t get), and the OST, maybe, but that\u2019s about it. My problems with the volleyball playing itself and the fact that I dislike drama is exclusive to me, so others may not have these issues. Everything else ranges from very good to outstanding leaving little room for criticism. This is the most overall enjoyable and well-made show to come out in the past 2 season, which says a lot considering the fact that we\u2019ve been bombarded with One Punch Man and Erased hype throughout each. When all's said and done, Haikyuu is a show that you should not miss. I\u2019m looking forward to watching season 3 when it comes out.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. If you have feedback of any kind, please tell me, I\u2019m always open to conversation.",

            "content": "Just one more point. You take a deep breath in, trying to truncate the overwhelming anxiety infiltrating your own body. Your pulse quickens and your mouth feels like gritty sandpaper, all while trying to keep your body from collapsing out of sheer exhaustion. The raucous cheering from the crowd serves as nothing but a muffled backdrop to the sound of your intensifying heartbeat.\r\nJust one more point. It's your turn to serve. Countless nervous eyes upon you, the florescent gymnasium lights oppressively beat your feeble body down with rays of warmth. The thought of the win or loss being on your shoulders causes your legs toquake with fear. Your arm feels like jello as you throw the ball up, sweat running down your forehead and stinging your eyes as you struggle to track it in the air.\\n\\n\r\nJust one more point. As you smack the ball your hand begins to throb, your heart begins to beat louder as you tirelessly contemplate the quality of the serve you just made. Will it make it over the net? How easily will they receive it? I wish I would've hit it harder. I should've used a jump serve, but I wanted to be conservative. All these thoughts run through your mind as the ball sails through the air. \\n\\n\r\nJust one more point. THIS is the glory that is Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nIntensity may only be a nine letter word, but the plethora of emotions derived from it are unquantifiable. Anger, doubt, fear and adrenaline are all feelings that stem from being placed into an intense situation, and perhaps no anime series sheds light on this phenomenon better than Haikyuu. I've seen a handful of shows struggle with trying to balance moments of suspense with plot or character development. What some writers fail to realize is that the synergy created from combining the two elements together, births an even more remarkable method of storytelling. The hype factor in Haikyuu season two is unreal, and the writers checked off my list of issues from the first season one by one as the show went on. Edge of your seat action, coupled with enjoyable/developed characters and stunning visual sequences helped this season of Haikyuu storm to the top of my favorites after a jaw-dropping final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis season picks up right where the last left off, and while most teams would be struggling to pick up the pieces, Karasuno is banding together to become even stronger in the Spring tournament. It was refreshing to see Hinata actually open his eyes (both literally and figuratively) when it came to execution, and he got proper technique training from one of the best in the biz. While many may be quick to toss aside the episodes at the training camp, I believe those episodes were critical in the development of the story. Hell, they even gave us backstory on Tsukishima... turning from a sarcastic know it all to a rather redeemable character. The relationship between Kageyana and Hinata is as polarizing as ever, and their chemistry as teammates constantly evolves as the series continues.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of Haikyuu is the character development of Karasuno's opponents. Why must we constantly be flooded with vanilla antagonists having virtually no backstory, and a motive with no justification? Many bad guys have a reason for their behavior, thus having this information presented to the viewer deepens the conflict and adds feelings of empathy. Haikyuu mends this chronic error by delivering sufficient backstory to even the most insignificant character. On the contrary, this could also be seen as a shortcoming due to the overwhelming amount of characters the series already contains. A delicate balancing act is concocted but I feel overall Haikyuu remains in the green here. A few new characters were introduced, including one black haired enigma (who I can't remember the name of) filling in for the captain who seemed to come out of nowhere. I relied on the flashbacks to cover my mental gaps on that one.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I appreciated the story progression, the middle third of season two is a tad slow. Due to the seasonal episode structure you pretty much knew Karasuno would make it through the first few rounds, so it was difficult to get attached to any of those matches. Also, due to the sheer intensity in most of the second season, the comedy took more of a backseat then in the first installment. Not a major complaint, just more of a blemish if anything. The writers buff the show back up with a remarkable ending, with episode 24 being one of the most memorable of all time for me. The way each character strained to get every percent of use out of their body was inspiring, and the final exchange between teams was epic.\\n\\n\r\nThough I haven't actually played volleyball before, I can speak for the amazing use of sound effects throughout the series. The squeaking of sneakers, and thuds from players hitting the gym floor were spectacular. It took me back to my days in high school while playing indoor sports. Not to mention the palpable atmosphere created by the roaring crowd and pumped up teammates. The series isn't entirely focused on one character, but how they fill each other's voids or weaknesses. Through quality writing and vivid visuals, the matches themselves are a sight to behold. This is some of the best art in modern anime, and not necessarily from a technical perspective, but from the ability to prompt emotions out of the illustrations. The hype factor is off the charts.\\n\\n\r\nI can only imagine how fun it must've been to be in the recording booth with some of Haikyuu's voice actors. The amount of screaming they do throughout the series would burst any normal man's vocal chords. Both openings were intense and added excitement each time I turned on my computer to watch the show. I didn't care much for either ending, but these seem to be hit and miss for me these days. The rest of the music was seamless, transitions seemingly invisible. Smooth transitions and peppy, fast paced tracks to go along. \\n\\n\r\nWatching the crows grow together was a delightful experience. Although I enjoyed the first season, I didn't have as high of expectations for season two. I was completely knocked off of my rocker with this one. I urge those of you who haven't had the pleasure of watching this gem, BELIEVE the hype... Embrace it, and enjoy the ride that is Haikyuu!",

            "content": "Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu.\r\nWith most sports anime, the pacing of the storyis hard to bear. In some shows, a match can last nearly half a season. With Haikyuu, it never felt this way. Each episode had a succinct amount of storytelling and the pacing was perfect. From the training camps they attended, to the matches that were played, every episode was a thrilling ride that always managed to be satisfying. One of Haikyuu's biggest strengths is how it properly sets up each story arc with the necessary back stories to each character. This type of information provided is exactly why this show is so good. It gives you the \u201cwhy should you care\u201d for nearly every aspect of the show. Haikyuu also mixes the elements of a story masterfully. Comedy, action, shounen, it's all there and perfectly balanced. Comedy was put in at the right times and had me rolling on the floor on more than one occasion. The action is thrilling in the big matches and the shounen aspect of \u201cimproving\u201d is so engraved in the viewer, it just feels so good to root for Karasuno.  The attention to detail in the story is by far one of the best of any shows I've seen and it truly makes for a great watching experience. \\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G has done a great job with the animation for Haikyuu. The animation quality is top-notch and most importantly, consistent. In fast-paced action scenes, the animation becomes incredibly intense, but it's very well done and gives a much needed \u201coomph\u201d for climaxes in the story. Character design is varied and unique as well. Far too often in other anime shows, the characters all look alike. Haikyuu does not experience this with its large cast of characters that are appealing and uniquely designed.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu's voice acting, background music and OST are, like the rest of the show, great. The OP and ED are fitting for the theme of the show. The background music in scenes are also utilized very well. Some other shows try to force insert songs in scenes that do not fit well but Haikyuu does not suffer from this. Haikyuu's OST is near perfect and manages to help emphasize the emotions experienced in the show. Google Haikyuu's OST and prepare to be blown away (or just listen to it while watching). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Haikyuu are most definitely its strongest point. I briefly mentioned this earlier, but Haikyuu fully develops each character in the show. The characters all grow throughout the series. None of them are 'perfect' from the start and altogether gives it a certain type of realism. Most people like to root for the underdogs and that's essentially the same feeling you get from Haikyuu. There is no 'Gary Stu' as each person has their strengths and weaknesses. Even the seemingly perfect Oikawa Tooru has his own weaknesses in that he is not a 'prodigy' but someone who worked his way up. I also appreciated that each character in the show has an impact. For example, Yachi, the manager, is not someone who just stands on the sidelines cheering Karasuno on. Haikyuu shows you her back story as well as her perspective. This greatly adds to the storytelling and to her character in general. Same goes for Tsukishima. His backstory is fleshed out and tells us why he acts the way he does. Each character is important to the overall story and is truly a 'cog in the machine' for Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nMy initial thoughts upon seeing the preview for the first season of Haikyuu is that I couldn't possibly find volleyball interesting. Now, 50 episodes later, I can't fathom how I'm going to wait for the third season. Haikyuu is not 'perfect' and of course has certain elements like 'they can't be losing all the time' armor plot. But again, Haikyuu is a fictional anime with the sole purpose of entertaining you. In this case, it is very much about the journey, not the destination. If you only care to look at the small conveniences that a story may take, you'll miss out on everything else that makes it great. For me, Haikyuu was an enjoyable show that I looked forward to watching every Sunday. With fully developed characters that you can care about, a great OST and masterful storytelling, Haikyuu is worth your time as it is an excellent example of just how entertaining anime can be.",

            "content": "The second season of the Haikyuu!! surpasses the first one by having more creative \u201cfunny\u201d moments, longer screen time for the secondary characters, and impressive plot/character development. I\u2019m sure many of us watch anime out of enjoyment but having an anime that is motivating & inspirational will eventually leave a deeper impact \u2014 I\u2019ve started running after watching Hinata and Kageyama run during practice, no jokes. \r\nThe strongest element of the show is hands down, the characters. Not only do we focus on the achievements of the main protagonists but we also get to see more of the \u201csecondary\u201d characters in the show (I hatecalling them secondary because I feel like they\u2019re all equally important). You cannot watch Haikyuu!! and not want both teams to win because you see how hardworking and talented each team is.\\n\r\nI must say, the creator is a genius for coming up with such diverse group of characters, artwork and story. In addition, the animation team did an excellent job bringing the manga to life and keeping it real.

This \u201creview\u201d will cover the 3 seasons WITHOUT spoilers, sorry for my mediocre english)\r\nMy character development:\r\n2 WEEKS AGO: i don\u2019t get how people can write long parragraphs just about one anime, they are so good, i wouldn\u2019t find so much things to say.\r\n1 WEEK AGO: I would love to review this show! I have so much thoughts i want to express!\r\nHi! I have to say, this is my first review here, so if you want you can run away from itAHAHAHAH. Really i don\u2019t mind if you won\u2019t read aaaall of this because it\u2019s boring, i wrote it especially for me (cathartic purposes). But PLEASE! Give this show a shot. PLEASE!! You won\u2019t regret it (hopefully). PLEASE!!!\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 9/10 (AND MY OPINION ON THE SPORT GENRE LIMITATIONS)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, its Premise is cliche and not \u201coriginal\u201d. Actually, is the Apotheosis of Simplicity: basically an underdog tale. You all have watched something like this at least once, right? yes and No.\\n\r\nIt may be cliche, but i took some cinematography classes, so i\u2019m a strong believer (like, SUPER STRONG BELIEVER), that is for 90% the EXECUTION what makes a show/movie/whatever worth and great, not its premise. A theorically interesting premise can end up being shit, or vice-versa. So, i want to \u201cexplain\u201d why Haikyuu!!, despite having a cliche premise, not only succeeds, but excels (for me, obv) in its genre and in general too. The universe the story takes place in doesn\u2019t glorify volleyball, nobady is gaining Super Sayian power ups to make things more extraordinary than they need to be and the major climactic payoffs can be something as simple as \u201cone payer learning to block one smash\u201d. This may seem simple but Haikyuu proves itself with HOW it executes these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSport genre: who critices Haikyuu!! for being cliche and predictable, really doesn\u2019t get how HARD to execute is the sport genre. No lying, this might be worst genre to handle for a mangaka, because of hoy difficult it is to maintain it interesting for a long time, and particularly it\u2019s the work of a God regarding Haikyuu!! which is a fucking long-runner, meant to have hundreds of chapters. This genre has a lot of limitations and restrictions that other genres don\u2019t. The characters in Haikyuu can\u2019t travel around the world exploring new and interesting places like other genres do. It\u2019s really hard to draw a lot of volleyball matches and make every match look \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d from another, because the setting (field) is always the same and so are the volleyball possible moves. It must be hard for a mangaka not to be repetitive in drawing a large amount of matches, but matches can\u2019t be eliminated because the genre requires them.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not a flaw per se (unless this is a detective story), but it\u2019s better if something is surprising, right? Of course. Unfortunately, in the Sport Genre (long-runner) the predictability simply CAN\u2019T BE TOTALLY AVOIDED because of the genre.\\n\r\nPlease, think about it: if you make a show where the formula of one loss equals elimination, losing means no championship, and without it there is no show. So, it\u2019s near impossible for the protagonist team to lose because as i said before, if they do there is no show. You have to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!IN CONCLUSION!!!!!:\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to create a TRUE sense of tension in this genre\u2026 BUT.\\n\r\nBut Haikyuu!! is actually able to provide an amazing feeling during the matches in a way that is utterly brilliant and makes it one of my favorites anime and piece of medium of all time.\\n\r\nHow does it? Haikyuu creates tension by GIVING THE OPPOSITE TEAM A REASON TO ROOT FOR THEM, breaking the cliched \"Protagonist/good \u2013 Antagonist/bad\" theme. Yes, Karasuno is favored team, but opposite teams aren\u2019t portrayed as mean and rude \u201cvillains\u201d bump in the road on the way to the top.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu gives them amazing traits, quirks and a decent development that once everything is reveald makes you question: \u201cWho I REALLY want to win?\u201d\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Haikyuu stands out, it not only makes you care about the teams Karasuno is playing against, but this attachment creates a new sense of tension that it\u2019s alright and makes you forget about the almost inevitable defeat.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what i\u2019m trying to say is: the unavoidable trait of \u201cnever losing\u201d, nearly impossible to get rid of it, makes the sport genre an incredible difficult genre to create amazing tension in, BUT instead of doing the impossible eliminating this all together, Haikyuu puts this element in the farthest corner of your mind, and doing this means that Haikyuu is able to BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SPORTS GENRE.\\n\\n\r\nTHE RIGHT EXPLOITATION OF A LONG-TERM PLOTTING:\\n\r\nThings are casually shown or mentioned in earlier seasons that show up later and may even evolve into major events. It's a sort of quiet foreshadowing -- you see it as part of the current happenings and don't even realize how significant it will become in 30 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY:\\n\r\nHonestly, it\u2019s hilarious. The perfect balance between comedy and \u201cdrama\u201d. The goofy moments never undercut the seriousness or break the tension. It was always a hit and rarely a miss.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: i was in the bus watching one episode, the none of the characters did something and\u2026 i couldn\u2019t help but laugh HARD, bur REALLY. I usually laugh \u201cin the inside\u201d or i smile at best. It\u2019s so rare i actually LAUGH for fiction, but that time i couldn\u2019t really stop and everyone stared at me like i was crazy. One of the most awkward moment in my life :\u2019(\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS: 9.5/10 (My cinematography teacher was right: You DON\u2019T need complexity to be great)\\n\\n\r\n(Super small detail: Haikyuu has 0 (really ZERO) fanservice with sexism and sexualization. The female characters here are traited with RESPECT unlike the 99% of anime in existence where the girls are constantly portrayed with huge boobs that make other girls jealous of them. Strong positive.)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a really lazy person, REALLY. I never liked sport, doing it or watching it. But THESE CHARACTERS are the reason why now i could accept to play some volleybal \u201cmatches\u201d for fun, instead of avoiding them. The characters, the author, the anime and the producers of it really love volleyball or at least respect it, and it shows a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMany times they accomplished to show and talk about volleyball stuff like roles and moves in a kinda poetic way that truly made me understand deeply the passion for this sport, and how is not the \u201csingle\u201d that matters the most, but the whole team.\\n\r\nAs i explained, the key here is wiritng characters that we GENUINELY CARE ABOUT, to the point where we become as passionate as they are for archieving their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nFinding characters compelling naturally makes us care about whatever they care about. So they are basically using empathy as a narrative tool. That\u2019s why ultimately the stake doesn\u2019t matter, if it\u2019s the fate of the universe or a simple game of volleyball. \\n\r\n\u201cStakes\u201d aren\u2019t proportioned by the magnitude of the \u201cdisaster\u201d, but by the importance of it in THE EYES OF THE CHARACTERS. There are many movies about distruction, but we just are disconnected from all the explosions because the characters don\u2019r care about (or maybe we don\u2019t care about them).\\n\\n\r\nBut WHY did we end up CARING about these characters to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe because they are endearing to watch (Hinita\u2019s enthusiasm, Kageyama\u2019s smugness\u2026), but this may be very subjective about which types of characters i like or not. So, is there something OBJECTIVE that explains why the majority of the viewers care about them? YES, there\u2019s an objective reason (i will explain it the art/animation section).\\n\\n\r\nJust like many other anime, Haikyuu has a semi-huge cast of secondary characters: the Karasuno players. But unlike most of the others, these characters are not underdeveloped. Actually, Haikyuu might have one of the most well-assorted and brilliantly handled cast of characters. They are not the most complicated or layered ever seen, but this has never been a requirement or a \u201cparameter\u201d to judge the quality of a piece of medium.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is, of course, special in some ways, BUT he is not the one who saves the day nor most talented one (and will never become). Is he good at volleyball or strong? \u2026Ehm. But he is necessary in a way that is masterfully handled by the author, despite him not being objectively \u201cstrong\u201d in a conventional way. But he is necessary for the team, and NOT ONLY HIM.\\n\r\nUsually, teammates are often forgotten or only used as pawns in sport shows, but in Haikyuu NO ONE IS LEFT OUT.\\n\r\nEach temmate in the cast is given a role, a strenght they build upon and grow as people because of, and most important, just like in real sport teams, they are all connected to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is also given a good amount of personal development as well corresponding to the role on the team.\\n\r\nEVERY PLAYER has its own very moment to shine and show his ability, and, most important, every player is necessary for the victory.\\n\r\nAnd this happens not only with the protagonist team, but the ANTAGONIST TEAMS as well (Episodes 16 of S1 and 23/24 of S2 are the peak of it and true masterpieces). Also the \u201cmain\u201d antagonist (Oikawa) is a genuinely well-written character and it shows in the 2 seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, the interactions between the players of the protagonist team feel extremely genuine and realistic, but even better are the interactions between them and the antagonist teams: their personalities reflect in each other and thus creates interesting social situations or funny banters.\\n\r\nHaikyuu always keeps you interested merely because you see two sides of the story. You know the struggle and passion of both the protagonists AND the antagonists. The screentime of them is not given too minimal to feel uninteresting and not given too much to where it feels overbearing. So, the protagonists success is even more rewarding and exciting when they beat someone with an equal amount of work and passion. This show and manga truly shows the importance of characters in a story. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters of course want to get better at volleyball but on top of that thay are also dealing with adolescence, expectations of each other and of themselves, self-esteem issues, school life and uncertainty of the future. CHARACTERS OF HAIKYUU DON\u2019T MERELY CHANGE, THEY GROW.\\n\r\nWhat is so damn impressive i show Haikyuu manages to give this meticulous traitement to a cast that spend the majority of time playing or talking about volleyball.\\n\r\nSo far Haikyuu has had 60 episodes and all of the characters still feel oddly fresh. That\u2019s because the show knows when to focus on which characters that way that everybody get the time they need to find their place within the narrative.\\n\r\nOf course writing and directing are both strong elements when it comes to crafting characters that we care about, but let\u2019s not forget that ANIME IS A VISUAL MEDIUM. Is there anything in Haikyuu\u2019s visuals that makes us care about the characters even more? YES.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: 11/10 (Very important FOR VALID STORYTELLING REASONS)\\n\\n\r\nWell, the show does a lot of different things with its visuals: the simplistic cartoony moments for comedic purposes, the \u201ci can\u2019t believe this is not an anime film\u201d levels of animation, and there are some visual metaphors too (crows).\\n\\n\r\nBut, what does Haikyuu do visually that is UNIQUE TO IT IN THE VISUAL PRESENTATION?\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER DESIGNS\\n\r\nThe style that they are drawn in really unique, they look different from every other anime which suffer from \u201cSame face Syndrome\u201d. Haikyuu\u2019s designs manage to look very distinct while still looking like anime characters. And\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-EXPRESSIONS (the most important thing)\\n\r\nFacial expressions in animation is one hell of a challenge.\\n\r\nUnlike real faces which have THOUSANDS of different details and lines, anime characters consist of just a few. This could called the \u201cSame Expression Syndrome\u201d. In anime, most of the times it just feels like there has been used templates for each emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: if you ask a hundred different people to smile, you don\u2019t get five different types of smiles, you get a HUNDRED. Every person looks slightly different when they express an emotion.\\n\r\nAnd Haikyuu has managed to showcase this in the animation. When Haikyuu\u2019s characters express an emotion it doesn\u2019t feel superficial or like it is drawn off of a template, it feels real! Like a REAL person is emoting something, like the expression is UNIQUE TO THEIR CHARACTERS, and that is INCREDIBLY ENDEARING. Distinct and believable facial expressions help selling a character\u2019s emotions (like Hinata\u2019s stare in episode 1).\\n\r\nThe expressions of Haikyuu\u2019s characters speak volumes of who they are and they make us remember them long after the game is over.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing to say, the sound is good and of course it makes the show better, but it\u2019s not an important aspect to me unless it is very good or very bad. Also, the voice acting\u2019s are just fantastic and \u201cgive life\u201d to the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, ENJOYMENT: 11/10\\n\r\nThis might be the most enjoyable show i\u2019ve seen. And as i clearly explained (hopefully!), Haikyuu is a great show that makes you care about the characters for subjective but also objective reasons, that exploited animation and visual storytelling to present visual metaphors, and that has a \u201ccliche\u201d story with such a masterpiece of execution, despite all the limitation of the sport genre that i mentioned preaviously.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is an anime that should not be passed up, it is one of my most memorable shows for creating tension in innovative ways in a genre which i preaviously thought to be impossible, as well as making a diverse team where everyone has a role to play and feels like a genuine sports team. And this is why i recommend this show to literally everyone. Of course i can't guarantee you will love it as much as i did, but it surely will be a good time because this show is really hard to hate.\\n\r\nI know nobody will read this fucking long stream of consciousness, but somehow if you decided to watch this show because of my \u201creview\u201d (or whatever reason), feed me back, it\u2019s always a pleasure to share opinions about such a great and important (for me) piece of art.\\n\r\nP.S. I won\u2019t write reviews again, this was terribly exhausting ahahah",

Seeing them go through bootcamp, struggle to find their own groove. Watching Hinata and Kageyama find a new super quick. Watching the 3rd years overcome the fact this is their last year. The story behind the other teams they played, the back stories of the aces too were well thought out and unique.\r\nArt - 9/10\r\nI've seen better but this was very good especially when it mattered.\r\nSoundtrack - 10/10\r\nIt's perfect, the OP and ED, the OST gave the most sophisticatedatmospheric mood within a sports anime. I couldn't stop feeling in awe of how well it fitted into the scenes, the plays and the overall atmosphere. What's so good about the soundtrack, it both sounds good on its own and perfectly in sync with the mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nEVERYONE got airtime. Do you know how rare fairly distributed airtime on an anime is? And now an anime has it, it made everything so much better.

            "content": "To be honest at first i dont like volleyball that much but when i gave haikyuu!! a try it seriously made me want to watch it more. so here's my review. This is my opinion so you dont have to argue with me. XD\r\nStory : All i can say is wow it met my expectations. These guys i love the team they are fun, silly, and awesome characters.  I enjoyed most of the parts which were funny also. I like how they say the story of each member. So we can understand them more. We have Hinata dreams to surpass the \"Little Giant\" whichis from the team he joined. A lot of action to look forward to with the determination and help of his teammates \"Karasuno High School\" to become the strongest and best.\\n\\n\r\nArt : I dont know much about what art is but one thing is the Animation of the anime is good. and also every look of the players. Looks really the same as the manga itself. Some anime tend to change the looks of the characters\\n\r\nfrom the manga which is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSound : the sound in each events in the anime blends in quite nice. Especially in some moments were there is an Intense Match between the teams it gives you excitement. And goosebumps. Other parts also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Every character in the anime is awesome. Its not a one man spotlight. We see the whole characters improve from the matches they played. And also made some new weapons to use in their matches. The characters are funny, awesome, entertaining. And also we get to see the team's development to be the best in the league and relationship to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Overall I extremely recommend to watch the anime.  It gave me a big thumbs up. Funny, Entertaining, Awesome characters to look forward and how the 'Karasuno High School Volleyball Club' improve from every problems they encounter. It never made me boring and it never gets boring!",

            "content": "Before we begin, I'd like it to be known that this series of Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) has been highlighted as my favorite show for quite a long time. How exactly is this a big deal? Despite the ratings that I give to almost every anime being generous, I would have to say that this one is well worthy of the rating-scale at 10. There comes too of the saying that I am, in actuality, a very meticulous person when it comes down to watching a show; I'd prefer the shows that I've watched to be meaningful, containing some underlying message that may be served as amoral\u2014 and yet at the same time, I'd also like them to be absolutely thrilling to the bone, in other words, interesting/enjoyable enough to maintain my attention throughout the whole episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the main review. Please be mindful as there may be MINOR SPOILERS up ahead.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, we continue to follow the tale of Karasuno team taking on the obstacles in order to reach for the top.\u007f That's it; that's the whole story put into short. However, it's how they took on the obstacles that significantly places an imprint on how the tale is executed. Asides from the main characters, we could see various supporting characters are also struggling with their own issues as well.\\n\\n\r\nSince the beginning of the first season, we could see that the series is bundled up of several things\u2014 and they've made sure to include a few matters that are or could be inevitable in real life, such as the importance of exams. It's an understatement that the story does mainly revolve around set of emotions, the challenges taken up by people, and how they respond to/cope with their current situation. What I like about the overall story is how realistic at times this series can be: like how people deal differently with their losses, that talent is something that is nurtured, etc. Furthermore, in the second season, we get to see some more of the supporting characters having their screen time and tidbits of their background.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while those things I've mentioned above are happening, regardless, they still managed to make them related to volleyball as how it should be\u2014 to which pinpoints the fact that they did not get sidetracked from their main plot line.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) even more unique is how they explained the volleyball game exactly works which includes the basics, and the tactics/techniques on how to do each move. Throughout the whole seasons, they have also shown that teamwork and communication are the key factor within the game. But most of all, they had done a particularly good job in conveying their messages; one example being that no team is guaranteed to be more invincible than the other; no individual is better than the other.\u007f\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint that I have here, however, is that there is a lack of small injuries that could be inevitable when it comes to playing volleyball in reality. As a volleyball player myself, I've always come out of the volleyball practice with few injuries, and I had a sprained finger for few times. It's quite baffling that they didn't mention any of this as volleyball is a game full of risks, what more with mainly hands, but then again, if exercised and played with enough caution and in a proper form, it's possible to come out of the game unscathed. Still, they should have mentioned this\u2014 in fact, the Mangaka should have mentioned about the possible risk of breaking a finger or a hand.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there were also few moments within the anime that feels unnecessary to me, including a few ones that are unrelated to volleyball, but I realized it's these little things that make the show and its story more believable and realistic. After all, the world is not thoroughly centered around volleyball. I'm glad that this series had also displayed that at few points.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat is a show with a story line that has potential but with butchered up characters? Horrible. On the other hand, what is a show that seems to have a boring story line, but has characters that are written well? The opposite. As much as characters do share the same important role as the story line, characters\u007f play a significantly higher factor in becoming a great story. No one would want to watch a show with an interesting plot but all of its characters are written so badly, they basically ruined the potential of the show. Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) is fortunately, and definitely, the latter.\\n\\n\r\nHaiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) showcases that the supporting characters in here also get as much support as the main characters. It doesn't matter how minor or insignificant they are, in the end, they've brought something to make the show have more purpose. Perhaps this is one of the few things that the series is trying to highlight; in one of the early episodes, and since the first season, we could see that the supporting cast got to have their own screen time. But wait! This may be a coincidence, but they've also put in a message that supporting characters do matter. This can clearly be seen in the episode where Hinata Shoyo, the main character, told to Hitoka Yachi, whom is a supporting character, that even the supporting characters can fight.\\n\\n\r\nQuote taken out of context: \"Townsperson B can fight too!\" [ From Hitoka Yachi to Madoka Yachi, her mother. ]\\n\\n\r\nMoving further, all of the characters in this show are quite impossible to hate. Or at least, I found it impossible to hate. I could have disliked a few of them but as time grew, I found myself to become fond of them. In general, every single character here has a personality of their own and there are those that share a few similar traits among them. Now that I look back, there's not a single character in this show that has uniquely stood out from the rest; it's as if they were all equally unique altogether. Yet at the same time, each character has their own quirks and perks that made them distinguishable from the rest. If you think long and hard enough about it, it could be safely deducted that these characters are quite a paradox. Hinata and Kageyama, for an example, may seem like they're complete opposites of each other when in truth, they share many similarities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is evident in this series. Overcoming fears, handling insecurities, going through conflicts, effort in order to become a better person/player\u2014 it's right there. I'm pretty sure that by now, you've all noticed that I'm mostly talking about the characters but that's because, and I repeat, they are the MAJOR key factor in a story. The progress of the character development is at the right pace; not too slow nor not too fast, otherwise, the off-pacing will make it seem unrealistic. By the end of this second season, you could see that our characters ( especially the ones in our protagonist team, Karasuno. ) are different compared to before. They've changed but not completely enough for us to notice right away. And it's not just them.\\n\r\n\u007f\\n\r\nI'd love to say more about the characters, because really, they're all superb in their own way. Honestly. I love all of them.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art & Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not that unique, but it's enough to make it seem decent which is also a factor ( but not much ) to make a great anime. The background noises are subtle often times, and depending on the atmosphere of the moment, the soundtracks fits the mood suitably. The voice acting of the characters are quite great, they've done a good job in expressing themselves! On the other hand, the opening and ending songs are all nice as well, catchy even, and in my opinion, they are better than the ones used in the first season.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think it's very obvious that I enjoyed Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) a lot. From the small and fleeting moments, to the sad ones, to the ones where hilarity ensues, and some more; this show is comprised of a lot of things. Truth to be told, even with this quite long review I put here, it still can't do much to express my love for this anime series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 OVERALL: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this anime, please do give it a try! But that is only if you're willing to do so. I, myself, admittedly felt bored in the first few episodes of Haiky\u016b! (\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!) but it really depended on my mood that time around. On the other hand, to those who have already finished the first season but has yet to watch the second\u2014 then I recommend this season to be watched. \u2665",

            "content": "To Whom It May Concern: The following review will be an unbiased, honest & systematic review that's just to the point. I will refrain from spoilers to the best of my ability. This critical review is mainly intended for people wondering whether to watch the second season since they finished first or for newcomers who are for some odd reason wants to start this anime for second. Please don't be the latter. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nHaikyuu!! Season 2 attempts to refrain from being just another sports anime while still incorporating most of the tropes throughout the entire season. The story, being simple as it is, continues fromfirst season and never really becomes complex. This is a very straight forward shounen style anime that motivates you. We have the struggling protagonists fighting against odds/antagonists/self to achieve their dream. The pacing in the first half of the season is really slow. The show really tried to develop almost every player on the volleyball team in the first half. Each of them learning new techniques to harness the power to unite for a common goal. However the second half it started picking up pace but it felt like the matches became monotonous. It's really cliche how they handled it and went about presenting it. If I watched in a weekly fashion, I would've just abandoned it or wait till the entire season ended. Atleast they didn't have any filler episodes and the comedy has a natural feel to it since most of the time it's not too forced. If there is any merit, the last few episodes of the show really delivered top notch story that will keep the viewer wondering what will happen next. So alas, the ending was satisfying and it resolves the minimal plot holes this show has. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are most if not all relatable characters so everyone can connect to their own counterparts. They present each character with a particular flaw and overtime shows how to overcome such flaws. This season, the characters become more fleshed out and they provide a better foil for the two main protagonists. Each of them finally have their own unique personality. So they become more likable. However, this case is only true for the major handful of characters. Everyone else, including the antagonists, are just a duplicate with minute changes, making them not so different from one another. To be blunt, there aren't any memorable characters that stick out except maybe the main two protagonists since they sort of give off the Naruto & Sasuke vibe from the first Naruto series. Maybe the creator of the show just wanted to do that for easy success to attract target audience, who knows. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at the technical aspects!!\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 & Sound 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime is fully hand-drawn, no CGI or blends and it really gives the viewers the closeness and nostalgic feel for this show. The animation looks crisp and the action sequences are really well drawn. Like most sports anime, this anime also abuses the slow-mo action shot of the final shot but it doesn't do it too much. It manages to figure out the just amount as the show progresses. They really like to accentuate tense moments. However, being a show that has a lot of minor characters, it faces the traumatic consequence of new characters being drawn almost identical to the main handful characters only to be differentiated by a small detail. Fortunately, this show has good opening and ending songs. The background score isn't extravagant. It's simple and the acoustic string instrument based scores gives this anime the push it needs. Also, a big kudos for the voice actors, they do a phenomenal job!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a shounen anime, the show delivers. The characters are fun to watch and the secondary characters are great caricatures. The show exemplifies the whole theme of the power of friendship and team building pretty well. The slap-stick comedy provides a nice laughter. Even the fan service is very tastefully done. Not too much to complain about since I binged it. It's not addicting, it's just fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnywho, overall, I would give this show a 7/10. The show isn't just fine or really great, as die hard fans hype it out to be. It's just a damn good show (provided you binge it and not watch it on a weekly basis) albeit it's ever present flaws. Would I rewatch it? Not really. However, I don't regret watching it. So I guess that's something to be hopeful about if YOU decide to watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, feel free to share your opinions/criticism with me. I don't bite. I hope you find this review helpful! Sayonara! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I made an account just to review this show and how crappy I thought it was.\r\nStory- 4\r\nIt's a sport anime. Now I love sports anime; I've seen the most popular ones of the genre and some of the lesser known ones like Over Drive and Softenni. I came to Haikyuu!! with some pretty high hopes after all the positive reviews the show got, but I still can't think of anything that set sit apart from all the other sports animes.\r\nWeak yet skill protagonist? Saw that in Kuroko no Basket, Eyeshield 21, and Yowamushi Pedal.\r\nSecondary protagonist that starts of somewhat antagonistic? Saw that in Daiya noAce, Eyeshield 21, and hell, even Naruto. This trope has been done to death.\\n\\n\r\nFormerly strong main team that has fall from power? Saw that in Daiya no Ace. \\n\\n\r\nThe exposition itself isn't just what bothers me. I've seen each of these tropes many times so seeing them again is rarely a deal breaker. What IS a dealbreaker is how this show somehow manages to complain all of those tropes into this mishmash of a show. \\n\\n\r\nTHh way the plot moves forward makes it soooooo predictable. Character wants to complete in national level tournament, teams gets close to finals, team loses to elicit sympathy from the audience, team agrees to participate in the conveniently placed 2nd tournament a few months after this one, team wins matches and replays previously introduced teams to create a surprise final boss, team beats final boss and everything is super!\\n\\n\r\nYes i'm well aware that KnB used a formula similar to this one but it get s a pass because the execution was so much better. \\n\\n\r\nI liked shows like Eyeshield 21 because the team wasn't awesomely powerful. They were a ragtag group of misfits that weren't presented like they could always win. Having only one chance to make nationals make it seem a thousand times more interesting when the characters lost.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great at moments during matches. I have no notes for the art or animation. The only thing that really bothers me is when a character is presented as attractive but has the same jawline/eye shape as almost every other background character.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6 \\n\\n\r\nHinata's voice was annoying. I didn't find the little sounds he made cute either. In other news, the first op and second ed was cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 1\\n\\n\r\nOH MY GOD HERE WE GO\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest problem with this show. I could not relate to any of these character except on the most basic level. Only, like, nine characters had a good personality or at least an interesting take on one that's been done before.\\n\\n\r\nI could describe all the major characters using TVTropes alone:\\n\\n\r\nHinata- Adorkable. Determinator.\\n\r\nKageyama- Tsundere.\\n\r\nSawamura- Team Dad.\\n\r\nSugawara- Team Mom.\\n\r\nAsahi- Broken Ace.\\n\r\nNishinoya- Keet.\\n\r\nTanaka- Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass.\\n\r\nTsukishima- Deadpan Snarker.\\n\r\nYamaguchi- Shrinking Violet.\\n\r\nOikawa- Jerk with a Heart of Gold.\\n\r\nIwaizumi- Vitriolic Best Bud.\\n\r\nAone- Gentle Giant.\\n\r\nKenma- Brilliant but Lazy\\n\r\nKuroo- Jerk with a Heart of Gold.\\n\r\nLev- Unskilled by Strong\\n\r\nBokuto- Keet.\\n\\n\r\nThere it is. That's the base amount of personality from all of these character. I'll admit that some characters had an interesting take on their generic personalities but it wasn't enough take make me like them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 2\\n\\n\r\nBesides the animation and 2 of the themes, I found very little enjoy as I sat through this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI added up my scores and they average out at 3.5. Taking out the two 6's a gave for art and sound and it averages out to a 2.25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: After their bitter defeat against Aoba Johsai, the team carries on through training with the same determination. A summer camp filled with new and strong opponents becomes the catalyst for Karasuno's evolution. When the evolution is complete, Karasuno forges ahead to the Spring High with the same goal as always-to go to nationals. \r\nArt/Sound: The new characters this season are drawn perfectly, and the voice actors assigned to them do very well in portraying the characters' personalities. In addition, the 4 OST's do well to set the mood of the anime. The opening songs/videos give viewers a feeling of perseverance and determination that usuallycomes during a match, while the ending songs/videos conjure up a feeling of bitter defeat/grim determination that usually comes to the near conclusion of a match. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In this season viewers will be introduced to new players from new teams, some of the highly anticipated players being the rowdy, charismatic, and immature Bokuto, his younger but more responsible and mature setter, Akashi, the flirtatious and fun-loving Terushima, and the choleric yet extremely skilled Kyoutani to name a few. In addition, we see some regular cast members like Tsukishima and Yamato go through a dynamic change. As far as the story goes, there aren't any unlikable characters; they are relatable, endearing, and funny. Every shout of victory and shout of frustration of the characters is echoed in the viewer. The term 'antagonist' is used very lightly because they aren't evil, they are just as hard-working and generous as the protagonists. It just so happens that every team is in it to win it, and when all is said and done there can only be one victor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Every episode is worth replaying. There were moments of drama, but it would be balanced with comedic relief. If you want to watch a show that's light and doesn't require psychoanalysis, then this is one of them.",

            "content": "\"Some people want it to happen, Some wish it would happen, Others make it happen.\" - Michael Jordan\r\nHaikyuu freaking second season. There's this term called escapism, it carries a negative connotation with it because the assumption is that one is running from reality through some medium. Lots of time, as anime fans, you may browse through endless sites saying \"aw man anime is escapism\" or some bullsh!t like that. However, sports can be looked at the same way and nobody bats an eye, very hypocritical of the world today isn't it? Many athletes, whether professional or recreational have a different persona when it comes tothe sport they play, and it may very well be their true nature. Sports is something that one can participate in to forget about everything else, it clears one's mind. I like to draw this parallel between sports and anime as I watch Haikyuu because what I see from it is a great look into an athlete's psyche. Just like people watch shows, movies, play games, etc, to remedy boredom or stress, athletes take the same approach in their respective sport. As an athlete myself, everything about Haikyuu was amazing in terms of team, psyche, and attitude. Haikyuu does a great job at targeting a sports audience while keeping it simple enough a simpleton can follow. It doesn't take understanding of volleyball, although there is some implied knowledge, to get across to viewers. However, Haikyuu does suffer with a lot of meandering between characters, scenes, and in the worst moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you aren't aware, this is the second season, so if you're reading this I'm expecting you finished the first season. We start right after the loss to Aoba Jousai, and as you can tell the team doesn't look so great after taking that HUGE L. But fear not, these guys are motivated to no end because of that loss and we go on their little journey of going to nationals. Second season is definitely a lot less focused on the volleyball action, rather wayyyyyy more exposition than necessary for a simple plot. The problem with this second season is the crazy influx of characters, which many were significant for like 1 minute an episode. Lots of screen time was devoted to these imbeciles and often times it happened during the volleyball action scenes, which takes away some of the adrenaline and instead slows down the pace of the viewer and the show. This rather unrealistic approach is a turn off because many times, whenever a flash back occurs it's highly predictable the result. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a big issue throughout Haikyuu because these scenes could be upwards a minute, and that is just too much precious time to take away from the action. In the case of Haikyuu, there wasn't enough FANSERVICE. I'm talking not enough VOLLEYBALL! Too much thinking, too much spoon fed context that viewers can catch on with. It's good that we get to dive into what an athlete's psyche, but I believe Haikyuu took too much time to go into EVERY character. It's a little ridiculous because scenes late into second season are incredibly inducing, with extreme tension and then flashback boom: predictable and takes away from the experience. However, Haikyuu does a great job of bringing the viewer into it's setting, almost like the viewer can be at the bleachers watching alongside the fans. It's immersive and fun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters took a nosedive that I didn't appreciate. A lot, and I mean A LOT of characters are introduced. And you can probably guess from that last statement that MANY were one and done. Many side characters seem to fill the plot convenience whenever necessary and it once again takes screen time away from the Karasuno team, who arguably is the most interesting team. Our two main slugs are no longer the stars of the show it seems, with lots of emphasis going on the side characters. This is a problem because the first season did a great job displaying how two polar opposites can come together and play a sport well. This season is...too lackluster. But there was great characterization for most characters, i guess due to the flashbacks that flesh them out. Also Yachi is like the most useless character ever. Her arc was just pathetic, I mean she is barely fan service if that's what the writers were thinking of adding her for. She's comparable to Nunally from Code Geass, just being plot device. She had some personality, but Haikyuu would be the same without her. Overall, the Karasuno group was a good cast to follow, with their chemistry together, the nice senpai's, the dumb and overreactive 2nd years, the polar opposite freshy (both pairs), and a playful coach to boot. They got a lot less screen time, but doesn't stop them from kicking ass!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation could be sooo much better, if the volleyball scenes were played out in succession. Many times its just different angles with the ball going down and someone diving for it. A bit repetitive in that department. The facial features were great though, whether someone was mad, sad, or indifferent was very distinguishable and comical as well. The character design is up to the viewer though, whether one thinks its good or not, but Haikyuu does a great job depicting volleyball as real as possible, although I can do without the pauses in midair. That just doesn't happen hate to break it to anyone interested in volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nSound is great. OST is amazing and sound effects are great. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu is a great sports series, it has many elements to the show that makes it good like it's characters, storytelling(half n half), and charm. While the first season was stronger on focus and characterization, second season has more exposition for those that love the funny interactions between characters. It still is intense as it was in the first season and able to bring you into the audience. If you play volleyball, this is a must watch. If not, it's definitely try to get as much out of the first season because second season has implied terminology and diction. It's still informative, but don't look at it like its how to play volleyball because it's whole lot harder than it looks.\\n\\n\r\n\"I've failed over and over again, and that is why I succeed.\" - Michael Jordan",

            "content": "The \u201csecond season\u201d for a lot of anime series tends to bring out amazing set-pieces, better story progression as well as the fact that, since the show was successful in the first place, the viewers would love to see more of it. Haikyuu: Second Season is a hidden gem that I loved for the first season, but this second season especially, for the first 13 episode and beyond held a special place in my heart because it was this show during Fall of 2015 that literally brought me back up to speed in terms of my education and just real life struggles. The mental impactit had on me during the first half of the season is something I can\u2019t really share, but I can give you a glimpse of what to expect from the second season of this phenomenal Sports/Shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season ended with a cliff-hanger where, Karasno saw the end of their inter-high tournament at the hand of one of the powerhouses of volleyball, Aoba Josai. This specific event sets precedence for the second season where Karasno has to make a choice to either get better as they practice more, or evolve the current style of play to something that can stand up against a powerhouse. New teams and characters are introduced in the series and for the first half of the season; it\u2019s ALL about CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  THIS is how you do character development. Showing the characters struggle to improve in the game with the emotion and tension that come with it. Each character that the show focuses on had some part in that struggle and the way it was portrayed in the anime was nothing short of amazing. To me personally, it was something really relatable at the time as I myself was going through some struggles during the first half of the season. They weren\u2019t the same but the crux of it was essentially relatable.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, Production I.G. knew exactly where to spend their budget and how to make full use of it. The animation is nothing short of outstanding and something that should be considered High-Quality. The fluidity of movements from the hair all the way to the full body movements and action scenes are done with precision work and something the company should be really proud for. This is quality animation and nothing less. As for the soundtrack, it\u2019s amazing and fits the mood perfectly and if I had the opportunity, I would buy and listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that Haikyuu second season is a real master piece. It has a full on training arc with major character developments, a thrilling tournament to boot and great lessons and struggles for people to learn from. The animation is top notch, the OST is freaking amazing and the story is overall progressing smoothly and greatly. I really hope you got something out of this review and I wish if you checked out the first season to check out the second one as well. The great news is that the THIRD SEASON has been announced so we can all look forward to that!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10 (Master Piece)\\n",

            "content": "Do you think sports anime are corny?\r\nAre you curious to watch one sports anime?\r\nDo you hate anime that has an exaggerated superpowers and there are random electricity coming out of their eyes or Sharingan is activated in the middle of the game? (Don't get me wrong. I love KnB).\r\nTHEN WATCH HAIKYUU!! DAMN IT! IT'S SOOOOO GOOOOD.\r\n*Ehem* Anyways, if you're reading this review and you haven't watch season 1, well, here's a synopsis.\r\nOne guy named Hinata loves volleyball and dreams to be the ace of one team (Ends up being a decoy). During his middle school, he had a volleyball club but, it had no membersat all. He had a rival named Tobio Kageyama a.k.a. the King of the court. He's called the king because of his selfishness and bossy attitude towards his teammates. When they were high-school, both rivals are now teammates. This is where their journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nOn this season though, this will tackle on how Karasuno will get back up again for the second time.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the second season is really just character development as a team on how they'll get back up. What I like about the story is that it's not only about the matches. Sure, the matches make a big impact on the story, but they also give time to develop the characters outside of the matches like their training. Haikyuu is very light to watch and it seems like you're watching a slice of life anime except there's sports \"feels\" on to it. This anime gives so much time on character development and it maybe boring for some, but not for me. The humor on this anime is also outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where the matches kicks in for the Spring Tournament. Honestly, there was never a match that disappoint me. Every match really has a big impact to it (The last match on this season is still the biggest though). Sure, they show a minor match just to see that Karasuno will advance (minor spoiler right there), but it's not just some any minor match. There's a lesson to it. This is where I was VERY IMPRESSED. Even minor matches has a big impact not only to the characters in the story, but pretty much to every sports players out there. I thought it was very heart-touching. I sound corny, but it's true.\\n\\n\r\nI gave story a 9 because despite all its greatness, it still hasn't concluded, so maybe if the next season will conclude and its greatness is consistent, maybe it'll get a 10/10. The characters though are a 10/10. Despite the huge cast it has, almost every cast are memorable and that is because they really give time for each cast to shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great though, it's art style is where I have to get used to. But hey, I'm used to it already. I mean, this is the second season already. What matters is on how fluid the animation is and they're consistent like Kuroko no Basket (Not surprising considering that they have the same studio). There are so many memorable moments on this anime and one of those reasons has something to do with the animation. The soundtrack for the second season is really good. There are some light soundtrack while there are some epic soundtrack. There's this one soundtrack where I really like (I don't know what's the name) where the bass guitar goes crazy and it really pumps me up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very enjoyable anime and season 3 is already confirmed and will air this Fall of 2016. I can't wait! If you haven't watch Haikyuu, watch it now! Seriously!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is on par with Baby Steps except Baby Steps has romance and it's only 1 v 1 (Tennis). Both anime have great character development and great matches in different ways (Read my Baby Steps review if you're curious). So, if you're looking for an alternative for Haikyuu, go watch Baby Steps. It's underrated and it seriously needs attention.",

            "content": "Listen, you might prefer One Punch Man or Death Parade or Your Lie in April or what have you, but this was my favorite anime of 2015 by far. (I know it went into 2016 but technically it's a 2015 show) \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nLike the first season, the second season's storyline is very simple. Karasuno wants to do well in this tournament and get to nationals. Typical of the genre, nothing too special or new. \r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThis was the thing that made season two so great for me, and there was no way I could give it less than a ten. With a simple plot anda simple goal, this series ends up being very character-driven and this season especially makes that crystal clear. At one point fairly early in the season, the character development parade begins for a multitude of characters and it is absolutely glorious. Of course, it helps that the characters are interesting and fun to watch, too. By the end of this season, you'll only love the characters more, including characters you didn't know you loved at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is a little rocky sometimes, but overall it's pretty great. The art style is the same as the first season, and it still works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are all phenomenal, and they all serve their purpose. The openings are catchy head-bopping tunes that get you hype for the episode while the endings make you not want to wait another week. Being the nerd for this show that I am, I've listened to both volumes of the soundtrack, and it covers a wide range of genres, instruments, and feelings to fit the moment (*cough* that one scene in episode eight *cough*).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEvery Saturday for six months starting in early October 2015, I would get home from my piano lesson, put a pot of mac and cheese on the stove, and settle in for a ride, and that was the highlight of my week. This show made me laugh, it made me cry twice, it made me ship things because I'm trash, and most importantly, it made me happy and it was a feel-good series most of the time. I looked forward to every new episode from the minute I finished the last one, and it was an extremely fun six months that I would repeat in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis series isn't full of deep themes about the nature of humanity or stunning visuals or a dark and gritty storyline, but there's a lot to appreciate. From the fitting theme music to the cute designs to the varied and lovable cast of characters, the second season of Haikyuu!! goes above and beyond the first's achievements and you'll definitely find something to fall in love with.",

We love so much every single caracther. Hinata and Tobio are very amazing. Oikawa is a great Captain and Iwaizumi a great vice-captain and ace for the their team. There's also have Hinata's ambition on the Little Giant and the rivalry between Tobio and Oikawa.

It really is deserving of all the praise and attention it gets. Watching this team dig themselves up from the bottom of the barrel to a point where they're actually a formidable powerhouse is stunning to watch. As always, this anime lines its story with wonderful narration as well as exceptional animation. Getting riled up over sports is not something I do often, but you can't help it when you watch Haikyuu!!\r\nAs far as individual character growth this season, it was outstanding. Not only did literally everycharacter develop at least one new skill, the entire team developed together as well. It truly is inspiring to see these characters grow and change. It's also a testament to the quality of the anime itself that they can add in so many characters while still maintaining a degree of backstory and development for each of them. \\n\\n\r\nI'd still recommend Haikyuu!! to anyone who enjoys a good story that melds with great characters. It's one for the ages.",

            "content": "SUPER SHORT VERSION: If you're a Haikyuu fan, then of course you're gonna like it. If you love sports anime but have never watch Haikyuu, then I strongly suggest you to start watching the first season since there's a huge chance that you'll love it. If you don't like sports anime, then I'll still suggest you to give it a try. It's a refreshing take on the sports genre and you'll definitely appreciate numerous aspects of the anime even if you don't fully enjoy it. \r\nLONG VERSION:\r\nHaikyuu 2nd Season: the season of development and growth. If the first season focuses more on introducing and establishingthe newfound strength of Karasuno(the main team) and how they're no longer the \"flightless bird\", then second season focuses more on developing and growing the strength even further and also adding and developing some characters that were sidelined quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI will start off with the strongest element of this series: the characters. Most people and fans praises Haikyuu the most on how it handles the characters, and rightly so. This is not just limited to the characters in the main team, they also gives quite an ample amount of focus on minor characters from other opposing teams. And they don't paint this 'rival' characters in a bad way as well. There are lot of the characters from the other teams that you will find quite likeable. Because of this, you will find yourself empathizing quite a lot with some of the minor characters in some parts. Everyone wants to win the match, everyone wants to be the best and this show handles it brilliantly well. \\n\\n\r\nThere were quite a number of new characters that were added into this season, but there was only one character that was added to the main lineup. Yachi Hitoka was added as a future or a replacement manager for the current manager who's a third year, Shimizu. Her impact on the series was not really that huge, but she was definitely a pleasant addition. Her addition doesn't felt forced and she connected really well and naturally with the team. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and plotting of this season was done really well. The first half of the season focuses a lot on the growth and improvement of the team. It was handled realistically well, in the sense of \"You cannot improve overnight\". It takes time but it doesn't feel like it's too dragged on. The build-up towards the tournament was also done brilliantly. There are some aspects of the story where it suffers quite a bit. This one I think is a problem where almost all shounen sports anime have. Too many expositions. Though in Haikyuu, the expositions are not as derailing as some anime are. It doesn't disrupt the flow too much so it doesn't come out as too sluggish. Also, the show handled the slice-of life aspect of it quite well. All of the characters bounce off each other quite well. You can't help but smile and laugh through out some parts of the series. It's lighthearted and also very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight of this series is the quality of art and the soundtracks. The animation sequence of this anime, especially during the matches, is seriously one of the best I've ever seen in an anime, or at least in a sports anime. It managed to stay pretty grounded with its sense of realism, but also pretty epic at the same time. The expressions of the characters whether it's anger, intimidating, or sadness, was animated and portrayed really, really well. The soundtracks throughout the series also definitely helped in elevating the level of excitement and thrill from the audience. The showrunners definitely know when to keep certain moments silence and when to add in music to add more thrill and excitements. The OPs and EDs of this anime also fit the mood of this anime quite well. \\n\\n\r\nTo say that this series is enjoyable would be a massive understatement. Honestly, I've never been as worked up when watching an anime as I was when I watch Haikyuu. Like I said before, the slice of life aspect was done really well. So this series is quite funny through out. And the level of intensity and excitement during the official matches is hard to describe by words. I'm well aware that I might exaggerate it quite a bit but I just can't help it. The flow, the sequence, and the level of intensity during the matches was just nothing short of brilliance.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was an amazing series and an excellent sequel to the first season that was already great on its own. It's a highly enjoyable series for all ages to enjoy.   \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The Karasuno volleyball club goes home after playing in Inter-High, focused on the the next tournament, training and practicing to become even better than they were before.\r\nAfter seeing them play in the first season, I honestly didn't know what Karasuno could do to improve their play. They seemed at the top of their game but this season clearly proves that there are levels they haven't even reached yet. It's actually unbelievably impressive to watch them train as hard as they did and not only improve what they already can do but alsolearn new skills along the way. It's so exciting to watch, even more that the first season. \\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty amazing how each character proves themselves to be such a vital part of the team. Leading towards the Spring Tournament, hey are take the next months training with Tokyo's top teams, playing practice matches with each of them, learning new skills and improving their play substantially. And once the Spring Tournament starts, you get to watch them display everything they learned and it's so exhilarating. The matches in season one were incredibly exciting, but season two takes volleyball to a whole different level.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did love was that we already know the characters from the first season so they waste no time getting right back into the story. The beginning is somewhat slow but it is pretty funny. They introduce one new character to the volleyball club, and she's an absolute gem. Definitely a great sequel to the first season, it might even be better. I really can't wait for the 3rd season.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\\n\r\n-Loved the training, the matches and pretty much every time anyone picks up a volleyball\\n\r\n-Loved the art, during one match, Daichi gets hit really hard in the face and you see the bruise on his face for the rest of the series, I absolutely loved that\\n\r\n-The music was fantastic, the intro really gets you pumped for whats to come\\n\r\n-The characters are hilarious and absolutely love watching them play volleyball\\n\r\n-The matches were incredibly suspenseful and you really couldn't predict what was going to happen\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\\n\r\n-I really can't think of any tbh",

The pace and growth of the character development and the reactions when people see Hinata's jump is amazing!! I absolutely, love this anime! I'm literally obsessed with Haikyuu and i can't wait for season 3 to come out! Good plot, BGM'S, etc. For someone like me who has no interest in sports or anything like that, this anime inspires me to do new things, and i could relate a lot to this. It's interesting watching your favorite character developthrough the plot and learn new things and surprising others, other than this being a sports anime, I believe there's also a lot of comedy involved, i've re watched this over and over again a bunch of times (Tbh, at least like 30 times during my summer vacation) and its hilarious!",

            "content": "\" Losing isn't always the end, sometimes it becomes the beginning. \" - Jospeh Duffy\r\nThe story itself is of a typical shounen genre and the experience of winning and losing that it portrays is another ordinary taste that every anime with similar genre has. The taste of winning a match and conquering others is certainly unforgettable, but the taste of losing will etch inside the heart and leaves all sort of regrets and blames inside as an invisible torture. What comes next is the determination and the enthusiastic fire that is bright enough to melt it. And Haikyuu managed to do just that.\r\nThe highlight ofthe show is the characters' insane determination and their endless will to keep going, to keep coming up with different attack and defense styles and to train non-stop just to improve the styles as to win the next match. It hurts to lose something even after you gave it all you got and others comfort you with words that has no meaning to you, but it hurts more not to try harder and to lose again. \\n\\n\r\nThe story depicts it well, that we can emphathize their bitterness in losing and their happiness in fighting through the other god-like teams with their overwhelming strength and teamwork as we cried out inside in joy for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are made up of a vast ensemble of different quirks for each player inside the team and for the other teams as well. The art style managed to match each characters with their personalities perfectly, from a cowardly ace with huge body, a small-sized middle block with insane jumping power and speed to a new cute and shy manager who is lack of self-confidence but brings a huge impact to the team. The characters' charms are the main drive that keeps the story entertaining and serious depending on the situation, you can laugh at the interaction between the mis-matched duo, Kageyama and Hinata and the entire team yet at the same time you can feel their passion and drive while playing a match, and how they keep backing each other up that you just want to cheer for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds match quite good with the tense and cheerful situation, to keep us either on the edge of our seat or dwell inside our joyful heart as we want to see more of their actions and quirks. Most noticeable OST for me is \" Fly High \" by Burnout Syndromes which is perfect change for the show and rise up my love for it even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu is not just an anime that those who are interested in volleyball will enjoy, but it will appeal to anyone that is up for a shounen anime for a change as it is entertaining with a bit of comedy and present a grasp of losing and winning as a team. The very embodiment that makes Haikyuu much more interesting.\\n",

            "content": "Story (9/10)\r\nWhy I give this a 9 score ? this is my reason.\r\nI thought Haikyuu!! S2 has a  positive and negative points on the story.here we go\r\nPositive points :\r\n-) Good development.This season successfully showed good chance how Karasuno picked themselves back up after losing in the Interhigh in Season 1. From the training camp up to the matches, they didn't fail to show the changes and developments. \r\n-) Enjoy plots.different from first season, this season gives step-by-step story developments.the plot wasn't so fast or so slow.\r\n-) Sense of joke.I can't say it Haikyuu!! if weren't contents of comedy.especially this season has most absurd humour.likeplay-called \"Gwaah!\",\"Shuut!\",\"Kaboom!\" who Hinata often to said it.although on the Karasuno players hasn't special joke,their absurd act sometime gives me a funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nSo,there are positive points what I seen.I will give you the negative points of Haikyuu!! S2 :\\n\r\n-) Impossible show-plays.are two points what I senn of this,there are when Johzenji-plays and Oikawa-serves.in realistic,you will know their play it's so impossible to do,like unstructured-plays,random-receives,and many more.and Oikawa great serves must have 'Monster'-hand to do.Yes, you can set it there but it's impossible for it to be on point, you know. Yeah, this is an anime so I shouldn't expect it to be 'oh-so-realistic' all the time but that plays killed the realistic feel that I had while watching the match.\\n\r\n-) Easy to predictions.because them has standard-speed plot,we have to predictable what will go the story,what next on story,and what characters to do. in short, it's because of the series of events and curiosity itself. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is great though, it's art style is where I have to get used to. But hey, I'm used to it already. I mean, this is the second season already. What matters is on how fluid the animation is and they're consistent like Kuroko no Basket (Not surprising considering that they have the same studio). There are so many memorable moments on this anime and one of those reasons has something to do with the animation. the new characters this season are drawn perfectly, and the voice actors assigned to them do very well in portraying the characters' personalities\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the second season is really good.it very different by on first season,there's so many greatest soundtrack from Yuuki hayashi.also the opening songs/videos give viewers a feeling of perseverance and determination that usually comes during a match, while the ending songs/videos conjure up a feeling of bitter defeat/grim determination that usually comes to the near conclusion of a match. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nThe main advantages of this were real-fights,variant characteristic,and growth skills.we have to see how Hinata and Kageyama tried to the best on them plays with totally-tried like on reality.\\n\r\neach of character on this series has more new characteristic and it's gonna growth by the condition of team itself.for example when Yamaguchi changes Tsukki bad-mood to be better feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,I very enjoyed this season even I've not to be patiently to wait the next season!",

I mean i haven't tried watching any sports anime. \r\nThe Story i gave it a 8/10, because its cool how they showed the value of teamwork in winning a game. Story is pretty original, them training and all. \r\nArt Style, i gave it a 7/10. It's cool how they were able to create the scene, cause volleyball is a fast game, whenever a player spikes.\r\nNow my favorite part, the characters. Atfirst, i expected them to be a boring cast with the main characters taking most of the story, leaving the minor characters in the team not shown. But that didn't happen in Haikyuu, you get to know every player in Karasuno. Also I love the character development in this anime. I gave this a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:; 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be short.\r\nIn sports i like to keep things simple. I don't like when too much abnormal or supernatural stuff is added to the content. You can call it a Kuroko trauma. Haikyuu managed that! \r\nThe main character Hinata is the jewel. I missed watching someone who conquered a sports for being good at it (even though he's really short). The combination of hard work plus talent made him everything i wanted to see in a sports anime. \r\nAlso big shoutout for the studio to dwell into volleyball and explain it without turning it into something overly ridiculous.\r\nMy only complaint is the lack of exploitingother characters (including our own Hinata). A bit short on what could be some potential relationships, ended up just tossed to second plan. Wish too they added some more drama but i guess that's up to my personal taste so it's subjective for others.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it's a solid anime. it ain't groundbreaking but it's far from being bad. \\n\\n\r\nWould recommend to anyone looking for a very cute MC in the shape of Hinata and who is into having a good time watching a energetic fun sport.\\n",

            "content": "Honestly, I would never watch a sports anime because it's not what I preferably watch but I'm very glad that I gave Haikyuu!! a chance. Sports anime is probably on my top five of what kind of anime's not to watch but I decided that this year, I should get out of my comfort zone and watch something different. I picked Haikyuu!! out on a whim and because I was bored and had nothing else to watch. I started watching Haikyuu!! the first season about four days ago and just finished the second season. I love Haikyuu!! and enjoyed it immensely.\r\nStory - 10:\r\nThe story wassimple. A volleyball club's journey of getting stronger and defeating their rival. But it was how the story progressed throughout the episodes that makes it so good and exciting. I can't really explain the story because it's probably your typical sports anime but Haikyuu!! drew me in really fast, so I'm giving this a 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10:\\n\r\nThe art was different from what I'm used to but that's okay because that's what drew me in. The colors were fun and bright when the characters expressed their delight when winning and dark when they lost. The drawings and art was incredible and I could really feel the intense concentration Shoyo and Oikawa had when they were in their matches. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10:\\n\r\nWhen I think of sound, I first think of the opening and ending, and I loved all the openings and endings. I already downloaded Imagination by Spyair and Fly High! by Burnout Syndromes. The openings, for me, created a great build up and excitement every time it played. For the soundtracks, I didn't pay too much attention because I was too focused on the match but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nAll I have to say is that the character development was insanely good. You see these characters start off weak and as you watch each episode, you see them grow stronger and stronger. I love all the characters and debated of adding them all to my list of favorite anime characters on myanimelist but I didn't. Each character had their own personality that fit perfectly with each other and that equaled a super awesome and strong team.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much. It was funny, intense, light-hearted yet it made me feel sadden and despair. This moved way up in my favorite anime list because it made my heart pound, it caught my attention, made me scream and shout with excitement and made me want to play volleyball. I love this anime because it's just so interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10:\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to everyone and anyone. I love this anime and still have their matches fresh in my head as I'm writing this review. I'm just sad that the anime is over and that I have to wait until October to watch season three. But honestly, I enjoyed this anime and love everything about it. Five thousand stars out of ten!!",

            "content": "I generally dislike second seasons of most anime. The usual plot point being that defeat made the team work harder to come back and get a revenge match. Haikyuu 2 is not gonna win any points on originality. If you have seen Kuroko no Basuke S2, then the story here will essentially follow the same path. I loved the first season, this one not so much. Lets get the pros and cons out of the way. \r\nPros: \r\n+ Tsukishima gets to shine. \r\n+ Some good moments with side characters Ennoshita and Yamaguchi. \r\n+ Music is still as awesome as it was in the first season.\r\n+First few episodes start off strong with good, solid humor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n- Hinata \\n\r\n- Hinata \\n\r\n- Hinata saying moikai 10 times each episode (yeah, yeah, I get it already, he wanna win)\\n\r\n- Insistence to potray Hinata >>>>> Naruto\\n\r\n- \"Ace\" Azumane spikes maybe twice entire season. \\n\r\n- Hinata overacting every episode. \\n\r\n- Give Nishinoya more screen time godammit. \\n\r\n- One Hinata wasn't enough, Hinata used kage bunshin and came up with Koganegawa, Lev, mad dog, Bokuto and Johzenji High volleyball club. \\n\r\n- Theres even a team full of Hinata's \\n\r\n- Gotta make moikai a catchphrase of the winners. Stop trying to make moikai the next dattebayo.\\n\\n\r\nYep, I pretty much like all the characters in the anime except for Hinata and most of his clones. Some clones like Bokuto are nice but the majority of them are just... ugh. Too bad Hinata was the main character. Would have loved to see more from Tsukishima's perspective. Generally in anime, anyone who thinks and analyses the situation is treated like garbage. Loud-mouthedness and foolishness is celebrated as key ingredients for winners. This anime does the same. The most level headed and smart players (Daichi, Tsuki) are relegated to side characters and dumb idiots get the role of main character. \\n\\n\r\n6/10. Not a bad anime. Certainly entertaining for shounen fans. Maybe I am just losing interest in shounen in general. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "An outstanding anime of its Time, Haikyuu is probably One of the best Sports Anime in this era. \r\nI really love this Anime because of the faithful adaptation of Production I.G. especially the way they've executed the anime, and most of all I love the OST of this anime, probably my main reason why I love Haikyuu so much(well BGM is the why I've started watching anime in the first place) enough said I just want tell you people that this anime is not your ordinary sports anime where it's only win or lose with a shallow reason, it's an anime filled with unpredictable, welldeveloped lovable characters \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is predictable when it comes to results of the game, but what isn't predictable was the execution and the characters, of course it's easy to know who's gonna win but it's not when the characters do their role in the story, they are not empty nor shallow but they've got identity and in the story they are developing so much that you can sympathize with them, and that is the reason to like Haikyuu, not because of the story but because of the Character. The Plot is not that much it has a simple pattern of Training and Winning but it was overshadowed by the execution, and by the developing characters, there only few elements that revolves in Haikyuu and it's only limited to the subject of Why do they play, How to play, Who(are the players and the participants of Volleyball, even passing an exam is for volleyball. Well at least this series is not using cliched setting where you just put some characters as a plot device ladder where the main characters have to step on it in order to make the plot progress nor to make some unrealistic power play like KNB. Overall the story was very decent for its sports anime that balances the character depth and shounen premise. The series treats its characters properly, every team has its own story and development, every character has its own problems and flaws yet the more when the characters develops along with the story, some of the things were light hearted but most of them were serious, especially the problems of the characters they were facing when it comes to playing volleyball (so for not one problem was encountered that doesn't affect volleyball unlike PingPong Animation). So Haikyuu is not just a volleyball anime focused to defeat its opponents, but rather every individual even the opponents gets the chance to change on what they are supposed to be as an athlete no matter what circumstances nor history they have, no matter what kind of people they are, they'll change as long as there's a flaw in their character, which is the reason why it's hard to hate an opponent at the same time it values its shounen premise of trying to reach the goal \"Winning\" and \"Rivalry\" \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound is the creme of this anime, Production I.G. never fails when it comes to these things, and they don't fail when they adapt some series, they can make any stories they adapt 10X better than the original, and they are always faithful to the series. Haikyuu is one of them, the manga has a decent plot but the art was very rough, but in the anime they've made the art so smooth but they add some rough scenes like from the manga but in a better way especially the character's critical moments. The art was so good that you'll easily pick the anime over manga, Design Background everything was just perfect. It's rare these days to see an anime better than manga, most of the time manga is better than the anime in terms of plot or adaptation. The execution, the scenes and the effects, or the whole animation was perfect, no doubt they've got the best art and unlike Ufotable which was known for having the best art but also known for not having a good financial support, Haikyuu's better future was ensured by the production, though Production I.G. might not be the perfect studio, w/out a doubt Production I.G. is one of the best production team. Enough said, the anime got an exceptional art, the execution of the animation was too good, especially the 24th episode where you can see fast camera, great angle, creative scenes and balanced screentime to characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound probably is the best of the anime, It's really good, which gives soul to the anime, the sound director makes every episode of the anime like a concert which gives satisfaction to its viewers. Most Overrated anime has a good sound and Haikyuu can be easily get good ratings because of it, much more with great art and great characters and unpredictable execution, which is acceptable to get a higher ratings than the others, though the plot is yet to improve. And the best of the sounds of this anime would fall to the BGM made by Yuuki Hayashi, the VA's did their job perfectly but with the support of the BGM the anime takes it into a new level. I how the composer thinks, he makes some BGMs that doesn't fit the anime yet it fits in when they were used in the right way, some of them can be used as an RPG BGM(I did it to be honest) or use it to relaxed or to study, I just love these sound tracks. \\n\\n\r\nNo doubt I've enjoyed it, and even I've read the manga this anime was able to surpass what I've expected. Most of the time when I've read the manga, I really don't watch the anime unless it's pretty good, since mangas are always better than the anime, but this time this anime surpasses the manga. Able to create tension despite of being spoiled and to make you feel even though you know what's gonna happen, it's really good that keeps me waiting every week along with the manga. I'm still waiting for the series to become beyond volleyball Playing, I want some dramas or if possible a romantic subplot, something that makes the series not limited to volleyball, but for now it's just a possibility and I hope the Author can do that. Overall the anime was a fun ride filled with unexpected development, a highly recommended anime especially for newbies and casuals. Also if you really love it pls buy it or watch it in legal terms, but if you're poor like me you can just watch in the anime sites as long as you don't pirate it XD",

You will get the right amount of adrenaline during the first episode and then more and more in each next episode. Behind the main topic - sport - there are also theme of friends, hazard, willing, dreams and team spirit!! As a former volleyball player I just felt nostalgic and it seemed I wished I hadnt had a chance to play like anime characters! But the main look is at volleyball games. You just dont want to miss them!! Also you will be awarded with amazing soundtracks that make you have goosebumbs!!But actually there is nothing to surprise because Japanese music plays with your soul and makes you heart warm. So DO NOT MISS IT!!!",

            "content": "I always find second seasons of sports anime better than the first, mainly because they usually lose in the first season but grow enough to win in the sequel! It makes everything better watching them pick themselves back up only to reach they're goal and rise even higher!   \r\n\u2800So the story, the matches weren't taking forever in my opinion but my friend disagrees with me on that saying they drag sometimes idk. I get too caught up in the game! So I guess it's a that haikyuu gets you too engulfed in the match to realize it was like five episodes long?! Kageyama& Hinata's fight also Tsuki & Yamaguchi was great.  Also Tsuki got the character development he needed, the thing with his brother killed me. ;-; And Ennoshita's backstory plus Yachi appreciating becoming the new manager in the end only added to the loads of character development.  The characters only grew to be more adorable and intense in this sequel.\\n\r\n\u2800Animation was haikyuu is fantastic especially since production I.G is so good with sports series, doing work on series like diamond no ace and kuroko no basuke. Tbh they're one of my favorite studios, I love so much that they've worked on. \\n\r\n\u2800The music was fantastic omfg haikyuu ALWAYS HAS GOOD OPENINGS AND ENDINGS, because SPYAIR is one of my favorite artists. Umm uh umm I don't really remember the background music, but I know it sounded really epic in the matches. \\n\r\n \u2800I enjoy this series so much I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",

            "content": "This is my first review and I may actually sound biased but this is how this anime was for me. \r\nWARNING: HAS SOME SPOILERS.\r\n*PLOT: 9/10\r\n-NEGATIVE POINTS:\r\n1) PREDICTABLE. \"Karasuno: A fallen powerhouse\"\r\nLet's face it, we all know where this anime will lead to. It's actually predictable but what makes you continue watching it? It's because of the questions: \"What will they do?\", \"How will they face the opponent?\" and the like--- in short, it's because of the series of events and curiosity itself. \r\n2) UNREALISTIC PLAYS. Well, I only have two plays in mind and the first was the time when Hinata jumped to reach forthe ball and landed on the wall. It was their match with Johzenji, if I'm not mistaken. Their captain called him \"mini-spider man.\" The second one was when Oikawa sent a toss to Iwaizumi from the other side of a net. Yes, you can set it there but it's impossible for it to be on point, you know. Yeah, this is an anime so I shouldn't expect it to be 'oh-so-realistic' all the time but that plays killed the realistic feel that I had while watching the match.\\n\\n\r\n-POSITIVE POINTS:\\n\r\n1) DEVELOPMENT. This season successfully showed how Karasuno picked themselves back up after losing in the Interhigh in Season 1. From the training camp up to the matches, they didn't fail to show the changes and developments. \\n\r\n2) PACING. It wasn't too bad either. It wasn't too fast nor too slow.\\n\r\n3) HUMOR: Haikyuu!! wouldn't be Haikyuu!! if it weren't for the tandems like Kageyama-Hinata (Hinata, you dumbass!), Nishinoya-Tanaka (Call me senpai!), Oikawa-Iwaizumi (I'll punch you!) and the like. They sure know where to insert those funny scenes. You would go from an intense \"gwaaah!\" to a loud \"hahahaha!\" real quick. It lightens up the mood during matches and adds to the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTERS: 10/10\\n\r\n1) DISTINCTION. Each of them has a unique trait that stands out. You wouldn't mistake anyone for someone else. For example, if you say \"clever and uninspired,\" the first one that you'll think of is Tsukki, right? \\n\r\nAlso, I like how one team differs from another. They emphasized that teams have their own way of winning. \\n\r\n2) REALISTIC. Aside from the play that I've mentioned earlier\u2026 well, this is self-explanatory. You can see it in the anime yourself. \\n\r\n3) GROWTH. \"I feel like we're getting in sync more.\" -Daichi. Growth is the most important factor in this anime and I think they carried it out very well. You can see how they adjust to every match. They did a great job showing how much they've improved not only their skills, but also their personalities as well.\\n\r\n4) SIDE STORIES. I liked how they gave focus to the other characters whom we didn't really notice that much in the 1st season. I thought that I'd only see a glimpse of their side stories but I was wrong. I was actually surprised that they gave Yamaguchi a whole episode. Hands down to that. Showing those back stories made me understand them more and I actually felt like I was connected to them. \\n\\n\r\n*ANIMATION/ART: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art was good, just enough to keep the hype and emotions going. Unfortunately, some parts were \"recycled.\" If you'd watch the episodes continuously, you would notice. It was like getting a scrap from a scene and just moving it to another. It would've been better if they varied those moves. Oh, the flashbacks were cool, by the way.\\n\\n\r\n*MUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nJust like the funny scenes, they know when to put the sound effects and background music. It was on point and it helped the scene's feels flow naturally. The voice actors did a great job and the OST were fine too but \"Fly High!\" was the one that stood out to me the most. Aside from the fact that its lyrics have a nice message, its rhythm gets you ready for the episode, instilling excitement to the watcher. \\n\\n\r\n*ENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI've watch this anime many times already but I still feel like I haven't had enough of it. There's just something about it that hooks you up and makes you want to watch it all over again.\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nHaikyuu!!, up to the first season and now, exceeded all of my expectations. It may have some flaws but hey, no anime's perfectly made. That's why I'm still giving this a 10. :) It is indeed a must-watch. May you be a volleyball or non-volleyball player/fan, you will surely enjoy watching this anime.\\n",

GO AWAY. His sour attitude held the teem back.\r\n Other issue like with season one I was really over all these geniuses that don't need the coach to strategize. And by the way everybodyis ten steps ahead when they're a powerhouse. But my biggest 2 issues are 1) mad dog wasted character given to us only to make that final battle difficult. And 2) I have seen many sports  anime and I do not believe they are strong enough to take nationals. I'm knb the team was already strong but only two players gave them that push. In this show they are struggling. I really loved the show but it has its flaws.",

            "content": "\"If I hadn't become a manager, I wouldn't have been able to watch today's matches, wouldn't have been so excited and flustered or been so happy when you won, and my heart wouldn't have felt so warm. It's all because I watched each of you work so hard to do something that you couldn't do before... If I hadn't been here, I would have never had that experience. So, thank you.\" \r\nHaikyuu!! began as an impressively solid and well-rounded anime, with strong characterisation and development, but it had some flaws. Shoyo was too often far less interesting than everyone around him. The team's manager,Shimizu, was a beautiful cipher with roughly one line every two episodes. Tsukishima could be little more than a surly grouch. The anime's scope in subject matter was limited wholly to the gym, with no sense of life beyond that, and its emotional scope was limited to the sports narrative boilerplate themes and feelings of vicarious joy after hard work resulting from disappointment. Like all the best second seasons, this one manages to improve on every flaw while maintaining its former level of quality. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! Second Season frequently surprised me with its willingness to depict real, serious conflicts and problems. The fear an aging ace on a team might have of being usurped by a rising star (and how that would balance with the team's dynamic), is explored, as are tensions between Shoyo and Kageyama: resulting from Shoyo's desire to evolve as a player past the rigid set plays that used his athleticism without letting him grow or learn, and Kageyama's dismissive attitude that someone who can't function properly as a cog in the wheels can't have opportunities wasted on him. The reason for Tsukishima's unwillingness to truly engage and emotionally invest in his team is revealed, and it's both psychologically realistic and even a little brutal. \\n\\n\r\nNew characters are introduced who expand the horizons of the show, giving it more depth and emotional range, and Shimizu becomes a fully-formed character in her own right. The matches are better than ever, because Karasuno is too, and the raised level allows for even more intense competition with complex strategies and in-game evolution. And all the little touches, like a strong serve from someone we've seen fruitlessly practice for twenty episodes, or a quick block showing the developing tactical senses of a brainless rookie, are twice as enjoyable because we've been along on this ride and become invested in the journey because of the show's solid characterisation and constant, organic development. Haikyuu!! Second Season is what shonen anime should aspire to be.",

            "content": "Haikyuu taught me a very important life lesson: \r\nTo improve, one must sometimes must be willing to endure long periods of \"deprovements\".\r\nWe often think of the path to expertise can be conquered by perseverance and hard work. Perhaps working smart can help a great deal.\r\nThis paradigm of thinking is prevalent in almost every sports and shounen anime out there. Keep on pushing and never give up - you will improve bit by bit and eventually hit there.\r\nHaikyuu goes against this popular and often untrue opinion.\r\n[Mild spoilers below.]\r\nIn the show, when the dynamic duo realized that their insane quick has hit a wall, they deconstructed theirtechnique and went through a period of hellish training in order to evolve their quick. This meant that they have to endure a massive performance drop against their opponents. Previously they had only lost 2 or 3 points, but when they were in the midst of training, they had to endure losses of 10 or more points, because they kept failing at executing their new quick.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, when everything came together, it resulted in revolutionary growth that would otherwise not happened if the duo chose to remain in their comfort zone and simply kept practicing their old technique. \\n\\n\r\nThis phenomena is evident in elite running (see 80/20 Running: Run Stronger and Race Faster By Training Slower by Matt Fitzgerald). In order to become faster, elite runners train by performing 80% of their runs at a slow speed (below ventilatory threshold). This runs counter-intuitive to the idea that in order to run fast, one has to practice running fast during training sessions. Yes, to run fast, one must not succumb to the temptation of showing off high speeds during training. Short term pride is not worth the last laugh one will get by staying disciplined and being willing to \"deprove\" to improve. \\n\\n\r\n[Weaknesses]\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the show is perhaps the non-realism of the new quick (see 0207xander's review). Maybe the author, or his editor felt that they could make increase the \"cool-factor\" by giving the ball some crazy spin, but it would have been better if the basis of the new quick is based on principles that are actually applicable to real life volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nAs I prefer more-realistic sports anime (the feeling of realizing something cool is actually realistic upon further research is truly exhilarating), this is the one area that Haikyuu falls short of my expectations (thus a 9). Otherwise, this show is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I was meant to do a review for the first season of Haikyuu!!! but too much time passed, so I thought I'll give my opinions on the second season as I've just completed it. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story to Haikyuu!! isn't too complex which I think is where it thrives the most, and you may know what's going to happen with Karasuno but for me I found that it was the finding out part which was the best thing about this series and the latter. Season 2 follows Karasuno High's Volleyball team as they compete in the spring high preliminaries for a chance to play atnationals. Season 2 steam rolls off the back of Season 1's great character moments and throws you into the freight of lesser known characters. Season 2 is much more volleyball-centric than it's predecessor I found myself shouting at the screen half the time because I love to hate Aobajosai and so many of the matches played through this season are so tense. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is filled with some of the best humour ive seen from any anime if watched and *certain* character interactions in a *certain* training camp are hilarious especially the teasing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAlways impressed by Haikyuu's art style especially the over exaggerated attacks in a game of volleyball, especially Hinata, Wall Blocks and Oikawas Service Ace. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAs a shounen series I don't expect less of great when it comes to it's soundtrack, I found the soundtrack to Haikyuu!! very bizarre as it blends into the background more than anything. I'm more transfected on the commands the team are throwing at each other, which to be honest I refer to more as a soundtrack than actual music. But when there is tense moments especially the last point of the last game of this season the soundtrack is so perfect I cant fault it.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nIf season 1 was about setting up it's main characters then season 2 was building up the array of secondary characters in it's roster, we know our main protagonists by now so the rest of the team get their time to shine. Two characters in particular stole the show when it came to fleshing out backstories and they were Ennoshita and Yamaguchi. \\n\\n\r\nFirst Ennoshita, when Daichi was injured in a *certain* match against a *certain* team Ennoshita had to come on as a replacement for him. You get to see the pressure he feels about being apart of the team (which he feels he is not) and what role does he play, he has little confidence in himself and it was great to see the show delve into this, he didn't feel as though he was good enough and lost sight of his interest. But when he gets into it hes just as great as a character as Daichi is in his own unique way. \\n\\n\r\nSecond is Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi is a similar case to Ennoshita he lacks confidence in himself, but in that *certain* match he embraced the role of decoy serving it was kinda funny to watch if I'm honest. You get to see flashbacks of training sequences which brought him to where he is now, again another perfect example of how good Haikyuu!! is at fleshing out all of their characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the thing I've always loved about Haikyuu is the way in which each character has a drive, they have problems that they each need to overcome and work well mixing different characters together when you're least expecting it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nFrom my ratings you'll be able to tell I absolutely love this series and hold very high on my list of greats, if you love sports anime this is definitely a must watch. Some of the characters including Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka are so memorable you'll instantly fall in love with them. \\n\\n\r\nGreat sports play (you'll actually learn something about volleyball) Great action sequences, great character interactions, a story that has you gripped and hilarious comedy\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this show more.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is a short review of the whole series.\r\nIf somebody were to ask me what is the most important aspect of a show I'd say it's the characters. If asked why, I'd give as an example Haikyuu!!\r\nThe story of a bunch of high school kids playing volleyball sounds boring and uninteresting- and it really is. However, why do I love this show so much? Because of the characters. Once you really start caring about them, everything they feel- you feel it too. Their passion, their insecurities, their sadness and, of course, their happiness. And everything that is important to them- is important to youas well. Yes, this show is about a bunch of high school boys playing volleyball- but, trust me, you\u2019re going to feel every second of the volleyball games like you\u2019re the one who poured all his/her passion it.\\n\r\nYou are probably curious to find out why am I saying the characters are so great- what\u2019s so special about them? Well, couldn\u2019t really say it\u2019s something special- it\u2019s their relatability, personalities and the way they are portrayed. Each and every individual has one trait which makes them likeable: Hinata\u2019s undying love and passion for a sport in which he has a major disadvantage- and his overflowing ambition to become great despite his shortcomings, Kageyama\u2019s willingness to change his rough personality in order to fit in better with the team, Nishinoya\u2019s amazing enthusiasm, team spirit and willingness to not give up, Daichi\u2019s amazing leadership which keeps the team together - and the list could go on.\\n\r\nI also mentioned how incredibly relatable these characters are. In Haikyuu!!, there\u2019s always this feeling that the characters are starting from the bottom- that they are in no way great but they are working their hardest, doing their best and are feeling the same nervousness a normal person would feel if they were in their situation. I love how they put a lot of focus on some character\u2019s lack of self confidence (which for me personally is as relatable as possible), on their fear of losing, on the pressure of living up to their own expectations and on the disappointment in themselves when they make a mistake. In Haikyuu!!, you always have your fingers crossed for the characters to succeed the techniques they plan on doing cuz you saw how hard they worked and how much they want wish to able to do them. However, you do seem them fail a lot. And when they succceed- it makes you feel so damn happy and proud.\\n\r\nYes, Haikyuu!! is by no means a dark or serious show- it\u2019s a light-hearted, at times funny and endearing story that will have you feeling happy, excited and sometimes nervos thanks to our loveable characters.\\n\r\nEnding note: this was my first ever review- hope it wasn't too bad.\\n",

            "content": "Normally I start off by saying for whom a series is a good choice or a bad choice but, in Haikyuu's case I already reviewed the first season, and since I thought that the second season was executed better and I enjoyed it more than its first, I'll talk a bit about what improved and some of the things that stayed the same. If you didn't watch the first season and you're just curious about how Haikyuu is at its peak, you could read this review, but note that I speak about the more glaring issues I had with the series in my previous reviewfor it. In this one I'll mostly focus on how things changed for the better or stayed relatively the same.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main factors that have caused me to enjoy the series more this season was a result of the fact that the series didn't have to introduce anymore entry pieces and could focus mostly on what I'm watching this series for, the sport. Rather than focus on the drama of the players before the team gets created and how they try to fit with one another, the team is already together, the only thing left is progressively improving it and polishing each character individually. And that's what this season focuses mostly on. Character moments and interesting matches. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu always put a lot of focus into its characters, don't get me wrong, the first season literally starts by focusing on how the characters come together and their mentality, however, what it doesn't do particularly well early on is the sport. It takes its time to get to what's entertaining about the sport and how it works in order to entrance the viewer by making sure we understand the characters. And since we already understand the characters...\\n\\n\r\nIt will instead put equal focus into the sport, teaching us and the players new techniques and new strategies, as well as introduce new people with different skillsets to spice things up. And as new strategies and techniques are introduced, there's just as many different mindsets and mini character arcs introduced in a fashion that complement each other well, without feeling like the problems the characters encountered are taking away from OUR OWN enjoyment of the sport itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series, the volleyball, finally feels like a proper battle of wits where the team has to use the skills they have honed to perform the most ingenious plays they can in order to win. I can wholeheartedly say that the matches this season were very entertaining and they do fit the description I've just given.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there's something that didn't really dissapear. And that's the overinvolvement of some characters where it borders melodrama when they react to a negative event. It did somewhat diminish, but I think it's a result of the narrative thread taken rather than an improvement in writing, and there's still some events where you're like \"Why does that matter THAT much to you?\" or \"Why do you have to yell, seriously, you could wait a little bit more and say that casually.\" \\n\\n\r\nThere's hardly any reservation in the actions and reactions of characters to most events, but note that it isn't as ridiculous as I might've possibly have made it sound. I'll try explaining it through giving an example of one arc a character went through, and if you wanna go blind on how things will go in the series, you can skip this paragraph, but trust me, this is just one out of many, so, keep that in mind when deciding, but it's also one of the ones that was more in focus, so what I'm continuing with in this paragraph is a spoiler even if I won't be specific, so also keep track of this fact. So there's this character who's rather reserved and doesn't really want to get into volleyball. You see, the train of thought and the events that influenced him are explained rather well and make sense, basically a person that he looked up to was lying about the fact that he was the best player in a team and then eventually he found out that was a lie and saw that being overlyinvolved in something may cause you to respond in a shameful way when things don't work out and wonders if that level of dedication is worth it if that's how you'll behave if you fail. How do you think he got over this? How do you think he decided to change his ways? Is it by being shown that when you succeed, you'll enjoy what you're doing and take pride in it and that's an addicting feeling? Sure, there's someone that does plant that little seed there, sure. Is it by understanding that an overorgolious ego is a bad thing? No. Is it by understanding that most things that are worth experiencing may cause you to experience shame? No. But what then? A dude goes like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! in his face, he says cool, and then he gets over it. Well, while there is more to it than that, when an interesting character gets solved with a dude screaming about highschool volleyball, I can't help but be somewhat dissapointed at the blown out of proportion reaction due to overinvolvement.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't read the previous paragraph, what it boils down to is well done and articulated characterization with a hint of overblown emotion to spin it in the right direction where you might occasionally scratch your head or look in the other direction for a few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. The series didn't really weaken in any aspect as it went on, the animation is still consistent and well detailed, the sound of the series seems to be in better sync than in the previous season, overall, it genuinely feels like a better series.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately this season of Haikyuu featured interesting matches that were consistently entertaining and always bringing something new to the table, characterization that was always welcomed on screen rather than snatching some of the spotlight for the sport itself, albeit sometimes still overlydramatic, but definitely better in terms of that than its preceding season. It turned Haikyuu from an ok show for me to a good one. If you're looking for the same things as me from a sports series, the end result was good for me.",

Train towards victory and fly all the way to the top of the powerhouses! With a jump and a hit that gets past the blockers, Season 2 of Haikyuu!! wondered the crowd with a new exciting entertainment.\r\nContinuing where Season 1 left off, the black and orange team that we all came to love returned back, boasting a determination ever stronger than before. This season is packed with all the training and practice goodness that they needed in order to survive against the skilled opponents in their journey.A handful of new characters were introduced too, but this did presented some issues that affected the plot. While we were treated with backstories that expanded on the characters, the amount and timing disrupted the suspense that were generated, essentially losing that buildup that hyped you up. It canceled each other out so it's kind of a win-lose situation where a bit too much of one thing slightly ruined the other factor. Another minor gripe I had was the repetition of volleyball plays in a few episodes to the point where it can be boring. But they didn't drew me away from the interactions between the characters. Their realistic approach to winning and losing was a refresher, leading to great development of themselves. Like before, no one was really left out, having their own fair go being in the spotlight of inspiration. It was awesome seeing how each team has their own unique playstyle, and the matches to prove how much improvements they made over the months to be in the court with opponents led to new tricks, trusts and teamworks that awed an nonathletic person like me. And the comedy. There weren't as much as before but the ones that did appeared got me chuckled.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art style, Haikyuu!! have this unique way of visualization where it contained a lot more lines in their design, particularly in the shadows or during fast moments. It's not particularly flashy or special but the simplicity perfectly fitted the characters and volleyball actions. One other related thing I've noticed during the course of this season was in the expressions of the characters. Their eyes evoked a lot of strong feelings, looking intently at the ball during moments of high concentration. You just know that they won't let that ball touch the ground, making them so much more impressive in the court. The animation was pretty fluid at most times, however, there were scenes where it looked sluggish and failed to delivered the energy from the athleticism of the characters. Those times made them looked quite lazy in fact, which was contrary to what they are as volleyball players. Thankfully, the slow-mo scenes were breathtaking to watch and was as splendid as ever showing off the shots. And for the sounds, the opening and ending themes were pleasant to hear. I'm not sure how to explain it but they have this underlying atmosphere that captured the moral of 'training to become stronger'. As usual, each soundtracks, especially the epic ones, were composed beautifully to go along with their respective moments. Amplifying the 'oomph' of a powerful shot or conveying the disappointment and regrets from losing, the OSTs did a wonderful job. Nothing much to say about the voice-acting other than they also did really well throughout every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThere are moments out there when you realized you're witnessing something profoundly great and new. These small period of times can change your perspective, and the many characters of Haikyuu!! felt this, increasing their passion for volleyball. Apply this to myself and pretty much the same thing happened. Having no interest in sports created second thoughts before watching this anime, but I'm glad I picked it up because now I know that I can add 'Sports' as a genre to look out for.",

            "content": "The second season of the smash-hit sports anime, Haikyuu!! S2 continues the trend of greatness set forth by its predecessor. With stronger character development, a solid (but predictable) plot, various stellar songs, and consistent art, I can see why this is so highly rated on MAL.\r\n[Story - 7]\r\nThis season follows the Karasuno team's efforts to grow stronger and make a comeback after suffering a narrow defeat at the hands of Aoba Johsai. The first half follows their rigorous training program, both at their own gym and at the 2 training camp sessions hosted by rival schools, and the second half follows their effortsin the Spring High Preliminaries. \\n\\n\r\nThanks to the hook of the finale for last season, the first half of S2 starts out strong and definitely provides entertainment in both drama and comedy. The latter half, however, is....not that strong. Perhaps it's due to the inevitable plot armour around Karasuno, but it doesn't really surprise anyone. The moments of drama aren't really /that/ dramatic if you're genre-savvy, but they do provide a nice break from the constant tension in each game. I still enjoyed this half nonetheless thanks to the pay-off from the first half, but your mileage will vary, of course.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe art hasn't really improved, but neither has it dropped in quality. There's still a lot of consistently strong character design (especially in regards to new characters such as 'Mad Dog' and Bokuto), but some animations are DEFINITELY still being re-used. That being said, I've also noted that they introduced a multitude of new ones, so I'm pleased to see that at least they put more effort there.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 9]\\n\\n\r\nThe SFX haven't changed as well (naturally), save for some new additions to complement new moves. Still pretty solid here.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus keep up the good work, as is expected. Shout-out goes to Yamaguchi's, Yachi's, and Chikara's for injecting TONS of emotion into their characters when given the chance. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has somehow gotten even better: While there are songs from last season that appear, there are even MORE songs now!!! Probably expected by everyone else, but I was so happy to hear them play. The new OPs and EDs are AMAZING, especially for the second half. \\n\\n\r\n[Character - 8]\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization has definitely gotten better this time around! Thanks to the developments from both the S1 finale and the first half of S2, everyone on Karasuno goes through some type of development arc that is rather satisfying to see. My personal favourite was Tsukishima's, as he went from someone who was...Just There for snarkiness to a well-rounded character/player that shows considerable promise. Another arc to note is Yamaguchi's, as we get to see how he handles his failures and grows from them to become a valuable pinch server to the team. All in all, everyone on the Karasuno team got really good writing, and the ending they got for this season felt well-earned.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters, however, may not be so fortunate. Since there were multiple schools introduced in the Training and SHP arcs, of course some underdevelopment happened. But like last time, there were a few surprises: Hitoka Yachi, the new Karasuno VBC Manager, brings the cuteness AND gets a small arc dedicated to her; Johzenji High School goes through the challenge of finally figuring out a good playstyle; and Tooru Oikawa has to bring out his best to face his rival, Kageyama, on equal ground. Some characters still remain underdeveloped, like the other staff behind the Karasuno VBC and ace spiker Ushijima, but again, perhaps next season will bring them their due development.\\n\\n\r\nOne other notable flaw, however, is melodrama. It was expected, since this IS a sports anime, but.....come on. It just gets really ridiculous sometimes. I hope they tone it down in S3. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 9/8]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this second season was a BLAST to experience. It was so much fun to revisit the growing pains of Karasuno, and the beginnings of their labour bearing fruit, along with seeing the many new faces introduced throughout these arcs. If you loved the first season, you'll definitely love this season!\\n",

The story is nothing new and very common story gets a 5.\r\nNow for the art & sound, not bad but not great somewhere in the middle the art & sound gets a 7.

In the anime they'll have one team perform amazingly, while the opposing team is failing hard.  turns out the opposing team is only losing by 1 point 21-22.  that's some bullshit.  \r\nIn another game the crows kick ass.turns out they were only winning by 8 points.  that's pretty lame considering the others guys gave up early on and we didn't even see them score a single point.  \\n\r\nThe show did not get me cheering out loud like I did while watching eyeshield 21... with no prior interest in football either.",

            "content": "The second season of Haikyuu!! was truly amazing. I love this anime and it is one of my favourites. The first season ended with a bit of a sad one but the second season is where they pick themselves back up and grow even stronger as a team. It was so intense and yet the humor and comedy that was included just made it perfect. I laughed all the time while watching it. I LOVE this anime and I recommend it to anyone who is into comedic anime with average main characters that are determined to win and are slowly thriving to being the best.They have the ups and downs but thats what makes this anime amazing. If you watch the first episdoe of season one then watch somewhere in season 2, you will see the huge difference between the characters and how they have grown. I'm attached to this anime and it's one anime that I will always love.",

            "content": "Continuing the flow from my review on Haikyuu!!... I'd say that this season picks up really well from where the first season left off. Similar to how I started that review I'd say this season is where the flock of crows start to work themselves into that \"polished diamond\" that they never were in the first place. \r\nAdmittedly I don't think they got there in this season either but I'll be damned if there wasn't a lot of improvements and new \"tricks\" added that they \"borrow\" from some of the other schools that were in the intensive training camp.\r\nI like to think of this seasonas being pretty much split in two and I liked the way it was done. For the vast majority of the first half of the season we see Karasuno being whipped into shape in the gym. As that's happening we do actually get to see some individual character development both inside and outside the gym. I personally think they did well with it overall. We even got to see small bits into Nekoma and Fukurodani. Some of the best comedy of the season came from little scenes involving a mix of players from either of the teams which I appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the season comes to a conclusion pretty much with the ending of the training camp and if the lack of intensity gets to you then rest assured there's enough in the last half to satisfy and then some.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly liked all of the games in the second half of this season a ton. I think a big reason why I can say that is that I didn't forget one big thing here... There is the SHOUNEN tag attached to this Anime along with Sports and Comedy. There are some things that we just have to take along with us for the ride because it is also a shounen... I also happen to think they do more than a good job going into the thoughts of the players during the matches while the ball is in motion or there is a stop in play momentarily. I think I can enjoy that aspect of this franchise because while it might not always be realistic, that's okay! This is a work of fiction, some stuff can be exaggerated. While it might be a little over the top sometimes, even though I've never played volleyball in my life, I can really imagine an actual person thinking some of that stuff to himself in mid rally that they do.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the soundtrack to this Anime was great and shockingly enough it was the second season when I really started to notice. I didnt even realize they used quite a few tracks over from the first season in the second season. The only reason I noticed at all was because of my re-watch of the franchise. The way they used snippets of a lot of the tracks in the volleyball games during the second half really brought everything out I think. Which is why I really latched onto the music in the second season and not the first.\\n\\n\r\nI believe this was a fine continuation of the franchise. I still think this a worthwhile franchise for anyone to watch as an introduction to the sports genre. If you can take some stuff with a grain of salt I think youll end up loving it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this lengthy one. As always I hope it was a good read.",

            "content": "Art 9/10: It is great, especially the actions during the critical moments in the game. However, it doesn't WOW me like the best in class.\r\nSound 8/10: Very good voice acting, good sound effective during actions, good music that help bring out emotions and some of the op and ed songs are great. However, there is no sound track that are memorable. Can't give it a higher score.\r\nCharacter 8/10: There are many very different characters. Most of them are real and believable. However, most characters are stereotypes and there is not much development.\r\nStory 7/10: Overall this is a pretty straight forward plot with some twists. However,the pacing is a bit slow until the last 4-5 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: Episode 23 and 24 are amazing 10/10. There are other moments that are great.  But outside of those, it was just good, 7/10. Overall 8.\\n\\n\r\nIn my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a 7/10 show in my mind. Good overall, I may rewatch some episodes but I won't go out of my way to do it.",
