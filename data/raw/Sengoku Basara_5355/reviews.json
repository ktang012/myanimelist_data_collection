            "content": "Story.\r\nIt's very simple and easy to understand, it's far from being complex and it doesn't try to be. Characters are introduced in a battle with minimal background information.\r\nHowever, the timesetting and some of the elements that appear are a bit odd but they were added to make it look even better. You shouldn't think of this as a historical anime or you won't like it.\r\nArt.\r\nI liked the art, it looked nice, and the effects used during combat scenes added an extra touch to it.\r\nSound.\r\nIntro and endings were nice and I was never once disturbed by the background music meaning they did a good job. Usethe music to magnify the events that are taking place and focus your attention on that and not on the music playing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nI have no idea how well they match the historical people that they were based on but each was interesting in its own way. Also the fact that while they all liked and respected each other, they still fought each other was something refreshing. They somewhat match the general idea one would have from that time. And some of them were given elements from the current time to amplify their personality. Like date's horse that looked like a motorcycle, the yakuza like army...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nThe whole show wasn't made to improve your knowledge of that time or anything like that. It was made for pure enjoyment. If you like some epic battles without complex background information and such, this might be the show for you. Since the series is only 12 episodes long, the story doesn't have time for sidestories, detailed backgrounds,.. I liked this series so much because I could just watch and enjoy without having to think over some things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nI liked the series, If you want a good short action serie. This is your thing. Don't be fooled by the historical tag, It might've been based on that but I wouldn't study for a history exam with this or you will fail. If you ever liked bleach, naruto,.. but you hated the fillers, the dramatic flashbacks in the past to explain something and just wished they'd get on with the battle. Then watch this for a few hours of simple enjoyment.",

            "content": "Preface: I have not played the game this is based on, nor am I a major in Japanese history, if you feel either or both are required to \u201cget\u201d this series, so be it.\r\nSengoku Basara is yet another action anime series taking place in ancient Japan that is targeted at young teen males, almost insultingly so. I don\u2019t normally review shows at all, much less after only watching 2 episodes, but in this case, I felt it was my obligation as a member of the human race to try to stop people from making the same mistake I did, watching 2 episodes of this crap.\r\nStory:1\\n\r\nHuh there is a story? There is no obvious overall story or plot of any kind. Characters have no motivation to do anything from the story. Just because you\u2019re in ancient Japan, doesn\u2019t mean you can just ignore the story and say \u201ceveryone is fighting, that is the story!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nArt is in general is good. Then you might ask why I gave it a 6 and not higher? It is because often in battle the artwork severely degrades and at times looks more like two people throwing neon paint at each other more than it does two people fighting. You can show various types of super powers without just splashing bright colors randomly together so that is NO excuse at all. I personally found it funny how after the first episode some of the higher ups apparently watched the show Noein (a significantly better show by the way) and for the second episode decided to copy the same style of art where in battle the drawing of the characters becomes less detailed and more basely furious. I wasn\u2019t really a huge fan of that in Noein though either and Neoin did it better and had other elements vastly superior (hello Sengoku Basara, I\u2019d like you to meet my friend story) to make it so I didn\u2019t care about it so much. Sengoku Basara NEEDS to take a lesson from shows like Berserk or Claymore that showcase both above human fighting (a lot above in Claymore\u2019s case) without turning in neon paint tag.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing especially good, bad or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nNone of the characters have any character. For one, the show moves around so much that you don\u2019t really feel attached to any one character as \u201cThe Main Character\u201d and the ones that are shown the most screen time also have dialog that seems to have been designed to make you hate them. Yukimura Sanada is probably the closest thing to a main character the series has, but sadly, his dialog is split between a doglike (literally) devotion to Takeda Shingen and some of the worst C grade Samurai movie honor banter I have ever seen. Then we have a female assassin who has some sort of puppy love for her lord, some six sword wielding lord who has to be constantly held back by his friend because his character contains nothing deeper than \u201cBATTLE BATTLE BATTLE\u201d and of course Yukimura Sanada\u2019s lover/owner who has the same C grade Samurai movie lines and is the most stereotypical Japanese Feudal lord ever in the history of animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you missed the hint, the characters are one dimensional and their dialog might as well not exist for all the good it does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI was trying to force myself to watch a 3rd episode in the hopes of it getting better, but the fact that I couldn\u2019t shows very well how much enjoyment I took out it. The battles were dull and lacked any detail while the dialog made me want to travel back in time to kill the characters they were supposedly based on so that the world would never have to know this travesty.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show is bad. There is no other way for me to put it. People talk about how it is \u201cmanly\u201d, \u201cGarr\u201d and other crap, but what you have is a show targeted at very young teens in much the same light as Dragon Ball Z or narutu that is simply of poor quality. If you want to watch a \u201cmanly\u201d show, watch berserk or something else that is actually good.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many areas of this anime that are severely under what one would call decent and there is also nothing to make up for those missing areas. My recommendation is you don\u2019t watch this unless you\u2019re looking for Dragon Ball Z: Japanese Feudal Era.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is a sh\u014dnen anime set during the Sengoku Jidai, or \u2018Warring States period\u2019 of Japanese history, and is based on Capcom\u2019s Playstation 2 video game Devil Kings (known as Sengoku Basara in Japan). It should be noted that Sengoku Basara is a world away from the period it draws its inspiration from \u2013 it's not historically accurate by any means. That said, a few features associated with the period, such as the rivalry between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin, and the Oda clan\u2019s use of firearms, are present. The characters, for the most part, are all taken from the era, although the mannerin which they are presented is obviously highly fictionalized. \\n\\n\r\nSengoku Basara is a fairly typical tale of good versus evil. Initially it may not seem so simple, as we are presented with many factions fighting for control over Japan. Eventually though, they come together to fight a common enemy; namely, Oda Nobunaga. As in Capcom\u2019s Onimusha franchise, he is presented as some sort of demon. Overall, the story certainly isn't anything to write home about.  Spanning a total of 12 episodes, the series does a decent job of wrapping things up within its time limit, although it can feel rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell from the poster, there are a lot of characters in Sengoku Basara. For an anime of its length, this isn\u2019t something that works to its advantage. Perhaps inevitably, character development is not one of its strong points, and this is one area where the anime can seem rushed. This is a shame, as we are introduced to several interesting characters such as Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika, the so called 'Demon of Onigashima', only for them to receive almost no screen time whatsoever (other than as forgettable reinforcements during the final battle). Equally disappointing is the fact that some of the characters that do feature heavily aren't given any significant fights of their own. You may find yourself waiting for a confrontation between a pair of characters, only to be disappointed when it never happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a varied bunch, with Date Masamune being perhaps the most interesting. Arrogant with the strength to back it up and full of ridiculous one liners like \u2018put ya guns on!\u2019, it\u2019s no surprise that he has been likened to Dante, the protagonist of Capcom\u2019s Devil May Cry franchise. He also incorporates English into his speech, which is refreshing. Other characters, however, don't fare as well. Listening to Yukimura as he constantly reminds us that he\u2019s burning with passion, for example, can quickly become tiresome. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime set during times of war, it's no surprise that most of the enjoyment from this series comes from its many over-the-top action sequences: one swing of an axe causing a tornado; a robot samurai with a jet pack and a massive drill for a weapon; and so on.  \\n\\n\r\nOne final thing to note about Sengoku Basara (for you blood and gore enthusiasts) is that the violence is pretty modest - even by sh\u014dnen standards. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any deaths! Of course, if this sort of stuff doesn't bother you in the slightest, you'll be fine. \\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting presentation of the Warring States period. If you know a thing or two about the period, you're likely to squeeze more enjoyment out of it (unless historical inaccuracies put you off).\\n\\n\r\n+/- Series is short in length but has a large, varied cast of characters. As a result, character development isn't a highlight.\\n\\n\r\n- A few annoying characters that you'll have to tolerate (subjective, depending on what you're definition of annoying is).\\n\\n\r\n+/- Rather modest levels of violence.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sengoku Basara is OK. Some of its characters may be annoying, character development isn\u2019t great, and the final confrontation arguably leaves much to be desired. However, I'm sure many will find it entertaining. Generally speaking, if you think the idea of a guy wielding six swords simultaneously (only two hands!) is just plain awesome, you should probably give this one a try.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10 (Reasonable)",

            "content": "Have you guys ever played Samurai Warriors, or at least Dynasty Warriors? This anime is the adaptation from one of Capcom Game called Sengoku Basara. One part of Sengoku Basara that sticks out from these kinds of games are their SUPER UBER OVER STRENGTH!\r\nInstead of just seeing a \"slash, slash, dash, blow!\" we'll see \"draw six swords at once, super speed, slash of EXPLOSION!\" For more information about people in the game type in \"Sengoku Period/Sengoku Basara\" in wiki for better understanding why \"this\" or \"that\" happened in the story.\r\nStory: 7\r\n Easy starting, we started in a battlefeild scence, then there comes the main character,then the fight, then the talk, then the fight. Think of it as \"What do you think will happen when you're in war\", the story just goes like that and I think (for people who played the game) the story won't change much from the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\n Art is Awesome! The fighting scene is really SUPER HUMAN, but it draws you to watch it until the end even though it seems so unrealistic. The backgrounds pictures (grass, building) was done very good and not complaints in that. One weak point is that sometimes the art goes into \"I'm GONNA spin myself 180 degrees without moving\" style, which makes the art look too much Inhuman.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n The OP \"Jap\" really does go with the anime and the ED is also the same. Since it's a action kind of anime you can expect good sounds from the fighting scene. Their sounds draw you to watch the scence more and more and their OST does go with \"what is happening\" in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n There is not much good point about their Character here. There's a BAD GUY, two almost good guys, Bad Guy armies, Good guy armies and they will fight each other...that's all. One good part about their character (which adapted from the game) was how usually the nickname of the generals sometimes go along with their looks and behavior (e.g. \"The Tiger of Kai\" of Shingen Takeda we'll see him wearing a tiger look-alike cloth with superb power and leadership\")\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n For an action anime, this series does give a lot of enjoyment. Even though they're not much story to follow, but the \"Maliness\" and the Over Human fighting scene will kept you on your chair and made you watch it until it finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n Too bad that this series does not have any creativity at all. Since it was an adaptation from the game PLUS most of us will know the story already it will pull away our interest in watching Sengoku Basara a lot! However, it's still kinda interesting to see how will they adapt the game into an anime without ruining the story.",

One of these lords called the devil king of the sixth heaven, note that he's a DEVIL king of the sixth HEAVEN this alone should keep you away from this anime, gained enough power to pose a real threat to the other lords as he ravaged all the lands that stood against him and also the lands that were his allies. Basically this is one crazy devil king of the sixth heaven. \r\nThe thing is, he is depicted asan evil lord doing evil things in this time of evil, but everyone else are the same. They all want to fight eachother and some of the \"good\" guys actually look forward to fighting eachother for no apparent reason other than that they respect eachother, atleast the devil king of the sixth heaven does it for his own perverse enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have been able to think that was cool, you might have been able to think any of the characters were cool, if they had possessed anything worthy of being called cool. They were all overplayed, not your regular overplayed, this was really bad. The producers insult the viewers and furthermore insult the main target audience which in this case would be shounen (teenage boys).\\n\\n\r\nI've seen this anime been compared to TTGL. This is an abomination of epic proportions. Where TTGL knows how to play the characters for maximum entertainment this anime fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the art and animations were good. Some of the fight scenes were well made and for this it retained some entertainment value which saved it from a rating of below 5.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a short shounen that insults you with its characters but tries to entertain you with fairly well made scenes of fighting then you should definitely watch Sengoku BASARA, if you want a good samurai/historical anime go watch Samurai Champloo.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is a relatively modern anime series created by Production I.G, and is based on the series of videogames of the same name in Japan. Despite some historical accuracy as pertaining to the key battles in the Sengoku period, the series takes many departures from the trappings of the period and introduces many outlandish elements, an example being Honda, a gigantic mechanical soldier introduced roughly halfway through the series. This over-the-top approach to Japanese history, however, does not exactly result in a work of great praise. (Note that I myself have not played any of the Sengoku Basara games, so this review is onlybased off the anime series itself, I have no bias towards the series itself)\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline and plot development of Sengoku Basara is barely worth mentioning \u2013 it is barely developed whatsoever, and the skimming over of the events of the period made trying to follow such an unexplained story fairly confusing for someone like me, who does not know much about the events of the Sengoku Period themselves. It becomes obvious that the bare threads of story only serve to connect the fights of the series, and this in turn contributes to the rushed feeling of the series itself. The basic time-worn concept of good vs. evil presents the main plot of the series, a very stereotypical goal for the demographic. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters for the series is quite large, surprising considering the fairly short length of the series itself, and because of this large cast/short series imbalance, character development is practically paper thin. Some characters only show up for one episode or so before being offed, or in some cases, only appear for two or three moments in the series, despite being seemingly interesting characters (prime suspects for this being Mouri Motonari and Chousokabe Motochika, the latter only being revealed at the end of the series and basically has around 5 minutes of screentime in total). Also, opposite to the above point, several characters that are featured prominently in the series have barely any interesting fight scenes or development whatsoever (prime examples being Sarutobi Sasuke and Kasuga). This presents a very \u2018half-finished\u2019 view on the character development of the series, which is never a good thing. Despite this, however, there are some characters that are developed more than others, such as Date Masamune or Yukimura Sanada, for example, but these characters still are not developed very much, and their dialogue mostly delves into a sea of predictable phrases later on in the series. Interactions between characters are fairly unremarkable, unless they are fighting between each other, and many of the \u2018gags\u2019 that occur throughout the series (such as Yukimura\u2019s exchanges with Takeda Shingen, or Kasuga\u2019s interaction with Uesugi Kenshin) are very repetitive and don\u2019t really add much whatsoever, they just end up being fairly silly and irritating as time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nIt is clear from the very first episode that the primary focus of Sengoku Basara is with its action scenes, something which the war-time setting caters to greatly. However, many battles simply degrade into one of the main characters using some kind of absurdly powerful attack to tear through legions of nameless weak soldiers, and this does become repetitive quickly. Despite this, the majority of the battles take place between the main protagonists and antagonists of the series themselves, and these battles can sometimes be fairly fun to watch, but most delve into the limitless vault of shonen series tropes such as powering up/energy blasts etc., which really hampers the uniqueness of the fights, even if interesting elements are involved.\\n\\n\r\nVisual direction of the series is quite well done, the fight scenes are fluid and transition well, and generally in itself the animation is quite detailed. Frequent splashes of colour and sketching effect are used very liberally throughout the series, to highlight the flashy special moves that the characters exhibit, which is somewhat interesting at first but is not particularly explored. There is a surprising lack of blood, even for a shonen series of this kind, which does make the battles somewhat disappointing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAudio wise the series does not present a particularly memorable soundtrack, most of the series\u2019 background music consists of either stereotypically created hard rock tracks for the fight scenes or somewhat traditional sounding music for the scenes that were not taken up by fighting, which is not very many whatsoever. The opening and ending themes are also fairly unmemorable rock pieces which contributed to the series\u2019 tone itself in principle, but really were not notable in any other merit.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sengoku Basara is a very average and overrated series. A lack of coherent story beyond an excuse for characters to fight, poor overall character development due to a large cast and not enough screentime, subpar and derivative action sequences with too much incessant energy blasts/special attacks, a fairly unremarkable soundtrack and a lack of veritable historical accuracy for the period translates to a measly 5/10. Some may find this entertaining as merely a baseless and flashy piece of media, but these features should not be treated as compliments.\\n",

            "content": "When I first noticed that this anime existed it piqued my interest. i remember playing the game Devil Kings for ps2 (game that the characters are copied from then replicated into this anime) and I recalled the somewhat enjoyable times playing the game with a friend, i must say that my experiences thus far with this anime is falling quite short to my expectations.\r\nStory:  Takes place in war-torn feudal Japan, in times of warring feudal lords all struggling for power. Sounds like a great historical anime right? well.... you'd be wrong. Its got a \"modern\" flare thrown in. and by modern i am referringto the presence of guns or crazy weapons or the Tank guy with a jet pack; Honda.  This anime focuses on throwing the viewer into overly-epic (to the point of disgust) battles, while the overall story (which there isnt really that much of one) is more or less thrown to the side.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Quite nice artwork actually: Vibrant colours, crisp artwork, and i rather enjoyed the few seconds worth of frames that revert to a more sketch-like portrayal of events.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I quite Dislike the opening. I am a fan of most of Abingdon Boys school's other songs but this one just irked me. wasnt a fan of the ending but it seemed to fit more or less the theme of the series. Good seiyu, but way too many over the top cliched english lines. Every time something was said in english i cringed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Basically the characters look more or less exact compared to the ps2's image of them. so i guess theres no place for complaint there, however each personality is way too far over the top. every character (at least the males) tend to be over the top GAR and it just gets to a point where it is hard to watch. personalities are stretched to no longer believable levels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well i had high hopes for this series, perhaps that is why I am quite let down with it now. about halfway into the second episode i couldnt stand it. now I am trying to complete the series based on spite.  If you were just looking for a series with a bunch of fighting scenes, weak dialogue which you really don't need to pay attention to, and extreme cleavage (I think she shows up pretty early) then this may be for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I personally just want it to be over. Im scared to see how a second season could be made from this. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Cutting out the whole summary and introductions, Sengoku Basara is a story of seemingly epic proportions squeezed into a very small time-frame as far as the series goes (being 12 episodes). Taking bits and pieces of history, twisting it a nudge and completely blowing it out of proportion, you get a kind of Gurren Lagann feeling. By that, I mean that the story just increases in its grandeur up until quite a climax at the ending. \r\nHowever, the storyline is not without its faults. In its twelve-episode lifespan, you get characters galore, yet little to no character development whatsoever. What I feel is a kindof minor setback is that for the viewer to get the most out of the anime he/she must be at least acquainted with the Sengoku period. However, it still manages a comprehensible storyline that, while often times easy to decipher, still makes you interested to see the outcome until the end. It definitely feels rushed, and it was kind of expected. The ending, while good, gave me a feeling of \"That was it?\" But admittedly, I would be lying if I said I wasn't satisfied, especially after seeing the credits at the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Sengoku Basara is what I'd consider to be at least above average, though people may say that it is about as good as any other shounen series, but to that I say: xP The combination of high-action scenes with clearly super-human capabilities, combined with the sheer amount of bodies flying about as well as a touch of 3D here and there and you'll know where a good portion of the budget went. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very, well, manly. It sets itself up as an anime where there will always be some form of inspiration or epicness, and that is definitely prominent in this show. With beautiful works such as dai roku tenma ou to give you that sense of dread and fear for the protagonists and the absolutely inspiring vocal cues of BLAZE -Crimson Lotus- (especially its full, final version), it's definitely one of the parts of the show that really pull it off the ground, if not at least its saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit cliche, but for series based on a fighting game, that was to be expected. You will always have your naive, young protagonist (Yukimura), the cool, calm, collected, yet human rival (Masamune), a master/father figure (Takeda), and your all-evil, all-powerful enemy (ODA NOBUNAGA!!! (yes, you have to say it like that)). Oh, and don't forget the ninjas, other lords, the vagabond, the other soldiers, enemies, retainers, but to be more specifically, the Date 4 (you'll see what I mean). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sengoku Basara is the kind of anime you would watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. Like Gurren Lagann, it isn't something you ponder over, and like Gurren Lagann, it does try to make a more serious storyline, which is eventually thrown out the window (perhaps not as radically?) and brought back to what its good at: Old-fashioned Blades, Guns, and Explosions. It's an anime that is there to make you feel good, and make you feel like you want to be awesome, and in that respect, it succeeded, giving it an overall score of 8. Sure it may not be for those who want a serious amount of storyline and character development, but it is definitely worth at least watching, and for those who like watching anime for the sheer thrill of fighting, you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Ok ' here we go ' [ date copyright ]\r\nSO...Sengoku BASARA review.Note that this review is ANIME only , as it says , no connection to the games , cause personally I hate when people compare 2 things that have SOMETHING in common as if they should be identical twins. Well no..this anime is BASED on the game , so we should compare them separately.\r\nStory: Not something outta the ordinary , like a big BOMB etc but , heck , it doesn't even need to be that way.It's simple and clean , and still manages to be pure enjoyment , but you'll only understand whyif you watch it yourself.You probably met these characters in different forms in other media cause, Date Masamune,Sanada Yukimura,Sarutobi Sasuke,Oda Nobunaga etc really DID exist [ except most of them are bishons here ...yep..i'm a girl..:X ] So the story is 8/10 for me . Even if it wasn't something twisted it had the spice that I liked .\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: well, no flaw here.Production I.G. made it superb.You'll love it.One of the best things about this series [ + eye-candy for fangirls ]  10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another big 10/10.Sengoku BASARA OST is just EPIC.I'm not talking about what you hear in the background on the anime.You have to listen to RED and BLUE .It will definitely go to your taste.It is a beautiful combination between modern and traditional rhythm plus a lot of orchestral instruments that just sound amazing and beautiful .Some songs like BLAZE ~CRIMSON LOTUS ,mastermind ,ZIPANGU,Heaven's Door ,SHUT UP~GO TO HELL ,Peaceful Days and others don't even need vocals ,that's how nice they sound [ ok except that the main theme songs for characters have one song with just instrumental and the other featuring the character; example: Heaven's Door is an instrumental and Heaven's Door feat Date Masamune is the song with Date's voice in it [ yeah..fangirls candy ] Also some songs on the same notes but in different tonalities or different instruments sound superb and offer a different taste [ ex: that's part of being a hero ]\\n\r\nSo basically the OST is an absolute plus.Give it a try , you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Not very deep characters ,but heck , they don't even need to be deep to be cool . Date would get emo if he gets deep.He's just Date , and that makes him cooler than cool :)) Same goes for other characters.The way they interact and the way they are portrayed , cause they are individualized , is enough . 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series very much and can't wait for the OVA and season 2 .  Some people regard this series as a FAIL, because they try to compare it to the game , but i kinda punch those ppl in the face .This anime is still , as individual , something really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It gets a 10 from me.It's a series to watch when you don't feel like stressing your brain but still be able to watch something good.Simple and good, that's the recipe that describes Sengoku BASARA.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If anyone asked me what's my opinion about Sengoku Basara, I'd just tell 'em it is a pretty fun to watch anime, nothing more than that. Nothing really stands out, but that is not a bad thing if the product is consistent all throughout, and Sengoku Basara is pretty consistent. \r\nThere is nothing really spectacular about the plot and characters, it's another one of those shows that are set during the Sengoku Period in Japan (having Nobunaga Oda as the villain and all), having some of the actual generals and captains that were involved in those battles as characters in the story, but changing alot of it to make it more \"anime\" and digestible to the public, and as far as the characters here go, they basically kept only their names and affiliations, but again, that's not a bad thing.\\n\r\nSengoku Basara is the Dynasty Warriors anime that never came to life (maybe because the game it was based on plays so much like DW). Characters are one-dimensional war machines that can tear through waves of men as easily as they can shout their enemy's name or say \"MY LORD!\", and it's surely fun to see them interact. \\n\r\nFor the most part they're just talking to each other in order to get some exposition about the plot out or just explain the characters motivations, but here and there you'll see some fight scenes, and in my opinion the show is at it's best during these fights. Every fight in this anime is comparable to the fight between Superman and Zod in the new Superman movie, as in they don't really give a fuck about logic or collateral damage, just throwing everything they have at each other hoping it kills whoever is fighting, and it is glorious.\\n\r\nOther than the fight scenes and the characters, the show has some pretty good animation, nothing that will make you impressed, but nothing as bad as the latest episodes of Naruto. The same goes to the sound section of the anime, none of the songs are really catchy or worth listening to in your free time, but you'll probably not skip 'em until the latter episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION: If you're a selective type of guy or just doesn't have that much time to watch anime, than skip this if you don't have anything better to watch, but, if you're willing to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.\\n",

Always been pray for this day that BASARA must become the real anime after playing BASARA 2 Heroes with it anime cut scene, and Production I.G has finally deliver it!\r\nThe anime biggest weakness was none the other the story and some are complain about that. But from the start, BASARA doesn't even have a single decent story. Maybe i did play the game so i know. Is the same with the game, no need for historical explanation. The start of episodeone just gave you a short explanation what is going for a few minute and then is straight to the party. You may have to play the game or do some research to get a clear what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nAction? Yes, BASARA is all about action with some frenzy craziness in it, fast, explosive, and some un-normal trick or behaviour. Who knew you will find a mushroom cloud in it, able to climb siege wall with horse, or how about punching someone in the face with random reason? That's how the party goes.\\n\\n\r\nBASARA biggest star was his cast and seiyuu. You have all your favorite character from the game are animated here, and the original seiyuu voicing them in the game are here to reprise their role. Something is to be celebrate. But the down side is to many character, and some maybe fans favorite couldn't have enough time space to show off. And for some, the director were smart enough to reduce them; like getting kill in battle or something. Only remain some of the important key character like Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, Sarutobi Sasuke and to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of key character, i will be praise on the villian in BASARA. Oda Nobunaga, is one of the SOB i would say supremely well done in game and anime. And Matsunaga Hisahide who also appear only in BASARA 2 Heroes and only a few episode then died; again well done. Notorious and truely evil. The character personality didn't change at all. All of them are the same, Shingen always punching Yukimura for no reason, Masamune still have Dante like attitude, and blah blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are rocking good. The OP was done by Abbrigdon Boys School with Jap, they also did do the game OP of BASARA 2 Heroes and for this OP also on the PSP game Battle Heroes, and then the ED Break & Peace done by the band Dustz.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will like it because action, some will not like it because of the weak story. But is a great action anime you might enjoy for a while, and is one hell of the party you might enjoy it.",

            "content": "Note: This review covers my general thoughts on all three season of Sengoku Basara and the movie.\r\nSengoku Basara is a really fun and straight forward action series, with the most crazy and over the top action I have ever seen in anime. I don't want to go into spoilers, but the action is like a fusion of Dragon Ball Z, One Punch Man, and even  a little Gundam. So if you are looking for simple and bloody samurai style sword fights, this is not the show for you. However, if you are fan fan of crazy ridiculous and well animated action than Sengoku Basarais a treat. The show knows what it wants to be and doesn't try to be anything more. The characters are simple, but they are all charismatic, likable, fun, cool, or bad ass enough that I didn't mind their simplicity. If you are looking for an action show with a lot of complex characters and a riveting plot with lots of intricate twists and turns, then Sengoku Basara isn't the show you are looking for. However, if you are looking for a ridiculous and really fun adventure than Sengoku Basara is right up your alley. Plus the soundtrack is amazing and there are some really good villains as well.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Spoiler: The third season is just a retelling of the movie, but with some more story elements and characters to help fill the 12 episodes.",

Let's party!\" - that this is going to be good...\r\nMain Characters: Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura, Katakura Kojuurou, Sarutobi Sasuke\r\nStory: 8/10 - nothing deep, really... it's just about power struggle and uniting against one really evil ruler... i liked that they were able to give a background of the characters/rulers involved... at first i thought that the fight scenes were a little exaggerated since the closest samuraii know would be Kenshin Himura - he has his style but not like this... once the story progressed, i've learned to accept that these guys are not your normal samurais...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - love the details and the colors, though sometimes it got too dark and too bright... but then again, i guess it was needed in the scenes... fight scenes are there but what we will usually see are blue and red lightning-like-streaks... i'm not complaining...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - now i'm not sure how this goes - rock 'n roll maybe? i liked it from the first time i heard it... OP/ED are very catchy... gotta love those dancing samurais in the background... BG music here really helps the scenes...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 - bias again? of course! Masamune reminded me of my fave character Hijikata Toshiro and I think i like him just as much... from his motorcycle-like horse to his penchant for saying English phrases (i so love it whenever he says \"Shit!\")... Sanada Yukimura - hmmm... i like him, yes... but when he said something like \"my heart is burning\", \"climactic end\", \"aroused feelings\", \"entwined together\" while referring to or with Masamune, it did not really sit well with me... maybe it's just how it was subbed or is it just me? Kojuurou as the dragon's right eye is very protective and i'm glad he got his screentime... Sasuke for me provided the comic relief... the rulers/leaders here also have their stories, though sad to say, they were outshined by their subordinates... Kasuga, the ninja-girl, is as sexy as she is useless and annoying... and i'm not going to mention Ichi... As for the villains, they are ruthless and effective... Akechi Mitsuhide is one masochistic bastard...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10 - Entertaining? you betcha! it's been a while since i've watched an anime that had action from beginning to end... \\n\\n\r\nHello, Testosterone! How I've missed you! Next stop, Sengoku Basara Two!  :D",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is the Game of Thrones of anime - you either like it, or you abhor it for ill-organization, fan service, and a pointless 12 episode run which serves nothing more than faulted padding with no purpose or reason whatsoever. Sengoku Basara is frankly, a waste of time and does not handle itself well in any form or way.\r\nStory\r\nBare boned and basic - bad guy wants to take over Japan, but there's \"clan grudges\" which prevent them from uniting and fighting them. These grudges are pointless and needlessly indicate the audience into falsely believing that there's a core plot development which in actuality isnever addressed directly. In essence, it overdoes with the \"fight till armageddon\" against THE VILLAIN WHOSE NAME IS \"DEMON KING OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN\". And what makes it even worse is that the story makes it clear that he's some \"demon child\" but never bothers to address it as anything other than \"it makes the villain look badass\". Most of the story revolves around a roundabout way of getting to the plot and resolving it.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this story is that it tries to show its historical perspective, but it rips it apart with character development that serves forced plot progression (betrayal, deaths, and needless drama and \"planning\" and \"tactical strategy formation\"). In all aspects, the story treats its villain like HE is the most sane person in the anime while the only two generals who know that he's the villain are powerless because they - almost as if they're breaking the fourth wall - understand that they won't die and will have to proceed with the needless drama that is ingrained into this waste of 325 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nMecha warrior, fan service cleavage ninja, fan service wife of the villain and mundane battle sequences followed by 70% of sequences just of the younger cast showing off their \"skills\". All aspects concerning the story - visually - is padding and extent the running time to a lot more than is needed. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIts decent. I can only say that the actors are doing their best, and that the sound of the overall product made it bearable and certainly is fairly well handled. Even with the obvious shit of a story and art style used to merely please fans, the sound is decent enough to capture the intended purpose of this anime, and for that, I find only that it could have been improved through some adjustments in the story itself. Another reason why this anime's sound is decent is because of the occasional English portions in the subbed version - again, credit where credit is due, the actors did their best in making do with what they were made to work with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nFew characters made me bother watching this anime - the axe wielding red general, and the \"Battle God\" blue female general because they're the only two characters who are well developed and handle their roles with a certain degree of maturity, knowing that they're stuck in an obvious ruckus of a story. Another character is Sasuke - even though his name is linked with the crappiest and most abhorring character ever to condemn anime (Sasuke from the Naturo franchise), he's likeable because he doesn't actually give a shit about the plot, shows that he has an appreciable acceptance of the story and makes it progress as best as he can, and brings boob showing lady to her senses.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else? We have dual spear wielding dumbo whose sucking up to axe wielding red general every time he can get, and is actually a staple construct for (worthless) padding; the two other characters, one eyed Harlock wannabe and his right hand man, both of whom are only concerned with \"fighting\" and serve purely to drive the action of the anime (and make it boring and artless); boob lady who exposes her cleavage shamelessly and has a thing for the \"Battle God\", her retainer (who, incidentally, is her big crush that she fantasizes about - and this anime does not resist showing her in lurid poses doing exactly that. Also she blushes when her retainer shows signs of concern for her in her development which I gather to be sarcasm, and she blushes in embarrassment. What a paperboard sexist construct); and a panel of numerous blank slate characters solely meant to die in every episode: they are all paperboard cutouts and are, quite frankly, the epitome of every anime with a \"dramatic\" twist out there. All of them, serve nothing to the plot, are merely running around catching their tails, and are so weak and worthless in their progression that honestly, there are only the three main protagonists here who I mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villain, he does nothing but pimp in his \"evil lair\", drinking from skulls, and lets his minions do his dirty work. He offers no surprise, and is a cardboard cutout anime cliche villain. In fact, only Sephiroth hair offers some form of action and movement to his plans of \"taking over Japan muhahaha\". His wife serves nothing more than kissing his arse, and is purely fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, if you want an anime which actually has a good premise, uses fantasy elements, and has characters who are actually three dimensional, and lastly has a good plot which is progressed through the actions of the characters themselves, then go watch Basilisk - its certainly a better anime than this crap. The plot is roundabout and doesn't actually and genuinely get going until episode 10, the characters (save for Sasuke, Axe General, and Battle God general) are caricature cardboard anime tropes with zero personalities, the padding because of the \"intellectual strategy interaction\" in which only the three main generals know the goal and main end point and are doing their best to achieve it, and the artwork fails to make this anime likeable - in fact, the moment they introduced MECHA SAMURAI, they killed the whole premise. Its a hopeless and disappointing 325 minutes, and isn't worth mentioning or appreciating in any way.",

            "content": "The series was pretty much exactly what I wanted and expected it to be. The animation was very nice and the art style did well in making it seem kinda cool/badass. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the One Piece/DBZ/Bleach style battles. The characters can leap to insane heights and land with no problems, they can shoot energy blasts form their swords to blow hundreds of guys away with one swing, and they pretty much never cut each other. They get in many deadlocks and end up blasting each other into walls with energy. I think that part's kinda silly... I would've preferred ifit was more intense/violent. \\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly quite different from history and from Samurai Warriors (if you're familiar with either). They sorta set you up expecting it to be accurate, but the inaccuracies make interesting plot twists. The story and characters are a little bit flat and predictable... well, it's not so much you know exactly what'll happen, but it just doesn't invoke much emotion or surprise you that much. You can kinda tell who's going to die and who isn't. There were some pretty nice speeches/lines. \\n\r\nI think I personally liked the characters better in Samurai Warriors (a PS2 game). Maybe it was just weird for me to see Mitsuhide as such a psychopath after Samurai Warriors showed him as an honourable, elegant samurai. I did like Sengoku Basara's version of Keiji Maeda, though. He pretty much inherited all the qualities I liked about Magoichi from Samurai Warriors (Magoichi isn't in this, by the way). Anyhow, if you ignore the differences, Sengoku Basara's versions of the historical figures are pretty enjoyable for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects and music were fitting, though none of it really stuck to me. \\n\\n\r\nIf this series wasn't based on the sengoku period or the historical figures involved, I probably would've rated it 6 or 7 overall. It was pretty good, but not amazing. Shingen and Yukimura have a certain funny running gag. You get to hate the enemies a little bit, but, like I said, the show doesn't make you feel that much emotion. I personally think it's better when a show can draw you in so much that you can get mad, sad, or happy with the characters, but I guess this would be more enjoyable for people who aren't into that.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is an action-historical anime based on the action game \"Sengoku Basara\". The story revolves around Warring States period in ancient Japan, with warlords and generals fighting for power and territory. For those who prefer to watch an action-dedicated anime which doesn't have any fillers, Sengoku Basara might be suited to your preferences.\r\nStory: 610.\r\nThe entire story focuses on dominance and territorial war. The plot is very simple and straightforward. All episodes are filled with ground-breaking battles with generals as the main center of the battle.\r\nThe second season (Sengoku Basara 2) offers more depth in story aspects than the first one, but there are stillsome common flaws to both. An example of this would be the running gags, which are a bit too repetitive (and lost its quality in the process) when used too often in the series. The battles are also a bit too influenced by the presence of the strong generals (a.k.a the playable characters in the game version of this anime). Because of that reason alone, common soldiers seems to only serves as a decorative aspect of war (sometimes they could only watch their general fighting the enemy general when the enemy soldiers are there, right besides them). In the end, if a general alone could annihilate hundreds of people in one attack, who needs soldiers?\\n\\n\r\nStill though, the soldiers proves to be a decent addition; at least it is very cool for the main characters to be able to wreck an entire army formation alone,  with typhoon attacks or with earth-shattering slashes.\\n\r\nThe entire battle concept reminds us of games such as Dynasty Warriors and, of course, Sengoku Basara. Watching the anime even felt like watching the game itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe characters are very well-drawn and detailed even to the armors and weapons. Background is simply superb, including the buildings and natural structures. The entire series looks vibrant and rich in color.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are also drawn well, and expressions are very vivid. The characters are easily distinguished with their respective army theme colors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10.\\n\r\nThe character voices are really suited to the characters' personalities. Although some voices sounds a bit exaggerated to the point of annoyance, some others are very natural and well-voiced.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music isn't very memorable. The only one noticeable would be the orchestral music used for cool situations. The OP and ED songs are decent though, it is very suited for a historical shounen-anime such as this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this anime and it is a bit necessary to memorize some important names to understand what's going on in the dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only little character development in this anime, but with so many types of personalities and characters in the series, it could be easily tolerated. The anime tends to emphasize currently available characteristics, rather than applying character developments (which is pointless if the character himself aren't very remarkable to begin with).\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the quality of character interactions in this anime, the main focus to the characters' quality would be their attachment to their respective leaders. Throughout the series there are very few cases of romance. Most of the intimate interactions in the anime are those between a ruler and his personal adviser/general. As for the main characters, the two shares a strong bond of rivalry from the start of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10.\\n\r\nThe main enjoyment to this series are watching the action itself. The battles are very cool to watch, and interaction between characters are variable and interesting. The end of every episode always sparks a sense of curiosity on how the war turned out in the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. ( Good )\\n\\n\r\n+ Ground-breaking actions\\n\r\n+ Beautiful graphic and character designs\\n\r\n+ Many weapon and skill variations to look forward to\\n\\n\r\n -/+  Exaggerated human power\\n\r\n -/+  Very few female characters compared to the quantity of male characters \\n\r\n -/+  Simple storyline, no need to think too much\\n\\n\r\n -  Too many names and terms to remember even in the beginning\\n\r\n -  Might confuse people who's not familiar with Japanese history\\n\r\n -  Soldiers as only an addition to the war, not the main factor.\\n",

There are historical elements involved, which is really what got me to watch it in the first place, but they don't go very in depth with it. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is for each individual to decide. I happen to think it's a little bit of both. The storyline is simple and easy to follow; almost too easy, in my opinion.\r\nThe animation and art was quite good. All of the characters are nice to lookat, and the battle sequences are well done. Music was good too. I particularly liked the ending and opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever played Dynasty Warriors? If so, you know exactly what Sengoku Basara is going to boil down to. I like to jokingly call it Dynasty Warriors, the anime. In the end, all this show is about, is a bunch of guys running around beating the shit out of each other. There might be a cut-scene or two, or a few minutes of character interaction here and there, but then we go back to endless battle after battle and forget there was ever supposed to be a story in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if that is your thing, then by all means, dive into Sengoku Basara. It certainly wasn't great, but it was a decent time killer. I did enjoy it, despite its short comings. I give it 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is probably the worst anime i have ever seen. I never dropped an anime so fast and I probably never ever will again.\r\nBut everytime I shrugged off one reason to drop this anime, the next scene gave me another to just stop watching.\r\nThe dialogues are horrible, the characters are annoying, the fighting scenes are absurd,ridiculous and just bad.\\n\r\nThere is nothing that could possibly get you hooked. Well it could but only if you, for some reason, have a thing for useless fight scenes and bad character introductions and story-telling and uninspired works in general.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to all the people who say that this one refers to Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors....why would someone make an anime about that? Dynasty Warriors has no story and it doesn't need one. But an anime does. \\n\\n\r\nSengoku is a pretty interesting period of japanese history. It's the golden age of warriors and leaves room for billions of interesting narratives. But instead of taking the chance by doing a great somwhat historical anime, they come up with this bulls*** where some of the main characters do have historical names but for some reason also have some weird superpowers.\\n\r\nNot only do these superpowers seem misplaced...\\n\r\nThe thing with superpowers is that in order to make them interesting you got to find a way to give the viewer an idea of how they work. Sengoku Basara does none of it. It just throws explosions in your face because, you know, explosions are cool and badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so replaceable I forgot about them the moment their screentime ended. They were not interesting they were only a mix of different stereotypes.

            "content": "Story.\r\nIt's very simple and easy to understand, it's far from being complex and it doesn't try to be. Characters are introduced in a battle with minimal background information.\r\nHowever, the timesetting and some of the elements that appear are a bit odd but they were added to make it look even better. You shouldn't think of this as a historical anime or you won't like it.\r\nArt.\r\nI liked the art, it looked nice, and the effects used during combat scenes added an extra touch to it.\r\nSound.\r\nIntro and endings were nice and I was never once disturbed by the background music meaning they did a good job. Usethe music to magnify the events that are taking place and focus your attention on that and not on the music playing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nI have no idea how well they match the historical people that they were based on but each was interesting in its own way. Also the fact that while they all liked and respected each other, they still fought each other was something refreshing. They somewhat match the general idea one would have from that time. And some of them were given elements from the current time to amplify their personality. Like date's horse that looked like a motorcycle, the yakuza like army...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nThe whole show wasn't made to improve your knowledge of that time or anything like that. It was made for pure enjoyment. If you like some epic battles without complex background information and such, this might be the show for you. Since the series is only 12 episodes long, the story doesn't have time for sidestories, detailed backgrounds,.. I liked this series so much because I could just watch and enjoy without having to think over some things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nI liked the series, If you want a good short action serie. This is your thing. Don't be fooled by the historical tag, It might've been based on that but I wouldn't study for a history exam with this or you will fail. If you ever liked bleach, naruto,.. but you hated the fillers, the dramatic flashbacks in the past to explain something and just wished they'd get on with the battle. Then watch this for a few hours of simple enjoyment.",

            "content": "Preface: I have not played the game this is based on, nor am I a major in Japanese history, if you feel either or both are required to \u201cget\u201d this series, so be it.\r\nSengoku Basara is yet another action anime series taking place in ancient Japan that is targeted at young teen males, almost insultingly so. I don\u2019t normally review shows at all, much less after only watching 2 episodes, but in this case, I felt it was my obligation as a member of the human race to try to stop people from making the same mistake I did, watching 2 episodes of this crap.\r\nStory:1\\n\r\nHuh there is a story? There is no obvious overall story or plot of any kind. Characters have no motivation to do anything from the story. Just because you\u2019re in ancient Japan, doesn\u2019t mean you can just ignore the story and say \u201ceveryone is fighting, that is the story!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nArt is in general is good. Then you might ask why I gave it a 6 and not higher? It is because often in battle the artwork severely degrades and at times looks more like two people throwing neon paint at each other more than it does two people fighting. You can show various types of super powers without just splashing bright colors randomly together so that is NO excuse at all. I personally found it funny how after the first episode some of the higher ups apparently watched the show Noein (a significantly better show by the way) and for the second episode decided to copy the same style of art where in battle the drawing of the characters becomes less detailed and more basely furious. I wasn\u2019t really a huge fan of that in Noein though either and Neoin did it better and had other elements vastly superior (hello Sengoku Basara, I\u2019d like you to meet my friend story) to make it so I didn\u2019t care about it so much. Sengoku Basara NEEDS to take a lesson from shows like Berserk or Claymore that showcase both above human fighting (a lot above in Claymore\u2019s case) without turning in neon paint tag.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing especially good, bad or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nNone of the characters have any character. For one, the show moves around so much that you don\u2019t really feel attached to any one character as \u201cThe Main Character\u201d and the ones that are shown the most screen time also have dialog that seems to have been designed to make you hate them. Yukimura Sanada is probably the closest thing to a main character the series has, but sadly, his dialog is split between a doglike (literally) devotion to Takeda Shingen and some of the worst C grade Samurai movie honor banter I have ever seen. Then we have a female assassin who has some sort of puppy love for her lord, some six sword wielding lord who has to be constantly held back by his friend because his character contains nothing deeper than \u201cBATTLE BATTLE BATTLE\u201d and of course Yukimura Sanada\u2019s lover/owner who has the same C grade Samurai movie lines and is the most stereotypical Japanese Feudal lord ever in the history of animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you missed the hint, the characters are one dimensional and their dialog might as well not exist for all the good it does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI was trying to force myself to watch a 3rd episode in the hopes of it getting better, but the fact that I couldn\u2019t shows very well how much enjoyment I took out it. The battles were dull and lacked any detail while the dialog made me want to travel back in time to kill the characters they were supposedly based on so that the world would never have to know this travesty.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show is bad. There is no other way for me to put it. People talk about how it is \u201cmanly\u201d, \u201cGarr\u201d and other crap, but what you have is a show targeted at very young teens in much the same light as Dragon Ball Z or narutu that is simply of poor quality. If you want to watch a \u201cmanly\u201d show, watch berserk or something else that is actually good.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many areas of this anime that are severely under what one would call decent and there is also nothing to make up for those missing areas. My recommendation is you don\u2019t watch this unless you\u2019re looking for Dragon Ball Z: Japanese Feudal Era.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is a sh\u014dnen anime set during the Sengoku Jidai, or \u2018Warring States period\u2019 of Japanese history, and is based on Capcom\u2019s Playstation 2 video game Devil Kings (known as Sengoku Basara in Japan). It should be noted that Sengoku Basara is a world away from the period it draws its inspiration from \u2013 it's not historically accurate by any means. That said, a few features associated with the period, such as the rivalry between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin, and the Oda clan\u2019s use of firearms, are present. The characters, for the most part, are all taken from the era, although the mannerin which they are presented is obviously highly fictionalized. \\n\\n\r\nSengoku Basara is a fairly typical tale of good versus evil. Initially it may not seem so simple, as we are presented with many factions fighting for control over Japan. Eventually though, they come together to fight a common enemy; namely, Oda Nobunaga. As in Capcom\u2019s Onimusha franchise, he is presented as some sort of demon. Overall, the story certainly isn't anything to write home about.  Spanning a total of 12 episodes, the series does a decent job of wrapping things up within its time limit, although it can feel rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell from the poster, there are a lot of characters in Sengoku Basara. For an anime of its length, this isn\u2019t something that works to its advantage. Perhaps inevitably, character development is not one of its strong points, and this is one area where the anime can seem rushed. This is a shame, as we are introduced to several interesting characters such as Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika, the so called 'Demon of Onigashima', only for them to receive almost no screen time whatsoever (other than as forgettable reinforcements during the final battle). Equally disappointing is the fact that some of the characters that do feature heavily aren't given any significant fights of their own. You may find yourself waiting for a confrontation between a pair of characters, only to be disappointed when it never happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a varied bunch, with Date Masamune being perhaps the most interesting. Arrogant with the strength to back it up and full of ridiculous one liners like \u2018put ya guns on!\u2019, it\u2019s no surprise that he has been likened to Dante, the protagonist of Capcom\u2019s Devil May Cry franchise. He also incorporates English into his speech, which is refreshing. Other characters, however, don't fare as well. Listening to Yukimura as he constantly reminds us that he\u2019s burning with passion, for example, can quickly become tiresome. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime set during times of war, it's no surprise that most of the enjoyment from this series comes from its many over-the-top action sequences: one swing of an axe causing a tornado; a robot samurai with a jet pack and a massive drill for a weapon; and so on.  \\n\\n\r\nOne final thing to note about Sengoku Basara (for you blood and gore enthusiasts) is that the violence is pretty modest - even by sh\u014dnen standards. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any deaths! Of course, if this sort of stuff doesn't bother you in the slightest, you'll be fine. \\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting presentation of the Warring States period. If you know a thing or two about the period, you're likely to squeeze more enjoyment out of it (unless historical inaccuracies put you off).\\n\\n\r\n+/- Series is short in length but has a large, varied cast of characters. As a result, character development isn't a highlight.\\n\\n\r\n- A few annoying characters that you'll have to tolerate (subjective, depending on what you're definition of annoying is).\\n\\n\r\n+/- Rather modest levels of violence.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sengoku Basara is OK. Some of its characters may be annoying, character development isn\u2019t great, and the final confrontation arguably leaves much to be desired. However, I'm sure many will find it entertaining. Generally speaking, if you think the idea of a guy wielding six swords simultaneously (only two hands!) is just plain awesome, you should probably give this one a try.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10 (Reasonable)",

            "content": "Have you guys ever played Samurai Warriors, or at least Dynasty Warriors? This anime is the adaptation from one of Capcom Game called Sengoku Basara. One part of Sengoku Basara that sticks out from these kinds of games are their SUPER UBER OVER STRENGTH!\r\nInstead of just seeing a \"slash, slash, dash, blow!\" we'll see \"draw six swords at once, super speed, slash of EXPLOSION!\" For more information about people in the game type in \"Sengoku Period/Sengoku Basara\" in wiki for better understanding why \"this\" or \"that\" happened in the story.\r\nStory: 7\r\n Easy starting, we started in a battlefeild scence, then there comes the main character,then the fight, then the talk, then the fight. Think of it as \"What do you think will happen when you're in war\", the story just goes like that and I think (for people who played the game) the story won't change much from the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\n Art is Awesome! The fighting scene is really SUPER HUMAN, but it draws you to watch it until the end even though it seems so unrealistic. The backgrounds pictures (grass, building) was done very good and not complaints in that. One weak point is that sometimes the art goes into \"I'm GONNA spin myself 180 degrees without moving\" style, which makes the art look too much Inhuman.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n The OP \"Jap\" really does go with the anime and the ED is also the same. Since it's a action kind of anime you can expect good sounds from the fighting scene. Their sounds draw you to watch the scence more and more and their OST does go with \"what is happening\" in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n There is not much good point about their Character here. There's a BAD GUY, two almost good guys, Bad Guy armies, Good guy armies and they will fight each other...that's all. One good part about their character (which adapted from the game) was how usually the nickname of the generals sometimes go along with their looks and behavior (e.g. \"The Tiger of Kai\" of Shingen Takeda we'll see him wearing a tiger look-alike cloth with superb power and leadership\")\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n For an action anime, this series does give a lot of enjoyment. Even though they're not much story to follow, but the \"Maliness\" and the Over Human fighting scene will kept you on your chair and made you watch it until it finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n Too bad that this series does not have any creativity at all. Since it was an adaptation from the game PLUS most of us will know the story already it will pull away our interest in watching Sengoku Basara a lot! However, it's still kinda interesting to see how will they adapt the game into an anime without ruining the story.",

One of these lords called the devil king of the sixth heaven, note that he's a DEVIL king of the sixth HEAVEN this alone should keep you away from this anime, gained enough power to pose a real threat to the other lords as he ravaged all the lands that stood against him and also the lands that were his allies. Basically this is one crazy devil king of the sixth heaven. \r\nThe thing is, he is depicted asan evil lord doing evil things in this time of evil, but everyone else are the same. They all want to fight eachother and some of the \"good\" guys actually look forward to fighting eachother for no apparent reason other than that they respect eachother, atleast the devil king of the sixth heaven does it for his own perverse enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have been able to think that was cool, you might have been able to think any of the characters were cool, if they had possessed anything worthy of being called cool.

This is an abomination of epic proportions. Where TTGL knows how to play the characters for maximum entertainment this anime fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the art and animations were good. Some of the fight scenes were well made and for this it retained some entertainment value which saved it from a rating of below 5.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a short shounen that insults you with its characters but tries to entertain you with fairly well made scenes of fighting then you should definitely watch Sengoku BASARA, if you want a good samurai/historical anime go watch Samurai Champloo.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is a relatively modern anime series created by Production I.G, and is based on the series of videogames of the same name in Japan. Despite some historical accuracy as pertaining to the key battles in the Sengoku period, the series takes many departures from the trappings of the period and introduces many outlandish elements, an example being Honda, a gigantic mechanical soldier introduced roughly halfway through the series. This over-the-top approach to Japanese history, however, does not exactly result in a work of great praise. (Note that I myself have not played any of the Sengoku Basara games, so this review is onlybased off the anime series itself, I have no bias towards the series itself)\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline and plot development of Sengoku Basara is barely worth mentioning \u2013 it is barely developed whatsoever, and the skimming over of the events of the period made trying to follow such an unexplained story fairly confusing for someone like me, who does not know much about the events of the Sengoku Period themselves. It becomes obvious that the bare threads of story only serve to connect the fights of the series, and this in turn contributes to the rushed feeling of the series itself. The basic time-worn concept of good vs. evil presents the main plot of the series, a very stereotypical goal for the demographic. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters for the series is quite large, surprising considering the fairly short length of the series itself, and because of this large cast/short series imbalance, character development is practically paper thin. Some characters only show up for one episode or so before being offed, or in some cases, only appear for two or three moments in the series, despite being seemingly interesting characters (prime suspects for this being Mouri Motonari and Chousokabe Motochika, the latter only being revealed at the end of the series and basically has around 5 minutes of screentime in total). Also, opposite to the above point, several characters that are featured prominently in the series have barely any interesting fight scenes or development whatsoever (prime examples being Sarutobi Sasuke and Kasuga). This presents a very \u2018half-finished\u2019 view on the character development of the series, which is never a good thing. Despite this, however, there are some characters that are developed more than others, such as Date Masamune or Yukimura Sanada, for example, but these characters still are not developed very much, and their dialogue mostly delves into a sea of predictable phrases later on in the series. Interactions between characters are fairly unremarkable, unless they are fighting between each other, and many of the \u2018gags\u2019 that occur throughout the series (such as Yukimura\u2019s exchanges with Takeda Shingen, or Kasuga\u2019s interaction with Uesugi Kenshin) are very repetitive and don\u2019t really add much whatsoever, they just end up being fairly silly and irritating as time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nIt is clear from the very first episode that the primary focus of Sengoku Basara is with its action scenes, something which the war-time setting caters to greatly. However, many battles simply degrade into one of the main characters using some kind of absurdly powerful attack to tear through legions of nameless weak soldiers, and this does become repetitive quickly. Despite this, the majority of the battles take place between the main protagonists and antagonists of the series themselves, and these battles can sometimes be fairly fun to watch, but most delve into the limitless vault of shonen series tropes such as powering up/energy blasts etc., which really hampers the uniqueness of the fights, even if interesting elements are involved.\\n\\n\r\nVisual direction of the series is quite well done, the fight scenes are fluid and transition well, and generally in itself the animation is quite detailed. Frequent splashes of colour and sketching effect are used very liberally throughout the series, to highlight the flashy special moves that the characters exhibit, which is somewhat interesting at first but is not particularly explored. There is a surprising lack of blood, even for a shonen series of this kind, which does make the battles somewhat disappointing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAudio wise the series does not present a particularly memorable soundtrack, most of the series\u2019 background music consists of either stereotypically created hard rock tracks for the fight scenes or somewhat traditional sounding music for the scenes that were not taken up by fighting, which is not very many whatsoever. The opening and ending themes are also fairly unmemorable rock pieces which contributed to the series\u2019 tone itself in principle, but really were not notable in any other merit.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sengoku Basara is a very average and overrated series. A lack of coherent story beyond an excuse for characters to fight, poor overall character development due to a large cast and not enough screentime, subpar and derivative action sequences with too much incessant energy blasts/special attacks, a fairly unremarkable soundtrack and a lack of veritable historical accuracy for the period translates to a measly 5/10. Some may find this entertaining as merely a baseless and flashy piece of media, but these features should not be treated as compliments.\\n",

            "content": "When I first noticed that this anime existed it piqued my interest. i remember playing the game Devil Kings for ps2 (game that the characters are copied from then replicated into this anime) and I recalled the somewhat enjoyable times playing the game with a friend, i must say that my experiences thus far with this anime is falling quite short to my expectations.\r\nStory:  Takes place in war-torn feudal Japan, in times of warring feudal lords all struggling for power. Sounds like a great historical anime right? well.... you'd be wrong. Its got a \"modern\" flare thrown in. and by modern i am referringto the presence of guns or crazy weapons or the Tank guy with a jet pack; Honda.  This anime focuses on throwing the viewer into overly-epic (to the point of disgust) battles, while the overall story (which there isnt really that much of one) is more or less thrown to the side.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Quite nice artwork actually: Vibrant colours, crisp artwork, and i rather enjoyed the few seconds worth of frames that revert to a more sketch-like portrayal of events.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I quite Dislike the opening. I am a fan of most of Abingdon Boys school's other songs but this one just irked me. wasnt a fan of the ending but it seemed to fit more or less the theme of the series. Good seiyu, but way too many over the top cliched english lines. Every time something was said in english i cringed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Basically the characters look more or less exact compared to the ps2's image of them. so i guess theres no place for complaint there, however each personality is way too far over the top. every character (at least the males) tend to be over the top GAR and it just gets to a point where it is hard to watch. personalities are stretched to no longer believable levels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well i had high hopes for this series, perhaps that is why I am quite let down with it now. about halfway into the second episode i couldnt stand it. now I am trying to complete the series based on spite.  If you were just looking for a series with a bunch of fighting scenes, weak dialogue which you really don't need to pay attention to, and extreme cleavage (I think she shows up pretty early) then this may be for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I personally just want it to be over. Im scared to see how a second season could be made from this. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Cutting out the whole summary and introductions, Sengoku Basara is a story of seemingly epic proportions squeezed into a very small time-frame as far as the series goes (being 12 episodes). Taking bits and pieces of history, twisting it a nudge and completely blowing it out of proportion, you get a kind of Gurren Lagann feeling. By that, I mean that the story just increases in its grandeur up until quite a climax at the ending. \r\nHowever, the storyline is not without its faults. In its twelve-episode lifespan, you get characters galore, yet little to no character development whatsoever. What I feel is a kindof minor setback is that for the viewer to get the most out of the anime he/she must be at least acquainted with the Sengoku period. However, it still manages a comprehensible storyline that, while often times easy to decipher, still makes you interested to see the outcome until the end. It definitely feels rushed, and it was kind of expected. The ending, while good, gave me a feeling of \"That was it?\" But admittedly, I would be lying if I said I wasn't satisfied, especially after seeing the credits at the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Sengoku Basara is what I'd consider to be at least above average, though people may say that it is about as good as any other shounen series, but to that I say: xP The combination of high-action scenes with clearly super-human capabilities, combined with the sheer amount of bodies flying about as well as a touch of 3D here and there and you'll know where a good portion of the budget went. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very, well, manly. It sets itself up as an anime where there will always be some form of inspiration or epicness, and that is definitely prominent in this show. With beautiful works such as dai roku tenma ou to give you that sense of dread and fear for the protagonists and the absolutely inspiring vocal cues of BLAZE -Crimson Lotus- (especially its full, final version), it's definitely one of the parts of the show that really pull it off the ground, if not at least its saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit cliche, but for series based on a fighting game, that was to be expected. You will always have your naive, young protagonist (Yukimura), the cool, calm, collected, yet human rival (Masamune), a master/father figure (Takeda), and your all-evil, all-powerful enemy (ODA NOBUNAGA!!! (yes, you have to say it like that)). Oh, and don't forget the ninjas, other lords, the vagabond, the other soldiers, enemies, retainers, but to be more specifically, the Date 4 (you'll see what I mean). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sengoku Basara is the kind of anime you would watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. Like Gurren Lagann, it isn't something you ponder over, and like Gurren Lagann, it does try to make a more serious storyline, which is eventually thrown out the window (perhaps not as radically?) and brought back to what its good at: Old-fashioned Blades, Guns, and Explosions. It's an anime that is there to make you feel good, and make you feel like you want to be awesome, and in that respect, it succeeded, giving it an overall score of 8. Sure it may not be for those who want a serious amount of storyline and character development, but it is definitely worth at least watching, and for those who like watching anime for the sheer thrill of fighting, you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Ok ' here we go ' [ date copyright ]\r\nSO...Sengoku BASARA review.Note that this review is ANIME only , as it says , no connection to the games , cause personally I hate when people compare 2 things that have SOMETHING in common as if they should be identical twins. Well no..this anime is BASED on the game , so we should compare them separately.\r\nStory: Not something outta the ordinary , like a big BOMB etc but , heck , it doesn't even need to be that way.It's simple and clean , and still manages to be pure enjoyment , but you'll only understand whyif you watch it yourself.You probably met these characters in different forms in other media cause, Date Masamune,Sanada Yukimura,Sarutobi Sasuke,Oda Nobunaga etc really DID exist [ except most of them are bishons here ...yep..i'm a girl..:X ] So the story is 8/10 for me . Even if it wasn't something twisted it had the spice that I liked .\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: well, no flaw here.Production I.G. made it superb.You'll love it.One of the best things about this series [ + eye-candy for fangirls ]  10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another big 10/10.Sengoku BASARA OST is just EPIC.I'm not talking about what you hear in the background on the anime.You have to listen to RED and BLUE .It will definitely go to your taste.It is a beautiful combination between modern and traditional rhythm plus a lot of orchestral instruments that just sound amazing and beautiful .Some songs like BLAZE ~CRIMSON LOTUS ,mastermind ,ZIPANGU,Heaven's Door ,SHUT UP~GO TO HELL ,Peaceful Days and others don't even need vocals ,that's how nice they sound [ ok except that the main theme songs for characters have one song with just instrumental and the other featuring the character; example: Heaven's Door is an instrumental and Heaven's Door feat Date Masamune is the song with Date's voice in it [ yeah..fangirls candy ] Also some songs on the same notes but in different tonalities or different instruments sound superb and offer a different taste [ ex: that's part of being a hero ]\\n\r\nSo basically the OST is an absolute plus.Give it a try , you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Not very deep characters ,but heck , they don't even need to be deep to be cool . Date would get emo if he gets deep.He's just Date , and that makes him cooler than cool :)) Same goes for other characters.The way they interact and the way they are portrayed , cause they are individualized , is enough . 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series very much and can't wait for the OVA and season 2 .  Some people regard this series as a FAIL, because they try to compare it to the game , but i kinda punch those ppl in the face .This anime is still , as individual , something really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It gets a 10 from me.It's a series to watch when you don't feel like stressing your brain but still be able to watch something good.Simple and good, that's the recipe that describes Sengoku BASARA.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If anyone asked me what's my opinion about Sengoku Basara, I'd just tell 'em it is a pretty fun to watch anime, nothing more than that. Nothing really stands out, but that is not a bad thing if the product is consistent all throughout, and Sengoku Basara is pretty consistent. \r\nThere is nothing really spectacular about the plot and characters, it's another one of those shows that are set during the Sengoku Period in Japan (having Nobunaga Oda as the villain and all), having some of the actual generals and captains that were involved in those battles as characters in the story, but changing alot of it to make it more \"anime\" and digestible to the public, and as far as the characters here go, they basically kept only their names and affiliations, but again, that's not a bad thing.\\n\r\nSengoku Basara is the Dynasty Warriors anime that never came to life (maybe because the game it was based on plays so much like DW). Characters are one-dimensional war machines that can tear through waves of men as easily as they can shout their enemy's name or say \"MY LORD!\", and it's surely fun to see them interact. \\n\r\nFor the most part they're just talking to each other in order to get some exposition about the plot out or just explain the characters motivations, but here and there you'll see some fight scenes, and in my opinion the show is at it's best during these fights. Every fight in this anime is comparable to the fight between Superman and Zod in the new Superman movie, as in they don't really give a fuck about logic or collateral damage, just throwing everything they have at each other hoping it kills whoever is fighting, and it is glorious.\\n\r\nOther than the fight scenes and the characters, the show has some pretty good animation, nothing that will make you impressed, but nothing as bad as the latest episodes of Naruto. The same goes to the sound section of the anime, none of the songs are really catchy or worth listening to in your free time, but you'll probably not skip 'em until the latter episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION: If you're a selective type of guy or just doesn't have that much time to watch anime, than skip this if you don't have anything better to watch, but, if you're willing to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.\\n",

Always been pray for this day that BASARA must become the real anime after playing BASARA 2 Heroes with it anime cut scene, and Production I.G has finally deliver it!\r\nThe anime biggest weakness was none the other the story and some are complain about that. But from the start, BASARA doesn't even have a single decent story. Maybe i did play the game so i know. Is the same with the game, no need for historical explanation. The start of episodeone just gave you a short explanation what is going for a few minute and then is straight to the party. You may have to play the game or do some research to get a clear what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nAction? Yes, BASARA is all about action with some frenzy craziness in it, fast, explosive, and some un-normal trick or behaviour. Who knew you will find a mushroom cloud in it, able to climb siege wall with horse, or how about punching someone in the face with random reason? That's how the party goes.\\n\\n\r\nBASARA biggest star was his cast and seiyuu. You have all your favorite character from the game are animated here, and the original seiyuu voicing them in the game are here to reprise their role. Something is to be celebrate. But the down side is to many character, and some maybe fans favorite couldn't have enough time space to show off. And for some, the director were smart enough to reduce them; like getting kill in battle or something. Only remain some of the important key character like Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, Sarutobi Sasuke and to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of key character, i will be praise on the villian in BASARA. Oda Nobunaga, is one of the SOB i would say supremely well done in game and anime. And Matsunaga Hisahide who also appear only in BASARA 2 Heroes and only a few episode then died; again well done. Notorious and truely evil. The character personality didn't change at all. All of them are the same, Shingen always punching Yukimura for no reason, Masamune still have Dante like attitude, and blah blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are rocking good. The OP was done by Abbrigdon Boys School with Jap, they also did do the game OP of BASARA 2 Heroes and for this OP also on the PSP game Battle Heroes, and then the ED Break & Peace done by the band Dustz.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will like it because action, some will not like it because of the weak story. But is a great action anime you might enjoy for a while, and is one hell of the party you might enjoy it.",

            "content": "Note: This review covers my general thoughts on all three season of Sengoku Basara and the movie.\r\nSengoku Basara is a really fun and straight forward action series, with the most crazy and over the top action I have ever seen in anime. I don't want to go into spoilers, but the action is like a fusion of Dragon Ball Z, One Punch Man, and even  a little Gundam. So if you are looking for simple and bloody samurai style sword fights, this is not the show for you. However, if you are fan fan of crazy ridiculous and well animated action than Sengoku Basarais a treat. The show knows what it wants to be and doesn't try to be anything more. The characters are simple, but they are all charismatic, likable, fun, cool, or bad ass enough that I didn't mind their simplicity. If you are looking for an action show with a lot of complex characters and a riveting plot with lots of intricate twists and turns, then Sengoku Basara isn't the show you are looking for. However, if you are looking for a ridiculous and really fun adventure than Sengoku Basara is right up your alley. Plus the soundtrack is amazing and there are some really good villains as well.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Spoiler: The third season is just a retelling of the movie, but with some more story elements and characters to help fill the 12 episodes.",

            "content": "I first became curious about Sengoku Basara when it was mentioned and spoofed in the Character Poll Arc of Gintama... I knew when I heard Masamune say at the beginning - \"Are you ready guys? Put your guns on! Let's party!\" - that this is going to be good...\r\nMain Characters: Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura, Katakura Kojuurou, Sarutobi Sasuke\r\nStory: 8/10 - nothing deep, really... it's just about power struggle and uniting against one really evil ruler... i liked that they were able to give a background of the characters/rulers involved... at first i thought that the fight scenes were a little exaggerated since the closest samuraii know would be Kenshin Himura - he has his style but not like this... once the story progressed, i've learned to accept that these guys are not your normal samurais...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - love the details and the colors, though sometimes it got too dark and too bright... but then again, i guess it was needed in the scenes... fight scenes are there but what we will usually see are blue and red lightning-like-streaks... i'm not complaining...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - now i'm not sure how this goes - rock 'n roll maybe? i liked it from the first time i heard it... OP/ED are very catchy... gotta love those dancing samurais in the background... BG music here really helps the scenes...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 - bias again? of course! Masamune reminded me of my fave character Hijikata Toshiro and I think i like him just as much... from his motorcycle-like horse to his penchant for saying English phrases (i so love it whenever he says \"Shit!\")... Sanada Yukimura - hmmm... i like him, yes... but when he said something like \"my heart is burning\", \"climactic end\", \"aroused feelings\", \"entwined together\" while referring to or with Masamune, it did not really sit well with me... maybe it's just how it was subbed or is it just me? Kojuurou as the dragon's right eye is very protective and i'm glad he got his screentime... Sasuke for me provided the comic relief... the rulers/leaders here also have their stories, though sad to say, they were outshined by their subordinates... Kasuga, the ninja-girl, is as sexy as she is useless and annoying... and i'm not going to mention Ichi... As for the villains, they are ruthless and effective... Akechi Mitsuhide is one masochistic bastard...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10 - Entertaining? you betcha! it's been a while since i've watched an anime that had action from beginning to end... \\n\\n\r\nHello, Testosterone! How I've missed you! Next stop, Sengoku Basara Two!  :D",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is the Game of Thrones of anime - you either like it, or you abhor it for ill-organization, fan service, and a pointless 12 episode run which serves nothing more than faulted padding with no purpose or reason whatsoever. Sengoku Basara is frankly, a waste of time and does not handle itself well in any form or way.\r\nStory\r\nBare boned and basic - bad guy wants to take over Japan, but there's \"clan grudges\" which prevent them from uniting and fighting them. These grudges are pointless and needlessly indicate the audience into falsely believing that there's a core plot development which in actuality isnever addressed directly. In essence, it overdoes with the \"fight till armageddon\" against THE VILLAIN WHOSE NAME IS \"DEMON KING OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN\". And what makes it even worse is that the story makes it clear that he's some \"demon child\" but never bothers to address it as anything other than \"it makes the villain look badass\". Most of the story revolves around a roundabout way of getting to the plot and resolving it.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this story is that it tries to show its historical perspective, but it rips it apart with character development that serves forced plot progression (betrayal, deaths, and needless drama and \"planning\" and \"tactical strategy formation\"). In all aspects, the story treats its villain like HE is the most sane person in the anime while the only two generals who know that he's the villain are powerless because they - almost as if they're breaking the fourth wall - understand that they won't die and will have to proceed with the needless drama that is ingrained into this waste of 325 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nMecha warrior, fan service cleavage ninja, fan service wife of the villain and mundane battle sequences followed by 70% of sequences just of the younger cast showing off their \"skills\". All aspects concerning the story - visually - is padding and extent the running time to a lot more than is needed. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIts decent. I can only say that the actors are doing their best, and that the sound of the overall product made it bearable and certainly is fairly well handled. Even with the obvious shit of a story and art style used to merely please fans, the sound is decent enough to capture the intended purpose of this anime, and for that, I find only that it could have been improved through some adjustments in the story itself. Another reason why this anime's sound is decent is because of the occasional English portions in the subbed version - again, credit where credit is due, the actors did their best in making do with what they were made to work with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nFew characters made me bother watching this anime - the axe wielding red general, and the \"Battle God\" blue female general because they're the only two characters who are well developed and handle their roles with a certain degree of maturity, knowing that they're stuck in an obvious ruckus of a story. Another character is Sasuke - even though his name is linked with the crappiest and most abhorring character ever to condemn anime (Sasuke from the Naturo franchise), he's likeable because he doesn't actually give a shit about the plot, shows that he has an appreciable acceptance of the story and makes it progress as best as he can, and brings boob showing lady to her senses.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else? We have dual spear wielding dumbo whose sucking up to axe wielding red general every time he can get, and is actually a staple construct for (worthless) padding; the two other characters, one eyed Harlock wannabe and his right hand man, both of whom are only concerned with \"fighting\" and serve purely to drive the action of the anime (and make it boring and artless); boob lady who exposes her cleavage shamelessly and has a thing for the \"Battle God\", her retainer (who, incidentally, is her big crush that she fantasizes about - and this anime does not resist showing her in lurid poses doing exactly that. Also she blushes when her retainer shows signs of concern for her in her development which I gather to be sarcasm, and she blushes in embarrassment. What a paperboard sexist construct); and a panel of numerous blank slate characters solely meant to die in every episode: they are all paperboard cutouts and are, quite frankly, the epitome of every anime with a \"dramatic\" twist out there. All of them, serve nothing to the plot, are merely running around catching their tails, and are so weak and worthless in their progression that honestly, there are only the three main protagonists here who I mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villain, he does nothing but pimp in his \"evil lair\", drinking from skulls, and lets his minions do his dirty work. He offers no surprise, and is a cardboard cutout anime cliche villain. In fact, only Sephiroth hair offers some form of action and movement to his plans of \"taking over Japan muhahaha\". His wife serves nothing more than kissing his arse, and is purely fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, if you want an anime which actually has a good premise, uses fantasy elements, and has characters who are actually three dimensional, and lastly has a good plot which is progressed through the actions of the characters themselves, then go watch Basilisk - its certainly a better anime than this crap. The plot is roundabout and doesn't actually and genuinely get going until episode 10, the characters (save for Sasuke, Axe General, and Battle God general) are caricature cardboard anime tropes with zero personalities, the padding because of the \"intellectual strategy interaction\" in which only the three main generals know the goal and main end point and are doing their best to achieve it, and the artwork fails to make this anime likeable - in fact, the moment they introduced MECHA SAMURAI, they killed the whole premise. Its a hopeless and disappointing 325 minutes, and isn't worth mentioning or appreciating in any way.",

            "content": "The series was pretty much exactly what I wanted and expected it to be. The animation was very nice and the art style did well in making it seem kinda cool/badass. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the One Piece/DBZ/Bleach style battles. The characters can leap to insane heights and land with no problems, they can shoot energy blasts form their swords to blow hundreds of guys away with one swing, and they pretty much never cut each other. They get in many deadlocks and end up blasting each other into walls with energy. I think that part's kinda silly... I would've preferred ifit was more intense/violent. \\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly quite different from history and from Samurai Warriors (if you're familiar with either). They sorta set you up expecting it to be accurate, but the inaccuracies make interesting plot twists. The story and characters are a little bit flat and predictable... well, it's not so much you know exactly what'll happen, but it just doesn't invoke much emotion or surprise you that much. You can kinda tell who's going to die and who isn't. There were some pretty nice speeches/lines. \\n\r\nI think I personally liked the characters better in Samurai Warriors (a PS2 game). Maybe it was just weird for me to see Mitsuhide as such a psychopath after Samurai Warriors showed him as an honourable, elegant samurai. I did like Sengoku Basara's version of Keiji Maeda, though. He pretty much inherited all the qualities I liked about Magoichi from Samurai Warriors (Magoichi isn't in this, by the way). Anyhow, if you ignore the differences, Sengoku Basara's versions of the historical figures are pretty enjoyable for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects and music were fitting, though none of it really stuck to me. \\n\\n\r\nIf this series wasn't based on the sengoku period or the historical figures involved, I probably would've rated it 6 or 7 overall. It was pretty good, but not amazing. Shingen and Yukimura have a certain funny running gag. You get to hate the enemies a little bit, but, like I said, the show doesn't make you feel that much emotion. I personally think it's better when a show can draw you in so much that you can get mad, sad, or happy with the characters, but I guess this would be more enjoyable for people who aren't into that.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara is an action-historical anime based on the action game \"Sengoku Basara\". The story revolves around Warring States period in ancient Japan, with warlords and generals fighting for power and territory. For those who prefer to watch an action-dedicated anime which doesn't have any fillers, Sengoku Basara might be suited to your preferences.\r\nStory: 610.\r\nThe entire story focuses on dominance and territorial war. The plot is very simple and straightforward. All episodes are filled with ground-breaking battles with generals as the main center of the battle.\r\nThe second season (Sengoku Basara 2) offers more depth in story aspects than the first one, but there are stillsome common flaws to both. An example of this would be the running gags, which are a bit too repetitive (and lost its quality in the process) when used too often in the series. The battles are also a bit too influenced by the presence of the strong generals (a.k.a the playable characters in the game version of this anime). Because of that reason alone, common soldiers seems to only serves as a decorative aspect of war (sometimes they could only watch their general fighting the enemy general when the enemy soldiers are there, right besides them). In the end, if a general alone could annihilate hundreds of people in one attack, who needs soldiers?\\n\\n\r\nStill though, the soldiers proves to be a decent addition; at least it is very cool for the main characters to be able to wreck an entire army formation alone,  with typhoon attacks or with earth-shattering slashes.\\n\r\nThe entire battle concept reminds us of games such as Dynasty Warriors and, of course, Sengoku Basara. Watching the anime even felt like watching the game itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe characters are very well-drawn and detailed even to the armors and weapons. Background is simply superb, including the buildings and natural structures. The entire series looks vibrant and rich in color.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are also drawn well, and expressions are very vivid. The characters are easily distinguished with their respective army theme colors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10.\\n\r\nThe character voices are really suited to the characters' personalities. Although some voices sounds a bit exaggerated to the point of annoyance, some others are very natural and well-voiced.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music isn't very memorable. The only one noticeable would be the orchestral music used for cool situations. The OP and ED songs are decent though, it is very suited for a historical shounen-anime such as this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this anime and it is a bit necessary to memorize some important names to understand what's going on in the dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only little character development in this anime, but with so many types of personalities and characters in the series, it could be easily tolerated. The anime tends to emphasize currently available characteristics, rather than applying character developments (which is pointless if the character himself aren't very remarkable to begin with).\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the quality of character interactions in this anime, the main focus to the characters' quality would be their attachment to their respective leaders. Throughout the series there are very few cases of romance. Most of the intimate interactions in the anime are those between a ruler and his personal adviser/general. As for the main characters, the two shares a strong bond of rivalry from the start of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10.\\n\r\nThe main enjoyment to this series are watching the action itself. The battles are very cool to watch, and interaction between characters are variable and interesting. The end of every episode always sparks a sense of curiosity on how the war turned out in the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. ( Good )\\n\\n\r\n+ Ground-breaking actions\\n\r\n+ Beautiful graphic and character designs\\n\r\n+ Many weapon and skill variations to look forward to\\n\\n\r\n -/+  Exaggerated human power\\n\r\n -/+  Very few female characters compared to the quantity of male characters \\n\r\n -/+  Simple storyline, no need to think too much\\n\\n\r\n -  Too many names and terms to remember even in the beginning\\n\r\n -  Might confuse people who's not familiar with Japanese history\\n\r\n -  Soldiers as only an addition to the war, not the main factor.\\n",

There are historical elements involved, which is really what got me to watch it in the first place, but they don't go very in depth with it. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is for each individual to decide. I happen to think it's a little bit of both. The storyline is simple and easy to follow; almost too easy, in my opinion.\r\nThe animation and art was quite good. All of the characters are nice to lookat, and the battle sequences are well done. Music was good too. I particularly liked the ending and opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever played Dynasty Warriors? If so, you know exactly what Sengoku Basara is going to boil down to. I like to jokingly call it Dynasty Warriors, the anime. In the end, all this show is about, is a bunch of guys running around beating the shit out of each other. There might be a cut-scene or two, or a few minutes of character interaction here and there, but then we go back to endless battle after battle and forget there was ever supposed to be a story in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if that is your thing, then by all means, dive into Sengoku Basara. It certainly wasn't great, but it was a decent time killer. I did enjoy it, despite its short comings. I give it 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To all the people who like/love this anime: I'm sorry... but I find this anime so bad it's even offensive to the viewer.\r\nEverytime I have a conversation about anime where I need an example for a terrible work the first name that comes to my mind is Sengoku Basara. It is probably the worst anime i have ever seen. I never dropped an anime so fast and I probably never ever will again.\r\nBut everytime I shrugged off one reason to drop this anime, the next scene gave me another to just stop watching.\r\nThe dialogues are horrible, the characters are annoying, the fighting scenes are absurd,ridiculous and just bad.\\n\r\nThere is nothing that could possibly get you hooked. Well it could but only if you, for some reason, have a thing for useless fight scenes and bad character introductions and story-telling and uninspired works in general.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to all the people who say that this one refers to Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors....why would someone make an anime about that? Dynasty Warriors has no story and it doesn't need one. But an anime does. \\n\\n\r\nSengoku is a pretty interesting period of japanese history. It's the golden age of warriors and leaves room for billions of interesting narratives. But instead of taking the chance by doing a great somwhat historical anime, they come up with this bulls*** where some of the main characters do have historical names but for some reason also have some weird superpowers.\\n\r\nNot only do these superpowers seem misplaced...\\n\r\nThe thing with superpowers is that in order to make them interesting you got to find a way to give the viewer an idea of how they work. Sengoku Basara does none of it. It just throws explosions in your face because, you know, explosions are cool and badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so replaceable I forgot about them the moment their screentime ended. They were not interesting they were only a mix of different stereotypes. You get the feeling that you have seen each character introduced in the first episode a billion times before in many other titles.\\n\\n\r\nI won't lose another word about this....thing. It already stole 20 minutes of my life I will never get back. Don't watch it, except you're in the mood for some real trash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Even the low scored Brave 10  have a decent storyline... but surely, Sengoku Basara is good in terms of art. However, I could not continue watching this anime after the 1st episode... sorry fans...\r\nThe things I like in this anime is the art and animation. The characters look good and the fighting scenes are smooth...\r\nAs for the storyline, maybe those who play the game or know the history of this period would enjoy thisanime better... Though, since the story focuses on 'thirst for power' theme, Arslan Senki is better ( although it is not related era or period)... What I meant is how the story started and developed... The sudden fighting scenes in Sengoku Basara makes me lose interest for this anime.",

            "content": "Sengoku Basara was the first anime that got me hooked up just by listening to its opening song and it gave me a good impression as well in the beginning. \r\nInteresting part of this is, many people are confused about Sengoku Basara and Sengoku Musou, those two are both historically located during the Sengoku Period. Main difference between these two is that Sengoku Musou doesn't have any demon-like creatures.\r\nNow back to the anime itself, I will separate them.\r\n* Story (7) - The story here is pretty straightforward and it doesn't get that jumpy and such but I felt that it was a bit too rushed.Mainly because in the beginning they already started a war against Oda Nobunaga, and that the main plot that is holding the whole anime together, there's not a single sub-plot that will keep me focused, this is why I didn't binge-watched this anime. A little bit distraction from the main plot would help but it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I must, say the ending will either leave you greatly disappointed or greatly amused. Each person differs but I was left disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n* Art (10) - The animating style of this anime looks clean for me to watch, it feels smooth and it feels like you want to jump into action. Literally.\\n\\n\r\n* Sound (10) - The VAs did a good job on portraying their characters, and it fits to their background as well. You might think it is weird for Date Masamune for randomly saying English words but if you checked his background, he has some few connections whereas he picked up some words from them. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, it is simply beautiful, all themes fit perfectly whenever they are played and such. I especially like the background music from the last episode. It gives you the feeling of victory. Like the last attack will be the end. \\n\\n\r\n* Characters (8) - Unfortunately, we don't see much of character development, they are like that already in the beginning. We only see characters dying and such or getting hurt. But that is pretty much to it. \\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment (8) - I will definitely rewatch the series especially for those two main poster boys for Sengoku Basara, because whenever they fought it would always be an epic battle between those two. \\n\\n\r\nMemorable thing about this anime? The VA of Date Masamune and whenever he is speaking small English sentences or words. That always cracks me up or makes me smile or grin even. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that this review is helpful!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is, to sum it up, a mash-up of historical samurai characters and timeline and ridiculous powers. Don't get your excitements up if you have a mind of history because you won't find much here. There are battles such as Nagashino and Okehazama, but none of them follows what their historical counterpart did. \r\nThe story consist of a evil presence, known as Nobunaga Oda the Sixth Demon King, wishing to conquer the entire land of Japan. Fortunately, the clans of the East combined their might in order to defeat him. It sounds very clich\u00e9, but what do you expect in a samurai-bashing kind ofanime that ludicrous power destroys everything in its path.\\n\\n\r\nThe art never hinders the scenes, which is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nWhat mostly impressed me is the soundtrack, from traditional Japanese music to rock music. It always fits scenes when it's played.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters include One-eyed dragon Date Masamune, Yukimura Sanada, the Tiger of Kai Takeda Shingen, etc. All of them (or most of them) are or at least based on their historical counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt the anime is satisfying, but it's not the most impressive shonen anime I ever seen. There are certainly better ones, but this is still worth watching. Better give it a go than miss it.",

Each single character is entertaining to the last one, even the bad guys are fun to watch. And though it is a simple show, it has brief touches of sadness, and anger, and mixes of emotions and you cant help but cheer for sanada ordate. I consider it a very fun anime to watch and regard it highly.",
