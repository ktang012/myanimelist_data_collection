            "content": "Story: Pretty much all filler. Each episode stands alone except the ending and they don't really play off of each other. The series strays way too far from the Manga and doesn't explore the main parts where you see many characters develop themselves. I understand that the Manga has stories that end in one chapter and expansion is necessary to make the Anime but they could've handled it better. A similar style to the beginning of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu would've been cool where there were two stories split between an episode. Since chapters for To-Love-Ru are short, that would've been a great direction forthis show to take. However, this show's filler made me feel incredibly bored as most of the stories weren't even adapted from the Manga. They were original stories. Only some of the episodes were based off the Manga. The ending was disappointing but you can predict that it'll go nowhere anyway. A predictable \"plot\" and being composed of mostly ecchi scenes gets it a 5. I'll admit that a few of the episodes, maybe five of them, I really liked, thought they were well done, and made me laugh a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Better than I expected for a series like this. It was pretty consistent for each episode. Nothing looked too horrible to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing in the bgm caught my attention and the opening was just okay. As for the voice acting, I didn't really have a problem with anyone. No one was extremely annoying to listen to. They did a pretty good job here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I did enjoy watching some of the characters but a lot of them seemed neglected and didn't get much screen time, which kind of disappointed me. I know they're side characters but if they're going to show up more than a few times, make them do more than \"Oops, you can see my panties\" or accidentally get naked. I suppose in the end, I shouldn't expect more than that in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I finished it. That's a sign that I didn't completely hate it. Most of the episodes made me want to punch my screen though. They were that awful and stupid. So be careful with it. It's supposed to be comedy as well but it didn't spark too much laughter from me. I wouldn't say that they're trying too hard or anything like that. It's just that most of the pervy jokes, accidents and misunderstandings are things we've seen before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I wouldn't mind a second series since they have more material to pull from and I enjoyed the Manga. It would be great to see certain stories animated. I just did not like how this turned out because despite the Manga being mostly stand alone stories, the creators of this show felt the need to make their own plots for many episodes... Would I recommend this to anyone? Not really since I can basically describe this as generic. It's nothing outstanding and there's a lot of \"typicalness\" to it. If anything, for those new to Anime it might just be their first ecchi comedy because if you start watching Anime, you'll run into these somewhere along the line unless you're very selective and careful.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.",

            "content": "Well.. Where do I start.. Hmmmm\r\nWell I watched this series due to a suggestion in the recommendations of Rosario + Vampire.. Although the shows are both somewhat similar.. I expected a bit more out of the series.\r\nLet me start with this.. there are to me.. two seasons to this series basically..and the second series starts somewhere around episode 14.. but.. too be quite honest in my opinion.. Episodes 18-24 are basically OVAs that are stuffed in.. I mean.. There is the story of Kyoto the Fire Girl..a entire episode about a show Lala and Rito watch on television.. which had absolutely nothing to do withanything.. There is an episode (23) that is adapted to Japanese folk tales which is really neat and informative.. but it has absolutely nothing to do with the storyline.. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes though.. 1-10 kept me well entertained.. and I laughed alot.. and the art is done really well.. and of course.. the fanservice is about the only thing that kept me interested enough to watch it.. the girls are very busty.. and very beautiful.. lol.. its hard not to enjoy Lala .. because shes buxom and clueless most of the time.. I liked most of the characters in this.. I didnt find any I didnt really care for much.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED are decent.. they sort of fit the general feel of the show.. if you like ecchi.. youll love the OP .. lol.. indeed.. \\n\\n\r\nSo let me warn you with this in closing.. if you dont like fanservice/ecchi ..pass this up.. because its the only thing that keeps this series somewhat afloat.. due to the fact that its so accessive it makes you giggle a bit..\\n\\n\r\nWould I suggest this anime? .... Yes... but to someone who just wants to watch something maybe as a change of pace or a break from a anime they just watched with a really deep storyline.. or if you just want to see alot of half naked girls with a couple laughs lol.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

Again.\r\nOh look,he got embarrassed again.\\n\r\nOh look, he got embarrassed again.\\n\r\nOh look, he got embarrassed again.\\n\\n\r\nGod knows how many rules I'm breaking, since I haven't finished watching this anime (I'm on episode 14), and there are one or two insignificant spoilers in that list above. (Insignificant because, so far, and most likely in the future, that haven't and won't be developed upon in anyway).\\n\\n\r\nBut already I recognise this anime to be an annoyance which is all mere filler (no plot development except for the first two episodes), and what makes it worse is the travesty that is Rito's character; he is utterly annoying and unbearable in large doses. The most grinding little twat in the history of Japanese animation. \\n\\n\r\nHis character, along with his voice actor, make him a idiot weakling who overreacts or gets majorly embarrassed at every single little detail good or bad, resulting in an utterly pathetic and downright annoying character who makes the show nearly unbearable to watch. He\u2019s far too loud and far too annoying. And my overuse of the word \"annoying\" is even annoying me, but I can't say anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThere has been absolutely no character development from any character in this series, (only new characters get introduced here and there), especially from Rito (although by ep. 14 he has stated he will change (I won't say how) but I predict the show will continue to plod along. Never changing).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that keeps me here is the fan service, and that never keeps me around for long without an interesting plot (which there isn't, since it's all unrelated filler) and a bearable main character around (which there isn't, for the reasons above.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I give this 3 instead of 1, since the characters of Lala and Haruna are pretty much spot on and well suited to their other aspects (appearance, relationships with other characters etc etc) and are mildly interesting. Zastin speaks for himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd like to give this anime 5, the extra 3 in recognition of Lala, Haruna, and Zastin, but the cons of this \"anime\" outweigh the pros brought by these 3 characters, so I give To-LOVE-Ru a 2: Dreadful.\\n\\n\r\nI hope the manga isn\u2019t like this.",

            "content": "This is just mindless, fun entertainment.\r\nAlright so the story of To Love Ru is about a boy name Yuuki Rito who gropes a pink-haired alien name Lala who is the princess of Deviluke. After trying to confess his feelings to a girl, Haruna Sairenji, he accidentally confesses to Lala and says to him \"Lets get married\". From there on Rito tries to get out of the relationship with Lala, but has other things in his way that actually makes him closer to her. The plot does get more of a serious tone towards the end of the anime, but overall it's just a fun anime.\r\nMyfavorite character in this show is without a doubt Lala. She is one of my all time favorite female characters. I don't know why but I like characters like her. This charismatic, upbeat, joyful personality and always having a positive outlook no matter how bad the situation. Even though Rito accidentally \"proposed\" to her. Lala loves Rito with all her heart and you can see in the show that she is devoted to him. Speaking of Rito he is a clumsy pervert. Literally think of every way to accidentally cop a feel and he does it. He doesn't like to think of himself as a pervert he just is really clumsy. And yes that is a running gag in this show. I also like that unlike other harem male leads, Rito doesn't want a harem he just gets tangled up into one.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in my opinion is pretty funny. Even though some people can get irritated with running gags, but I just love them.\\n\\n\r\nDo I think To Love Ru is great. No. In all honesty the story is pretty stupid, but is it funny and entertaining Yes. I think this show is very good, has likable characters, nice music and voice acting. If you don't like ecchi anime then you're going to dislike this show. Overall I say give it a watch.",

            "content": "To-Love-Ru was a huge disappointment for me. The series had so much potential, but in the end, turned out to be one big failure... It had no plot whatsoever, beside the first few episodes, which introduced the \"story\". No plot progression for characters as well, what they did was throw in a few new characters during the show and there it ended. They could use much more interesting turn of events and character progression it even hurts to think about it.\r\nAnother thing I have to point out - the humor in this series is simply NOT FUNNY... AT ALL. The only one who actually mademe laugh was Zastin - he's a genious, not to mention his seiyuu is Takehito Koyasu and he's one of my favorites (Adam Blade from Needless, Shark Fujishiro from Seto no Hanayome, Luke Valentine from Hellsing...). Still wasn't worth it... \\n\\n\r\nSound and animation are OK I guess, nothing special but not great either. Too much tenticle service also brought it down for me, though other echii scenes were decent. There were a few, only a FEW normal episodes, yet they also weren't satisfying, the rest were simply dreadful. When I got to the 9~10's episode, I thought I'm gonna quit, but still gave it another chance - that was a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I did not enjoy the series at all and would not recommed it to anyone. Bad humor, poor story, no character progression... Overall - bad, very bad. One of my friends saw it before me, he said \"whatever you do - do not watch this anime\", but I still gave it a shot... Should've listened to him in the first place...",

            "content": "Story: From the fanservice and the OP it pretty obvious that this show is a harem. If you've watched Harem/ecchi/romance-comedy anime before you wont really find anything groundbreaking about this anime.  So if you don't like these kinds of shows, I suggest you stay away. It is basically your multi-sided struggle over the main male character. I personally have no problems with the alien/marriage theme, but I find the plot of this series all to predictable.\r\nArt: For a new show the animation quality is what you would call decent. Its not high quality, but it isn't crap either (although the first episode did seemto be on the low quality side). In spite of a few sequences (of course the perverted scenes are always drawn a little better to capture the interest of the viewer), I was surprised that the quality was not as good as I expected to be. So if you like top notch designed and colored anime, don't expect it to be the next high def series off the market.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for this series is not bad. The OP and ED singles are great. I personally prefer the OP over the ED, but its really a matter of taste in music. The BGM has yet to play a role in the series so far, so it really is not much you can say about it as of yet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I find the cast in general pretty generic, with a few exceptions. The male protagonist strikes me as the one of the most generic, if not THE MOST, characters in the entire series. It literally seems as if he was taken from another romance-comedy series and molded with a different character design. The same could be said for other characters as well who more or less resemble characters from other anime (though have yet to be developed or revealed).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  If really can't decide whether or not you want to watch this, I dont blame you, I find the show a bit iffy, even though I do like harem shows a lot. Like I said, there is nothing really distinctive about this series which explains my semi-disinterest (for the lack of a better term) in this series.",

            "content": "'To Love-ru' is an anime with one exclusive purpose - to supply the viewer with a fresh uninterrupted stream of ecchi, served with a side of slightly cliche but still grin inducing comedy. Now this is only going to work for those who are really into ecchi/comedy or something light-hearted in general as 'To love-ru' lacks any semblance of a plot and is entirely episodic. One common occurrence that I've noticed during my time on MAL is that people will usually go into these type of series knowing full well what they are and then complain about it afterwards anyway. This anime is targeting avery specific audience and if you do not fall within the boundaries of that audience then you will naturally end up bored or even despise the series. You can guess which side of the camp I'm on.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"plot\" of this anime is a no brainer. There's a fragile looking teenage boy (Yuuki Rito) who has tremendous difficulties dealing with the opposite sex. One day a female alien (Lala) teleports to his bathroom & he \"accidentally\" gropes some boobs and all hell breaks loose. After that incident, as if through some divine prank, our hero finds himself randomly bumping into women's private parts like a blind man at an orgy. Things only keep getting more hectic from then on as the protagonists unintentional shenanigans intensify exponentially until the whole thing goes positively FUBAR.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. That's your whole plot described right there. What happens between that initial introduction and the ending is more or less plot insignificant and for the most part features side-stories and fillers alike - all aimed at giving you as much ecchi as possible and increasing your chances of having a stroke. And 'Love-ru' doesn't mess around either. In some episodes they'll give you buck-naked characters for your viewing pleasure within a few seconds after the opening song. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the only noticeably interesting quality of this anime, in my opinion. The comedy here might not be anything novel in the ecchi genre but it is very easy to understand and follow. You won't need a degree in Japanese history or the inside knowledge of the anime industry to get the jokes here. Most of the comedy is slapstick and centered around surrealistic situations. Girls popping out of nowhere to hug a peeing man who then proceeds to pee all over himself, the toilet and the hall of his school while running frantically... is pretty surrealistic to me unless times have moved on and that's what teenagers in highschools now do to kill time.\\n\\n\r\n The art is precise and for an ecchi anime it has to be anyway, since the visual aspect is half of the success here. This series' primary focus on female characters can be easily seen and especially the clothing they have on. However all other things have also been drawn with attention to detail. The overall quality is very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/voice acting is likewise good but surprisingly the \"OST\" of this anime is recycled. I've heard some of the songs used here in other animes, one notable example being 'Sister Princess'. It makes the series seem more generic, then again the OST is not what you'll want to be focusing on here. Of course the opening and ending is still unique and befitting of an ecchi series.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the most dreaded part of the review. Enjoyment. The most difficult time for a reviewer comes right after he/she finishes a particular anime. Not before or during but after the anime ends. You have to sum your feelings up and express them but also make a recommendation to potential readers. So I'll say this - if you're unsure or don't like ecchi mixed in with comedy don't watch this. You'll hate it, leave a rating of 2 and curse the producers. When Xebec, TBS and Sentai Filmworks sat down together on this project, it was decided from the outset that it was going to target a rather narrow audience and that audience will be able to appreciate the fact that this anime is very good at what it does - ecchi entertainment. For everyone else however, it will be a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nI for one enjoyed it as 'To Love-ru' served its intended purpose. The story is lacking considerably, at times it's camp as hell but none of that matters because that's not what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\n8 points from me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For the love of god, PLEASE read the manga. I must say; if there has ever been an anime that tainted the name of the manga more than tsubassa chronicles, To Love-Ru would be up there.\r\nThis is not to say that the anime is a complete train wreck. In fact, the first two episodes are fantastic in my opinion. They had it all down pat: The engaging story, the hilarious, embarrassing, over the top ecchiness, the art quality. Twas fantastic.\r\nThen came the filler onslaught. I thought by grabbing hard onto the pages of the manga that the storm of pointless stories may not pulverize me,but it seems it was hopeless. Every episode I would say to myself, &quot;now, this has GOT to be the last filler,&quot; and then WHADDYAKNOW? another one shows up. Man, I wish I could punch TV shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that always bugged me about To Love-Ru was that the manga had all this great material up for grabs, and the first 6 episodes of the anime were very loyal to the manga. Then for the next 18 episodes, I would say about 3 were based off of actual manga chapters. Why? I certainly wouldn't know, but apparently the producers thought lame fillers would satisfy us.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the manga was so much better than the anime that I found myself looking down on this TV show. Maybe I'm wrong. A lot of people like this anime, and I enjoy it as well. It just bugs me how the show had so much potential, and then let us down as viewers. First 6 episodes I given an absolute 10, and the fillers about 5. If you have time, then watch this, but there are better harem animes.",

            "content": "to-LOVE-Ru, a slice of life romantic comedy.  Now its an adaptation of the manga, and as far as I can tell, it only adheres to the source material in spirit.  Not that there is a problem with that.  It'd be rather unfair to compare it manga anyway.\r\nFirst up is the plot, or the lack thereof.  They work quite well as standalone episodes, since there is not much continuity among them.  However, there are some plot holes here and there.  I still can't find the point in the anime that explains how Run ends up liking Rito.  They eventacked on a mini-arc at the end which brought the show to somewhat of a conclusion.  It may have been hasty but there was little else they probably could have done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, in tune with the spirit of the manga is very, ahem refreshing with judiciously placed art and lighting.  Though there is a tinge of reuse and the feeling of loss when some scenes could not be depicted due to the violence (which has many reasons as to why it is so).  The art shifts in certain episodes are a well done as well.  Overall, quite good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however, is not something to write home about.  It is adequate for the scenes depicted, but there is nothing special of note in it.  Same goes for the background music.  The OP and EDs are well done though and I am sucker for the guitar entrance of the OP.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, romantic comedies thrive on status quo, which requires that the relationships between characters stay the same.  Quite so as is the case with To-LOVE-Ru's main characters.  The love triangle that started has never progressed, and apart from the rare episode where we get to see Lala in another light (even then, they pressed the reset button at the end).  However, surprisingly enough, its the secondary characters that get explored a bit more.  Though some get very few episodes, or none at all, its quite easy to see that they are people themselves.  This is a far cry from the same old indecisive Rito, shy Haruna and energetic Lala.\\n\\n\r\nQuibbles aside, it is an enjoyable show.  It really is more comfort food, nothing ground breaking but its not a total failure in following the formula though.  There is not much else going for it except for the art, so I recommend this only for those who just want some eye candy.  Besides if you're feeling jealous of the male lead, you know they're doing something right.  Still, in real life, you'd have to go out and find trouble.  But in to-LOVE-Ru, trouble finds you!",

            "content": "\"Rito~\"\r\nStory: Well, the story isn't better than your average ecchi/harem/comedy anime. The protagonist always gets into \"misunderstandable positions\" with the girls whom all seem to feel something to the protagonist. All the space business doesn't help either. If you ever expect something more than this, to-LOVE-Ru is not for you.\r\n7/10\r\nArt: The art is what I'd call typical for your average ecchi anime. It's not bad, but it's not ultra high quality of course. I found no reason to make it high quality when all the fans of harem would watch it unless it has seems like it's from 1990s. Don't ask me how those rippedoff clothes are replaced.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: saikou no chansu Now is the time! minogasanai- Oops sorry about that. I must say that the OP and ED of to-LOVE-Ru is pretty catchy. Especially after you watch them over and over again \"for various reasons.\" Though I like the OP more, the ED isn't unbearable or anything. For background music, I can't really decide. It surely isn't the type I'd download buy, but it doesn't have any moments that I feel the loss of background music. The seiyuu cast is good too. It's my first time listening to Tomatsu Haruka, but her voice as Lala is really cute ^^ And Rito is of course voiced by a girl.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I must say that none of the characters can be classified as unique (well, maybe Lala's dad, but you get the point.) BUT, even though they are not unique, they are not rip-offs (not counting our usual extremely lucky \"but-i-love-both-of-them\" Rito of course.) The girls are all lovely as expected. Aside from the main interests, there are many funny (and somehow unique) side characters in the show, all being aliens. Ranging from cute little to absolutely perverted monsters, they will manage to make you laugh quite a few times.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Comedic aspect of to-LOVE-Ru can always be noticed. There weren't any comedic moments that seemes \"dull\" to me, but that of course depends on how much you like ecchi. I take that back, you may find it funny even if you don't like it that much.This anime is much more than being extremely ecchi version of a certain anime made with absolutely nothing in mind.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like ecchi/harem/comedy genres and laugh out loud when the protagonist goes on a series of misunderstandings just to get hit by the girl he loves, this is the anime for you. A daily of ecchi keeps doctors away.\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "To LOVE-Ru is a pretty standard harem anime with the usual sickeningly innocent protagonist with unbelievable luck with women falling at his feet. This anime is full of fan service, I mean packed full, there isn't an episode without a decent amount of ecchi scenes. Despite the fan service and dull story it is still a pretty funny and fun to watch anime, with the following continuation to Motto To LOVE-Ru and To LOVE-Ru Darkness being very enjoyable to watch.\r\nWhat I loved about the To LOVE-Ru series as a whole (all 3 seasons), was the enjoyment. This anime made me laugh but was fun anduplifting throughout, it was just very pleasant to watch. I'm not one to watch anime one handed but the fan service usually came with a laugh so it added to the anime without being purely for fan service sake. The romance in the anime is enjoyable to watch unfold albeit a bit frustrating sometimes but overall it was sweet and really makes you envy the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked about the To LOVE-Ru series was the repetitiveness. They re-used so much over and over. Almost all the jokes came from the same misunderstandings, basically all the comedy came from misunderstandings. Almost every episode followed the same format, a flower or invention would do the same thing and the outcome would be the same and it got a bit tiresome. This series is incredibly predictable, you can easily guess what is about to happen and it ruins a lot of moments. I disliked how the main characters and side characters roles kept changing so much throughout the series, some characters would disappear and reappear whenever it suited the writers to throw them in, it really devalued any character progression when their roles were messed around so much. I disliked how the first season had 26 mediocre episodes and the much better follow up seasons only had 12 episodes each. \\n\\n\r\n(Story: 7/10) \\n\r\nThe story of To LOVE-Ru the first season takes place over 26 episodes. I've watched some great anime that told an entire story over 26 episodes, and yet this anime did nothing over 26 episodes. There is basically no story to the first series, it's really just showing the day to day life and events of the characters. Well there is a story but its overshadowed by the fan service and random events that it becomes almost unimportant. After 10 episodes I was about to drop this anime but I'm glad I didn't. To LOVE-Ru is the first season, followed by Motto and then Darkness. The first season is nothing special at all but the following seasons make up for it, they are much much better in every way and are thoroughly enjoyable. The story and enjoyment factor goes up with every season, the first season (To LOVE-Ru) for me would be a 7/10 at a push, the next season (Motto To LOVE-Ru) a much better 8/10 and the final season (To LOVE-Ru Darkness) a strong 9/10 in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely mention the art of anime series because I like contrast between different series with their own unique style of drawing and colouring. I will however say that the art of To LOVE-Ru was nothing impressive at all but I was really impressed with the next two seasons, a lot of work was put into the vivid colours of Motto and Darkness with a nice soft feeling on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime as a whole and I will be watching any new episodes they bring out but it has a lot of flaws and is far from perfect which is expected from a harem anime I suppose. My tip would be to not watch this anime around your family, it would raise too many questions I feel if anyone saw what you were watching. Since the anime is so immersed in fan service you should get the uncensored DVD versions which have better quality and are uncensored so you don't have to stare at mist and sunshine and can actually watch the series as it was meant to be watched.",

            "content": "WARNING: TO FULLY EXPRESS MY OPINION THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS OF THE SHOW, ONLY READ IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo Love Ru is quite honestly a show that has left me conflicted in almost every aspect, even in regards to how to rate and review the show. What I will say is this: if you're looking for a lighthearted, ecchi show which is based around just being plain ridiculous for the sake of comedy, then this is the show for you. However regardless of the Romance tag, if you're looking for any kind of deeper romance withinthe show then don't bother, you would only be disappointed. If you are also looking for I suppose what you could consider a story and story progression then I would also not recommend this show. Aside from the introductory episodes and the last 3 or so episodes, there really isn't story progression. The show is episodic in that (outside of the parts I mentioned), each episode isn't really going through a story and is individual, because at the start of the next episode it's as if the previous didn't really happen. Therefore the main chunk of the series in the middle between the introduction and ending 3 episodes is like this. Now personally I don't have a massive issue with this as I feel like this was the intention as it is hardly a serious series. But it's my warning if you are looking for some kind of progressive story.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said, onto why i'm personally conflicted. I love the characters in the show. A lot of them are vibrant, individual characters with lots of personality. Lala is a good example of this. However the problem is that barely any of the characters thrown in are fleshed out whatsoever. Because of that, a lot of the characters just lack something for me. Now as this is a silly, over the top show aimed at being a comedy, I hardly expected massive individual episodes for characters with character development; but if there are gonna be characters popping up each episode I want them to at least have some substance or development. This is the main problem with the characters for me. That every single episode, every single character is forced into it for the sake of them doing individual roles that they always do. I think the hot springs episode is a good example of this, where every character turned up for seemingly no reason just for the sake of them being there. 90% of the characters just do the same thing every episode and that's why they're there. For example how Golden Darkness is there to just do the whole 'Yeah i'm trying to kill you but i'll help you this one time' thing and how Haruna is just there for Rito to be attracted to and for them to do the same 'trying to confess but speak over each other and then be interrupted' thing which happens at least 5-10 times. Personally, as much as I love the character designs and some of the actually developed ones, most of them I don't as they're completely one-dimensional with no development and are simply there to fulfil one comedic role in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is a personal opinion of mine about the show. I'm not 100% as I haven't read the manga, or at least not yet, so i'm not sure if the adaptation from the manga is the reasoning but.. I don't feel as if the season should have been 26 episodes long. Getting towards the end it just felt far too dragged out. If the season had been 12-13 episodes in length I believe it would have felt like a better use of time. In these 12-13 episodes they could still have had the first 2 or so as introductions and the last 3 how they were too with actual progression. Then between this they could still have had a decent amount of the filler like, ridiculous episodes in the middle chunk. Because personally having around 20 episodes in the middle of the show be the ridiculous stuff was just far too much to sit through. However, as I said at the beginning, I haven't yet read the manga and so they may have wanted to try and keep the anime exactly to the source material which is why everything was included. But regardless, as I stated I believe the season could have been better in 12-13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow. The harem aspect of the show really confused me. Whilst Rito was in fact surrounded by plenty of females, again most of them felt underdeveloped and irrelevant. Lala is the main female, being engaged to Rito and living with him. There is also Haruna who has a thing for Rito and Rito has had a crush on since he was a young child. There is also Run, the female version of Ren, who has a big thing for Rito, however this is only really shown in 1-2 episodes. Aside from this, everything else is irrelevant. Every other female shows no actual romantic or love interest towards Rito, as is suggested in it being a harem. The other females just pop up in episodes to push the comedy of specific situations and that's really it. So therefore you're left with Lala, who makes sense as they're engaged, Haruna, who became annoying to me as her only purpose of every coming into the episode was the crush thing between her and Rito, and also the 1 or maybe 2 episodes around Run having a crush on Rito. That's it. To me, it felt bland.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the note of the harem, I unfortunately did what I decide never to do with harems and settled for the person I wanted to see the MC (Rito) end up being with. This was Lala. However, there was reason behind this. To me, it's what made the most sense. They were engaged from the start, and regardless of this being an accidental situation it was still the best choice for me. Lala and Rito grew and developed around each other. Not only were they practically the only characters to get real development for themselves and the relationship between them, but they were also the only two characters who had different purposes in different episodes and weren't just one-dimensional characters. Unlike all the other females in the show, Lala had lots of personality and developed a lot from first arriving on earth up to the end. Now there's mostly two sides to this. A lot of people want Lala and Rito to be together, and a lot seem to want Rito and Haruna together. To me, this was a big part of the plot. Due to the romance tag I was hoping for Rito to end up with someone. Also honestly Rito was a pretty hopeless MC, so I was hoping he would at least go through and marry Lala as planned. \\n\r\nI don't like Haruna. Haruna is Hinata from Naruto but far worse. And by this I mean quite literally all Haruna does is blush and says 'Yuki-kun..', that's all. She's one of the most bland girls because that's all she does every episode. Rito only considers her because of his child crush he has had on her. That's why I always wanted Rito to take the Lala route and so the season could end with Rito ending up marrying the most fleshed out and best female character. \\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, this doesn't happen. I saw a lot of praise for the final episode however I wholeheartedly disagree with all of my being. I like the final 3 episodes with actual progression. Firstly Rito at last exclaims his love for Lala, bringing her back from her flu. When this happened I was finally satisfied as things were going in a good direction. However, towards the end, firstly for whatever reason Rito still can't get over his ridiculous thing for Haruna.. I understand the idea of having a crush on someone since you were young, but really? That VS actual love and care you've built up from living and spending time with someone?? Seems far-fetched. Especially when Rito barely develops anything with Haruna, he simply speaks to her a few times and even then the conversations are basically nothing. Whereas with Lala Rito lived with her, spent time with her, actually communicated with her and so had actual reasoning for his feelings towards her. Whereas the thing with Haruna is nothing more than just a crush. But regardless of that, Rito finally gets through all the trials and tribulations put forward by Lala's dad so he can have permission to marry Lala and save earth. So everything is finally going in a good, progressive direction. So what could possibly go wrong, right? Well. WELL. Last minute, quite literally just as they're about to get married, Lala for the first time does a complete 180 and cuts off the marriage. IT HURT. Her personality had remained exactly the same throughout the entire series (besides the one episode where the joke is her personality changing each day) and so it was out of no where. Rito had finally confessed his love, and then suddenly with basically no explanation given she cut off the marriage and tried to erase everyone's memories.\\n\r\nI guess i'm just most upset because it was so sudden and there was no reasoning given outside of her briefly saying something along the lines of 'I've put Rito through a lot of pain' and that's it. Now, this is true, however that's the point! Lala was always a handful. She arrived suddenly on earth and Rito and her were suddenly engaged to be married. She was very hyperactive and crazy, doing crazy things, making crazy inventions etc. But that was really part of her charm. Lala and Rito built their relationship up from that, learning about each other, taking care of each other and spending time with each other. This led up to Rito confessing his love to her. I'm in belief that the whole reasoning is that she could see the conflict Rito felt in his feelings between her and Haruna, and that just annoys me. Because if that's the case then if Rito could have just realised that his feelings towards Haruna are pretty much completely superficial then everything could have worked out fine and the marriage could have taken place. My second theory is simply that this was done intentionally by the writers for the sake of the rest of the series as there are plenty more seasons. That i'm not sure of at the moment, but will come to find out when I watch them.\\n\r\nBut as I said earlier, Rito was a seemingly useless MC, and so all I wanted was for him to go through with this marriage so he could at least have done something worthwhile. \\n\r\nThe ending honestly just left me feeling empty. I got a similar feeling to when I watched the Oreimo ending (though i'm obviously not going into detail about that, but if you know then you know). \\n\\n\r\nIt just made me sad.\\n\\n\r\nSO IN CONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nDue to everything aforementioned I found it very difficult to judge this anime. This is the first review I've done on this account and just wanted to do it since I was left with so many conflicting emotions. So overall, I really like the characters. I think that they're all very vibrant and different design wise and all fill very different roles and there is a character for each common anime trope such as a tsundere etc. I liked the art in general, it all looked pretty good consistently and there weren't any moments where I thought the animation was particularly poor. I got a relative amount of enjoyment out of the season. It was designed to be very lighthearted in many senses and just be a ridiculous, over the top comedy. So to that effect, I enjoyed it. However:\\n\r\nAs also mentioned before, I feel like either the personality of the characters should have been fleshed out and developed more as they had 26 episodes to do so, or that they should have done the same but made the season only 12-13 episodes so it doesn't feel like there's just some over abundance of filler. And finally, in terms of a romance it left me dead inside. There was one obvious choice for the MC, one in which it would have been a good ending and would have shown some kind of progression for the MC, however this was cut off literally within the last 10 minutes of the season. I'm still sad.\\n\\n\r\nSo my overall review would be if you wanted to watch the series: If you don't mind the notion of there being almost no story progression, character development for most characters and all ideas of a romance being tossed in the trash last minute and instead you're just looking for a typical, over the top harem comedy, then this is definitely for you.\\n\\n\r\nOh but also that if you end up loving Lala as is very easy to do so, and want to see the romance progress, you'll be left empty like me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I may be left dead and empty inside; but because I loved the characters and foolishly hold onto some false hope i'm going to continue to watch through the other To Love Ru seasons and maybe one day write another review for one of them if they effect me to quite the same extent as this one did.",

            "content": "So I completed this series not but a few days ago and believe that I'm finally ready to review it.The basis of this series is we have alien (Lala)who comes to earth trying to escape capture who meets this \"unfortunate\" fellow (Rito) who seems to be this socially inept loser who can't ask out the girls of his dreams (Haruna); events happen and by some strange coincidence Rito ends up engaged to Lala which throws his whole entire world into a spin of alien encounters, comedy, romance and ecchi. So for those of you wondering is this something new no absolutely not but is thissomething enjoyable...short answer yes long answer maybe leaning towards a yes.\\n\r\nStory- Yeah the story is not that complex it's a love comedy ecchi so it has pretty much everything you expect (mandatory hot spring episode you for some reason cannot have an ecchi series without one). Basically it adds a few new swings to the whole scene but basically most episodes are scenes and scenarios that if you've watched pretty much any other series that focuses around the same general plot you've seen it before. My opinion not so bad I was glad to see something new at all seeing as most series today lack even the creativity to try and come up with a new idea or twist to make their series interesting. Although I'm telling you now I subtracted one point from story because there was one episode in the series that just had nothing at all to do with the story line in any way form of fashion and it only pissed me off for the next week that I had watched it so yeah (its episode 20 for those of you who wish to know).\\n\r\nArt- Okay yes the art was really good. I mean it's not my eyes are bleeding from beauty good but it make you stop and admire it for a while good but this is actually becoming very common today especially in series where the basis is a form of love comedy.\\n\r\nSound- No joke the sounds were pretty good everything matched up all the sounds were smooth and best of all the voice acting was incredible.\\n\r\nCharacter- Well yeah it's not as though we haven't seen these kinds of characters types before and you'll know what I mean the instant you watch this series but what kept me from completely flunking this series on characters were the unique and innovative styles innovating to make them unique I mean typically we can just point and go generic character #2 but in this case even though it is generic character #2 it is an interesting version of them with some new twists put onto their character type (alright not completely true but you will notice that some characters do not always act as you expect them too).\\n\r\nEnjoyment- So how do I feel after finishing this series...pretty good actually. It had an acceptable story line a decent moving pace and in my opinion a pretty good ending.\\n\r\nSo do I recommend this series as a matter of fact I do if you like comedy or ecchi this is definitely the series for you although I'm warning you in advance if you expecting a lot of drama, romance, and especially action you will be sorely disappointed. And once again a word of warning don't waste your time watching episode 20.",

It takes a cute manga and adds in some of the most dross filler in anime period. We're not even going to bother talking about the cast, because the paper they drew the sketches of these characters on has more depth than 90% of the cast. Aside from maybe chief heroine Lala, who's cute, likable, but a little grating at times, the only decent characters are Rito's little sister, the calm and supporting Mikan, and busty, alien school nurse Ryouko Mikado, the only other character with a functional brain.(Though you might be tempted to question that, since she is the one who tasked two high-schoolers with running a huge inn... while in the middle of their school year?) And of course, we'd be remiss to leave out the principal of everyone's school, whom we kept wondering why he was allowed to keep his job. Or even walk around free to randomly sexually assault girls, which he does in almost every single one of his appearances.",

And since To Love-ru was made relatively recently, the animation quality was very well done.\r\nNow that I've got all the positive factors out of the way, its time for some good ol' criticism. The music was not great or memorable and the characters were cliched, but there was one thing that topped them all. To Love-ru flirts with the borders between ecchi humor and hentai. There is often tentacle monster fondling, but in those situations, there is usually a clothes barrier between the tentacles and theskin (though the tentacles do reach in between the legs a few times).\\n\\n\r\nSo say your watching this anime at home and one of these scenes occurs as your mom is about to walk by. Do you keep watching because it's not actually hentai, or do you try to block the screen so she can't see and look even more suspicious to her?\\n\\n\r\nNow i am not saying that ecchi humor is bad or that hentai sucks, but I would prefer knowing what catagory an anime falls under. To Love-ru just felt weird as I was watching it. It failed to create a viewer friendly atmosphere for me, but who knows you might enjoy it. It's just not my cup of tea.",

He spends easily a majority of the anime obsessing over a girl, because of flowers, and he makes the typical clueless male trope seem like a genius. The show itself has little plot, and seems filled with nothing but filler, using the main love interest, Lala, as fanservice, and the inner thoughts of a truly idiotic male protagonist. The show had plenty of potential for a good story, and character growth, but it's squandered to over the top fan service, and the idea that the protagonist is in lovewith the girl he's obsessed with, Haruna. Haruna herself is more of a side character, but feels forced in an attempt to make her a main character. The art work is very good. The sound is good. The characters are mostly uninteresting with the exception of Lala, and a couple others. If you're coming for an interesting romance, and a good, thought out story, stay away. Hell, run like Jason Vorhees was chasing you in an 80s slasher flick. If you came for fan service, and over the top goofiness, then this is your show.",

She ran away from home because her father wants her to get married. She wanted to marry Rito and then fell in love with him.

            "content": "To LOVE-Ru is an anime that is often conveniently brushed aside due to the unprecedented crave for an elaborate plot. People seem to have disregarded the time and effort set forth in the creation of anime as well as any form of entertainment. Nothing can be considered perfect because even if everyone in the universe adores it, there will always be those select few who escort hatred. The overall intention of any form of entertainment is to captivate the audience by whatever means necessary. To LOVE-Ru positively secures this feat.\r\nJust so everyone is aware, To LOVE-Ru is an ecchi (perverted) anime, so be fully preparedfor excessive amounts of breast fondling and panty shots. In fact it may even surpass your initial expectations of the ecchi genre. With that established, if you are seeking an exstensive development, crowded with suspense and tear jerking moments, I would firmly advise you search in the opposite direction. You would have a better chance of slamming a revolving door. However, If you are scouting exceptional comedy accomanied by attractive characters and art that perscribes eye-gasms you my friend have discovered the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that To LOVE-Ru obtains such a generous amount of characters I will only talk about the frequently displayed ones. The dominate male figure Yuuki Rito is a 15 year old boy who lives with his younger sister Mikan. Rito has a crush on Sairenji Haruna, a fellow classmate. However, Rito is too shy to confess his love. I feel sorry for him because every oppourtinity he inherits to confess, something insane happens which negates his intentions. While I do bear sorrow, I also carry envy towards Rito because of the seemingly unlimited harem he obtains throughout the series. This is ironic because this \"ladies man\" is infact voiced by a woman, which I did not realize until post completion of the anime. Deviluke Lala Satalin, often reffered to as Lala, is an alluring alien princess who is introduced after teleporting inside Rito's home, in the attempt to escape relentless persuers. This in return leads Rito to recieve \"quite a handfull\" of responsibilty.\\n\\n\r\nThe illiustration in To LOVE-Ru can be presented as refreshing and compliments the story and cast thourougly. This anime presents any and all types of female characters imaginable. Tsunderes, Lolitas and everything in between. Although To LOVE-Ru won't make you cry it will deliver a gratifying experience which all fans of the ecchi/comedy genre should venture.",

            "content": "Story: Pretty much all filler. Each episode stands alone except the ending and they don't really play off of each other. The series strays way too far from the Manga and doesn't explore the main parts where you see many characters develop themselves. I understand that the Manga has stories that end in one chapter and expansion is necessary to make the Anime but they could've handled it better. A similar style to the beginning of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu would've been cool where there were two stories split between an episode. Since chapters for To-Love-Ru are short, that would've been a great direction forthis show to take. However, this show's filler made me feel incredibly bored as most of the stories weren't even adapted from the Manga. They were original stories. Only some of the episodes were based off the Manga. The ending was disappointing but you can predict that it'll go nowhere anyway. A predictable \"plot\" and being composed of mostly ecchi scenes gets it a 5. I'll admit that a few of the episodes, maybe five of them, I really liked, thought they were well done, and made me laugh a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Better than I expected for a series like this. It was pretty consistent for each episode. Nothing looked too horrible to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing in the bgm caught my attention and the opening was just okay. As for the voice acting, I didn't really have a problem with anyone. No one was extremely annoying to listen to. They did a pretty good job here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I did enjoy watching some of the characters but a lot of them seemed neglected and didn't get much screen time, which kind of disappointed me. I know they're side characters but if they're going to show up more than a few times, make them do more than \"Oops, you can see my panties\" or accidentally get naked. I suppose in the end, I shouldn't expect more than that in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I finished it. That's a sign that I didn't completely hate it. Most of the episodes made me want to punch my screen though. They were that awful and stupid. So be careful with it. It's supposed to be comedy as well but it didn't spark too much laughter from me. I wouldn't say that they're trying too hard or anything like that. It's just that most of the pervy jokes, accidents and misunderstandings are things we've seen before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I wouldn't mind a second series since they have more material to pull from and I enjoyed the Manga. It would be great to see certain stories animated. I just did not like how this turned out because despite the Manga being mostly stand alone stories, the creators of this show felt the need to make their own plots for many episodes... Would I recommend this to anyone? Not really since I can basically describe this as generic. It's nothing outstanding and there's a lot of \"typicalness\" to it. If anything, for those new to Anime it might just be their first ecchi comedy because if you start watching Anime, you'll run into these somewhere along the line unless you're very selective and careful.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.",

            "content": "Well.. Where do I start.. Hmmmm\r\nWell I watched this series due to a suggestion in the recommendations of Rosario + Vampire.. Although the shows are both somewhat similar.. I expected a bit more out of the series.\r\nLet me start with this.. there are to me.. two seasons to this series basically..and the second series starts somewhere around episode 14.. but.. too be quite honest in my opinion.. Episodes 18-24 are basically OVAs that are stuffed in.. I mean.. There is the story of Kyoto the Fire Girl..a entire episode about a show Lala and Rito watch on television.. which had absolutely nothing to do withanything.. There is an episode (23) that is adapted to Japanese folk tales which is really neat and informative.. but it has absolutely nothing to do with the storyline.. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes though.. 1-10 kept me well entertained.. and I laughed alot.. and the art is done really well.. and of course.. the fanservice is about the only thing that kept me interested enough to watch it.. the girls are very busty.. and very beautiful.. lol.. its hard not to enjoy Lala .. because shes buxom and clueless most of the time.. I liked most of the characters in this.. I didnt find any I didnt really care for much.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED are decent.. they sort of fit the general feel of the show.. if you like ecchi.. youll love the OP .. lol.. indeed.. \\n\\n\r\nSo let me warn you with this in closing.. if you dont like fanservice/ecchi ..pass this up.. because its the only thing that keeps this series somewhat afloat.. due to the fact that its so accessive it makes you giggle a bit..\\n\\n\r\nWould I suggest this anime? .... Yes... but to someone who just wants to watch something maybe as a change of pace or a break from a anime they just watched with a really deep storyline.. or if you just want to see alot of half naked girls with a couple laughs lol.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

Again.\r\nOh look,he got embarrassed again.\\n\r\nOh look, he got embarrassed again.\\n\r\nOh look, he got embarrassed again.\\n\\n\r\nGod knows how many rules I'm breaking, since I haven't finished watching this anime (I'm on episode 14), and there are one or two insignificant spoilers in that list above. (Insignificant because, so far, and most likely in the future, that haven't and won't be developed upon in anyway).\\n\\n\r\nBut already I recognise this anime to be an annoyance which is all mere filler (no plot development except for the first two episodes), and what makes it worse is the travesty that is Rito's character; he is utterly annoying and unbearable in large doses. The most grinding little twat in the history of Japanese animation. \\n\\n\r\nHis character, along with his voice actor, make him a idiot weakling who overreacts or gets majorly embarrassed at every single little detail good or bad, resulting in an utterly pathetic and downright annoying character who makes the show nearly unbearable to watch. He\u2019s far too loud and far too annoying. And my overuse of the word \"annoying\" is even annoying me, but I can't say anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThere has been absolutely no character development from any character in this series, (only new characters get introduced here and there), especially from Rito (although by ep. 14 he has stated he will change (I won't say how) but I predict the show will continue to plod along. Never changing).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that keeps me here is the fan service, and that never keeps me around for long without an interesting plot (which there isn't, since it's all unrelated filler) and a bearable main character around (which there isn't, for the reasons above.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I give this 3 instead of 1, since the characters of Lala and Haruna are pretty much spot on and well suited to their other aspects (appearance, relationships with other characters etc etc) and are mildly interesting. Zastin speaks for himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd like to give this anime 5, the extra 3 in recognition of Lala, Haruna, and Zastin, but the cons of this \"anime\" outweigh the pros brought by these 3 characters, so I give To-LOVE-Ru a 2: Dreadful.\\n\\n\r\nI hope the manga isn\u2019t like this.",

            "content": "This is just mindless, fun entertainment.\r\nAlright so the story of To Love Ru is about a boy name Yuuki Rito who gropes a pink-haired alien name Lala who is the princess of Deviluke. After trying to confess his feelings to a girl, Haruna Sairenji, he accidentally confesses to Lala and says to him \"Lets get married\". From there on Rito tries to get out of the relationship with Lala, but has other things in his way that actually makes him closer to her. The plot does get more of a serious tone towards the end of the anime, but overall it's just a fun anime.\r\nMyfavorite character in this show is without a doubt Lala. She is one of my all time favorite female characters. I don't know why but I like characters like her. This charismatic, upbeat, joyful personality and always having a positive outlook no matter how bad the situation. Even though Rito accidentally \"proposed\" to her. Lala loves Rito with all her heart and you can see in the show that she is devoted to him. Speaking of Rito he is a clumsy pervert. Literally think of every way to accidentally cop a feel and he does it. He doesn't like to think of himself as a pervert he just is really clumsy. And yes that is a running gag in this show. I also like that unlike other harem male leads, Rito doesn't want a harem he just gets tangled up into one.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in my opinion is pretty funny. Even though some people can get irritated with running gags, but I just love them.\\n\\n\r\nDo I think To Love Ru is great. No. In all honesty the story is pretty stupid, but is it funny and entertaining Yes. I think this show is very good, has likable characters, nice music and voice acting. If you don't like ecchi anime then you're going to dislike this show. Overall I say give it a watch.",

It had no plot whatsoever, beside the first few episodes, which introduced the \"story\". No plot progression for characters as well, what they did was throw in a few new characters during the show and there it ended. They could use much more interesting turn of events and character progression it even hurts to think about it.\r\nAnother thing I have to point out - the humor in this series is simply NOT FUNNY... AT ALL. The only one who actually mademe laugh was Zastin - he's a genious, not to mention his seiyuu is Takehito Koyasu and he's one of my favorites (Adam Blade from Needless, Shark Fujishiro from Seto no Hanayome, Luke Valentine from Hellsing...). Still wasn't worth it... \\n\\n\r\nSound and animation are OK I guess, nothing special but not great either. Too much tenticle service also brought it down for me, though other echii scenes were decent. There were a few, only a FEW normal episodes, yet they also weren't satisfying, the rest were simply dreadful. When I got to the 9~10's episode, I thought I'm gonna quit, but still gave it another chance - that was a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I did not enjoy the series at all and would not recommed it to anyone. Bad humor, poor story, no character progression... Overall - bad, very bad. One of my friends saw it before me, he said \"whatever you do - do not watch this anime\", but I still gave it a shot... Should've listened to him in the first place...",

            "content": "Story: From the fanservice and the OP it pretty obvious that this show is a harem. If you've watched Harem/ecchi/romance-comedy anime before you wont really find anything groundbreaking about this anime.  So if you don't like these kinds of shows, I suggest you stay away. It is basically your multi-sided struggle over the main male character. I personally have no problems with the alien/marriage theme, but I find the plot of this series all to predictable.\r\nArt: For a new show the animation quality is what you would call decent. Its not high quality, but it isn't crap either (although the first episode did seemto be on the low quality side). In spite of a few sequences (of course the perverted scenes are always drawn a little better to capture the interest of the viewer), I was surprised that the quality was not as good as I expected to be. So if you like top notch designed and colored anime, don't expect it to be the next high def series off the market.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for this series is not bad. The OP and ED singles are great. I personally prefer the OP over the ED, but its really a matter of taste in music. The BGM has yet to play a role in the series so far, so it really is not much you can say about it as of yet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I find the cast in general pretty generic, with a few exceptions. The male protagonist strikes me as the one of the most generic, if not THE MOST, characters in the entire series. It literally seems as if he was taken from another romance-comedy series and molded with a different character design. The same could be said for other characters as well who more or less resemble characters from other anime (though have yet to be developed or revealed).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  If really can't decide whether or not you want to watch this, I dont blame you, I find the show a bit iffy, even though I do like harem shows a lot. Like I said, there is nothing really distinctive about this series which explains my semi-disinterest (for the lack of a better term) in this series.",

            "content": "'To Love-ru' is an anime with one exclusive purpose - to supply the viewer with a fresh uninterrupted stream of ecchi, served with a side of slightly cliche but still grin inducing comedy. Now this is only going to work for those who are really into ecchi/comedy or something light-hearted in general as 'To love-ru' lacks any semblance of a plot and is entirely episodic. One common occurrence that I've noticed during my time on MAL is that people will usually go into these type of series knowing full well what they are and then complain about it afterwards anyway. This anime is targeting avery specific audience and if you do not fall within the boundaries of that audience then you will naturally end up bored or even despise the series. You can guess which side of the camp I'm on.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"plot\" of this anime is a no brainer. There's a fragile looking teenage boy (Yuuki Rito) who has tremendous difficulties dealing with the opposite sex. One day a female alien (Lala) teleports to his bathroom & he \"accidentally\" gropes some boobs and all hell breaks loose. After that incident, as if through some divine prank, our hero finds himself randomly bumping into women's private parts like a blind man at an orgy. Things only keep getting more hectic from then on as the protagonists unintentional shenanigans intensify exponentially until the whole thing goes positively FUBAR.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. That's your whole plot described right there. What happens between that initial introduction and the ending is more or less plot insignificant and for the most part features side-stories and fillers alike - all aimed at giving you as much ecchi as possible and increasing your chances of having a stroke. And 'Love-ru' doesn't mess around either. In some episodes they'll give you buck-naked characters for your viewing pleasure within a few seconds after the opening song. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the only noticeably interesting quality of this anime, in my opinion. The comedy here might not be anything novel in the ecchi genre but it is very easy to understand and follow. You won't need a degree in Japanese history or the inside knowledge of the anime industry to get the jokes here. Most of the comedy is slapstick and centered around surrealistic situations. Girls popping out of nowhere to hug a peeing man who then proceeds to pee all over himself, the toilet and the hall of his school while running frantically... is pretty surrealistic to me unless times have moved on and that's what teenagers in highschools now do to kill time.\\n\\n\r\n The art is precise and for an ecchi anime it has to be anyway, since the visual aspect is half of the success here. This series' primary focus on female characters can be easily seen and especially the clothing they have on. However all other things have also been drawn with attention to detail. The overall quality is very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/voice acting is likewise good but surprisingly the \"OST\" of this anime is recycled. I've heard some of the songs used here in other animes, one notable example being 'Sister Princess'. It makes the series seem more generic, then again the OST is not what you'll want to be focusing on here. Of course the opening and ending is still unique and befitting of an ecchi series.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the most dreaded part of the review. Enjoyment. The most difficult time for a reviewer comes right after he/she finishes a particular anime. Not before or during but after the anime ends. You have to sum your feelings up and express them but also make a recommendation to potential readers. So I'll say this - if you're unsure or don't like ecchi mixed in with comedy don't watch this. You'll hate it, leave a rating of 2 and curse the producers. When Xebec, TBS and Sentai Filmworks sat down together on this project, it was decided from the outset that it was going to target a rather narrow audience and that audience will be able to appreciate the fact that this anime is very good at what it does - ecchi entertainment. For everyone else however, it will be a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nI for one enjoyed it as 'To Love-ru' served its intended purpose. The story is lacking considerably, at times it's camp as hell but none of that matters because that's not what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\n8 points from me. \\n\\n",

In fact, the first two episodes are fantastic in my opinion. They had it all down pat: The engaging story, the hilarious, embarrassing, over the top ecchiness, the art quality. Twas fantastic.\r\nThen came the filler onslaught. I thought by grabbing hard onto the pages of the manga that the storm of pointless stories may not pulverize me,but it seems it was hopeless.

Man, I wish I could punch TV shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that always bugged me about To Love-Ru was that the manga had all this great material up for grabs, and the first 6 episodes of the anime were very loyal to the manga. Then for the next 18 episodes, I would say about 3 were based off of actual manga chapters. Why? I certainly wouldn't know, but apparently the producers thought lame fillers would satisfy us.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the manga was so much better than the anime that I found myself looking down on this TV show. Maybe I'm wrong. A lot of people like this anime, and I enjoy it as well. It just bugs me how the show had so much potential, and then let us down as viewers. First 6 episodes I given an absolute 10, and the fillers about 5. If you have time, then watch this, but there are better harem animes.",

            "content": "to-LOVE-Ru, a slice of life romantic comedy.  Now its an adaptation of the manga, and as far as I can tell, it only adheres to the source material in spirit.  Not that there is a problem with that.  It'd be rather unfair to compare it manga anyway.\r\nFirst up is the plot, or the lack thereof.  They work quite well as standalone episodes, since there is not much continuity among them.  However, there are some plot holes here and there.  I still can't find the point in the anime that explains how Run ends up liking Rito.  They eventacked on a mini-arc at the end which brought the show to somewhat of a conclusion.  It may have been hasty but there was little else they probably could have done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, in tune with the spirit of the manga is very, ahem refreshing with judiciously placed art and lighting.  Though there is a tinge of reuse and the feeling of loss when some scenes could not be depicted due to the violence (which has many reasons as to why it is so).  The art shifts in certain episodes are a well done as well.  Overall, quite good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however, is not something to write home about.  It is adequate for the scenes depicted, but there is nothing special of note in it.  Same goes for the background music.  The OP and EDs are well done though and I am sucker for the guitar entrance of the OP.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, romantic comedies thrive on status quo, which requires that the relationships between characters stay the same.  Quite so as is the case with To-LOVE-Ru's main characters.  The love triangle that started has never progressed, and apart from the rare episode where we get to see Lala in another light (even then, they pressed the reset button at the end).  However, surprisingly enough, its the secondary characters that get explored a bit more.  Though some get very few episodes, or none at all, its quite easy to see that they are people themselves.  This is a far cry from the same old indecisive Rito, shy Haruna and energetic Lala.\\n\\n\r\nQuibbles aside, it is an enjoyable show.  It really is more comfort food, nothing ground breaking but its not a total failure in following the formula though.  There is not much else going for it except for the art, so I recommend this only for those who just want some eye candy.  Besides if you're feeling jealous of the male lead, you know they're doing something right.  Still, in real life, you'd have to go out and find trouble.  But in to-LOVE-Ru, trouble finds you!",

            "content": "\"Rito~\"\r\nStory: Well, the story isn't better than your average ecchi/harem/comedy anime. The protagonist always gets into \"misunderstandable positions\" with the girls whom all seem to feel something to the protagonist. All the space business doesn't help either. If you ever expect something more than this, to-LOVE-Ru is not for you.\r\n7/10\r\nArt: The art is what I'd call typical for your average ecchi anime. It's not bad, but it's not ultra high quality of course. I found no reason to make it high quality when all the fans of harem would watch it unless it has seems like it's from 1990s. Don't ask me how those rippedoff clothes are replaced.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: saikou no chansu Now is the time! minogasanai- Oops sorry about that. I must say that the OP and ED of to-LOVE-Ru is pretty catchy. Especially after you watch them over and over again \"for various reasons.\" Though I like the OP more, the ED isn't unbearable or anything. For background music, I can't really decide. It surely isn't the type I'd download buy, but it doesn't have any moments that I feel the loss of background music. The seiyuu cast is good too. It's my first time listening to Tomatsu Haruka, but her voice as Lala is really cute ^^ And Rito is of course voiced by a girl.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I must say that none of the characters can be classified as unique (well, maybe Lala's dad, but you get the point.) BUT, even though they are not unique, they are not rip-offs (not counting our usual extremely lucky \"but-i-love-both-of-them\" Rito of course.) The girls are all lovely as expected. Aside from the main interests, there are many funny (and somehow unique) side characters in the show, all being aliens. Ranging from cute little to absolutely perverted monsters, they will manage to make you laugh quite a few times.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Comedic aspect of to-LOVE-Ru can always be noticed. There weren't any comedic moments that seemes \"dull\" to me, but that of course depends on how much you like ecchi. I take that back, you may find it funny even if you don't like it that much.This anime is much more than being extremely ecchi version of a certain anime made with absolutely nothing in mind.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like ecchi/harem/comedy genres and laugh out loud when the protagonist goes on a series of misunderstandings just to get hit by the girl he loves, this is the anime for you. A daily of ecchi keeps doctors away.\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "To LOVE-Ru is a pretty standard harem anime with the usual sickeningly innocent protagonist with unbelievable luck with women falling at his feet. This anime is full of fan service, I mean packed full, there isn't an episode without a decent amount of ecchi scenes. Despite the fan service and dull story it is still a pretty funny and fun to watch anime, with the following continuation to Motto To LOVE-Ru and To LOVE-Ru Darkness being very enjoyable to watch.\r\nWhat I loved about the To LOVE-Ru series as a whole (all 3 seasons), was the enjoyment. This anime made me laugh but was fun anduplifting throughout, it was just very pleasant to watch. I'm not one to watch anime one handed but the fan service usually came with a laugh so it added to the anime without being purely for fan service sake. The romance in the anime is enjoyable to watch unfold albeit a bit frustrating sometimes but overall it was sweet and really makes you envy the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked about the To LOVE-Ru series was the repetitiveness. They re-used so much over and over. Almost all the jokes came from the same misunderstandings, basically all the comedy came from misunderstandings. Almost every episode followed the same format, a flower or invention would do the same thing and the outcome would be the same and it got a bit tiresome. This series is incredibly predictable, you can easily guess what is about to happen and it ruins a lot of moments. I disliked how the main characters and side characters roles kept changing so much throughout the series, some characters would disappear and reappear whenever it suited the writers to throw them in, it really devalued any character progression when their roles were messed around so much. I disliked how the first season had 26 mediocre episodes and the much better follow up seasons only had 12 episodes each. \\n\\n\r\n(Story: 7/10) \\n\r\nThe story of To LOVE-Ru the first season takes place over 26 episodes. I've watched some great anime that told an entire story over 26 episodes, and yet this anime did nothing over 26 episodes. There is basically no story to the first series, it's really just showing the day to day life and events of the characters. Well there is a story but its overshadowed by the fan service and random events that it becomes almost unimportant. After 10 episodes I was about to drop this anime but I'm glad I didn't. To LOVE-Ru is the first season, followed by Motto and then Darkness. The first season is nothing special at all but the following seasons make up for it, they are much much better in every way and are thoroughly enjoyable. The story and enjoyment factor goes up with every season, the first season (To LOVE-Ru) for me would be a 7/10 at a push, the next season (Motto To LOVE-Ru) a much better 8/10 and the final season (To LOVE-Ru Darkness) a strong 9/10 in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely mention the art of anime series because I like contrast between different series with their own unique style of drawing and colouring. I will however say that the art of To LOVE-Ru was nothing impressive at all but I was really impressed with the next two seasons, a lot of work was put into the vivid colours of Motto and Darkness with a nice soft feeling on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime as a whole and I will be watching any new episodes they bring out but it has a lot of flaws and is far from perfect which is expected from a harem anime I suppose. My tip would be to not watch this anime around your family, it would raise too many questions I feel if anyone saw what you were watching. Since the anime is so immersed in fan service you should get the uncensored DVD versions which have better quality and are uncensored so you don't have to stare at mist and sunshine and can actually watch the series as it was meant to be watched.",

            "content": "WARNING: TO FULLY EXPRESS MY OPINION THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS OF THE SHOW, ONLY READ IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo Love Ru is quite honestly a show that has left me conflicted in almost every aspect, even in regards to how to rate and review the show. What I will say is this: if you're looking for a lighthearted, ecchi show which is based around just being plain ridiculous for the sake of comedy, then this is the show for you. However regardless of the Romance tag, if you're looking for any kind of deeper romance withinthe show then don't bother, you would only be disappointed. If you are also looking for I suppose what you could consider a story and story progression then I would also not recommend this show. Aside from the introductory episodes and the last 3 or so episodes, there really isn't story progression. The show is episodic in that (outside of the parts I mentioned), each episode isn't really going through a story and is individual, because at the start of the next episode it's as if the previous didn't really happen. Therefore the main chunk of the series in the middle between the introduction and ending 3 episodes is like this. Now personally I don't have a massive issue with this as I feel like this was the intention as it is hardly a serious series. But it's my warning if you are looking for some kind of progressive story.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said, onto why i'm personally conflicted. I love the characters in the show. A lot of them are vibrant, individual characters with lots of personality. Lala is a good example of this. However the problem is that barely any of the characters thrown in are fleshed out whatsoever. Because of that, a lot of the characters just lack something for me. Now as this is a silly, over the top show aimed at being a comedy, I hardly expected massive individual episodes for characters with character development; but if there are gonna be characters popping up each episode I want them to at least have some substance or development. This is the main problem with the characters for me. That every single episode, every single character is forced into it for the sake of them doing individual roles that they always do. I think the hot springs episode is a good example of this, where every character turned up for seemingly no reason just for the sake of them being there. 90% of the characters just do the same thing every episode and that's why they're there. For example how Golden Darkness is there to just do the whole 'Yeah i'm trying to kill you but i'll help you this one time' thing and how Haruna is just there for Rito to be attracted to and for them to do the same 'trying to confess but speak over each other and then be interrupted' thing which happens at least 5-10 times. Personally, as much as I love the character designs and some of the actually developed ones, most of them I don't as they're completely one-dimensional with no development and are simply there to fulfil one comedic role in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is a personal opinion of mine about the show. I'm not 100% as I haven't read the manga, or at least not yet, so i'm not sure if the adaptation from the manga is the reasoning but.. I don't feel as if the season should have been 26 episodes long. Getting towards the end it just felt far too dragged out. If the season had been 12-13 episodes in length I believe it would have felt like a better use of time. In these 12-13 episodes they could still have had the first 2 or so as introductions and the last 3 how they were too with actual progression. Then between this they could still have had a decent amount of the filler like, ridiculous episodes in the middle chunk. Because personally having around 20 episodes in the middle of the show be the ridiculous stuff was just far too much to sit through. However, as I said at the beginning, I haven't yet read the manga and so they may have wanted to try and keep the anime exactly to the source material which is why everything was included. But regardless, as I stated I believe the season could have been better in 12-13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow. The harem aspect of the show really confused me. Whilst Rito was in fact surrounded by plenty of females, again most of them felt underdeveloped and irrelevant. Lala is the main female, being engaged to Rito and living with him. There is also Haruna who has a thing for Rito and Rito has had a crush on since he was a young child. There is also Run, the female version of Ren, who has a big thing for Rito, however this is only really shown in 1-2 episodes. Aside from this, everything else is irrelevant. Every other female shows no actual romantic or love interest towards Rito, as is suggested in it being a harem. The other females just pop up in episodes to push the comedy of specific situations and that's really it. So therefore you're left with Lala, who makes sense as they're engaged, Haruna, who became annoying to me as her only purpose of every coming into the episode was the crush thing between her and Rito, and also the 1 or maybe 2 episodes around Run having a crush on Rito. That's it. To me, it felt bland.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the note of the harem, I unfortunately did what I decide never to do with harems and settled for the person I wanted to see the MC (Rito) end up being with. This was Lala. However, there was reason behind this. To me, it's what made the most sense. They were engaged from the start, and regardless of this being an accidental situation it was still the best choice for me. Lala and Rito grew and developed around each other. Not only were they practically the only characters to get real development for themselves and the relationship between them, but they were also the only two characters who had different purposes in different episodes and weren't just one-dimensional characters. Unlike all the other females in the show, Lala had lots of personality and developed a lot from first arriving on earth up to the end. Now there's mostly two sides to this. A lot of people want Lala and Rito to be together, and a lot seem to want Rito and Haruna together. To me, this was a big part of the plot. Due to the romance tag I was hoping for Rito to end up with someone. Also honestly Rito was a pretty hopeless MC, so I was hoping he would at least go through and marry Lala as planned. \\n\r\nI don't like Haruna. Haruna is Hinata from Naruto but far worse. And by this I mean quite literally all Haruna does is blush and says 'Yuki-kun..', that's all. She's one of the most bland girls because that's all she does every episode. Rito only considers her because of his child crush he has had on her. That's why I always wanted Rito to take the Lala route and so the season could end with Rito ending up marrying the most fleshed out and best female character. \\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, this doesn't happen. I saw a lot of praise for the final episode however I wholeheartedly disagree with all of my being. I like the final 3 episodes with actual progression. Firstly Rito at last exclaims his love for Lala, bringing her back from her flu. When this happened I was finally satisfied as things were going in a good direction. However, towards the end, firstly for whatever reason Rito still can't get over his ridiculous thing for Haruna.. I understand the idea of having a crush on someone since you were young, but really? That VS actual love and care you've built up from living and spending time with someone?? Seems far-fetched. Especially when Rito barely develops anything with Haruna, he simply speaks to her a few times and even then the conversations are basically nothing. Whereas with Lala Rito lived with her, spent time with her, actually communicated with her and so had actual reasoning for his feelings towards her. Whereas the thing with Haruna is nothing more than just a crush. But regardless of that, Rito finally gets through all the trials and tribulations put forward by Lala's dad so he can have permission to marry Lala and save earth. So everything is finally going in a good, progressive direction. So what could possibly go wrong, right? Well. WELL. Last minute, quite literally just as they're about to get married, Lala for the first time does a complete 180 and cuts off the marriage. IT HURT. Her personality had remained exactly the same throughout the entire series (besides the one episode where the joke is her personality changing each day) and so it was out of no where. Rito had finally confessed his love, and then suddenly with basically no explanation given she cut off the marriage and tried to erase everyone's memories.\\n\r\nI guess i'm just most upset because it was so sudden and there was no reasoning given outside of her briefly saying something along the lines of 'I've put Rito through a lot of pain' and that's it. Now, this is true, however that's the point! Lala was always a handful. She arrived suddenly on earth and Rito and her were suddenly engaged to be married. She was very hyperactive and crazy, doing crazy things, making crazy inventions etc. But that was really part of her charm. Lala and Rito built their relationship up from that, learning about each other, taking care of each other and spending time with each other. This led up to Rito confessing his love to her. I'm in belief that the whole reasoning is that she could see the conflict Rito felt in his feelings between her and Haruna, and that just annoys me. Because if that's the case then if Rito could have just realised that his feelings towards Haruna are pretty much completely superficial then everything could have worked out fine and the marriage could have taken place. My second theory is simply that this was done intentionally by the writers for the sake of the rest of the series as there are plenty more seasons. That i'm not sure of at the moment, but will come to find out when I watch them.\\n\r\nBut as I said earlier, Rito was a seemingly useless MC, and so all I wanted was for him to go through with this marriage so he could at least have done something worthwhile. \\n\r\nThe ending honestly just left me feeling empty. I got a similar feeling to when I watched the Oreimo ending (though i'm obviously not going into detail about that, but if you know then you know). \\n\\n\r\nIt just made me sad.\\n\\n\r\nSO IN CONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nDue to everything aforementioned I found it very difficult to judge this anime. This is the first review I've done on this account and just wanted to do it since I was left with so many conflicting emotions. So overall, I really like the characters. I think that they're all very vibrant and different design wise and all fill very different roles and there is a character for each common anime trope such as a tsundere etc. I liked the art in general, it all looked pretty good consistently and there weren't any moments where I thought the animation was particularly poor. I got a relative amount of enjoyment out of the season. It was designed to be very lighthearted in many senses and just be a ridiculous, over the top comedy. So to that effect, I enjoyed it. However:\\n\r\nAs also mentioned before, I feel like either the personality of the characters should have been fleshed out and developed more as they had 26 episodes to do so, or that they should have done the same but made the season only 12-13 episodes so it doesn't feel like there's just some over abundance of filler. And finally, in terms of a romance it left me dead inside. There was one obvious choice for the MC, one in which it would have been a good ending and would have shown some kind of progression for the MC, however this was cut off literally within the last 10 minutes of the season. I'm still sad.\\n\\n\r\nSo my overall review would be if you wanted to watch the series: If you don't mind the notion of there being almost no story progression, character development for most characters and all ideas of a romance being tossed in the trash last minute and instead you're just looking for a typical, over the top harem comedy, then this is definitely for you.\\n\\n\r\nOh but also that if you end up loving Lala as is very easy to do so, and want to see the romance progress, you'll be left empty like me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I may be left dead and empty inside; but because I loved the characters and foolishly hold onto some false hope i'm going to continue to watch through the other To Love Ru seasons and maybe one day write another review for one of them if they effect me to quite the same extent as this one did.",

            "content": "So I completed this series not but a few days ago and believe that I'm finally ready to review it.The basis of this series is we have alien (Lala)who comes to earth trying to escape capture who meets this \"unfortunate\" fellow (Rito) who seems to be this socially inept loser who can't ask out the girls of his dreams (Haruna); events happen and by some strange coincidence Rito ends up engaged to Lala which throws his whole entire world into a spin of alien encounters, comedy, romance and ecchi. So for those of you wondering is this something new no absolutely not but is thissomething enjoyable...short answer yes long answer maybe leaning towards a yes.\\n\r\nStory- Yeah the story is not that complex it's a love comedy ecchi so it has pretty much everything you expect (mandatory hot spring episode you for some reason cannot have an ecchi series without one). Basically it adds a few new swings to the whole scene but basically most episodes are scenes and scenarios that if you've watched pretty much any other series that focuses around the same general plot you've seen it before. My opinion not so bad I was glad to see something new at all seeing as most series today lack even the creativity to try and come up with a new idea or twist to make their series interesting. Although I'm telling you now I subtracted one point from story because there was one episode in the series that just had nothing at all to do with the story line in any way form of fashion and it only pissed me off for the next week that I had watched it so yeah (its episode 20 for those of you who wish to know).\\n\r\nArt- Okay yes the art was really good. I mean it's not my eyes are bleeding from beauty good but it make you stop and admire it for a while good but this is actually becoming very common today especially in series where the basis is a form of love comedy.\\n\r\nSound- No joke the sounds were pretty good everything matched up all the sounds were smooth and best of all the voice acting was incredible.\\n\r\nCharacter- Well yeah it's not as though we haven't seen these kinds of characters types before and you'll know what I mean the instant you watch this series but what kept me from completely flunking this series on characters were the unique and innovative styles innovating to make them unique I mean typically we can just point and go generic character #2 but in this case even though it is generic character #2 it is an interesting version of them with some new twists put onto their character type (alright not completely true but you will notice that some characters do not always act as you expect them too).\\n\r\nEnjoyment- So how do I feel after finishing this series...pretty good actually. It had an acceptable story line a decent moving pace and in my opinion a pretty good ending.\\n\r\nSo do I recommend this series as a matter of fact I do if you like comedy or ecchi this is definitely the series for you although I'm warning you in advance if you expecting a lot of drama, romance, and especially action you will be sorely disappointed. And once again a word of warning don't waste your time watching episode 20.",

It takes a cute manga and adds in some of the most dross filler in anime period. We're not even going to bother talking about the cast, because the paper they drew the sketches of these characters on has more depth than 90% of the cast. Aside from maybe chief heroine Lala, who's cute, likable, but a little grating at times, the only decent characters are Rito's little sister, the calm and supporting Mikan, and busty, alien school nurse Ryouko Mikado, the only other character with a functional brain.(Though you might be tempted to question that, since she is the one who tasked two high-schoolers with running a huge inn... while in the middle of their school year?) And of course, we'd be remiss to leave out the principal of everyone's school, whom we kept wondering why he was allowed to keep his job. Or even walk around free to randomly sexually assault girls, which he does in almost every single one of his appearances.",

And since To Love-ru was made relatively recently, the animation quality was very well done.\r\nNow that I've got all the positive factors out of the way, its time for some good ol' criticism. The music was not great or memorable and the characters were cliched, but there was one thing that topped them all. To Love-ru flirts with the borders between ecchi humor and hentai. There is often tentacle monster fondling, but in those situations, there is usually a clothes barrier between the tentacles and theskin (though the tentacles do reach in between the legs a few times).\\n\\n\r\nSo say your watching this anime at home and one of these scenes occurs as your mom is about to walk by. Do you keep watching because it's not actually hentai, or do you try to block the screen so she can't see and look even more suspicious to her?\\n\\n\r\nNow i am not saying that ecchi humor is bad or that hentai sucks, but I would prefer knowing what catagory an anime falls under. To Love-ru just felt weird as I was watching it. It failed to create a viewer friendly atmosphere for me, but who knows you might enjoy it. It's just not my cup of tea.",

He spends easily a majority of the anime obsessing over a girl, because of flowers, and he makes the typical clueless male trope seem like a genius. The show itself has little plot, and seems filled with nothing but filler, using the main love interest, Lala, as fanservice, and the inner thoughts of a truly idiotic male protagonist. The show had plenty of potential for a good story, and character growth, but it's squandered to over the top fan service, and the idea that the protagonist is in lovewith the girl he's obsessed with, Haruna. Haruna herself is more of a side character, but feels forced in an attempt to make her a main character. The art work is very good. The sound is good. The characters are mostly uninteresting with the exception of Lala, and a couple others. If you're coming for an interesting romance, and a good, thought out story, stay away. Hell, run like Jason Vorhees was chasing you in an 80s slasher flick. If you came for fan service, and over the top goofiness, then this is your show.",

She ran away from home because her father wants her to get married. She wanted to marry Rito and then fell in love with him.

            "content": "To LOVE-Ru is an anime that is often conveniently brushed aside due to the unprecedented crave for an elaborate plot. People seem to have disregarded the time and effort set forth in the creation of anime as well as any form of entertainment. Nothing can be considered perfect because even if everyone in the universe adores it, there will always be those select few who escort hatred. The overall intention of any form of entertainment is to captivate the audience by whatever means necessary. To LOVE-Ru positively secures this feat.\r\nJust so everyone is aware, To LOVE-Ru is an ecchi (perverted) anime, so be fully preparedfor excessive amounts of breast fondling and panty shots. In fact it may even surpass your initial expectations of the ecchi genre. With that established, if you are seeking an exstensive development, crowded with suspense and tear jerking moments, I would firmly advise you search in the opposite direction. You would have a better chance of slamming a revolving door. However, If you are scouting exceptional comedy accomanied by attractive characters and art that perscribes eye-gasms you my friend have discovered the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that To LOVE-Ru obtains such a generous amount of characters I will only talk about the frequently displayed ones. The dominate male figure Yuuki Rito is a 15 year old boy who lives with his younger sister Mikan. Rito has a crush on Sairenji Haruna, a fellow classmate. However, Rito is too shy to confess his love. I feel sorry for him because every oppourtinity he inherits to confess, something insane happens which negates his intentions. While I do bear sorrow, I also carry envy towards Rito because of the seemingly unlimited harem he obtains throughout the series. This is ironic because this \"ladies man\" is infact voiced by a woman, which I did not realize until post completion of the anime. Deviluke Lala Satalin, often reffered to as Lala, is an alluring alien princess who is introduced after teleporting inside Rito's home, in the attempt to escape relentless persuers. This in return leads Rito to recieve \"quite a handfull\" of responsibilty.\\n\\n\r\nThe illiustration in To LOVE-Ru can be presented as refreshing and compliments the story and cast thourougly. This anime presents any and all types of female characters imaginable. Tsunderes, Lolitas and everything in between. Although To LOVE-Ru won't make you cry it will deliver a gratifying experience which all fans of the ecchi/comedy genre should venture.",

            "content": "To Love-Ru takes the accidental girlfriend sort of sense to kick off the harem. Burdened by his lack of skills  in regards to talking with girls and a new \"girlfriend\" who happens to be an alien, Yuuki Rito begins his new harem life. As more females are added to this harem, Rito develops more as a man and strives to be the number one person in the universe not only for Lala, but for himself.\r\nOn paper, that plotline sounds somewhat intriguing, but it is easily destroyed by loads of useless fillers, borderline fanservice, and ultimately, appealing to the male masses. Although it has someplot, TLR does not go too deep into it, straying away from the main focus multiple times to gather up happiness in a certain part of the human body. The whole story and conflict is really just a facade and honestly, if one was looking for great story in an ecchi harem, they might as well give up.\\n\\n\r\nOne strong point of TLR is its artwork and animation. Things run pretty fluidly and the characters are designed with many eye candy aspects. The art compliments the fanservice moments very well. The music is extremely catchy with many upbeat tunes to hype up the mood of the anime. The OP and ED are both pleasing to listen to and the animation isn't too hard on the eyes either. *wink* *wink*\\n\\n\r\nTLR had one of the most appealing harems I have seen. There are many females to please the tastes of the viewers, from little sister all the way down to the teacher/nurse. There are also many types of fanservice which is TLR's strong point. Their personalities are dreadfully static, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the viewer's preference. There is very minor character development, as TLR simply seeks out to present the character, show them off, and move on. To be blunt, the character development that is there ultimately serves no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Rito as a harem can be defined in one word: disappointing. He's weak, scrawny, horrifyingly dense, indecisive, and doesn't take advantage of nearly all of the situations he's in. There is usually some sort of special trait or power that the harem lead receives, but for Rito, that's not the case. Instead, the writers gave him this idea that he must do his best to protect everyone, but really, it's a cliche and an uninteresting drive. It's even worse to see him try to accomplish something when he's only fooling himself.  Many refer to him as one of the luckiest men alive but he's obviously too dense to realize it. It makes one wonder what in the world these women see in harem leads.\\n\\n\r\nThere is much to enjoy when watching To Love-Ru depending on what the viewer wants to see.  TLR is a huge guilty pleasure; there is no real excuse to watch this anime other than those appealing moments. There are plenty of mushy romance parts as well but they are easily made impure and irrelevant by the ecchi moments which is the meat and potatoes of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a harem, To Love-Ru is one of the best out there. With such a wide array of females in the harem and plenty of ecchi, TLR proves to be a solid harem. Having this many borderline scenes isn't necessarily a negative although there is a little something called too much. However, I felt that TLR didn't cross over that line very often and did a fine job with what it's real intent was. This season of TLR is just one big filler full of guilty pleasure, and it would be shameless to expect anything more.",

            "content": "\"If you smile once when you\u2019re feeling down, you begin to feel better and become more cheerful.\"\r\nI made a mistake when I first started watching this series. It was too late to correct it, and I feel ashamed for what I did... yeah, you guessed it. I watched Motto to LOVE-Ru before this, which was apparently season 2. In retrospect, I probably should have figured that out when there were a bunch of scenes in Motto to LOVE-Ru talking about the previous events in this season. Ah well, what are you going to do?\r\nAnyways, To LOVE-Ru. Most people who enjoy echii have probably heard ofTo LOVE-Ru Darkness, one of the most popular echii animes of last year. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Season 1 of the To LOVE-Ru series. As I said before, it might be pretty easy to get all the seasons mixed up at first glance, but I can assure you that this is definitely Season 1. I've always been a fan of the echii genre. I'm not a pervert, I don't watch it for all the fan service, but I've found that there seem to be a lot of echii animes with appealing stories, and usually ends up having some good love interests throughout the show. To LOVE-Ru is one of my personal favorite echiis, along with Heaven's Lost Property and Yosuga no Sora. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nAnimes these days have started to lack in the story department. Either the stories have all been done before, or they are just plain bad, but what makes them good is how they're planned out and presented. To LOVE-Ru was more or less on the \"Done Before\" side of the line. The story goes like this: Boy likes girl, girl might secretly have feelings for that boy, boy cannot confess feelings due to shyness and bad luck, alien spaceship crashes to earth and nearly kills this boy, boy takes bath, girl magically appears in bath, accidental booby squeezing, sudden engagement. Yup. That's pretty much it. The male protagonist is engaged to an alien (a very attractive one at that), and the most surprising thing is that she's actually okay with it. So throughout the story, it's the two characters getting to know eachother better with more characters popping in and more minor and random stories suddenly appearing. It wasn't until the final 3 episodes where the climax of the story takes place, and the ending was somewhat disappointing. But hey, that's why more seasons were made, right? Even though this seems like a common story among anime these days, I enjoyed it for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nTo LOVE-Ru was brought to you by Sentai Filmworks in the year 2008. Previous animes include The World God Only Knows, Ef, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and other animes. Personally, they have been one of my favorite people when it comes to art styles. I liked how the characters were portrayed (pantie/boob shots excluded), and it had an overall original feel to it. I liked it quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nTo LOVE-Ru is one of the more popular titles in the anime world... there aren't many echii fans who haven't heard of it before. So a question: why hasn't this been licensed in America for dubbing yet? I feel like they could actually do well in the process of getting an English dub for it since most of the characters could have fairly predictable actors in it. But anyways, the cast for To LOVE-Ru involves Haruka Tomatsu as Lala, an actress you might know from titles such as Asura Cryin', My Pet Monster, and Sword Art Online. We also have Sayuri Yahagi from animes such as Karneval (TV), Asura Cryin', and Sola. And finally Akeno Watanabe from Aria, Code Geass, and the new anime Free!. We have an interesting choice of actors and actresses, and I can say that they all did a good job. It was above average work, but it wasn't perfect exactly. A good job though.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we have the characters of To LOVE-Ru. First of all, let me say that this is probably one of the best harem animes that I've seen since Negima!? and Love Hina. It had a vast selection of girls, and they were each unique. First off, we have Lala. She's the Princess of the planet Deviluke. She comes to earth due to the fact she refuses to get married, but just ends up getting engaged anyways, but she's fine with it. She's super cheerful throughout the anime, and has no problem being naked. Next we have Haruna. She's shy, sweet, and very pretty. She gets embarrassed easily, which our main protagonist has found out by multiple slaps in the face. Next we have Rito, our main protagonist. In most echii animes, the main protagonist happens to be a pervert. Luckily he's not, but he's the kind of guy who gets embarrassed amazingly easily if he walks into the girls changing room by mistake or sees a girl naked by accident. He is an overall nice guy. There is also Yami, my personal favorite girl in this series. She is an assassin from space sent to kill Rito. Her hobbies include using her hair to beat him into a pulp, walking around town, and eating Taiyaki Pastries. She isn't technically a Tsundere, but she is definitely dangerous, but very very cute. And then, the one girl everyone seems to love despite her being 12 years old, Mikan, Rito's younger sister. She's cute, she can cook, and shows signs of a brother complex throughout the series. Interesting combinations if you ask me. After that, there are a bunch of minor characters which are hard to hate, but at some points they might get annoying. However, not often does this happen, so the characters were nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, this is one of my favorite echii animes. Yes, there was a lot of fanservice (A LOT), but that wasn't the reason I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for multiple reasons, but the main reason was just because of the comedy and romance throughout the course of 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe High of To LOVE-Ru: Excellent character planning and designing.\\n\r\nThe Low of To LOVE-Ru: Fairly bland story, but still able to make it not completely bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked To LOVE-Ru a lot, and I recommend this to anyone who enjoys echii animes, fanservice, or has seen Motto to LOVE-Ru or To LOVE-Ru Darkness.",

            "content": "As I've been scrolling through the reviews, I've noticed that To Love-Ru is an anime that can be put securely in the 'love it or hate it' category.\r\nBoth sides have very good reasons for taking their positions, but since there are enough people to hate on it, I'm gonna go ahead and explain why this is one of my favorite shows of all time. (For the first season, at least).\r\nLet me take a moment to compare a few anime to famous TV shows. If something like Cowboy Bebop were the Breaking Bad of anime, and Neon Genesis Evangelion was the 'The Soprano's' of anime, ToLove-Ru would have to fall in the category of the 'Seinfeld' of anime. There is little to no story whatsoever, and the character's positions at the end of the last episode are arguably almost identical to their positions at the end of the first. This show doesn't really have a true plot or story, there are just a bunch of one shot episodes that add a little bit to the world. It's just slice of life in its purest form.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, the stories are NOT original in any way, shape, or form. To Love-Ru takes almost every single possible trope or stereotype it can find from the genre and turns it up to 11. It repeats itself often, character development is very minimal, and there are more plot holes than a badly written fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I think people hate on this show is either because they've read the Manga and expected more, or because they were looking for something to engage them and make them think about life and its lessons as so many other anime do. This simply just does not happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no way to describe this show other than bad, and I'll admit it. Critically, this would be an absolute flop. However, what matters is how much you enjoy the show. If you liked the characters and it could keep you laughing, then it did its job. It's almost comparable to B Gata H Kei in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point you should take from this is just that this anime is pure, unadulterated fun in its most basic form. Don't look for a deeper meaning, don't dissect whats going on, just enjoy the ride and all of the shenanigans the characters get into. Point out and laugh at all of the tropes they use, especially in the infamous episode 20. If you don't like it, that's okay, but don't try to treat it as something it's not.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, it's time to talk about \"To LOVE-Ru\".\r\nBefore I go any further, I want to point out, this show is utterly moronic, in almost every category. But there is no voting category for imbecilic anime creation. So I'm forced to put that on the table, up front and center.\r\nDoes this mean I intend to rip this show a new hole in its' posterior? Not necessarily. It just means that this show is intended to be liked by folks that have appreciation for things that equate to unreal expectations.\r\nAnd there are times when that is appropriate behavior. For example, if you notice a multi-mile longasteroid approaching the planet you live on, and understand the consequences of this approaching doom-stone, you may just wish for a nice breezy day on the beach ....   of another planet. That is clearly a good reason to put your mind in the 'make-a-wish' zone.\\n\\n\r\nTo LOVE-Ru, is not mainly concerned with that kind of apocalyptic event, and so the wishful thinking now runs into the kind of thinking of; \"... these folks are doing ...  what, ... why? ...\"\\n\\n\r\nSo let's now move into the characters, almost all of which need some discussion (I'm going to deal only with some of the primaries, the secondary characters will take too much time):\\n\\n\r\nRito Yuuki-\\n\r\nI realize this kind of fellow turns a lot of teenage boys cold, but let's look at this kid with a little more sincerity. Rito is loyal, decent, polite, not excessively aggressive, and he's bashful around girls. He is in fact, exactly like the young fellows who often review this show and rip it a new one because of Rito; because they have all the same characteristics. They have them, but don't really want them.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they want the girls to be attracted to boys that are abusive, obscene, non-intuitive, crass, rude, overly aggressive, pushy, loud and generally mean-spirited. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry to make this absolutely plain, but in real life, Rito will get the girl every time; in comparison to an abusive bastard every time. It's just too bad for you young folks that want things to be otherwise. Deal with real life, and try to extend that knowledge into your appreciation for anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, To LOVE-Ru got this part of its' story right. Rito is exactly like every other boy his age, in the real world, and just as shockingly non-adult. So he gets flustered around real girls, especially when a pretty girl is in very close proximity.\\n\\n\r\nHaruna Sairenji-\\n\r\nHaruna is everything most of the critics of this show don't really like. Because she is the female version of Rito. She is: loyal, decent, polite, not excessively aggressive, and she's bashful around boys. Wow, there's a strange thing. And oh, I forgot; she's also cute as a bug in springtime.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough, girls have also been bashful and self-embarrassed around boys; for a very long time. Again, I realize boys don't like this kind of girl. They want to think that the more mature view is of a girl who will drag them behind a tree and do sexual favors on demand. This is because the boy is almost always to bashful to ask for that. Boys of this age group believe they are much more manly if they wait for the girl to suggest it for them,  ...  because the boy is already too much of a coward. As well he should be, at Rito's age.\\n\\n\r\n But in the end, we are all stuck with real life. Most girls don't behave that way. And strangely enough, when one finds a girl of that persuasion, the girl doesn't get the boy either. At least not for long.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, To LOVE-Ru got this part right as well. The good girl, in real life; normally wins her hearts' desire, and ends up with a nice boyfriend, and even a fine husband. I know, I'm speaking sacrilege, but the truth is; the purpose of dating, meeting friends of the opposite sex, and socializing with them; is to to get married and start a family that will raise children that are worth having in society. \\n\\n\r\nThe over-sexed girl gets that abusive fellow already described; and never, ever, produces anything worth having. Both die non-contributive to society, and almost never makes anything worthwhile in their own lives. These are the facts of real life.\\n\\n\r\nLala Satalin Deviluke-\\n\r\nLala is a character designed in lala-land. She is pretty, slender and shapely, and she has a tail, and her bat wings stick out from the sides of her hat. She is in fact a 2-dimensional character with an equally simple personality. And for some very good reasons.\\n\\n\r\nLala is a princess of a planetary empire, her father being an abusive bastard that can destroy pretty much whatever he wants, and uses that fact to his personal advantage. A clear case of absolute power corrupting absolutely.\\n\\n\r\nHer father is such a bastard, that the whole last set of episodes of To LOVE-Ru are all about a challenge designed to destroy the suitor to his daughter, Rito. Does he play fair? No, breaks even his own rules in order to win. In other words, Mister Deviluke lies, cheats and steals, even when he can win without doing so. What a piece of pond scum! One wonders why, in his infinite display of disreputable conduct, he doesn't just lay it on the line, and create a new family by sexually assaulting his daughter (collaborative pun intended). It is not outside his own personality.\\n\\n\r\nLala however, is a fairly nice little girl (I can't figure out why she should be) that is quite intelligent, in an intellectual set of disciplines that leads to the creation of inventions that are never developed sufficiently to work the way they were designed.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, she's a dilettante, who never, ever; finishes anything she ever starts. Which leads us all to a really important question. And that is;\\n\\n\r\n\"When she's finally gotten to the point where she would normally drop an invention, as it regards Rito; will she operate as she has in the past, or will she stick to something important, for once?\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, she got involved with Rito because she didn't want daddy to pick her husband. She said as much in the show.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this make her a bad person? No, far from it. It means she chafes on the abusive and domineering behavior of her father. She would like to strike out into real life on her own, and make choices for her future, by herself. She is, however, a product of her own life. She is a very rich, spoiled brat, who expects everything to work out nicely; and when it doesn't, either she builds her way out of it, or appoints someone responsible. Leaving the whole mess in something or someone else's lap. Like Zastin, as a true to life character in which this sort of thing actually happens, in To LOVE-Ru.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason Lala gets away with stuff on Earth, is because she is dealing with a whole school full of boys who are too bashful to say NO, and also full of girls who raise their own game because of Lala being a threat to the social structure that they had expected, and is now in jeopardy. Most of the student body are NOT the offspring of the idle rich, and Lala IS. It creates an artificially difficult struggle for everybody concerned.\\n\\n\r\nIf she were to understand honorable conduct, and all that implies; Lala would go home to Deviluke, and fight it out with her father, take the throne away from him and rule the place as the reasonable and at least polite individual she is capable of.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, she runs away from home, hopes her father is too busy blowing up planets to bother about her absence (which of course, makes Lala an accessory to mass-genocide), gets involved with a boy that is almost reaching the point where he can confess his appreciation for a girl in his class; as happens in real life. Totally screws that up, invades another persons' household, creates extra duties and work for Rito's sister, blows up several relationships in school, that at the bottom of all is none of her business, involves her 'true love' in events containing aliens of no-ones' choosing, endangers Earth with the arrival of some of these ne'er-do-wells, and even endangers the alien doctor, that Mister Deviluke should marry. She's his kind of girl.\\n\\n\r\nIn all of these events and scenarios, Lala Satalin Deviluke walks through her life with charm and great cheer, while leaving destruction in her wake. Everybody else has to clean up the messes Lala creates. But Lala is fine, although totally oblivious to almost everything else around her. The only good word that describes Lala is IRRESPONSIBLE, beyond any kind of redemption.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Audio/Music-\\n\r\nWhile the music is cute, it is also mindless J-POP of the worst type. Having no meaning, in the sense that it might have meaning to the anime. I'm one of those people that think the music should say something about the anime. It doesn't. The inter-stigial music is adequate, but continues on the theme of \"What theme might that be?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dialog is read well, and the mindless commentaries by Lala are appropriate for the situations. This goes for most of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artwork-\\n\r\nActually not bad at all. It describes the actions well, and helps tell the story. Do we get some really fresh background parallax art? No, but it is otherwise adequate.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story-\\n\r\nThe basic story plot is excellent, and it had a lot in the way of comedy potential. Potential is what it had. Only a fraction of the comedy potential was ever realized. Would have been much better if Lala's father was not quite as much pond scum. Lala should have had a little more intellect (oh I dunno, maybe like real human girls?). But I keep forgetting, this show is to please teenage boys with very little appreciation for 'the thinking stuff', while providing a female heroin that girls can feel 'speaks to them'.\\n\\n\r\nYea, right. Really? Is that all Mankind has to look forward to? If so, Mister Deviluke will have little trouble destroying Earth. We'll be too busy looking up his daughters' cute little ass, to notice our cities being blown up for his personal amusement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm done with this review. I'm done with To LOVE-Ru. I actually sat through all the episodes. God what a trial! The show is entertaining in a certain mindless way, but I'm sorry if I'm one of those people that can't shut my brain off.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this colorful and entertaining piece of mindless pond scum a generous 4.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I remember when I first watched To Love Ru (TLR) back in Nov 2011. Being the very first anime I watched, I really liked it up to the point of rewatching it 4x. I could say TLR is the one that piqued my interest towards anime, all thanks to a friend of mine. However, having watched more anime later on, my opinion of TLR have changed.\r\nStory - 6\r\n\"I LOOOOOVE TLR! I kept laughing throughout the show. Although yeah, there are some fillers in the show that I got bored with. It's rather amusing how the MC keeps on failing to clear misunderstandings, ends up inoutworldly situations, yet does not end up being hated by the girls around him. I also liked the last episodes. A real conflict came up, that semi-dramatic finale, and a very heart-warming ending. Score: 9!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what I thought back then. Because I liked the series so much, I ended up reading the manga after watching season 2. I have noticed that much of the anime is different from the manga, with the exception of few episodes. That did not change my opinion of TLR.\\n\\n\r\nRight now, I definitely don't hate TLR S1, but it does not have anything particular to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching more anime, I rewatched TLR again December last year because I kinda forgot the story and wanted to watch season 3. What can I say. It ain't as good as back then. Ain't as funny back then. [There are anime that never fails to keep me laugh (or keep me interested) whenever I watch it.] I realized that this was your typical harem anime. There wasn't much substance nor story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nConsidering its a 2008 anime, I think its art is pretty good for its time. The girls are freakin' kawaii~!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nI liked all 3 songs, especially the 2nd ED. I had that song looped in my MP3 for some time back then. It really matches up Haruna's feelings (who happens to be the spotlight of the ED), be it the lyrics or the sound, and left me a rather strong impact. Nice VA for all, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nI don't particularly like or hate anyone, but for some reason, all the characters in TLR are essential to keep the enjoyment of this series. My most fave: Kotegawa Yui.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nI had fun when I first watched it. I had fun rewatching it immediately after watching it. Not worth rewatching in a future time, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 (I probably rated 9 back in 2011)\\n\r\nTLR ain't a bad series at all. In fact, I owe my love for anime to TLR.\\n\\n\r\nThere are better anime series in the line of romcoms. TLR focuses on the comedy/ecchi part rather than the romance, which could be a turn off for some. (In the genre of ecchi anime, this one has the upper hand, though.)\\n\\n\r\nDoes this mean that you should skip TLR and proceed to the better anime romcoms? NO. It's worth watching it. And you won't be able to enjoy the next seasons (which are, in my opinion, are better than S1) without watching this, so... \\n\\n\r\n(Currently watching season 4.)",

            "content": "What a woeful, sodding show this is. Never has an anime given me such grief. This was an extremely hard show for me to get through. 26 episodes! Of what? That's a bloody good question! I have no idea just what this anime is trying to tell me. I have never seen such a cringe worthy compilation of terrible humour, immensely drab and repeated cliche 'harem scenes', sub- par ecchi scenes that don't even KNOW whether they want to take advantage of the show's R+ rating, as well as a story that serves NO PURPOSE. \r\nThe entire show was utterly, and completely, pointless. \"Don't watchecchi shows looking for good story\" some may say. Fair point, perhaps watching a show that has a completely pointless story doesn't work for me. What I'm concerned about primarily here is... what the show DOES focus on and what it DOES value is also done to a horrific standard; i.e the humour and the ecchi scenes. The story and the humour are both closely intertwined, which is why I have mentioned the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue with this story is not only in the fact that it is totally pointless... it is also physically painful to watch. The humour present is just so stupid, and the story events are supposed to be funny and goofy... but they're really not at all. They're just crap. There is no other way for me to explain it without pulling out my foul-word-repertoire. The only time I was laughing was when it was beginning to hit me just how terrible this show is. \\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi, also closely linked to the story (which leaves the ecchi dead on arrival, as the scenes are badly executed due to the badly written story) is just lacking. If you're going to have a show based so heavily around ecchi- scenes, make them good. Seriously. (I will say that To LOVE-Ru Darkness really picks up the ball on this one, but that's not related to this steaming pile of buffalo feces i.e the first season of this show). The ecchi scenes are just not good enough for a show like this. They cover the nipples more than they should, and as has been previously mentioned, the scenes are just badly executed in general, to an eye- rolling extent. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters. Oh god, the characters. Here we go. The main character, of course, being Rito (who is clearly just an unfortunate soul trapped in a terrible anime for the lowest common denominator) is just a completely pointless character. Yes, there are a few scenes demonstrating the fact that he's just a genuinely 'nice' kid, and that he likes plants (which is the basis for which one of the characters in the show falls for him... what kind of CRAP is that?!), but they hardly explore his character at all apart from his internal conflict regarding whether or not he wants to bone the hyperactive pink haired bimbo or the ONLY INTERESTING CHARACTER IN THE SHOW, Haruna. Instead they just use his character as a means to instigate terrible ecchi scene after terrible ecchi scene; you know, the usual trip over and somehow strip the woman naked - mistakes and bumbles that are mildly funny once or twice, but become ridiculously depressing to watch after 26 EPISODES. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to make this too long, but in summary, all of the other characters except for Haruna, in this season anyway, are just 'there', and serve no purpose other than to be 'hot' or to be stripped naked. Lala is one of the few anime girls that I would willingly punch in the face, and the school principle should be arrested. Not for being a sexual predator, but for being a fat midget who is NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what do we have here? We have a story that is completely and utterly pointless with NO redeeming aspects whatsoever, whether it be in regards to the characters (who have the depth of a piss puddle) or the humour (which is some of the worst I've seen in anime thus far). I am aware that a lot of the things I have outlined in this review aren't unusual for a harem anime, but my concern is that this anime does everything BADLY. I actually LIKE a lot of the aspects that this show presents; aliens, ecchi, humour, just to name a few. What concerns me is just how TERRIBLY these were done. If you're going to have a crap story, support it with something else that's good in place of it. A an anime that is weak in all aspects, to the point where it hurts to watch a few minutes of one episode out of 26 EPISODES, should not be allowed to exist. \\n\\n\r\nI regret ever getting into this series.",

            "content": "Alright. Here we have another RomCom ecchi harem anime. I'm not a big fan of Harem, or even reverse harem, but if it's played out well I might enjoy it. To be quite honest, I watched To LOVE-Ru about a year ago, but I still remember most of it. So let's get on with the review, shall we?\r\nStory: 5\r\nThe story is of a boy that we can easily call Anonymous, because this kind of character is a little rehashed. He can't confess to a girl, and then another alien girl appears that's running away from her planet. To stay on Earth, she says she'll marryAnonymous. Alright. This kind of idea could be good. The problem is, too many characters were introduced and the focus of the story was kind of lost Anonymous never really becomes closer to the girl he likes or Lala, the alien girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe falling point in the story department is that although the story itself had some sort of potential, that potential was lost when it became too much of an ecchi harem. I know the idea of some extraterrestrial girl falling in love with a pathetic human is hawt, but it's not realistic. At most the alien would become interested in the human, and use them for lodging, and perhaps over time they may see something in this person. In a way, Lala does this, but she falls in love with him immediately. If I was Lala, I'd look at my options. Surely there was a better guy than Anonymous on that planet? I don't know, someone with more PERSONALITY?!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNow, this is where To LOVE-Ru is very good. The art is rather beautiful and clean. The opening art was very well done. I only wish they didn't do so much zooming on their tits and crotch for credits. Seriously. I almost didn't watch this anime because of that. Each character design is unique in my opinion Lala's  space outfit was something that drew me to this anime, as it looked like a mix of a devil, alien, and slut outfit. To LOVE-Ru is one of those animes in which the characters actually look their age, and not like little midgets trying to convince everyone they really are 16.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nTo LOVE-Ru's opening is \"Forever we can make it,\" which was a song I immediately fell in love with. For me, often the opening is what ultimately convinces me if I should watch an anime or not, and To LOVE-Ru's opening art along with song convinced me to watch it. The ending, \"Lucky Tune,\" was also catchy, though not as much. I've often hummed these songs out loud in public because of how great they are.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, I'm going to have to watch a clip or two before I review this, because I've forgotten all about it.\\n\\n\r\n-INTERMISSION-\\n\\n\r\nAlright I'm back. The voice acting is very good, actually. The women do their parts of screaming in embarrassment pretty well, and the guys do a good job of voicing perverts and Anonymous. I wouldn't say \"realistic\" is the word. Honestly. Girls don't really scream out in embarrassment. I'm a girl. I should know. Maybe some do, but most would cover themselves up and hiss at the guy. And the guy would apologize, close the door, and find a nice quiet room to rub one out.\\n\\n\r\nI'm getting off topic, aren't I?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNow, one could say the majority of the cast being girls is a falling point too. I disagree, unless every single one is a part of the harem. Let's consider a non-anime famous story: Harry Potter. Weren't most of the cast male? Does that mean Hermoine was banging a new guy every week? No! The majority of the cast can be female, but not if that's their only selling point. And the male characters aren't any better. The principal's only point is to be a pervert, Lala's bodyguard, whats-his-face is even less of a bodyguard than Anonymous. It seems like he's just there to spout shit and be a source of fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nBut the other problem with a lot of characters being introduced quickly is that there's no development. I never finished To LOVE-Ru, because I don't think I could withstand more. Not even Anonymous got any development throughout 20 episodes, and I doubt there would have been any in the next 6. That's why I'm calling him Anonymous.The characters are too 2-dimensional and it makes it hard for me to sympathize with them. If Lala was hit by a truck in the middle of the series, I wouldn't shed a tear. \\n\\n\r\nYou know a series in which the characters develop a lot, and in less than 26 episodes? There's Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Elfen Leid, which is more ecchi than this. Tokyo Mew mew was even longer, and obviously took their time to develop the characters, although the guy was also an anonymous.\\n\\n\r\nAh, I love a good rant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nNow, with all the shit I said about To LOVE-Ru, why do I give it a rather high rating? Because I fully remember watching this and liking it. I just lose interest quickly, and that's why I stopped it. I watched episodes 1-18, and a year later I watched 19-20. Then I wondered why I enjoyed this so much. Perhaps it was fun to see the strange antics Anonymous and his harem get into? perhaps it was fun to see Anonymous have his ass kicked by a girl every episode, the whiny loser? Perhaps I wanted to see some fucking development? The only kiss was an accidental male on male-that-can-change-into-a-girl-with-a-sneeze-and-vice-versa, and I'm not a fan of Yaoi. Or Yuri, for that matter. And this show has the nerve to call itself romance.\\n\\n\r\nIt did give me a few laughs. Lala's sudden useless inventions did make it interesting. See, this is realistic. Lala bringing in some random shit that turns out to be dangerous. A lot of people do that. What's not realistic is this thing being an octopus that tentacle rapes Lala and the love interest girl. It's also not realistic that nearly twenty girls have some connection to Anonymous. However, I digress. I fully remember enjoying this show. Hey, even the smelliest shit has something good in it. Perhaps it was the music, or the art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8=7\\n\r\nThrough some mighty calculating, I give this show a fair rating. It had a good story, great art, and beautiful music, but they just couldn't fit that all together into something amazing. Maybe if To LOVE-Ru wasn't a harem, I would have gave it a better rating. Yes, it's a harem. At least five girls are in love with Anonymous for some reason. The problem with most harems is that they don't really give that much of a reason to LIKE the main character. I'm planning to watch R-15, since it seems the main character isn't some washed-up perverted loser. He's an intelligent perverted writer. I'm not sure. I haven't watched it yet.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying harem animes are bad. The problem with them is that they give much reasoning behind them. Why would an alien girl suddenly love a human. Why would ANYONE like a guy that's so indecisive a king took him by the collar and yelled \"YOU INDECISIVE BASTARD!\" in his face, and he STILL couldn't make a decision? Come on. It's not that hard to tell an alien princess to fuck off, is it? And please don't put so many girls in the harem, unless there's a valid reason to love the main character.\\n\\n\r\nCome on, Harem genre. It's not too late to show your potential.",

            "content": "Where do I start... \r\nWell this show is not for everyone. If you do not like borderline porn, harem, random perverts and groping then you might want to find a different series. This show was not that bad. It had potential to be good but it did not quite make it. At first, I only watched a couple episodes then just stopped. Few days later, I ended up finishing it. The story wasn't so bad but just poorly executed. It had mostly fillers but the fillers were just different situations that the guy and alien girl went through. Until the last couple episodes, it closesthis series. Then the sequels come out and I tried out those and I just started skipping half of them cause they were fillers also. I basically skipped to the To Loveru: Darkness series and I basically didn't miss much except for the fact that the characters never developed after about 4 seasons, give or take, and that it is the same crappy fillers they always had. But I will admit they have a better story, or at least a story this time, and the fillers actually connected with each other. I am not going to spoil the fun for everyone but I will say a couple of things. In To Loveru: Darkness, if you want to see Rito pick a girl in the end chances are he will never pick just one cause of his personality and how he is in the series. You are basically putting your hopes up that are destined to fail you. I would really appriciate if they actually have him pick one girl in the end but I feel like the intentions of the audience and the writer is on something else. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would probably watch \"To Loveru\" and then just stop so I don't ruin myself to the other fanservice sequels. In my opinion, this whole concept was a wasted. I would only watch this if I wasn't looking for too much of an ending, for random laughs of enjoyment and also if I wanted to look at attractive anime characters. Other then that, I don't really think it is worth watching because the farther you get through the each series of these, the more you get frustrated with certain things that re-occur that will never be re-solved in the end.",

            "content": "OVA Impressions At The End. This review contains minor spoilers.\r\nTo LOVE-Ru\r\n This\u2026 this\u2026.. had soooo much goooood. SOO MUCH. Byong Boing! That\u2019s the sound breasts make if you didn\u2019t know! Do you like 2D Girls (Who doesn\u2019t?), do you like the ecchi/lewd nature of anime (.. I DO!)\u2026\u2026 do you want to watch something that is both funny and infuriating at the same time? (Probably not) To Love-Ru is all that and more! =)\r\n So To LOVE-Ru is about Rito Yuuki, a boy who is, like your typical Harem shows, afraid of all things related to girls. He gets incredibly flustered at the slightest thoughtof anything slightly naughty\u2026 for instance, imagining his crush in a bikini will cause him to overheat and flip out and just \u201cdie\u201d; if you hate hate hate seeing MC\u2019s who act like that, skip To Love-RU, almost every single episode, say for maybe 2 of the 26, involve him getting into situations like that. If you can handle this type of personality, To LOVE-Ru rewards you with many many many many ecchi scenes.\\n\\n\r\n The story starts out with Yuuki taking a bath when all of a sudden Lala appears naked in his bath and he just happens to be holding her breasts. Unfortunately for him, the way to propose a marriage to an alien of the Deviluke planet is to\u2026. You guessed it!..... grab the breasts of the woman you want to marry. This is the beginning of To Love-Ru and for the most part, it stays comedic and fun throughout.\\n\\n\r\n As I mentioned above, Lala is our alien from Deviluke, she\u2019s super gorgeous, incredibly pretty, has a beautiful and radiant personality, full of bubbly lovey goodness. She has a super cute tail and she has a helper named Peke who can change her outfits on a whim. Some of the best scenes involve Peke changing her outfits, because Peke will wrap himself around her causing Lala to moan in rather sensual matters.\\n\\n\r\n Now, a harem can\u2019t consist of just one girl now, can it? So the others are, Haruna, Yuuki\u2019s crush. She has a very shy personality and even though she likes Yuuki, they both tend to act the same when alone, flustered, shy, no words to say. Don\u2019t except \u201canything\u201d to happen between the two of them. We also have Yami-chan, she\u2019s an assassin who is sent to kill Yuuki, but discovers that Yuuki is actually a really kind guy and she sort of falls for him; I think she\u2019s absolutely amazing and her  ability is super incredible ; she\u2019s also the gothic Lolita of the show; so\u2026\u2026 yeah. There is also Run-chan, who is one of the best characters of the anime.  Being an alien, he changes genders in both body and mind 100% whenever he sneezes. As a male, he\u2019s totally in love with Lala and tries to prove how much of a man he is. As a female, she will try her best to get Yuuki to notice her. As a female, she\u2019s one of the best looking girls in the anime and is just so pretty . Then come the cast of supports who just happen to be a part of the harem or somehow involved with Lala or Yuuki, I won\u2019t list them all, but Mikado-sensei is definitely one to look out for, she\u2019s pretty great.\\n\\n\r\n So a large cast of characters, a story that makes very little sense and a lot of episodes for something that should probably only be a 1-cour show; how does To LOVE-Ru keep people watching all the way through? Well easy; throughout most of the anime, To LOVE-Ru takes the direction of introducing other aliens who continually try to propose to Lala and fail. There are episodes where Lala tries to please Yuuki as much as possible, there are episodes that include some tentacle action, there are many episodes where the show is simply slice of life goodness. Around half way or so, we\u2019re introduced to Lala\u2019s father and for a second, a real plot starts up, but no\u2026 not at all. After that episode the anime goes back into its standard harem fairs and things. The best thing and probably the saving grace for To Love-RU are the ecchi related scenes. Pantsu shots? Yeah, expect to see at least 2-3 pairs of panties being shown per episode. Boobs? Yeah, expect to see the great breasts almost each episode (or honestly, every episode). Skin? Yesss, there is a lot of skin shown in To LOVE-Ru, backside shots, butts, thighs and all sorts of things. Ecchi/lewd is really where To LOVE-Ru shines and it\u2019s the only reason anyone would really want to watch To LOVE-Ru. It\u2019s a harem, with a rather lame MC, great and super cute girls and a lot of fun when Yuuki isn\u2019t involved as much. I know the later seasons really spice things up and thank goodness, I don\u2019t believe To LOVE-Ru could continue on with its direction for much longer before just becoming a chore to watch.\\n\\n\r\n Art: It\u2019s 100% static and very plain. The wind moves, but only to reveal pantsu (not complaining) and blow the girls hair. Nothing looks \u201cgood\u201d really, aside from the girls themselves. The school is plain, the background art is plain, and everything is really\u2026.really plain. Thank goodness the colors are visually rewarding and the girls are pretty and cute. Aside from that, there is detail elsewhere. Shading where it counts, lines drawn in ways to give the viewers a better \u201cunderstanding\u201d at what they\u2019re looking at, in this regard, huuuge A+ to the art team peoples, you did your job and fulfilled the ecchi role incredibly well, bravo!\\n\\n\r\n Music/Sound: An aspect that To LOVE-Ru actually excels at. Great use of BGM, great understanding of when to begin and stop music, great music choices to begin with! The OP is amazing, as is the first ED, but the 2nd ED with Haruna as the key focus, that might be one of the best ED\u2019s ever, it\u2019s seriously so good to listen to and the art with Haruna is just incredible; for instance, there is heavy emphasis on her lips and man, it looks good; it\u2019s simply amazing, really, they make Haruna not just look \u201cgood\u201d, but incredibly attractive, more than normal.\\n\\n\r\n To LOVE-Ru, an anime filled with ecchi, filled with lewd, filled with super cute girls. That\u2019s really all there is to say about it; I expected something similar to what I received. Lala, however was the highlight of the entire anime and when the story plot started to matter (last two episodes), she did what I never thought she would do, simply because Yuuki is a loser\u2026. I really hope  Haruna and Yuuki get together in Motto, because it\u2019s getting tiring seeing them act so ridiculous around one another . If not, then the lewd needs to be a lot better to really keep interest, much more risqu\u00e9 and more of it too.\\n\\n\r\n NOTE: The below are my rather.... mind losing impressions of the OVA's, don't read, it contains a lot of \"oh my gao/gau's\" and me yelling names....\\n\\n\r\n OVA: Episode 1: OH MY GAO, that\u2019s incredible! I think To LOVE-Ru would be a ton better if it had Yuuki be like this instead, especially since he\u2019s all \u201cooooh noooo, girls\u201d, and stuff. I wish his personality was changed though, that would have made this so much better; but Lala is amazing. Saki, this episode made her absolutely amazing and incredible, goooo SAKI!\\n\\n\r\n Episode 2: Mikan (Yuuki\u2019s imouto) is way too cute this episode, so unbelievably adorable! Yuuki-baka! Yami-san continues to just be an all-around amazing girl and Haruna actually did something this episode, in an OVA, but still, she did something! Yuuki Baka Baka Baka Baka!!\\n\\n\r\n Episode 3: An island resort consisting only of the girls? Yes please. Bikini\u2019s everywhere, rubbing oil on each other, butts, thighs, boobs, and a little more of\u2026 oh this is heaven!",

            "content": "Harem ending. \r\nThe plotline is broken down into four segments:\r\nSegment 1: Lala is here - everyone go crazy (underlying tone throughout)\r\nSegment 2: Suitors from other planets - everyone goes crazy.\r\nSegment 3: Everyone is in love with the hero, Rito - still, everyone goes crazy.\r\nSegment 4: Quest to become #1 in the universe - Everyone (mostly Rito) goes crazy \r\nThese segments are fun and would be enjoyable to watch, if the show were 12 episodes long. However, when these segments are stretched out into 3, 4, or even 5 back-to-back (sometimes broken up by an episode) episodes with a similar theme, it's going to get predictableand boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what pull this show out of the dumpster. \"To Love Ru\" decided to go with the \"million shades of gray\" character personality list. You got your introverts, extroverts, flirts, perverts, control freaks, etc., etc.; all types of character are represented here and each are given a good amount of screen time so that they become familiar and likable. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening theme to the series. I usually tend to skip the opening themes to most animes because it's always keeping me from getting to the actual content. \"Ru\"'s, however, won me over. The catchy up-beat tone and truncated guitar chords, coupled with the change in octaves and tempo of the voice always made me feel like I was hearing it for the first time,  every time. The best opening theme I've encountered so far. \\n\\n\r\nBeing that I can't really compare how the art style translated to the anime from the manga - I'll let that comparison slide - but I really dug the art style that was employed with \"Ru.\" That classic anime feel that is has to it - almost old school - but clean and crisp enough that you know it's part of a newer era of anime. \\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime. I liked the amount of fanservice, I liked the amount of romance. I just can't get past the typical harem ending we find ourselves in again. They try to distract you, it seems, by (attempting) to pull off an ending that is so ludicrous and \"WTF-ish\" that you almost forget that, all-in-all, it's a harem.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10. Nothing anyone hasn't already seen, heard, thought already\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. A classic anime art style that's clean and crisp.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Apart from the amazing theme, the voice work is good. But, c'mon, that theme kicks ass. \\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Would've liked to have seen more of the main female protagonists' feelings. Enticing and enjoyable characters, however.\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 7/10. A good anime for a viewer that doesn't mind harem endings. I do, though, and the score suffered because of it.",

            "content": "STORY - 4\r\nART - 6\r\nSOUND - 7\r\nCHARACTER - 6\r\nENJOYMENT - 6\r\nWell, hello there fanservice. To LOVE-Ru is full-on packed with all kinds of ecchi goodies, crammed tightly into a bundle of filler-esque stories to bring in humor, a bit of romance, and quite a handful of bored annoyance at your side.\r\nLike I said, the story is pretty much how you would define fillers to be. Simple episodes that were not related to the main sci-fi story that was introduced early in the anime. Which is not a bad thing in hindsight, but for a mindless entertainment of this nature, To LOVE-Ru didn't do a goodjob in achieving that goal for the most part. There were a lot of repetition. Let me repeat that again. There were simply too much repetition for the show to be a fun one. It was why I was amused by the first half but as time goes on, I found myself to get annoyed with the recurrence, whether it's jokes or actions, because it won't work if you've seen it multiple times. However, there were a few episodes that I really enjoyed as I found myself laughing at the silly things that happened with the characters. As for them, it was pleasing to see that the main boy wasn't as annoying as I thought he would be. In fact, he strayed away from the major denseness found in other leads who happen to be in the same situation as him, although a couple of similarities were still present. The group of girls were likable, having personalities that were different enough to each other. However, only a couple of them had screentime so I didn't feel too much about the ones who were barely there this season.\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to be said in the arts department except for the fact that it was as simple as the story. A modern take on the looks of the art style in the past. Consistency were maintained with the use of bright colors that matched with the energetic aura from the characters. Though for the animation, at times it felt dull which didn't really helped with the boring story. There were exaggeration in the comedy and ecchi scenes, as to be expected in an anime containing a lot of silliness. With fanservice, it should be unprecendented that the designs of the characters were quite proportional, including their eyes too which reaches big but not big enough to look weird. Cute I'd say, especially with their clothings as it complemented well with the personality of each characters. Same goes for the voice acting though it did took a bit of time to get used with some. While there were no notable soundtracks that I've remembered, it did removed any distractions that could possibly ruin some of the humors so that's a good thing. And for the opening and ending songs, they had a charming attitude that fit the tone of the anime if that made any sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nTo LOVE-Ru in the end served as an entertainment that only shows and doesn't tell any progression of the story or characters. In a sense, it's just a montage of attempted humors combined with a sexy atmosphere that worked for half of the time. Do not try to find any deeper meaning in this anime and just watch it at face value. This ecchi trial of harem is awaiting you.",

If anything it is merely a combination of character tropes and cliches. At the end of the day this anime is very simple. Fanservice + Harem + Spineless Protagonist = $$$$. For those who enjoy shallow, fanservice based humor, I would recommend this anime. To those who are looking for something similar, but with an actualstory, I recommend Nisekoi, High School DxD, or Sora no Otoshimono. 4/10",

            "content": "A lot of people recommended this to me. It took me well over a year to finish but I wanted to give it a review because I think it is overhyped. \r\nAnimation and Sound: The animation is ok. The only problem I have it is that the characters look creepily young which is a problem in an echhi anime. Because of that, many parts of this anime are very uncomfortable and kind of gross. The voice acting is hard to judge because the dialogue is so repetitive that it doesn\u2019t really get a chance to be memorable. The voice acting does shine in the finalepisode but at that point it is already too late. The music is also repetitive. Every episode has the same goofy tune which gets really irritating after about the third time you hear it. \\n\r\nCharacters: After about the 5th episode they become so predictable that there is no point in them even talking. Instead of building on these characters the cast just expands with even more flat characters. \\n\r\nStory. This show is tedious. Every episode is like wading through oatmeal. The story starts out interesting and goes absolutely nowhere for 22 episodes. Its just filler through and through. On top of that every episode follows the exact same formula with minor alterations just so we can tell episodes apart. It becomes the same nothing over and over again. There is a main plot but it takes place over 4 episodes, making 22 episodes a complete waste of time. I admit the main plot is ok and actually has some substance. The problem is it is easily drowned out by the fluff surrounding it. This show tries to be a comedy but manages to become completely unfunny. I didn\u2019t laugh once. The closest I would ever come to laughter was a long depressing sigh. With a drawn out story, bland characters, and a complete lack of humor the show really isn\u2019t worth it. If you judge the show by the 4 real episodes its ok. However, a review is not fair if you pick and choose and 22 terrible episodes ruin the average. If you like harem, ecchi, or comedy there are better shows out there so I would say don\u2019t waste your time with this one.\\n",

I haven't even been watching anime faithfully more than a year, and I've seen similar set ups at least 3 other times. But the story isn't what's so great about this anime. Sure, it gets us from place to place, in a mostly episodic anime. But what I enjoyed out of this anime was the wackiness of the show.

The last epi is how she cancels the wedding, but in the book, it goes way past that! And in the epi's i dont ever recall encountering Momo or Nana. And i thinkthey're actually important. Some of the chapters i wish were episodes because theyre so funny or suspenseful. Other than that and very few tiny tiny mishaps, i think To-LOVE-Ru is fantastic, and i'd like to read or watch more like it! =3",

            "content": "I've been watching a lot of Harem anime lately, and I'm not fully sure as to why. Whether it's the zany misadventures, the hilariously awkward scenarios, or the countless love stories connected to the male protagonist; I've enjoyed the lighthearted, straightforward fun that comes out of this sub-genre! \r\n\"To Love-Ru,\" is no exception to this pattern. Highly entertaining, hilarious, incredibly wacky and chock full of fan-service; this series perfectly encapsulates what good harem anime is all about! Given that we've discussed a bit in terms of the nature of the show, let's talk a bit about its story! \r\nRito Yuuki is our main male protagonist,and a young man who is a bit down on his luck. He has a big crush on a girl in his school named Haruna Sarenjei, who subsequently, unbeknownst to Rito, also has a crush on him. Though they are friends, Rito cannot muster up the courage to confess his feelings to her, ultimately leaving him feeling dejected and defeated. In the midst of all this, a young princess named Lala from the planet (yes, planet,) Deviluke is fleeing her homeland in hopes of avoiding an arranged marriage. In the midst of her pursuit, she ends up on planet earth and ultimately... Rito's house! Shocked at this development, Rito frantically tries to keep her a secret, especially from Haruna! In haste, love, and perhaps a bit of desperation, Lala declares herself to be Rito's fiance, which was ultimately made official by a planetary contract with Deviluke. Lala is super cute, super funny, and any guys dream girl, right? Wrong. She is not Haruna, and our poor male MC is left to wonder if he can ever be with Haruna after the events that had just taken place. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of this basic plot synopsis, the story is quite loose and operates in more of an episodic fashion than anything. Rito ends up making quite a bit more friends, primarily female, ranging in their memorability and pertinence to the story. The plot as laid out above, sets up the zany adventures that Rito partakes of with his friends, or perhaps more fittingly, his harem. They do everything from fighting aliens, building robots, and going to the center of the earth, to  chilling at the beach, (because every anime needs a beach episode!) and saving the world from mass destruction. The episodic nature of this series allows for quite a bit more leniency in just how much variety and differentiation can be present with each and every episode! The subtle story lines are just that, subtle, which is perfect for this series. The wackiness and overall uniqueness of this series in its singularity is something so, so refreshing for a harem series. The planetary/alien theme isn't super common within the genre, and going outside of the typical trappings of school life is also a welcome change of pace from the norm! \\n\\n\r\nAnother really awesome thing about \"To Love-Ru,\" is the likability of the characters. In any harem series, it can be really hard to like just about every girl, or even the male MC. Often times, the MC can be a one dimensional pervert, bereft of any depth as it pertains to male/female relationships. On the other hand, many harem girls can be seemingly bitchy, uninteresting, obnoxious or like our male MC, one dimensional. Though I'm pretty lenient in my harem character studies, there's usually at least that one character that bothers me and falls into these aforementioned categories. I can say with confidence that this is not the case with this series. While these characters range in their memorability, they are all largely likable, kind, funny and genuine. Qualities like these can sometimes be put on the back burner so as to appeal the solely the fan service or awkward scenario's between the MC and the harem. \"To Love-Ru,\" balances these factors excellently, giving us a lot of fan service and zany scenario's, teamed up with some well developed and likable characters! \\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, Rito, Lala and Haruna really take the cake for the most likable characters in this series! Rito is good a guy who likes girls for the right reasons, not always gawking at their bodies and external features. He's mild mannered, quiet and respectful, always looking out for the needs of others before his own. Lala is a fitting companion for Rito, though quite the opposite in many ways! She's lively, vibrant, hilarious, bubbly and honestly, a bit of a klutz! She always shows Rito affection through verbal affirmation, physical touch and various other means of flirting. In this way, she's much different than a lot of harem love interests. She doesn't incessantly beat up Rito and doesn't embody the typical Tsundere personality that a lot of harem female MC's exhibit. Haruna reminds me a LOT of Onadera from \"Nisekoi,\" (such a GREAT series!) She has a lot of similar qualities to Rito, thus they are quite conversationally compatible, sharing in an awesome friendship that develops throughout the series. We see these characters and their qualities throughout the entire series, but we also see them grow as people as the series progresses. Additionally, we see different sides of them in response to different scenarios whether good or bad, allowing for a decent amount of depth within most of the characters, especially these main three. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this series is very catchy and fitting for the genre, and the opening theme, \"Forever We Can Make It,\" is my favorite opening song of all time! It is super upbeat, fun and catchy, in a way, like a microcosm of the entire show. The closing theme is also solid, and likewise, upbeat! \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are solid, but fairly average stylistically speaking. The color palette for this series is great though! It's all very vibrant and colorful, to match the overall optimism represented in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"To Love-Ru,\" receives an 8 for all of its merits and how they work well within the genre. Though I appreciated the episodic nature of this series, and the liberties it gave to various smaller stories, I didn't enjoy every single episode. Some episodes were long winded, or uninteresting. This is natural with shows that operate in a more episodic way, and it's not something I really hold against \"To Love-Ru,\" to a large extent. For the most part, this show was hilarious, fun, wacky, heartwarming and highly entertaining! Being that this show didn't set out to be a masterpiece, I didn't  expect it to be such. Within the confines of the genre it exhibited, \"To Love-Ru,\" stands tall as one of the finest harem series' of all time in my book! I highly recommend for fans of good harem anime, romantic comedies, or just something wacky! You probably won't be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score-8",

            "content": "The MyAnimeList reviewing scheme suggests that giving a show a 2/10 implies that I found said show \"Horrible.\" For the most part, this is not inaccurate, but when it comes to To LOVE-Ru, it doesn't really fit. This is an anime that is not so much horrible as it is horribly dull\u2014an atrocity of mediocrity if you will. I'll get deeper into the plot and characters later but, fundamentally, the cardinal flaw with this show is that it is an ecchi series without very good ecchi. There is all the lack of plot and weak characterization you might expect from a major ecchi series, butvery little of the fanservice-filled payoff. It\u2019s like porn without the porn\u2014nothing, in other words. 26 episodes of vapid, vacuous, banal, stale, insipid nothingness. It is natural then that I regret watching To LOVE-Ru, for who would consider watching nothing for 26 episodes an enriching way to pass the time?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, To LOVE-Ru does, in fact, have the very vaguest semblance of a plot (at least in the first few episodes). Our main character, a man with a propensity for falling down on top of attractive women, is named Yuuki Rito. He lives a normal high school life... that is, until something shocking happens in the bath one day. While the unsuspecting Rito is minding his own business, a naked alien girl named Lala (who looks indistinguishable from a human besides her bright pink hair and tail) falls on top of him out of nowhere. Through a series of extraordinarily contrived misunderstandings, Rito accidentally proposes to this girl despite actually being in love with Haruna Sairenji, another girl at his school. Naturally, being utterly incapable of expressing himself to girls his age, he finds himself unable to call off the accidental proposal, and likewise unable to profess his love to the real girl of his dreams. To make things worse, the reason Lala ended up in Rito\u2019s bath in the first place is that she is the crown princess of one of the most powerful civilizations in the galaxy\u2013\u2013the Devilukeans\u2013\u2013and was trying to escape a political marriage. As a result, any attempts by Rito to break off the engagement would likely offend the Devilukeans and might end not only in his death but the death of the entire world. So, with tensions as high as they are, Rito is obviously immediately inspired to go out and face his problems, clear up any misunderstandings and\u2014just kidding, he acts like the hero he is and continues with his daily life as though nothing is wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYes, while a number of other aliens show up to either try to assassinate Rito or convince Lala to cancel the proposal, and countless other girls show up and dilute the situation further, as far as progress, there is none to be seen. Instead, the show remains in an awkward limbo, with Rito clearly in a situation in pressing need of his attention yet making only the most feeble and infrequent attempts at remedying this fact. In truth, most of the episodes don't even mention the main plot at all. Rather, they resort to episode long filler plots which range from bad to appalling. We see everything from Lala bringing in some alien tentacle monsters (animated with horrible CG) to cook and getting groped by them instead, to some insignificant side character dreaming about being in feudal Japan.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the story is questionable and mostly ignored\u2014there may as well be no story. But as I wrote above, in an ecchi show such as this one, sacrificing plot for fanservice is common practice\u2014I daresay I prefer it that way. No one in their right mind would watch this show hoping for a complex or emotional story to blow them away, as that would only get in the way of what really matters here: the fanservice. What they might hope for, however, is a plot that would facilitate as much fanservice as possible. And here, is the heart of the issue. Despite advertising itself as \"a romantic comedy full of slapstick humor, sexy girls, and outlandishly lewd moments that defy the laws of physics,\" To LOVE-Ru contains a surprising dearth of lewdness. 90% of the fanservice in this series is composed of little more than panty shots and Rito being an accidental pervert by falling on top of girls, and the other 10% is rarely much better. Sometimes the series will go for almost an entire episode with very little fanservice, instead caught up in its lackluster filler plots\u2014filler plots like the one about feudal Japan I mentioned above, which create practically no good opportunities for sexual moments. How could this become a flagship of the ecchi genre when it does ecchi in such a mediocre way? From what I have heard, this situation was largely caused by the anime deviating heavily from the manga, which is apparently much better. Certainly, if there is one good thing about To LOVE-Ru it is the character designs, which were taken directly from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of characters, I think it is high time I discussed them. To get straight to the point, they are clich\u00e9 and uninspired. And unlike with the plot, being ecchi is absolutely not an acceptable reason for bad characters. Series like Nisemonogatari are proof that fanservice shows are perfectly capable of having well-written and unique characters. Now, rather than talk about them broadly, I think the best thing for me to do at this point is to scrutinize each and every character in needless detail. \\n\r\nSo, without further ado, let's begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMain Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nRito Yuuki: From head to toe, Rito is comprised of little more than the standard elements of your friendly neighborhood harem protagonist. He's nice, bad at talking to girls, clumsy and if the size of his harem is any indication, the most attractive man in the galaxy. Only one little thing: he is absolutely, 100%, completely and fully opposed to anything even remotely sexual. Just imagining a girl in a swimsuit is too much for his sex-averse mind to handle. In this way, this show\u2019s failures stem largely from the failures of this one aspect of this one character: someone thought it would be a good idea to make the lewdest show around about a kid who doesn\u2019t like lewd things. It is one thing to have the protagonist of, say, a battle shounen be sex-averse, but for the main character of an ecchi anime to act that way is like trying to make a sports anime about a character who has a grudge against sports. Pure and simple: it doesn\u2019t make any sense. I realize that such timid protagonists are not uncommon in ecchi harem shows like this, but I have always found this fact baffling, and this show certainly does nothing to reduce my confusion.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does at least make feeble attempts at addressing this obvious contradiction, and it does so rather creatively by attempting to have Rito become the preeminent accidental pervert of the anime world. And this, to be totally and completely honest, is not actually such a bad idea. Now, instead of having some unsympathetic loser who goes around groping women as our main character, we have a fine, respectable young man who just\u2026 accidentally finds himself groping women sometimes. In a good anime, this could be a resounding success, creating lots of fanservice in an interesting way, but this is not a good anime. The vast majority of Rito\u2019s accidental perversion takes the form of him falling on top of girls, and in doing so, finding his hands and/or face where they really don\u2019t belong. Sometimes these scenes are amusing, but by the end, they are so overused and so rarely varied upon that they quickly become tiresome more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Rito is mostly generic, and where he does deviate from the norm, he rarely achieves anything of particular note. With such a weak foundation on which to build the rest of the show, it is little surprise that To LOVE-Ru is so spectacularly unsuccessful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLala Satalin Deviluke: Rito\u2019s fianc\u00e9e Lala is nothing groundbreaking either character-wise, but she remains one of the stronger characters the show has to offer. Her personality is bubbly, upbeat, and... well, not very complex, but her demeanor is so resoundingly positive that I have great difficulty maintaining any lasting dislike for her. In essence, she is a bundle of joy, and while she is not the most richly wrought character to ever come out of the world of anime, her frequent presence is one of the few features that make this slog of a show bearable.\\n\\n\r\nBesides her personality, the other main aspect that sets Lala apart is her inventing abilities. Though she never comes off as particularly intelligent, we are told to believe that she is, in fact, a genius who regularly invents devices capable of nearly anything. Naturally, To LOVE-Ru being the show that it is, \u201cnearly anything\u201d usually takes the form of a device that causes fanservice-y shenanigans in some capacity. Be it a teleporter that causes the teleportees to lose their clothes along the way, a machine that swaps the genders of its users, or a pair of glasses that allows one to see through clothes, Lala\u2019s inventions never fail to impress. As one of the few consistent producers of quality fanservice in the show, it is always a delight when an episode centers on one of these, though like all the good things this anime has to offer, they don\u2019t seem to appear as often as they should.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaruna Sairenji: Rito\u2019s dream girl could best be described as blandness incarnate. The reason for Rito\u2019s attraction to her, if we are to surmise from the two minutes dedicated to the subject during the first few episodes, is her extreme kindness. At first, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with this, but as the show progresses it becomes increasingly apparent that the reason that Rito finds her kindness to be her most appealing characteristic is largely that it is her only characteristic of note. Despite being one of the most important characters in the show, her personality can pretty comprehensively be described with the word \u201cnice.\u201d Though she never does anything actively offensive, her oppressive boringness made me quickly come to dislike any time she appeared on screen (which was quite frequent given that she is a major character). This dislike was only compounded by the fact that every time Rito is in her presence, he immediately becomes a blubbering, retarded cow of a human being and finds himself utterly incapable of expressing even the most basic of thoughts without stuttering seven thousand times. Even given that this kind of awkwardness is typical of anime romances, the extreme to which Rito takes it quickly makes it change from endearing and cute to tiresome and grating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSide Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nKonjiki no Yami (Golden Darkness): The \u201cGolden Darkness\u201d is a cold and distant alien assassin capable of transforming any part of its body into a weapon. It was sent to the earth to murder Rito so that Lala could be married off to some other alien prince. After it meets Rito in person, however, it discovers that he is actually kindhearted, and decides that killing him would be wrong. For the rest of show it remains officially still carrying out its mission to off Rito, but really just living on earth because it has come to like it there.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and it takes the form of a cute girl that goes by \u201cYami-chan.\u201d Obviously. Cute girls can be cold-blooded killers too!\\n\\n\r\nYami as a concept is probably the most compelling any character in To LOVE-Ru gets, though, between her appearance, her dispassionate personality, and her status as a living weapon, she draws a few too many similarities with Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion to call her wholly original. If anything, she suffers from the same issue that Rito did: as an idea, she\u2019s not bad, and in a good anime she would be a successful character, but (as has been firmly established) a good anime this is not. She\u2019s given none of the development a character with a setup this interesting deserves, instead mostly being used as the token deadpan girl and occasionally using her turning-body-parts-into-weapons ability for slapstick humor. If there is one character in this show who deserves to be a part of a better anime then it is surely the \u201cGolden Darkness.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nRun Elsie Jewelria and Ren Elsie Jewelria: A childhood friend of Lala\u2019s that comes to earth aiming to woo her. Run and Ren are really two separate personalities that live in one body as an alien that switches between male (Ren) and female (Run) every time it sneezes. As an idea for a character, sneeze induced gender-bending is so bizarre that it\u2019s hard to really criticize it, and actually, Ren and Run\u2019s personalities are fairly unique as well. Ren tries to win Lala\u2019s affection by performing various masculine feats in the hopes of outdoing Rito, and Run, after (unsurprisingly) falling for Rito herself, ends up becoming an idol to try and impress him. Run and Ren are among the more infrequently appearing characters in the show, but when they do appear it is always a pleasure to see them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYui Kotegawa: Yui Kotegawa is a tsundere. By reading that one sentence, anyone could come to understand the entirety of her character, because that\u2019s really all there is to it. There are no other nuances, no creative new takes, nothing\u2014she is nothing more a tsundere at its purest and most creatively bankrupt. Well, perhaps I should give her at least a little bit more credit: there is, at the very least, a backstory. She is the president of the school\u2019s morals committee and finds Rito\u2019s accidental perversions repugnant, yet simultaneously she realizes that she is attracted to him for some poorly explained reason. Whatever her feeble reasons may be, though, the fact remains that Yui Kotegawa is a walking clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMikan Yuuki: Mikan is Rito\u2019s responsible little sister who essentially acts as his mother while their actual parents are conspicuously absent for nearly the entirety of the show. She appears frequently early on, but her influence wanes as the show progresses, to the point that she gets relatively little character development. This is really too bad, because, while not stunningly original, she has a sort of snarky air in the first few episodes which was one of the few things in this show that I found amusing. Plus, I find that it is always interesting to see the reaction of those close to harem leads as things get crazier. Alas, like so many elements of this show, any interest Mikan might have held was crushed by awful execution.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKenichi Saruyama: Saruyama is the perverted best friend at its most tired and bland. He is so bland, in fact, that he holds the impressively unimpressive distinction of being my least favorite character in this show. His personality is so utterly formulaic that it could have been replaced with countless other similar characters from other shows and I suspect no one would even notice. To make matters worse, rather than appearing infrequently for (unfunny) comic relief like most characters of his ilk do, he often appears prominently, even taking the spotlight in a few places. Not only is he the main character of the bizarre and out of place feudal Japan episode I mentioned above, but he also is the focus of perhaps the worst episode of the entire show (although there are many candidates for this), in which an ugly alien creature gives birth in the school clinic and Saruyama is forced to help with the birth and later become a father figure for the child. God knows what extraordinary lapse of judgment must have occurred for the writers to think that making an episode about a side character helping an alien give birth was what this show needed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPrincipal: Why does this character exist? The principal is the disgusting old man who runs Rito\u2019s school and appears regularly as so-called \u201ccomic relief\u201d to make public displays of his lust for high school girls. Because that\u2019s funny. The only saving grace for this abomination of a character is that even the writers seemed to agree that he\u2019s awful, and he doesn\u2019t appear very often. Additionally, unlike Saruyama, when he does appear, we don\u2019t have to suffer through entire episodes with him as the main character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSaki Tenjouin: Tenjouin is the token pretentious, arrogant \u201cOjou\u201d character. When she appears, she is always accompanied by two of her lackeys and tends to spend most of her time flaunting her class and purportedly extreme attractiveness. Her main purpose, however, is to serve as something along the lines of Lala\u2019s rival in the early part of the show. I say \u201csomething along the lines of\u201d because Lala more or less ignores her presence, and she spends most of her time making a fool of herself in fanservice-y ways. She\u2019s irritating, but intentionally so, and honestly the episodes where she appears prominently tend to be some of the better ones in the show, so I harbor relatively little animosity towards her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nShizu Murasame: The award for the most pointless character in this show must surely go to this ghost girl, who appears in one episode about a haunted old school building and then just sort of continues showing up for some reason. She never really contributes anything to the show\u2014she doesn\u2019t appear to share any meaningful relationships with any other characters, never adds anything of value to the plot, has no comedic purpose, has no interesting dialog, never plays a part in any fanservice, she simply exists. It is as though the writers felt that some scenes seemed empty, so they created a new character, but couldn\u2019t be bothered to give her a reason to be there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRisa Momioka and Mio Sawada: These best friends and classmates of Rito exist more or less entirely to compare the boob sizes of girls in Rito's class\u2026 and then grope them just to be sure. Now, while I feel a deep admiration for anyone who has found a purpose in life as enviable as this, I do slightly question if this show needs not one, but two characters dedicated to showcasing it. At any rate, necessary or otherwise, these two are a staple of the show, appearing frequently to spice things up with a little sexual harassment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, most of the side characters can be defined by a few characteristics, the major characters are shallow and dull, and those characters that are interesting either appear infrequently or are poorly executed. The exact significance of having such weak characters may vary from person to person, but for me, it is the final damning blow in cementing To LOVE-Ru as a truly hopeless affair. I have not dedicated 2,000 words to lambasting these characters purely because it is fun (although to be fair, it is quite fun), but rather because I find that good characters are integral to creating a good show. Not only are they the foundation on which every other part of the work stands, they are the aspect of the work which most directly connects it to the reader. If I can empathize with a character, it makes the entire story all the more meaningful to me. And if, as with this show, I cannot connect with any characters, then it makes the experience merely a distant and pointless waste of my time.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part then, the character designs are really the only good things the characters have to offer, and without any fanservice of particular merit, these designs are rarely put to good use. It is, I suppose, worth mentioning that the quality of the character designs also extends to the rest of the show\u2019s appearance\u2014the art style is certainly one of the very few strong points To LOVE-Ru has to offer. Although this is purely speculation, I suspect that the reason the character designs and art style stand out so much from the rest of the show is that they come directly from the manga, of which this anime is likely a botched adaption. Perhaps the blame for this animated abomination does not lie with Kentaro Yabuki\u2014the To LOVE-Ru manga\u2019s artist\u2014but rather with the fine folks at Xebec animation studios who thought it would be a fantastic idea to take a successful manga, use its characters and scenarios, and then make an entire season of brainless filler content instead of actually following it. Granted, I\u2019m sure the manga is not high art either, but I am certain that it, at the very least, has the decency to compensate for its lack of depth with some honest-to-god fanservice.",

Going in to this, once again, I only went by categories and picture, no synops.  I will forever do this for now on.\r\nThis anime has a lot of filling episodes and the story line is mainly at the beginning episodes and the ending episodes.  Though they do this, it is still interesting to me in the certain situations that Riko the main character may get himself into.  The fillingepisodes help organize and explain some of the content and help us better understand the characters a bit more even though they may seem boring.  Which is why people who really like romance animes should look into watching this one.  Since I am interested in romance I liked it and didn't mind the filler episodes since they helped develop the anime.  But one thing I do wish they did a little bit of work on was with Riko's family situation since we barley got much information about it but overall I think the content is good.\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit scared in the beginning since it started looking like a bad acid trip anime but it settled down and so don't base anything on the beginning of animes.  People who like Action type animes should stray away from this unless you like romance since this is mainly a romance anime.  \\n\\n\r\nNow that I have watched this one it is to Mott to love ru so hopefully that one will be as entertaining as this one.

Is it just me or do these kids move really fast these days, I mean one minute shes naked in his tub and next thing we know she wants to get married... Regardless, this could've been about half thelength but I don't really care one way or the other. I think that it would've been better if they hadn't tried to reuse the same stuff over and over(and over) but most viewers don't pay attention to this with the boobs flashing across the screen at such short intervals. Basically this is one of those shows that is built on a solid foundation of fanservice with just enough story and humor to keep the viewer interested.\\n\\n\nArt: basically all that the animators had to be able to do here was be good at drawing circles (because of all of the boobs) and seeing as how I can do that much they should be able to, and did. Next up would be the character design which is pretty good, they make the show into a dudes paradise since there are no, absolutely no unattractive girls within a 10 mile radius of this show so I don't know why every guy in this is so pissed at Rito for having a few on his arm.

            "content": "Well I am writing this review particulally to those who never watch the anime at all or just read the manga. First I need to ask several questions:\r\n1. Do you hate harem animes?\r\n2. Do you hate watching a lot of ecchi scenes in almost every episode?\r\n3. Do you hate watching plenty of fillers?\r\nIf any of these is yes, then I recommend that you don't watch it at all because you would be wasting your time, which I think you can spend time watching other animes.\r\nNow let me put down to reason why I might give quite a high score on these one which I rarelygive to most animes I've watched(and in my favourite list btw)\\n\\n\r\nMost are concern of the story so I will start at that. Firstly was that the story was involving Lala, a princess alien who try to run away and escaped to Earth and met Rito by accident(which saw her naked btw). This was then accidently meant that Rito will be Lala's fiance and so the story goes on. I just give a bit of the story if and I apologise if you don't like that. The few several episode are related to the story and few in the middle and the last 3 episodes(if I remember correctly). The rest are practically fillers but if you don't mind, you might enjoy watching them. In the starting, you might find it irritating of Lala's character or the fact that they introduce a new girl in quite a lot of episodes that adds a lot to the harem group who like Rito. The story progress beautifully and the ending might be a disappointment for the ending for some of you guys \\n\\n\r\nYes, you got it. It will be one of the largest harem group you will ever see. But its only the first season so it won't be that much compared to the latest season where you will see there's around 15-20 girls(I lose count track of how many girls are there) that like Rito. So that make put you off for the anime but that's the fun of it. That's whats makes me entertained to watch it even though there was indeed a number of ecchi scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd talking about ecchi, this anime is not hentai, its ecchi. I know of that cause someone I know saw hentai b4 and it was a total different thing. And I mostly skip some of the ecchi scenes cause I am not that into such things(though some do caught me by surprise unexpectedly, mostly involving Rito)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite good and they show their feelings for Rito for the viewers quite direct and explicit. These really was something you might admire for the fact that there are really a lot of girls in the harem group. And amazingly everyone who enjoy this anime will have a favourite girl whom they thinks are better for Rito than Lala. So mine is Yami and Run. What's yours? That's up for you to decide\\n\\n\r\nNext the music in the anime which I think was the lack of the anime. The opening in my opinion sucks a lot and the first ED was too. I only listen to the 2nd ending quite frequently.\\n\\n\r\nThus in overall I think this anime was extremely good with the romance all over the place and I really enjoy watching for most part of the anime, the big harem group and the story line the creators did. I would recommend for those who enjoy a good harem and the romance stuff but you might find the frequent ecchi scenes quite irritating so I advised you skip them(which I did).\\n\r\nHowever, for those who read this and hated the anime, you've wasted your time reading this and watching the anime, I strongly suggest you watch better animes out there. AND PLZ don't treat this like a like or dislike button\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if you do enjoy it well, you will tempt to rewatch it again or proceed to season 2(Motto To Love Ru).",

            "content": "Note: This includes a review for the whole series (all 3 seasons and OVAs)\r\nIf you love infinite panty shots, uncensored breasts and hundreds of tentacle scenes (with a splash of spectacular raunchy comedy), then To Love-Ru is the perfect ecchi show for you. To Love-Ru and High School DxD are probably the two best ecchi anime that I've seen and if you're a fan of the genre at all, this is a must watch. To Love-Ru is an ecchi comedy SOL harem that involves aliens and creatures of all sorts who lead our fateful protagonist, Yuuki Rito, into countless jaw-dropping and cringe-worthy situations over andover again. I never got tired of Rito falling headfirst into the breasts of an unsuspecting female student. And thanks to Lala's countless inventions (and the help of many alien friends/foes), the scenarios keep coming and always seem fresh. The greatest strength, by far, of the series is the cast of female characters. This is one BIG harem. There are easily 10+ women at the end (each with varying affection levels for Rito) and I can honestly say that I love them all. Each girl has a very distinct personality and ability along with different motivations and background. And they interact marvelously with each other as they try to chase Rito or fend off his unwitting sexual harassment. My personal favorites are definitely Yui, Yami, Momo, Lala, Mikan and Oshizu.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality definitely differs from each season by getting better and better. The first season is by far the weakest and has the least to do with the manga. It's still funny and a good introduction for most of the characters but don't drop the series just because you think the first season wasn't that great as there is plenty of quality to come. The first set of 6 OVAs after the first season revert back to the manga material and this is where the comedy starts to get good and we finally get introduced to the full set of characters (for the most part). The second season (Motto To Love-Ru) swings into full force and adopts a different format from the first where each episode is broken into 3 separate independent sections that are different stories entirely. I thought that this format really allowed the comedy to come alive and keep things fresher and interesting. Also, the ecchi really starts getting pumped up in this season. The third season (To Love-Ru Darkness) is absolutely fantastic and the best of the bunch. While Motto didn't really have an overarching story, Darkness does a great job incorporating that into the fray especially by delving into and really focusing on the characters of Yami and Momo (who are two of my three favorite characters). Also, Yui Kotegawa starts to get more and more screen time (which I love). And my god... The ecchi reaches borderline-hentai levels here and it is glorious. And the last set of Darkness OVAs just keeps on bringing the same goodness.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are an ecchi fan, you better watch To Love-Ru and don't drop it just because you think that the first season was a bit weak. Power on through. It only gets better. As the Darkness OVAs have just concluded, I hope that they announce a new season in the near future because I need my fill of the best harem in the universe getting caught up in tentacles.\\n\\n\r\nTo Love-Ru Trouble: 6/10\\n\r\nTo Love-Ru OVA: 6.5/10\\n\r\nMotto To Love-Ru: 7/10\\n\r\nTo Love-Ru Darkness: 7.5/10\\n\r\nTo Love-Ru Darkness OVAs: 7/10",

            "content": "Hmm I do admit that I enjoyed watching this series, but only really for Lala. Everything else was pretty bad.\r\nStory: \r\nLol. Pretty nonexistent. Each episode is its own mini-adventure, but the mini-adventures have literally nothing to do with each other. You could watch this entire show in a random order and it would basically be the same. There are only really 3 important episodes where outside characters are introduced (like the episode where Golden Darkness arrives), but other than that all the episodes are completely unrelated. Now, that's not to say that just because a show has mini-episodes, it's bad. Those who are fans ofSora no Otoshimono will know that you can still pull off a pretty good story with having mini-episodes. It's just with To-Love Ru, each mini-episodes contributes nothing to plot movement nor does it develop any stories or help us answer any conflicts. Each episode just does nothing to help us move forward. It's like reading the same page in a book instead of reading through the pages. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nNot bad, but you can tell it's an older animation style. It does look too cartoonish at times, but art usually doesn't really affect my opinion on shows unless it's just glaringly bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI actually really love the opening theme \"Forrever We Can Make It\" and normally I skip openings, but I actually listened to the opening for every episode in this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLala-chan is basically the only highlight of this show. Rito is actually a very likable character as well, but all his potential is not shown. We see the beginnings of a badass/kind male lead which is refreshing in a harem since it seems most harems nowadays just have male leads who need all the female characters to protect him. But his badassery and kindness are barely developed after they're shown. What I mean by that is he'll rescue one of the girls or do something nice for them, and then that's it. He just goes back to his school boy self and doesn't try to consider his actions or think about his relationship with the girl he just helped, which is what a normal person would do. \\n\r\nBut Lala is a really interesting character. She's quirky, cheerful, part stupid, part genius. She's pretty different from a lot of female characters you see because of this weird combination of personalities. At times she'll be serious and profound, and other times she'll be dense and have no idea what's happening around her, so she's extremely entertaining to watch. But once again, there wasn't as much character development with her as there could have been. They could have revealed a lot more about her feelings for Rito, but instead decided to make a lot of filler episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSomehow I managed to finish all 26 episodes in about 4 days which is pretty fast for me since I like to take my time watching anime. And for some reason, I didn't particularly hate the anime even though I'm giving it such a low score. I think it was just interesting to watch Lala as a character, but nothing else was really interesting. Yeah, it's a comedy, but to be honest I laughed maybe twice during this entire show, and at times I was pretty bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a relaxed anime, To-Love Ru is definitely it since it doesn't have any intense or emotional scenes. But if you're looking for comedy (which is what I originally watched it for), then you're probably in the wrong place since this anime hardly has any original comedy that you haven't already seen in other shows.",

            "content": "I normally don't write many negative reviews... And this one isn't very negative either. I enjoyed this series enough to be able to watch it all the way to the end, due to hearing about how To Love-Ru ends up getting really good. Well... Maybe To Love-Ru Darkness will be 'really good', but I'll have to see for myself. Anyway... here's my review.\r\nStory: The plot... well, I can't say it was very thick or anything. It definitely wasn't without any story elements. It utilized its wide character variety to have multiple episodes where lots of ridiculous, funny and over the top things happen. There's underlyingstoryline presence that takes place occasionally and comes to a head at the end though, but otherwise, it almost feels like most of the episodes are filler? I didn't think this was a bad thing though, cause I had a good time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It wasn't anything special. To be fair it's not exactly that new anymore. The way the characters were drawn and animated though, they had a lot of cute and funny moments about them just in the drawings alone. Oh, and there are PLENTY of unnecessary ecchi/nudity scenes... Which in of itself was also kind of funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, just fine. Though I have to say, I find LaLa's voice to be adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All of the characters were very interesting, and there was a very wide variety of them. LaLa especially keeps things interesting and funny with her reckless behavior and lack of human understanding and customs. My personal favourite character was the rich princess, who like many of the series other characters, followed a cliche. That being said, I think there could have been more character development for many of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't regret watching it. I hope To Love-Ru Darkness is better. Still, I think if you're looking for a comedy/romance harem anime, with lots of fan service and laughter, To Love-Ru is your next series to watch! I scored most of the stats at a 6 and 7, but I laughed so damn much I had to give it an overall of 8.\\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Don't skip the To Love-Ru OVA. Some episodes in it aren't that important, but some definitely are.",

            "content": "So To love ru is about a hot alien girl braking into a dude\u2019s house via the bathtub. Accidental groping, panty shots and tentacle rape ensues. \r\nSTORY\r\nHa! What story? The story can be summed up in 2 sentences, and is only important for about 5 episodes. A large majority of the series is episodic filler, and when i say a majority, i mean a majority. So how can I talk about the story of an anime if there isn\u2019t even a story? Easy. I don\u2019t.\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nHa! What characters? There aren't a whole lot of characters, and absolutely none of them are developed or super well-written. Theonly one who has any semblance of a conflict is the main character. He has Lala, a beautiful girl willing to marry and have sex with him at any time, but he really has feeling for his classmate, Ms. I-forgot-her-name. The only character or story arc is the main character deciding what to do with these girls and try to make himself look good in front of Whatshername. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nArt? The animation and sound are both passable, and the only sand-out thing about the art is the opening, and... ahem... the...\\n\\n\r\nFANSERVICE!\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I haven't done a whole lot of talking about this show, because Ive been looking at it critically. Thats is clearly not the way to look at this show, because once you do, you'll notice that there is absolutely nothing this show can offer in terms of development, intrigue, or emotion. There are really only 2 things one can talk about with this show: Fan-service and comedy. Why? Because those 2 things are the only 2 things this show ever does. Although I\u2019m more of an ass man myself, id be lying if I said i didn\u2019t love the fan-service in this show, especially in the last episode\ud83d\udc4c. BUTT I must say this: this show is credited as being one of the sexiest, fan-serivce-y anime out there. I\u2019m here to tell you the truth in that its not the sexiest, fan-service-y anime out there. If you\u2019re here to exclusively watch tits and hot girls, then watch actual porn. You\u2019re not going to find much fapable content in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY\\n\r\nThis is the other aspect of To Love-ru that really matters. If there is no story, nor character development, nor that much fan-service, then what is there? The silly antics of course! The ridiculous, zany situations are what this show is really about. Every episode has another weird and unbelievers story to it, and i must say that the humor is the best thing about the show! The jokes and situations pleasantly reminded me of western cartoons like phineas and ferb or fairly odd parents. If you, like me, enjoy that ridiculous, all-or-nothing style of humor, then you will enjoy most of this anime. With that said, there is a good mix of horrible episodes and great episodes. Some of these episodes are really fun and ridiculous while others are downright cancer.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nSomething doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare in order for it to be entertaining. Yes, there is no semblance of plot, character, or intelligence, but such things are expected when you have a dumb ecchi written like a dumb cartoon. I really did enjoy the humor is this show, and seeing as though thats pretty much all this show is, i can safely say that I liked this anime. If you want something smart, or well-made, then look somewhere else. If you\u2019re looking for hot girls exploiting their giant breasts, then look somewhere else. If you\u2019re still riding off the high of seasons 1-3 of spongebob and want something similar to that, youve found the right place!\\n\r\nGoodbye \\n\r\n(  .  )(  .  )\\n\r\n  )   .    (",

            "content": "Having a crush is hard. Trying to confess your feelings to said crush is\r\neven harder. Having an ailen crash into your house and wanting to get \r\nmarried? How did that happen??? This is the predicament Rito finds himself in as he tries to deal with bizarre, perverted accidents added to his already-complicated adolescent life.\r\nStory (6/10) - When I first discovered this series, I had to pause and collect myself from all the seemingly perverted and awkward situations, before being able to dive back in. I was only able to get to episode 11 before calling it quits. When I came back, out of the sakeof not leaving it unfinished, I found it more enjoyable than I remembered. Story-wise, there isn't much plot; mostly fan-service and comedic situations.   \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10) - I'm not gonna lie. I had to pause the first few seconds of the first episode, and just GAPPED at the art of this show. It looked like something from the 90s, despite this Anime airing in 2008. I then figured that this might be the style, and found out that the adaptation was nearly spot-on.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4/10) - The intro and outro of this show wasn't anything great, maybe a Little memorable, but the visuals with it were a bit much for a Romantic Comedy. Some of the gag sounds made during ecchi scenes seemed unnecessarily thrown-in that made me groan in despair rather than laugh at the main character's reaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) - Seeing Rito trying to manage his normal life, the new-alien arrival, and his feelings for the girl of his dreams is an enjoyable ride despite sometimes being derailed by outside forces.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) - When I came back around to finishing this series, I actually found that I liked it more than I thought I would. The ending was a slight surprise, yet also predictable at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) - A series about a boy struggling to confess to his longtime crush, and adding on an alien wanting to marry him, isn't a series everyone would like, or one everyone would hate either. Is it the worst? No, it did get my attention to find out what happens next, so we'll have to wait and see.",

It's hard not to binge watch this entire series, since it will hold you enchanted from start to finish.\r\nBy the end, I really cared about what happened to Golden Darkness, which impressed me.

Later on, he succeeds get the right words out of his mouth, but during that time Lala appears in front of him once more, and theavalanche of misunderstandings sets on it's way...\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are not related to each other in any way, except for the most basic set-ups. An episode is born by an alien arriving from space, mostly to ask the hand of the alien princess Lala, or just by crazy fantasies of the main characters, continuing with the never-stopping fanservice. The endings lack conclusion and often are cut halfway through, with the next episode resuming from as if nothing had ever happened previously.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice, and new cute girls keep appearing, some of them alien, possessing different attributes, like jealousy, clumsiness and embarrassment - just enough to make the scenes perverted in each and every situation, just as though Lala's lack of common sense wasn't enough.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some humorous episodes I really enjoyed watching, but there were some totally lame ones too, those that exceeded the limit of randomness and craziness.

            "content": "I started To-LOVE-Ru without particularly high expectations, after some of the reviews I'd looked at prior to watching. Fortunately, I am able to create my own opinion of it after finishing - and all I can really say is, if you're looking for a deep, thoughtful anime, this probably isn't for you.\r\nFirstly I'd like to say that I haven't read the manga, so this review isn't going to compare the two, it will simply be my opinion of the anime as a stand-alone.\r\nStory - 4 - Most people seem to have a problem with To-LOVE-Ru's excessive use of fanservice. I will admit that, at times,it got a little repetitive and boring to watch - there was no real story to most of the episodes (the majority of them were filler), however it didn't detract from the enjoyment of watching because most of it was pretty amusing. Some of the episodes are so silly you can't help but laugh at them, and the over-used panty-shots and accidental boob-grabs etc are really just a tool which makes it even more silly. So I gave the story a 4, as it wasn't really present, but what was there was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 - I quite liked the art for this series, it is well drawn and animated and there is good use of chibi/exaggerated expressions. The characters are all relatively easy to differentiate between (unlike some animes I've watched, where everyone looks just about the same), which is always a plus especially if you watch the series staggered, as I did.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 - I enjoyed the OP for this series and the original ED, the latter being very catchy and easy to get stuck in your head. Those who enjoy ecchi scenes will very much enjoy the OP, I'm sure. Not much more to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5 - Two words - Yuuki Rito. Probably one of THE most annoying males in anime I've seen. He's loud, gets overly embarrassed over very little and seems to have no idea about anything even if it's obvious (Don't want to include any spoilers here for those of you who haven't watched this series yet). The rest of the characters seem very linear and generic, with a couple of exceptions. You may be wondering, after that, why I gave character a 5, and not less - the answer lies in Lala, Haruna, and most of all Zastin. Lala is sweet, but rather ditzy, which makes her extremely endearing. Zastin is just a badass, and Haruna has that kind of sweetness about her, you just can't dislike her. I think those three characters really saved the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7 - I enjoyed most of the episodes of this anime, there was very few times when I wanted to drop it, however the cases when I did feel like not watching it any more was when I'd just had enough of all the darn fanservice. But I got a fair few laughs/giggles from it, even if some of them were out of disbelief!\\n\\n\r\nSo overall To-LOVE-Ru gets a 7 - just a lighthearted ecchi-fest for those who can cope with it. Just don't expect too much of it and you will most likely enjoy it.",

A cute space girl that randomly lands on earth and almost kills the main character, mainly from his bad luck. From the entire story standpoint, there's a LOT of filler here, but somehow it all works out in the end.\r\nThe OP is seriously addicting, and may be one of my favorites I've heard in an anime. And the art is great too. Not over the top, but just right.\r\nCharactersare the best part of this. While you do have your standard harem style character layout, most of the characters have a great personality and I enjoyed seeing them all. My favorite character is obviously Lala. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a good one to watch. Like I said though, there is a lot of filler here, and the story is very broken up, but some how complies toward the end of this anime to a nice conclusion. I'm probably going to re-watch this one, as it had a great funny vibe to it. I definitely recommend this one if you're into anime like Highschool DXD or Rosario + Vampire.\\n",

That's it?\"\r\nStory: 6\r\nOkay, as i said before, the story is very random, means that it suddenly having this and that without proper reason, Although they introduce thecharacters throughout the episodes, but it still lack a sense of common, like suddenly \"Wow, why is this happening?\" And you might lose interest in the following story, which is why i recommend you to read the manga and watch the anime at the same time, it'll help you to keep staying on the track :D\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI must say that this is one of those that has a better artwork among ecchi series anime, the characters are great, so if you're worrying about the artwork, this anime will not have any problem of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAgain, the sound quality of this one is pretty outstanding, surely because the music fits the situation, and it's really hard to point out any mistake. So i give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe reason i gave the characters a 7, it's because each of them wasn't deeply developed. Except for Lala and Sairenji, the others were not appearing oftenly, which is why i don't much like it in harem series. If they were to make a harem, they should at least make a few more episodes to make us more understand the characters, than rather focusing on the main one, that would be unfair to the others ( especially Yami-chan, haha xD )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nFor me, it wasn't that great, mainly because of too much unnecessary fanservice. First of all, I don't hate fanservice, because me myself is also a fan of ecchi series, BUT, when the fanservice are more than the plot itself, it became a big problem, the plot itself are random, and that was already a problem, and the fanservice are too excessive, making the anime seems like nothing but just a bunch of fanservice, but it will be enjoyable if you like the comedy in it\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nTo Love-Ru can do alot more better than this one, the manga is great, but the anime wasn't that good because sometimes it doesn't make sense, which make this anime confusing a little while, but the fanservice and the comedies are covering up those holes, making this series can still stand alone itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this one, you should expect enjoyable yet random moments.",

            "content": "I'm here to tell you this series is first and foremost a comedy. Sure, there is a lot of fanservice, but I was hardly paying attention to that because the humor is so good. To LOVE-Ru doesn't have some profound story that is going to change the way you think, but it's not supposed to: it's a comedy. The aim of every episode is to get you to laugh. Now, don't take that the wrong way. The writers weren't just throwing in a bunch of cheap jokes. And while I will say the writing isn't that clever, I'd say it is clever enough. Some partsof this series are an absolute laugh riot, in the good way.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you have a good sense of humor and you aren't bothered by the curves of the female body, I'd say you will probably enjoy this series. I know I did, hence the score.",

            "content": "When I saw reviews for this before watching the anime, people kept complaining how unlike the manga it was and I mean everyone. For someone who hasn't read the manga, I don't see the issue. I mean if you don't read the manga and decide to watch this, you don't know whats wrong. But thats not to say the manga is nothing, To anime; manga is basically the whole script already made. Some will just go off what they created in the manga without really moving away from that plot too much, while others will try to change the script and show off their creativeabilities or try to do something in a different way that ends in the same result in the end. For most, this doesn't work so well and they end up having to re-edit the manga (the script) to better fit the anime, others however get it right like this one where people still like it and you end up with sequels. \\n\r\nNow while this is just a episode by episode plot, it's very light-hearted and fun to watch, I tend to think that a lot of anime with a giant plot in a season get too dramatic for my taste. Overall, this makes for a fun watch as well as a nice way to get away from a annoying day of whatever.",

To love-ru's story and characters don't go anywhere and if you want to watch an anime with a good story with just as much fan service then watch high school dxd. the only reason why you would want to watch this show is to jack of to it. And this show is basically unfulfilling porn. \r\ncharacters- ok so you got your princes and your main character who become married and what ever and you thing they would interact with each other as theseries goes by but NOOO their relationship becomes farther apart because so many new unnecessary characters are being added. \\n\\n\r\nAlso there is no character development and the most if any character development is going to be if they held hands and or kissed, and I get the point you may be wondering which is \"why should there be character development in what is considered hentie\" well that is true but without character development then the whole entire show get boring which it does. And also there is 3 seasons of this shit.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong the entertainment in this series is good i mean you can get a couple of laughs but it kind of gets old after 3 seasons. so in the end i think this is a good harem anime but nothing else.",

            "content": "This is a couple years after my viewing, but I thought I should say something anyways. The reason it's even coming up is because the show was mentioned somewhere and got me thinking about how I don't even remember finishing it, and I was wondering if I had dropped it. Coming here, I see that I actually did, in fact, drop it, and all of its sequels, about half way through.\r\nWhy did I drop it? Because it is boring. Unbearably boring.\r\nI guess I should have seen it coming, since it's an ecchi. So there's going to be big anime tiddies and gratuitous fanservice. But thething is, Kill la Kill is also an ecchi, and KlK is fucking awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does KlK do right that this show does so horribly, horribly wrong? I'm not completely sure, probably because it's been so long since I last attempted to watch it, but there are things in this show that irked me from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, nothing ever happens. From the first episode, we're introduced to this impossibly clumsy protagonist, who always manages to fall onto random women, with his face ending up in either their crotches or their big anime tiddies. Then the girl screams and Johnny Bravo's him, and he feels embarrassed until the alien girl (can't even bother to remember her name. Lala?) bursts into the room with some insane shenanigans that either blows up the area or results in an alien coming to challenge the guy for her hand in marriage, despite the fact that she is completely head over heels for the protagonist and will obviously not go for the challenger no matter how badly they kick the protagonist's ass, either because she's a rebel or because she's eccentric, I don't remember. This happens EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE. It's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like this show has an element of tongue-in-cheek to it, like it's not taking itself seriously, but at the same time, I feel like they got the execution completely wrong, so it ends up being boring instead of funny. I only managed to put up with 15 episodes before I dropped it.\\n\\n\r\noh...that was like two things...\\n\\n\r\nI also put some comments on my list entry. I usually do this for the REALLY good/bad shows as a \"note to self\" in case I forgot why my opinion was so extreme. If that makes any sense. I feel like my fresh commentary from the time will help. Maybe. Here's what I wrote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"It took me 7 months to watch 15 episodes. This show is so boring that I just can't do it. Every episode is the same. Here's the formula: protagonist slips on a banana peel and falls into one of his classmates' vaginae. An alien comes from another planet to either kill/marry/rape/strip the protagonist/lala, the alien princess who fell in love with him out of boredom because she fell naked into his bathtub from space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounded like the plot to a porno, that's because it is. They just pussed out of going all the way and as a result this is horrible both as a show, and as a hentai.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFail.\"\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there's also a girl the protagonist has a crush on. I don't remember her name. she's the purple haired girl in the top left of the cover art.\\n\\n\r\nBut nobody gives a fu",

            "content": "When I was watching To love Ru, I struggle to finish the season as I tend to leave ecchi animes on and off. This was no different but finishing it took maybe a good 6 months...\r\nTo Love Ru is by far one of the more quality finishes of ecchi anime with borderline hentai like bondage, tentacle, and of course your full nudes. But you can't absolutely force a ecchi anime to be love by all.\r\nWith a somewhat random plot line it was overall kill to watch all 26 episode when the last 3 episode was what brought the whole anime to full circle but ToLove Ru stride on the its fan service to keep the audience watching. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion I would recommend watching To Love Ru for those who loves ecchi and some mild comedy but skip it if you are looking for some hard story line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating:\\n\r\n6.4/10",
