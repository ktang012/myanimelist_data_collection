            "content": "_-*-SPOILER FREE REVIEW-*-_\r\nNoragami Aragoto is probably the best 2nd season anime this year. There is a big deal of change since the first season, for good. To be honest, the first season's second half was slightly off the entertainment level. I wasn't able to dive into the seriousness of the final arcs in the first season. But I am surprised how second season made a remarkable progress in making the plot more interesting.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWe all have seen Noragami first season and were left with many doubts, mostly related to Yato and Bishamon. In the first half. the second season tackles the back story of Yatoand Bishamon and reveals the secrets of Yato, Bishamon, \u200eKazuma, Other Gods etc little by little. The second half deals with the mystery of masked phantoms and also focuses of the relations between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori. Still there are plenty of things which are left untold which we can expect them to be shown in the 3rd season, when it comes out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNoragami and Noragami Aragoto has been animated by the studio 'Bones' which is very well known for it's remarkable art in the anime 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'Soul Eater', 'Space\u2606Dandy', 'Tokyo Magnitude 8.0' etc. As expected of Bones, it's art in Noragami is also smooth, colorful and remarkable. The character designs are another plus point of Noragami series. The characters are drawn so well, I can't even imagine anyone else replacing them in any way. Their designs are the perfect match for their personality which makes them so much likable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNoragami's opening song 'Hey Kids' by 'THE ORAL CIGARETTES' is a BLAST! There's no way anyone can deny me with this point. While everyone may not agree with me, the ending song 'Nirvana' by 'Tia' is another great song and the visuals and the lyrics adds more to it. While Noragami 1st season's soundtracks were already good, there has been a great improvement in the soundtracks in the 2nd season. The number of soundtracks under different situations have been changed, increased in number, and has become more suited to it than before. The soundtracks played during battles, sad scenes, happy scenes etc. makes them even more interesting and fun to watch. Coming to the voice actors, many famous and insanely talented actors like Kamiya Hiroshi, Kugimiya Rie, Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Hayami Saori, Toyosaki Aki etc. gave an amazing performance which makes Noragami deserve  a 10/10 in terms of Sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe male protagonist of the show, Yato, is my most favorite of all the characters. Not just from Noragami, but Yato has become one of my favorite character of all the anime and that's because of his cool attitude, wicked sense of humor and his seriousness when it is needed. Other characters like Bishamon, Kazuma, Yukine are also pretty likeable for their own unique personality. While most of you will disagree with me, I feel that Iki Hiyori is also an important character which adds some spice to the story. Due to her caring and loving nature, she is also pretty likable. And the fact that there is almost zero percent chance of her of being in relationship with a god, Yato, makes us want to know more about their relation progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFor me, the first season of Noragami was like 10/10 in terms of enjoyment but the second half was like 7/10. With more interesting plot, Noragami Aragoto has exploited the curiosity of the viewers and made this season worth a watch. Definitely 10/10 in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10\\n\r\nIf you really liked Noragami first season, then Noragami Aragoto is undoubtedly a must watch for you! If you are like me who liked half of the season and the other half of the season was meh, then you must give the second season a shot and you will undoubtedly be satisfied with it. And if you didn't like Noragami first season at all, then there's not much helping it, better skip this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope my review helped. Comments appreciated. :)",

            "content": "I really won't be surprised if I get a mob of weeaboos wearing Yato masks at my door ready to baptize me in the sacred Yato holywater for rating it a 5 but please keep in mind that I actually use the rating system in it's entirety and believe it or not, I don't hate Noragami! This will contain minor spoilers.\r\nOverall I think Noragami is a very overrated series. I really didn't enjoy the first season and didn't realize what all the hype was about. It had a lot of problems - I felt the writing was poor, characters did stupid things that made nosense a lot of the time and the constant abuse of Yato is overused for comedic value but at a certain point it runs dry, and most of all - Yukine.\\n\r\nYukine is one of the most annoying and whiny characters I have ever witnessed. If nothing else, I applaud this season for reducing this fact to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Noragami Aragoto has the same initial premise as the first season but this time is divided into 2 major arcs. The first arc focuses on the character of Bishamon, the strongest god of war who also has a deep hatred for Yato as he slaughtered her entire clan once before. By doing this though he saved her life, as requested by Kazuma, the only survivor of the clan. Everything begins when one of Bishamon's regalia is suddenly killed. No one however knows who killed the regalia and panic ensues. Also coincidentally before his death he befriends Yukine and when Yukine hears the news he turns into Emo Kid once more and goes to seek vengeance for his friend. \\n\r\nThe last season also gave a lot of hints that Kazuma knew Yato and their past is now unraveled. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc starts off by Yato receiving a shrine from Hiyori. In the Noragami universe gods who have shrines get special perks sorta say. Yato moves into the Heavenly Neighborhood or whatever other lame name you can think off and is now a proper god, being friends with everyone! After 1 episode of sunshine and rainbows Yato gets captured by Nora and a person she calls \"father\", who knew Yato for a long time as well as seen in the flashbacks of them holding hands.  So this is where the series went downhill for me. This arc just felt so unnecessarily rushed (I've heard so from people who read the manga as well so it isn't just me). So much content is just bundled together in this single arc and sadly, 7 episodes isn't nearly enough time to cover it well.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Studio Bones, all I can say is how fluid and nice it is. To be honest, the fight scenes can be lackluster sometimes but I really enjoy the character designs. I may be giving it too much credit because I just find it better than most of the animation this season though. Shame pretty colors can't save a show :^)\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto like the first season has a variety of music throughout the series and I'd like to say how much I like it like most people do but I really don't think it's anything that special. Sure it's better than the norm nowadays but it's not setting out to break any records. That being said, the opening theme is one of my favorites from this season.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, for the most part I don't like the characters in this series. Let's briefly go over the main characters of the first season: Yato is a god that will obey your every request (( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) for 5 yen but there's a twist to it - He has a dark past. This was revealed a bit in the end of the last season and now plays a big role in the plot. Hiyori is annoying at times but is generally okay and then there is Emo Kid. So now in this season we get more development for Bishamon and suprisingly, Kazuma. Bishamon has too much trust in all of her regalias and you could say that is her downfall. She is shown to be very stubborn when dealing with Yato, seemingly ignoring the fact that he saved her life.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat I wanna say that I feel like they handled the development of Suzuha alright but it may of been better to give him more screen time first since he is the plot device in this situation. The main antagonist of this season is also one of Bishamon's regalia by the name of Kugaha. He really isn't interesting much like the villain of the first season but hey at least he has a goal. We are then introduced to Ebisu who is one of the seven gods of luck, the god of fishing. He could of been a cool character if the series didn't decide to rush it so badly. Needless to say, he doesn't get nearly as much character development as needed for us to actually care about him. We also don't know a single thing about Nora or father, yay.\\n\\n\r\nNorgami Aragoto is a pretty enjoyable series really. As I said in the beginning, they made Yukine a lot more likable which I'm very happy about. The enjoyment does go down after the 2nd arc tags along but it was never to the point where I was forcing myself to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt's somewhat of an improvement from the first season and is an enjoyable series with cool fights and quirky characters (that get on my nerves sometimes but that's besides the point). It still struggles with the issues it had in the past like the plot and the character development in a lot of instances. The 1st arc is the pinnacle of the season (and I'd argue the series but I'm just a dirty hater of the first season), however the 2nd is inferior by a longshot due to how rushed it is. So all in all, while I enjoyed it more than the first season and you'll probably do too, Noragami Aragoto really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally uploaded on October 30th, 2015.",

            "content": "When thinking of Noragami, I often imagine the series as some sort of fairy tale. Only of course, it\u2019s a fairy tale in the modern world about a delivery God named Yato. His question to own his personal shrine makes him an unusual character as well. From previously established concepts, Noragami Arargato returns in full force. And I have to say, any fans of the first season and manga will be delighted to see what the sequel has to offer.\r\nThe second season takes directly after the first season and we get a full on course of the story from the beginning. Unlike some supernatural orshoujo stories that concentrates on romance and relationships, Noragami Aragato crafts human emotions out of fantasy. The previous season already build a lot about personal conflicts such as Bishamonten\u2019s troubled past. And in this sequel, it greatly expands on that as she takes vengeance against Yato. It\u2019s simple to say really though. This season is more of an emotional roller coaster ride. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s clearly shown that there\u2019s darker background building through its various flashbacks. Demonstrated by the appeal of character trauma and PTSD-like scenarios, each episode builds up to a grand climax of this season. At the center of it, we have Yato who struggles with his own problems. Although luckily, he still has trustworthy friends like Hiyori and Yukine at his side.\\n\\n\r\nA good portion of the season takes a look at characters from a personal approach. A key character and enemy to Yato is Bishamonten. Her troubled past links with Yato as viewers see how regalias (weapons made from the deceased) were killed by him. So in return, she wishes to gain revenge. Sounds plausible right? There\u2019s actually a lot more story to that and thankfully, this season nails revelations through its precise buildups. From the present viewpoint, the storyline also follows Bishamonten\u2019s followers as they are now. Some of her prominent regalias such as Kazuma and Aiha get their own roles with discrete purpose. At the same time, it creates some tension among her own group as tense feelings are expressed. Similarly, Yukine experiences grief as he loses a friend and learns about the destiny of being a shiki. Furthermore, Yato and Hiyori builds more of their relationship with trust that becomes stronger each episode. This can also be applied to Yato and Yukine as the latter even puts his own life at risk in battle. It goes to show how far these three\u2019s friendship has led to their strong loyalty. Unfortunately, there\u2019s also betrayal as viewers will learn the real mastermind who engineers suffering and despair throughout season. That\u2019s just the first half though, there\u2019s even bigger things that awaits those who is patient and eager to see how far the story develops. These include the origins of masked phantoms, how Gods exists, and what awaits for Yato\u2019s future.\\n\\n\r\nAs Bishamonten is upgraded to a much more prominent role this season, it\u2019s also important to realize her character. I think it goes beyond her vengeance against Yato as she is also a character with a compassionate nature. She clearly cares about her regalia both past in the present. And furthermore, she often tries to give those who have no place to go a home that they can appreciate. So no wonder, when her regalias were annihilated in the past, Bishamonten would go into a vengeful frenzy. In addition, Bishamonten is a strong willed woman, the type that doesn\u2019t give up easily. Although her reasoning may have flaws, she is merciless towards her enemies and guards her own personal feelings closely. This sometimes leads to backfire as well when she lets those personal feelings get the best of her that leads to reckless decisions. In retrospect though, I think Bishamonten is definitely a character that is important to the core of this season; whether it\u2019s her personality, morals, or actions. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there\u2019s a darker nature of the second season, comedy still retains its comedic nature. So yes, there will be plenty of time to laugh such as with Yato\u2019s childish moments. Anyone familiar with the first season will get to see how Yato\u2019s lack of common sense places him in ridiculous positions. While it may be a bit of or hit or miss at times, Noragami always retains its ability to entertain the audience through clever dialogues. It also shows that Gods can be like humans with their behavior and even relatable through what they do. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly the previous season, studio Bones does a terrific job at working with its animation. The character designs looks clear with Yato as he maintains both a humorous and cool side. Bishamon also returns with her battle gear and tough attitude that is translated by her facial expressions. And that\u2019s a fun thing to look at. Noragami often has fun with itself and this season is no different. Almost every comedic moment is demonstrated with effective expression of character reactions. Whether it\u2019s Yato or some other character, it\u2019s very amusing and feels natural. Hiyori, Yukine, and some of the returning cast also looks good as well while the Phantoms are designed with credibility with their malevolence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, we can\u2019t forget about the soundtrack. On a personal level, the first season\u2019s OP song has a catchier song with more stylistic choreography. But after examining at the sequel, I can say with confidence that the new OP song works quite well too. It has a similar style with fast paced action sequences and montage of the main and supporting characters. While there\u2019s some foreshadowing too, the show does a great job with its themes. The OST is also quite noticeable between scenes of sadness, anger, and humor. It\u2019s surprising at how the show can maintain it throughout the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragato is definitely a sequel that can appeal to just about anyone. Whether you\u2019re looking for some drama, action, or comedy, it has a little bit to offer from all angles. Our main characters return and it\u2019s fun to see where they are now. Bishamonten\u2019s personal rivalry with Yato is a pivotal part of this season so a fan of her character will be in for a treat. And even if you\u2019re not a fan of hers, the season is still entertaining with its concrete storytelling. It\u2019s really a show that\u2019s hard to pass by so what are you waiting for?\\n",

            "content": "The first thing that could be said about the second season of Noragami is that it is arguably better in terms of story and characters than the first season, yet may lack in other departments. This mainly concerns aspects such as expanding on the world and its phantoms, that were enticing in the afore-mentioned one. It is in fact quite an improvement, and was naturally quite enjoyable; nonetheless, it has its flaws as well, which will be discussed below in addition to its strengths.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story follows once again the main protagonists Yato, Yukine and Hiyori and their interactions with the world; yet in this seasonit begins to focus on the goddess of war Bishamon. She is known to be kind, which causes her to take in a lot of shinki's when saving them from phantoms: this will naturally cause her quite some problems, as she isn't able to tend to them all. Pain, insecurity and paranoia are on the order of the day, and the fact that Bishamon hates Yato doesn't ease the situation at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't entirely focus on the goddess of war; it also expands on the world of the gods, in addition to their importance. In addition, it provides a bit of an insight in the underworld, while mutually introducing numerous gods and characters. It could be said that the story in mainly character driven, as it expands on Yato's past, as well as Bishamon's and surprisingly, Kazuma. Quite a lot of action was provided, which was well executed - although having its share of plot convenient twists - in addition to keeping good levels of intrigue throughout the series. However, quite some things were very predictable, as well as their respective outcome, which was a bit of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nIt also shared its slice of life moments in which it focused more on the female lead character, yet these were uninteresting as it didn't provide any story progression, neither character development. The pacing of the series was overall well done, although it had its share of some inconsistent jumps. However, what was personally a drawback, was the fact that it didn't expand on the different worlds of Noragami, meaning how these are related, as well as the phantoms and how these affect the various worlds.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Noragami is by no means big; in fact, there are a handful of characters, which are for the most part distinguishable from each other, especially the main cast. Audiences will be rewarded with some more insight in Yato's past, as well some character development, albeit not impressive. This is because the main mysteries surrounding him are still not explained, and in fact, even more were added. Other positive aspect was the explanation on why Bishamon hated Yato, although the reason behind this were quite lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Yukine, who in my opinion was the most intolerable character in the prequel, did undergo some character development. The fact that his constant wining and sudden outbursts were much less pronounced in this season was a welcoming change, yet it still happened, being in some cases overly dramatic. However, the main problem lay with Hiyori, who underwent zero character development, as well as fleshing out. She plays no important role whatsoever, other than just being a female lead who supports Yato. It is as if her problems with the phantom world lay forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story also began focusing on some gods, in particular that of Ebisu. Although it was interesting, not enough information was released to even begin to care for the character, hence making the events that follow a bit tensionless. Other gods were introduced as well, yet were never expanded on; some seemed to be interesting character-wise.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Noragami is of high quality, what is expected of a show airing in 2015. The battle scenes are well executed, being diverse and well conveyed to the viewer in addition to being consistent: blood, anger, fear and the likes are well relayed to the viewer. The backgrounds are well drawn and detailed, matching with the different scenes. Character design is appealing to the eye, as well as diverse, yet a bit generic in some instances. In some cases inconsistencies could be found when for example these were in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used is quite strange at first, as viewers from the prequel may have thought as well; nevertheless, it is befitting and catchy is some instances. Voice actors performed their roles well, in most cases matching with the personality of the various characters.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nNoragami was overall quite an enjoyable anime which certainly maintained me entertained throughout the whole series with the different aspects and mysteries presented. Expanding on the different character's past was a pleasant sight, although some were annoying, as well as underdeveloped, which was a drawback personally. The art style was nice to look at, as well as the catchy soundtrack. Although the different outcomes where somewhat predictable, in addition to some convenient plot twists which weren't convincing, I certainly could recommend Noragami for an entertaining time. Just don't expect impressive characters or stories.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "The refreshing new season of Noragami directly starts off where the prequel ended, continuing to follow the interactions and daily lives of the dynamic trio of Hiyori, Yukine, and Yato. As a new season unfolds, new characters, relationships, and secrets are introduced. Past questions and plot holes as seen in the previous season now have answers.\r\nYato\u2019s infamous line of, \u201cYou, who desecrate this Land of the Rising Sun. With the advent, I [Yatogami], lay waste with the [Sekki] and expel thy vast defilement. Rend!\u201d makes a comeback in this season still accompanied by the famous usual track of \u201cNoratan\u201d. However, this season\u2019s OST lineupis far more captivating, emotional, and energetic. The diverse OST has songs ranging from classical, dubstep, electro house, and even rap. The songs are beautifully integrated throughout the series\u2019 heightening moments of hype and grief. Altogether, the Noragami series is known for its OST and new catchy OP (Kyouran Hey Kids!! By THE ORAL C!GARETTES).\\n\\n\r\nThe new season begins to unravel with the introduction of the Bishamon arc. As seen in the prequel, Yato and Bishamon hold grudges dating back centuries, their resentment for one another remains unknown to the audience. However, this arc does a great job of slowly unraveling the history and past of the two Gods and their regalia. Flashbacks and dialogues are naturally integrated, making the story interesting yet easy to follow. Not only does this arc dissolve the bad blood between the God of War and God of Calamity, but it also strengthens the relationship between them. Through this arc, new understandings and relationships are formed between characters, furthering their trust, faith, and hope in one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of the season introduces a new character: Ebisu. Ebisu, the God of Fortune is comically portrayed as the generic everyday Japanese salaryman. His introduction is rather abrupt, with little to no background information known about him. At first, this made me wonder if it was worth the time getting to understand his character making it difficult to feel emotionally connected to him. However, as the story progresses, the series does a great job of revealing his troubling past and motives, but unlike the Bishamon arc, it felt rather rushed. As the arc and series were near its end, closure was done in an awkward manner making the latter half of the series lackluster in comparison to the first half. Despite this problem, the arc still managed to tackle important personal revelations made by Yato.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series caters to the battle shounen audience, it does a great job avoiding common tropes that are typically seen. Unlike popular shounen heroes, Yato is a complex character shrouded in mystery, where his past is slowly being uncovered by those closest to him. Once known as the God of Calamity, Yato\u2019s past plays an important role in his shortcomings, forcing him to fall into a state of vulnerability numerous times. Friendship remains an important recurring theme that allows Yatogami to hold onto his humanity and slowly transform into the individual he desires to become.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragato as a whole does a beautiful job of amplifying the character development and storytelling, furthering the emotional bonds and ties between Hiyori, Yukine, and Yato. The trio\u2019s chemistry and friendship can be described as a puzzle with its pieces fitting together perfectly. Each individual\u2019s weaknesses and strengths bounce and play off of each other creating balance. What one lacks, the others possess. Despite their growth, moments of vulnerability, insecurity, and instability also continue to plague Yato. These brief moments of doubt reveal how Gods, figures of authority, worshipped by followers and the common also manifest very humanlike qualities, making them realistic and relatable to the audience. They too give rise to temptation, lust, greed, and fear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is highly enjoyable and worth the watch, especially if you enjoyed the prequel.  However, the ending cruelly hints at more and without a third season announcement your only option is the manga.\\n",

            "content": "[MINOR SPOILER ALERT]\r\nNoragami is a very special anime to me, because i watched it back when i was just getting into anime, and i was very impressed with it. I gave the first season a 9/10, but the second one didn't really hold up to my expectations.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis season went in a totally different direction from the first one, adding new characters, developing backstories, plot points, plot twists and so on. It was interesting to find out the reason behind Bishamon's hatred for Yato, and all the events related to Ebisu, Nora and Yato were also intriguing. However, i felt like this season tried tobe more serious, and it didn't work that well for me, since i was expecting a light-hearted action-comedy. Another downfall is the fact that this season didn't expand the world of Noragami, it's like all the phantoms lurking around the city were just forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters sure went through a lot of changes, especially Bishamon, who learnt to let go of her past and her hatred for Yato, and in the end actually tried to save him. Yato, however, took a turn for the worse in my opinion. I enjoyed the goofy, bombastic and overall hillarious Yato of season 1 more than this serious guy with an \"i will protect my dear ones no matter what\" attitude. Hyori... i guess she didn't really change. Then we have some new characters that didn't really impress me. Kugaha didn't strike me as an antagonist and i didn't get attached to Ebisu, since he was only around for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nCan't say much about the art and animation, it was consistent, similar to the first season, with lots of vivid colors and details, Bones did a really good job once again.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI felt like this was actually an improvement from the first season, adding new tracks, but being keeping the techno style with the occasional pipe sounds. The voice acting was well done, nothing worth mentiong about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough i expected more action and more comedy, i can't say that season 2 was a boring experience. The ending left me a bit disappointed, as i was wishing for a big fight between Yato and Izanami or at least some fight at all, but they chose to wrap it up in and anti-climactic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you have seen the first season you'll probably watch the second season anyway, so i recommend it for all Noragami fans out there. Even though i didn't enjoy it as much as season 1, i am eagerly wating for season 3, witch will probably happen since we got a lot of foreshadowing in the final episode.",

            "content": "Noragami is a very enjoyable and fun anime in today's modern anime seasons filled with pretty bad generic ecchi and shounen boy content over and over. It has a very deep underling to the story itself and expands on it pretty well to a point. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning and fits the mood of the story very well both in up and down moments.\r\nUnfortunately the story actually does fall very short to what would be considered a very complete storyline. It feels very rushed and goes from a very good story arch that was continued from the previous season, with the God of War,to a tacked on story about randomly controlling phantoms. This pretty much happens in the span of a few episodes, and fills the role of the climax of the show. With little to no build up to this plot point. It felt almost rushed to guarantee they got this point of the plot in the season so they didn't have to hope they got a season 3 to continue it, all while dropping the \"to be continued\" ending. It tried to make me care for a character with little screen time prior to these episodes, and therefore i didn't really feel too much a connection with them. All while shotgunning their life in about one episode. While it was a good plot line and it was a good character, it was very rushed to a point it was annoying to watch. The other points in the plot dealing with the more main characters were very good, and the development of those characters over time were really interesting to watch. However, the main focus of the anime seemed to steer off the development of these characters and made it more of a side point.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and sound were absolutely amazing. The OST is probably one of the most enjoyable OSTs I've ever listened to. The sound as well in conjunction with the OST in important parts or low parts in the anime matched perfectly and heightened my enjoyment of the show. The colors bursting from the screen to help give the show more flair is a huge enjoyment boost, and made the viewing experience enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was extremely enjoyable, the characters were lovable and interesting, the comedy in the show didn't distract from the serious parts. Combined with the sounds and art, the show was absolutely great. However the main story seems to be thrown into a disarray about halfway through, and it feels rushed.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nI've seen my fair share of negative reviews for Noragami Aragoto, for various reasons, but I'm writing this review to make the case for why Noragami is so popular, and why so many people love it: it makes you feel something. Actually, a lot of things. I'm a huge believer in the idea that what makes any piece of art gain success is the creator's ability to evoke an emotional response from the audience. This doesn't always mean its a good thing: terrorist groups, as an extreme example, achieve this \"success\" by evoking fear and torment. In most cases, however, the intent is tomake the audience feel happiness, sadness, anger, and/or suspense (ha, better add agony to that list, actually). Sometimes this comes as a retrospective realization, which often leaves lasting effects, while other times it comes as the journey unfolds, like Noragami. The advantage of having this evocation of emotion occur as the story unfolds is that it keeps the audience constantly engaged, without having to rely on curiosity or sudden changes that inevitably result in pacing inconsistencies. The disadvantage is that, while the feelings may be intense \"in the moment,\" they may or may not be memorable, but I can't make the case for everyone--it all depends on how much a person personally enjoys the series, and how long they watch it for, whether that's week by week or binging, like me. In addition, this being the second season means that (if season 1 did it's job) we're already attached to these characters (to a degree), making it easier to empathize with them and much easier to care about what happens to them.\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT--SKIP CHARACTER CATEGORY IF YOU CARE\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I even feel the need to differentiate \"Character\" from \"Story\" after already complimenting the character development is because of one character, essential to the second arc of the season: Ebisu. While MAL may categorize him as a supporting character, I beg to differ--he obviously has an extreme impact on Yato after he dies, ultimately causing the complete shift of his perspective and his releasing of Nora. Because of how important he was, I feel like the audience should have been given a bigger insight into his importance and his past, rather than just passing him off as \"that god who reincarnates a lot.\" All that being stated, Ebisu was still focused on enough throughout the second half of the season to have an impact on me when he died, especially considering his newfound desire to survive and the illegitimacy of his execution.\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art of Noragami Aragoto is very stylized, and the colors are vibrant and often meaningfully chosen, either to highlight certain elements of a scene or to create subliminal connections between specific characters and their personalities. While the style is pretty common, this use of colors is something rather unique, considering the otherwise flat shading (as opposed to either continual dull or vibrant tints throughout).\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music of the show is great. It always fits the mood of a scene, and is the type of OST that one could listen to independently after the anime has concluded. The OP is upbeat and never fails to get me pumped for what's to come (on top of how catchy it is), while the ED, though by far not my favorite, was choreographed well and had meaninful, emotional lyrics.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNo need to extrapolate here. I really enjoyed the show. In addition, it wrapped up in a way that leads us straight into season 3--suffice to say, I'm excited to see where the story takes us next.\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI recommend this show for fans of shounen, or people who appreciate continually dramatic, unpredictable, and intense plot, and those who enjoyed season 1.",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto \u30ce\u30e9\u30ac\u30df Review\r\nStory (8/10) Very Good\r\nNoragami Aragoto takes too arcs from the manga and adapts them in 13 episodes and as an anime only watcher I feel it was done very well from a pacing stand point. Only one episode really felt episodic and out of place but it wasn't a bad episode to say the least. Although the first arc felt more compelling than the second they both connected well when it came to Bishamon's character development, characterization and her relationship towards the MC. It left the ending of this season with a teaser of what's to come which I felt wasa very good cliff hanger and I hope it get's a season 3 to continue it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nBones did a very good job animating this season nothing mind blowing but it was still an eye candy to some extent. I do felt last season was animated a bit better but I guess that's only because of the final battle in season 1 that made me feel that way. Either way the art style and animation in the season was very good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM, voice acting (in both JP and Dub although the JP was better the Dub wasn't bad the only voice who doesn't fit their character in the dub is the MC himself) and opening music are all great in this season. I started watching it in Sub but then moved over to Dub even though I'm not a fan of Yato's voice it didn't bother me enough to not watch it but it was enough to point out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this season are all very good, almost every character got very good character development and are more likable this time around vs back in season 1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was very good even though I started watching this anime when it first aired and I put it on hold and didn't finish it until now. I still enjoyed my time with this season and I feel I enjoyed it more binge watching it as I did the first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.35/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nI felt Noragami Aragoto is a bit better than the first, I think it's a very good anime to binge watch like I said before and the pacing was well done. For them to cover to arcs in 13 episodes and not make it feel rush I think is an accomplishment.",

            "content": "[First of All]\r\nThis is going to be a combined review of Noragami and Noragami Aragoto. Since my feelings are the same for both seasons, this shouldn't be a problem. From now on, I will refer to season 1 as \"Noragami\" and season 2 as \"Aragoto\", just to further simplify things.\r\nNoragami the series is awesome. From beginning to end, this anime was a consistently good time. If there is any question about it, I highly recommend watching Noragami and Aragoto.\r\n[Writing]\r\nThis story manages to fuse comedy and tragedy like no other. It's very rare to see an anime that strikes that perfect balance, but when it does,it really does add to the experience. I love comedies and I love tragedies, but there are heavy consequences to having them in the same place. \\n\\n\r\nOne example of misusing the combination of tragedy and comedy is High School DXD. Yes, the fabled boobu festu anime. The writing is actually kind of good for an ecchi-harem anime, but the tone is all over the place. I mean, you can't go from having every girl get naked to killing off a protagonist in the same episode. Crazy tone shifts like that are what confuse the audience and thus kills any investment one might have in a series' story. In Noragami as well as Aragato, this isn't a problem. The comedy moderated to the point where the transition from tragedy to comedy is seamless. You never feel like the stakes are gone because comedy is usually done and dealt with before the drama starts to coalesce. That's only one possible result of misusing tragedy and comedy, though.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is hard to strike that perfect balance between ROFL and ROFC, as a writer, you really should try. Having more than one tone for an anime will increase its longevity significantly. One example of this rule is Dororo (2019). Very well made anime, but it's stuck in tragedy mode for 24 episodes straight. The drama is truly compelling, but I felt the need to put it on hold because I was simply growing bored of the depressing atmosphere. Noragami and Aragoto have several tones within their separate 24 minute confines. That's just separately, though. Incidentally, the overall tone of the series from beginning to end is like a gradient from comedy to tragedy. This works well to the show's favor since comedy is more likely to attract viewers while drama is more likely to keep them enthralled. That's a trap that I don't mind falling into, and you shouldn't either. It's good writing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've rated the story 9/10 for a reason. Despite all my praise, there was a minor hiccup at the end of Aragoto. If you decide to watch, you'll notice that the pacing and character building become rushed in the final arc. This is minor and the ending is still very much watchable, but it's disappointing especially considering the fact that a 3rd season is unlikely at best. Now, onto the art (and sound) [I'll call it presentation].\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a beautiful, polished anime. To begin with, the art style is simply amazing. The emphasis on specific colors as identification is a very good way of marketing. I have a theory that the people behind designing this anime were actually very passionate about it (I know, shocking), so they tried their absolute hardest to make it a successful franchise. Think about it: Yato is a sharp light blue, Yukine is a burning orange, and Hiyori is a bright pink. Even the minor characters get their own colors. Purple, violet, green, black, red. All of them distinctly related to a specific character. This concept is further emphasized by the series' kickass OPs. All the color is flushed out to make the marketing turn into straight up art. Not to mention, the music choice is very suitable for both seasons of the anime. Delving further into the sound, the voice acting is superb. Full disclosure, I am biased; Hiroshi Kamiya is listed as a \"favorite person\" on my MAL page, but objectively speaking, I think he was well cast. He can deliver great performances as Happy Yato, Sad Yato, and everything in between. I only decided to mention Yato's voice actor since he's the one you'll be hearing the most of should you decide to watch. Overall, masterful presentation all around. Now onto the characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are charming, relatable, and well written. Almost never do they break character for the sake of the story. The characters actually grow too- all of them. It's sort of amazing how an audience can like a character both before and after they change throughout a story. If only other writers would take note of this possibility and stop making garbage exposition deliverers, the industry would be even better. I don't have much else to say, since it'd be spoiling integral parts of the story, so now into the final stretch.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nWhen I'd first watched this series when I was still a young buck. Back then, the best anime i'd seen was High School DXD because it did magical things to the state of my pants. Now, roughly 4 years later, I've decided to re-watch to see if this series was worth the 10/10 I'd originally given it. Yes, it was. Noragami and Aragoto are great anime and you definitely should watch them.",

The fight scenes are very exciting to watch. They will have you on the edge of your seats. The next arc has a lot about Yato's relationship with Nora. This was also a very good arc. I also prefer this opening to thefirst season. Aragoto only made me love Noragami more and deserves a season 3. I definitely will be collecting all the mangas.",

            "content": "Regular readers might remember that I dropped the first Noragami back when it aired because my tolerance for shonen action stuff was less then than it is now and I was still in that Jojo phase where everything I see of the genre from here on out would be a disappointment by comparison. However, once I had exited that phase, gained more of an interest in religion (that is, stories that apply religion rather than actual beliefs themselves) so I could understand better why people liked it, and learned of the sequel's existence, I watched the whole thing on Netflix and...well let's just say Igot through Nana in the span of a week and despite Noragami's much shorter length, it took me five days to finish it. It had a lot of interesting things to it, but so much time was spent on Yukine's stuff to the point of annoyance, and the final bad guy...I don't even remember what his deal was and I doubt anyone else does either. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to the sequel since fans told me that from here on out was when the series got into the meaty stuff and unlike light novels (looking at you...not gonna bother naming names), manga actually have a tendency to do that. And you know what? They were right.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the setup from what I can only describe as an incredibly overlong prologue completed, Noragami delves more into actual character struggles with this sequel as we focus on the truth behind Bishamon's hatred for Yato, Yato's previous familiar and her new owner, and Yato himself as we learn just how important being a god with an actual shrine is to him, along with what he'd do to accomplish said goal. The series takes a darker direction in order to tackle these arcs properly, with a bunch of arc-specific characters getting the ax and the shonen-esque humor involving Yato doing something stupid and Hiyori freaking out at his actions is toned down to only a single episode and one or two moments elsewhere. Now I make a policy to not spoil major events in my reviews unless it's bad enough to the point that no one with any sense of reality would bother defending, so I can't really tell you what actually happens in the show. But I will say that it's cool to see Yato make dual-wielding cool again after Kirito rained all over Lloyd Irving's parade and will continue to do so for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the non-story related good about Aragoto is pretty much the same good that was in Noragami, so there's no point in really describing it. Characters are still fun. Animation is still nice. Soundtrack is fitting. Blablabla. Actually, I'm surprised by how much I've grown to like Noragami's cast over time. I kinda forgot everyone but Bishamon and the main trio by the time the second season hit, so it was nice for me to remember more characters' names this go around. Well okay, I still can't remember the name of the \"bad luck\" god without using Wikipedia, but at least I remember she exists now. Amazing what giving some personal flaws and having said flaws fuel arcs can do for someone, isn't it Kazuma?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Noragami over say, Jojo, is that all the shonen action and character tropes are ultimately an accessibility tool for the mainstream crowd in order to explore actual religious lore and provide serious takes on what Japanese gods are being treated like today rather than the reverse the latter utilizes with its movie tributes and obsession with poses. Having said that, Noragami still hasn't fixed its problem of occasionally making things a little too accessible to the point that it sacrifices story impact. Whilst the Bishamon arc has been hyped as one of they greatest story moments of the series, I honestly prefer the one where Yato visits Izanami and causes Hiyori to almost forget him mainly because the former had a tendency to pull its punches right when it needed to squeeze the trigger. Gonna be hard to say why without spoilers, but basically a giant portion of the conflict was based around a stupid misunderstanding, the character who caused said misunderstanding to happen got off with a slap on the wrist after everything was over, and the true bad guy of that arc turned incredibly generic in the end, Tiger and Bunny-style. It's the biggest, but by no means the only time when Noragami seems to struggle with meshing the desires of the casual crowd and the elitist crowd into something that'll please them both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd similar to another shonen action anime that delved into serious issues, Tokyo Ghoul, whilst the action is pretty good for the most part, I'm not a fan of how shonen-esque it can be at times. You know, with all the cheesy lines and exposition mixed into all the fighting, along with how they stretch the fights out by revealing a loophole that was never hinted at before? It's like if you made a movie adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days that tried to impart the impact of Phileas Fogg's grand adventures through ludicrous karate fights with some of the locals he encounters...oh wait.\\n\\n\r\nBut those faults are hardly wait throwing the anime into Hell for, especially with everything else the show has going for it. In a medium where good follow-ups are harder to find than a presidential candidate that doesn't come with enough asterisk marks attached to their speeches to fill up ten pages in Microsoft Word, Noragami Aragoto should be held as a good standard for how anime sequels should be. Don't give us more of the same. Use what you had previously for something new, preferably bigger and better. And before people comment on this, I mean bigger and better whilst still retaining focus in the vein of something like The Dark Knight. Not the retardedly unfocused bigger and better that Resident Evil devolved into with its sixth installment.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I'm still not ready to consider Noragami a great anime as of yet. It feels like there's a bunch of cannons within its narrative that it has yet to fire, and whilst the ones that it has fired are quite loud, there's a bit of an annoying \"okay, that's enough for today\" after-feel to them by the time the series ends, right down to the main trio still having their relationship be the same as always, along with an incredibly unsubtle sequel hook that I am neither excited nor opposed to seeing what comes of it. The show is fun, but by the time it was over, I was already set to move on to the next thing with zero inclination to give it a second look. But who knows? Maybe the next Noragami sequel will change my mind. And then maybe the Republicans will stop denying the existence of global warming when the incredibly large amounts of evidence is shoved in their faces.",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto is the second season of the fun, never boring, and sometimes intellectual and deep Shounen anime Noragami. \r\nI'm going to keep this short, because honestly, this isn't \"psycho pass\"; There is no need for an essay on why this show is good, or whether its worth your time. \r\nThis is an anime for people who want to watch something light, something akin to a fighting Shounen, but with a little more depth, far less length, and some cool characters to befriend on the way. \r\nI personally hate Shounen, for the most part. Things with as many episodes as Bleach or Naruto don't needto exist, and honestly, they are basically like soap operas. \\n\\n\r\nSo, it was a nice suprise to find out that Noragami is actually quite short. Both the first and second season make up about as many episodes as one normal single season of this type of show. Shorter shows make it easier to jump in, as compared to longer running shounen that seem to have no end in sight. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami also has an interesting, unique story, and even though the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could have been, they are all fairly unique, and undergo many changes throughout the course of these two seasons. (FYI: the manga fleshes out the characters perfectly, and has a far deeper, psychological backdrop.)\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles things like coming of age, depression, and self-worth- so there is some depth and seriousness to the show. The fighting scenes often seem to be there, more than anything, to keep the story interesting and break up the scenes of the deep relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis season actually seemed to have more fights and conflict then the last, and the extra darkness/ uncertainty fit in perfectly with the world building that occurred during the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, but I fell in love with the characters enough to look past the rushed anime ending, and the (compared to the manga) sometimes thin plot. But, at least it didn't try to outdo itself, only to be full of plot holes like many anime today. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that knew what it wanted to be, and it achieved just that- a lighthearted, world weary shounen about a stray god, looking for belonging, and his rag-tag group of friends and accomplices along the way. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate:\\n\r\nAfter finishing the manga, I only wish that the show received more funding so that it could have fleshed itself out as well as the manga did. Sadly, it's been years since the last episode, so the chances of the story catching up to the manga and having a proper ending are slim to none. \\n\\n\r\nIt really is a shame, because Noragami's manga has such a great, life-affirming story, and the two women who write it under the joint pseudonym \"Adachitoka\" make such a wonderful team.  They deserved better, and so did Noragami.  Let's hope the anime industry stops churning out fast food garbage and stops cutting funding for shows before they have a chance to properly end. We see it too much these days...",

More past stories has been revealed, more plot twists will eventually unfold. Well, I can say that the plot \"Escalated quickly\" *insert that escalated quickly meme here*. I mean Noragami's story line is immediately exposed to the anime, no fillers at this moment. Episode 7's preview made me love it even more.\r\nI was dumbfounded when I watched Episode 8 zzz ASDFGHJKL! I wanna curse but, I can't. The new arc is. just. so. NOOOO!! IT CAN'TBE! NOOOOOOOO!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11 is just, PLAIN AWESOOME! ASDFGHJK. CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE zzz I almost died in ****'s speech. But, the ending is such a cliffhanger. It definitely needs a 3rd season. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 11/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just so asdfghjl! It's way too coooool! The animations fight scenes, the animated characters, and all! It's way too coooool! I mean, I'm pretty judgmental in terms of art, if the art doesn't look good, there's a huge probability that I'll not watch the anime. But this anime? With no second thoughts, I started watching this anime since the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nStarting from the first season until this season, the OST of Noragami never failed to amuse me. Especially the opening soundtracks, I just don't know. I like it! XD I even have the Opening Song in my iTunes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made. Some of them even changed personalities in this season. Specially ******, I hate him. But I won't say it in order to make this review \"Spoiler Free\" :p And also, I highly ship Yato x Hiyori xD (ep. 2 I guess) wait til' you see it :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Noragami hype is still the same as the first season! I really enjoy this season. Cool storyline, plot twists, fight scenes, and \"same old jokes\". Some jokes are repeated from the first season but, I still like it ;) \\n\r\nI REALLY LOVE THIS",

            "content": "Amongst the many sequels I've seen from 2015's offerings, the biggest and most welcome improvement I've seen would be from Noragami Aragoto. Even though I still like the 1st season, the fact remains that all we got was a basic introduction the characters before Angsty the Ghost and some boring filler antagonist took over the 2nd half. This time, Noragami brings out the big bats and swings hard, real hard.\r\nOn top of doing what any good shonen ought to past the introductory phase by introducing higher stake conflicts (something I felt was sorely lacking in the 1st season) this season gives even more focus tothe Gods themselves and what it takes to have that kind of status when imbued with emotions shared by the people that worship theme on top of their flawed ideologies. This, of course, means that Yukine and Hiyori feel more like they're a part of the periphery this time around, but I don't think this equates to either of them getting the shaft at all. Whilst I\u2019m not a big fan of seeing Hiyori play the role of damsel in distress, her presence in the 2nd half of the season as the primary reason for Yato keeping himself tethered to a life of peace (away from bad influences like Yato's Nora, who alway seems to be ready to lead Yato astray) and even to his very existence is enough for me. She feels more like an accessory to Yato than an interesting character in her own right, but she\u2019s a fine accessory nonetheless. Despite also not being a central character in either of the arcs this season, Yukine has still come a pretty long way from the lad who only thought about his misfortunes. Anyone who found themselves at their wit's end as a result of his endless whining will be happy to find out that Yukine has permanently washed all the salt out of his boipussy. I think it\u2019s also worth noting how characters like Yato, Bishamon and Ebisu have a lot more worth looking into because of their long, tragic histories. The Gods ought to be the ones driving the story here, and that's what this second season gets. \\n\\n\r\nThis time, we're split between two arcs. The 1st is centered around a mobilizing threat within Bishamon's ranks, consisting of scores of regalia picked up over the years. What made this arc work is the way in which it is driven by the flaws of the characters, and forces them to come terms with those flaws. Bishamon's main flaw being her Mother Theresa-esque impulses that compel her to collect as many needy regalia like some kind of compulsive cat hoarder. She lacked the proper means to properly shower love upon the many she has taken in, yet continues to bear the physical side-effects of maintaining a link with so many fallible souls. Kugaha, the antagonist of this arc, and one of Bishamon's most trusted regalia works as some kind of master manipulator of sorts in the way he schemes to eliminate everything between him and the creation of his idealized version of his master. The idea behind his character is a very interesting one. His motives aren't selfish, as he treats his actions as if they're bitter but necessary pills for Bishamon to swallow. The arc also highlights a lot of the problems with the God/regalia system as Kuguha is always able to use loopholes as workarounds for his heinous acts. We also learn a great deal about Kazuma (a character who appeared in the 1st season yet didn't leave much of an impression) and his complicated history with Bishamon and the burden he carries as her exemplar, which makes an already good arc even better, If their's anything wrong with this arc, then it's the fact that the way it wraps up was not quite as impactful as it should have been, as the consequences for the chaos that was the climax weren't quite there. A painful lesson for the main characters of a story ought to be painful for the audience as well, and I think Noragami Aragoto let me down a little in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have as much to say about the following arc as it didn't quite have the emotional highs of Bishamon's story, but it remained fairly strong from beginning to end nonetheless. The 2nd half of this season focuses on a newly introduced God, Ebisu, one of the Seven Gods of fortune (the real Ebisu, not that pink-haired, disaster-bringing piece of waifu material). Bishamon's arc made it clear that no one can pass judgment a God. Ebisu's arc, however, makes it clear that law only applies to those of the Near Shore, and that under the scrutiny of the heavens, a God must tread carefully. Historically speaking, Ebisu is a God that is prone to making bold moves (as is proven by the fact that he has a reputation of being killed and reincarnated for more regularly than his fellow deities). As a result, his current incarnation is not afraid to break the ironclad laws even Gods must abide by with his fascination with the idea of controlling phantoms. Initially framed as an antagonist, through his interactions with Yato, we get a much better picture of what Ebisu is aiming for and the type of God he really is. Speaking of Yato, he also gets some much-needed development with this storyline, as in the previous arc he was more of a supporting character necessary for getting the plot moving. Here we get a much fuller picture of not only the God he once was, but the God he wants to become. In doing so, Norgami's already likable lead character make his leap into being truly lovable here. \\n\\n\r\nWith the story lines presented this season, I say that the combination of Bones and Adachitoka (the original mangaka) lead to the creation of something that soundly nails all of the requirements expected of a worthwhile sequel. Compounding all of the emotional devastation, is Taku Iwasaki's return as the composer. Once again his distinctive South Asian influences are instantly identifiable, and the fantastic composition and music selection are always welcome additions to any scene at hand. Not only that but the opening theme, Kyouran Hey Kids! is cool as hell. Whilst obviously not without its share of blemishes (a couple of questionable decisions script-wise on top of what I described with Bishamon's arc and the fact the art quality dips somewhat in later episodes), there are still a lot of reasons to look forward to another season. I just hope it won't take so long to announce this time!",

            "content": "Fall 2015 was a season filled to the brim with disappointments.  Things like the failed trio of shows developed by Silver Link to other spinoffs and shows that just didn't really get up there in terms of quality.  Thankfully, Bones was able to provide us a second adaptation to the Noragami series to make up where the other shows failed or didn't do as proficiently.  \r\nStory: Aragato, as I will refer to this second season of Noragami as, continues the story of the our titular main trio of characters, Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine as they continue fighting Phantoms and dealing with variousgodly issues.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story standpoint, Aragato picks up directly where the first season ended, moving onto two more arcs, the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs, where the show puts more focus on those characters rather than our main cast.  What makes this season different than the first one is how more developed the world is.  More of the world of gods is introduced to us, as well as the backstory to previously unknown developments in the first season, including who Yato is (kind of), and what was up with Bishamon's boundless hatred towards Yato.  \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that makes this season better is the fact that the show really puts focus on Yato as a character, as the arcs that are presented here really put emphasis onto Yato as a character and really develop him as he works his way up the proverbial 'corporate ladder' in order to become an important god.  Not only for Yato though, the story arcs that are presented also develop the characters that they're named after; the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs.  These gods in addition get quite a bit of attention and really make sense.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the big issue that I have with this show is the fact that the show didn't really put much emphasis on Hiyori or Yukine.  Sure, the show was never really about either one of them personally, but as members of the main cast, they weren't really all THAT important in context, and because the show focused on Yato primarily, they were shelved off to the side most of the time.  Also, the last episode wasn't really all that grand.  It just kinda trailed off after everything happened.  I know the climax happened before, but it just seemed like it was just leading into another season which I do hope we get, cause this story is really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Character development\\n\r\n+  Interesting story arcs\\n\r\n-  Kind of a bland end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, the characters for Noragami are more or less split into characters that carry a lot of weight for the show, or just simply add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, we have Yato, the main protagonist in this entire Japanese god story.  Reprising his role as the Delivery God, Yato himself takes a huge brunt of development in this story, particularly in the second half, as he aids the two featured gods in this season with their issues and problems.  Yato changes, he changes over the course of the entire season so much that you the growth really becomes apparent from episode to episode.  It's great change that is really appreciated because you don't get to see the amount of development or attention he gets all that much anymore.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters that deserve mention are Ebisu and Bishamon.  As the two other gods that take the main role in this season, both of these gods have issues and major problems that Yato spends the entire arc fixing and helping.  In addition to Yato changing, these gods of fortune are shown to alter themselves as time goes on, growing alongside our main character, creating a change that is both noticeable and pleasant to watch.  (Sadly, I can't say how or why because...spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nThe one problem I have about this season comes with the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both are sort of shafted to the sidelines.  Both of these characters while extremely important in the first season, don't really have all that much of an impact as a whole in Aragato.  They're important to some extent, adding to the series since they are the two most important people to Yato, but in terms of importance and development, they don't really contribute to that aspect all too much.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters for the most part serve a similar role to Hiyori and Yukine.  Since they are more or less related to the respective gods that they are associated with, (Like Kazuma to Bishamon), their change or role in the series stems off from that part about them and really nothing else.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since they're supporting cast, yet they still take a good foothold and have quite a lot of importance in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good character development for featured gods\\n\r\n+  Good supporting cast\\n\r\n-  Most of the Main cast gets kind of shafted...\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The animation for Aragato was produced by Studio Bones, and as such, hosts a fantastic  artstyle that reflects the style of the series.  The artwork is very clean and holds both a mystical and eerie tone to it, as the Phantoms and Yomi both have that feel to it.  \\n\\n\r\nin addition, the fluidity of the battle scenes and the appearance of the more magical aspects (like huge magical rings) are both outstanding to look at.  While maybe not as fantastic as other things in terms of staggering beauty in terms of fight scenes like other fight scenes in recent years, but it's still great to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, clean art\\n\r\n+ Fight scene fluidity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Like last season, Noragami employed a rock band to give us once again, another great OP by the name of \"Hey Kids\" by the Oral Cigarettes which is not only an action heavy song that fits with the visuals of the OP, but is also very memorable and quite addicting to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand doesn't really fit with the show as it sounds...rather happy and joyful.  It's pretty memorable and it's a good song but...it doesn't really fit Noragami.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great and memorable songs\\n\r\n-  ED doesn't really fit...\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I enjoy Noragami.  As a series, it boasts a lot of connection to Shintoism and has great and enjoyable characters in addition to a very engaging plot that never deviates from what it wants to do.  It's a consistently great series that I very much enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a series that never fails to impress me.  There are virtually no flaws with it as for me, it never fails to engage me into its plot and throughout the whole series, I never lost any interest in watching it.  It gripped me in and I was always happy to see another epsiode come in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both really never make too much of an impact in this season.  Sure they are in the show and they help move the plot along quite frequently and well, but they just felt a lot less important this season and as such, I was a bit disappointed simply because they didn't have as much impact on the plot as they did before.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami as a series is one that I would recommend to watch.  It's a very well written story that I feel is just good period, something that you don't normally see with a lot of anime these days.  It's not without its flaws, but they're not so glaring that they would hinder the watching of the series.  That being said, only watch Aragato after the first season because it wouldn't really make sense to watch season 2 before season 1.",

            "content": "A bond between friends of any amount can be strong when you have shared all of your interests, strengths and weaknesses to each other to help understand one another. Similar to how friendship is portrayed in story, a convincing friendship involving people that try to fight off whatever conflicts they must face can be an emotional roller coaster of an experience. Sometimes this can be accomplished by simply adding enough time for us to take in the fact that they have grown together as friends before the inevitable climax. At first I was loving this friendship that Noragami presented in its first season, now I\u2019vegravitated towards them in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nMy love for Noragami has always been for the characters. I\u2019ve always loved their charisma, high energy shenanigans, and great chemistry that they create from their dialogue and actions. Not only did the writing serve a part in making this a reality, but also the talented voice cast that honed their voices for their roles to make each character distinctive and memorable. Now with Aragoto, things have started to change dramatically, to say the least. There is less comedy and more dramatic story arcs than in the previous season which was, for the most part, pretty light-hearted; mostly due to the jokey protagonist, Yato. Which is probably my only big issue with this season being as I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the serious plot elements of the 1st season as much as the comedy bits. I wished there was a bit more of it in this one than just serving it mostly on the first three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaint, I actually did find myself enthralled by how they did justice to the serious undertones of the series. My favorite main story arc, in particular, was the first one involving Bishamon and her regalia. The reason why is the fact that the story arc actually brings something new to the series that shifts a character into being three-dimensional rather than one that is one-note. I know the reason why she has a place with the story involving Yato because of her dark past, so her being a part of the story makes sense at adds a layer of depth to her that was desperately needed. Heading off after that arc is the biggest one in the season involving Yato confronting the demon\u2019s of his past. I felt as though this wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as I hoped it to be. There were parts that felt really rushed that didn\u2019t feel like a natural progression of Yato being a killing machine after being taken away from his friends. Not a bad arc to go through, but it could have been better paced with a few more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami has proven itself worthy of being a solid action anime with its spectacular artwork and animation. I\u2019ve always loved the type of color palettes the studio used to create a visual atmosphere of different kinds. Whether it is bright and colorful when the series is generally comedic and goofy or dark and cryptic whenever there is a dark and sinister moment to help gravitate the viewer into a distinctive mood. Of course this mood is also helped by the talented voice cast who do their job splendidly well, with Hiroshi Kamiya as Yato doing one of the best roles in his entire career. In fact, the voice cast is one of the other big reasons why Yukine, Hiyori, and Yato\u2019s chemistry works because the actors all play off each other naturally.\\n\\n\r\nAs multiple sequels keeping trudging along these past seasons, Noragami Aragoto has done the series a favor of improving previous problems I had with the story by adding in one that felt like it had some depth to it. There are still some minor issues that keep it from being the magnificence of what many might have hoped for. That all comes down to what they will do next. Hopefully one with more laughs and less dreariness.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "TAKE MY 5 YEN!\r\nThe thrilling sequel to the ever popular shounen that took the world by storm, Noragami Aragoto is definitely a step up from its prequel. It takes a much more serious approach to the themes of god and phantoms, and also reveals more about the mysterious Yatogami's past. Despite being much lower on the comedy aspect than its prequel, the intensity and suspense of its thrilling plot and action more than makes up for it.\r\nIn fact, I can agree that the Noragami franchise is a perfect mix of action, comedy, and drama, and truly shows what a shounen anime can be when doneright. It's jokes are hilarious when they occur, the drama is incredibly impactful and will bring tears to your eyes, the action is hardcore and intense, and there are even some really gorey and horror-like moments that will surprise you. Noragami is one of the few shows that can execute so many themes well!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great mix of everything that makes a shounen good.\\n\r\n- Great characters that are chock full of development and likable characteristics. Yato is a great lead character!\\n\r\n- A very interesting world and depictions of gods and spirits.\\n\r\n- Intense and engaging plot, full of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Pacing is fairly rushed at some points.\\n\r\n- Art and character designs may be good, but the action scenes can be somewhat of a letdown at parts.\\n\r\n- Some plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nUnlike the first season, this season splits its story into two, more serious arcs. The first arc deals heavily on Yato's relationship with Bishamon, as well as the history between them. The second arc deals with Yato's rise as a god, as well as his relationship with Nora (or Hiiro), whatever you wanna call her. Both of these arcs have extremely dark, dramatic, and highly thrilling moments. The uncovering of Yato's past is always taken in a really interesting way, as the more you dive into his past, the deeper you want to go. Despite having less comedy, the story of this season is much more intriguing, and the stakes are always shown to be really high.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs and artwork of this series is incredibly top notch. The animation is also relatively good, however, sometimes it gets a little lazy during some action scenes. There isn't that much high quality choreography, but even so, the artwork and the atmosphere that it gives off is enough to pull you into the action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is incredibly catchy, to the point where I never skipped it. The OST is also hype generating, especially during action scenes. However, the OST isn't anything remarkably special either. It's good and it supports the intensity of the show, but it doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nYato is probably the most moe man on earth. He is incredibly carefree and childish, and saying he has a mind of his own is an understatement. However, despite his seemingly innocent personality, his backstory is full of death and darkness. You would never expect such a happy person to have such a dark backstory, but Yato's backstory is incredibly dark and thrilling as well. Yukine is also a really good character due to his ability to redeem himself multiple times throughout the series. At first he is pretty annoying, seemingly spoiled and stubborn, but he has a good heart and means well, and proves that to the world in a spectacular fashion. Hiyori is also an incredibly lovable character, as she constantly helps Yato and Yukine through thick and thin. These three characters together make an incredibly colorful cast, full of amazing character interactions and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI definitely liked Noragami Aragoto more than the first season of Noragami. The story was really engaging and it was an amazing thrill ride. It also left a lot of potential for a third season, whenever that comes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nDefinitely something you must watch if you have already watched the first season of Noragami! It's an example of a great shounen series with a lot going for it!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: You, who desecrate this Land of the Weaboos! With my advent, I, Yatogami, lay waste with the Sekki and expel thy filthy casualness! --- Rend!\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Indirect Spoilers\r\nI just finished watching this, and it\u2019s amazing! Don\u2019t take my word for it, tho, lol, but I just really love the well-outlined plot and character development! While I find it unfortunate that some of the featured characters end up having to back up later on (specifically Hiyori & Bishamon), how the plot flowed and got the characters was wonderful! It\u2019s been quite a long time since I got to scream while watching or reading like that, ahaha,,,\r\nHnnngh I\u2019m running out of things to say. Well... some flaws I\u2019d like to point out is\r\n1. Hiyori\u2019s character. It\u2019s nice and all, and luckily nottoo pressed in my opinion, but I feel like she haven\u2019t really developed much as a character at all. Sure, her arc\u2019s already done with, so there\u2019s not much need, but wasn\u2019t her role generally just being Yato\u2019s motivation and reminder to live and stay justified? Her clich\u00e9 bath scenes are starting to get a little tiring, too, even if it lacks fanservice (I mean, we literally only see whatever\u2019s above her chest, no sideview of the naked butt or something, see). Just... it could be better ^^\\n\\n\r\n2. Clich\u00e9 reactions to angsty horrible things. How many times has we seen a character or two let out a taken-aback gasp as they lean forwards, stretching their hand forwards as whatever just happened causes their eyes to turn shineless? The shineless eyes themselves are a bit repetitive at any case. Still, a lot of horrific things happened, so it\u2019s pretty understandable.\\n\\n\r\n3. The switching between Hiyori\u2019s perspective and Yato\u2019s perspective when Yato was stuck in... well, you know. The anime could\u2019ve at least showed one perspective first, not switch back and forth. It slightly kills the mood to see Yato wringing in blight only to switch back to Hiyori laughing with her friends and then getting angsty again. Just saying,,,\\n\\n\r\n4. The pushed YaTori (Yato x Hiyori). Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do like YaTori; it\u2019s pretty cute and is a good ship with how it develops and works and all! It\u2019s just that it\u2019s a little... forced, maybe? Anyone who watched this could tell Hiyori really cared for Yato (Yukine, too, but Yato especially) and meant the world to Yato in return. It kind of came to the point where I felt a little bad for the people who don\u2019t like that ship... \\n\\n\r\nMmm I can\u2019t really think of anything more significant, but basically, it\u2019s just the notable clich\u00e9s that bother me. I\u2019m not the kind of person who dwells on flaws more than pros in an enjoyable anime, though, especially with an anime t h i s good! I mean, wicked character development! Intense plot! Cliffhangers that\u2019ll make me scream! Cryable scenes (not that I cried much, but as a person lacking empathetic and affectionate feelings, I still cried and got a little upset a couple of short times-)! The lack of difficulty in understanding emotions and what\u2019s going on! The admirable devotion & loyalty the characters have! \\n\\n\r\nJust,,, certainly recommendable! This is something I can look forward to showing my sister once I start rewatching the Noragami series with my sister (since it\u2019ll be her first time watching it)! Hope you enjoyed this series, too, if you already watched it! <3",

            "content": "_-*-SPOILER FREE REVIEW-*-_\r\nNoragami Aragoto is probably the best 2nd season anime this year. There is a big deal of change since the first season, for good. To be honest, the first season's second half was slightly off the entertainment level. I wasn't able to dive into the seriousness of the final arcs in the first season. But I am surprised how second season made a remarkable progress in making the plot more interesting.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWe all have seen Noragami first season and were left with many doubts, mostly related to Yato and Bishamon. In the first half. the second season tackles the back story of Yatoand Bishamon and reveals the secrets of Yato, Bishamon, \u200eKazuma, Other Gods etc little by little. The second half deals with the mystery of masked phantoms and also focuses of the relations between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori. Still there are plenty of things which are left untold which we can expect them to be shown in the 3rd season, when it comes out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNoragami and Noragami Aragoto has been animated by the studio 'Bones' which is very well known for it's remarkable art in the anime 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'Soul Eater', 'Space\u2606Dandy', 'Tokyo Magnitude 8.0' etc. As expected of Bones, it's art in Noragami is also smooth, colorful and remarkable. The character designs are another plus point of Noragami series. The characters are drawn so well, I can't even imagine anyone else replacing them in any way. Their designs are the perfect match for their personality which makes them so much likable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNoragami's opening song 'Hey Kids' by 'THE ORAL CIGARETTES' is a BLAST! There's no way anyone can deny me with this point. While everyone may not agree with me, the ending song 'Nirvana' by 'Tia' is another great song and the visuals and the lyrics adds more to it. While Noragami 1st season's soundtracks were already good, there has been a great improvement in the soundtracks in the 2nd season. The number of soundtracks under different situations have been changed, increased in number, and has become more suited to it than before. The soundtracks played during battles, sad scenes, happy scenes etc. makes them even more interesting and fun to watch. Coming to the voice actors, many famous and insanely talented actors like Kamiya Hiroshi, Kugimiya Rie, Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Hayami Saori, Toyosaki Aki etc. gave an amazing performance which makes Noragami deserve  a 10/10 in terms of Sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe male protagonist of the show, Yato, is my most favorite of all the characters. Not just from Noragami, but Yato has become one of my favorite character of all the anime and that's because of his cool attitude, wicked sense of humor and his seriousness when it is needed. Other characters like Bishamon, Kazuma, Yukine are also pretty likeable for their own unique personality. While most of you will disagree with me, I feel that Iki Hiyori is also an important character which adds some spice to the story. Due to her caring and loving nature, she is also pretty likable. And the fact that there is almost zero percent chance of her of being in relationship with a god, Yato, makes us want to know more about their relation progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFor me, the first season of Noragami was like 10/10 in terms of enjoyment but the second half was like 7/10. With more interesting plot, Noragami Aragoto has exploited the curiosity of the viewers and made this season worth a watch. Definitely 10/10 in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10\\n\r\nIf you really liked Noragami first season, then Noragami Aragoto is undoubtedly a must watch for you! If you are like me who liked half of the season and the other half of the season was meh, then you must give the second season a shot and you will undoubtedly be satisfied with it. And if you didn't like Noragami first season at all, then there's not much helping it, better skip this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope my review helped. Comments appreciated. :)",

            "content": "I really won't be surprised if I get a mob of weeaboos wearing Yato masks at my door ready to baptize me in the sacred Yato holywater for rating it a 5 but please keep in mind that I actually use the rating system in it's entirety and believe it or not, I don't hate Noragami! This will contain minor spoilers.\r\nOverall I think Noragami is a very overrated series. I really didn't enjoy the first season and didn't realize what all the hype was about. It had a lot of problems - I felt the writing was poor, characters did stupid things that made nosense a lot of the time and the constant abuse of Yato is overused for comedic value but at a certain point it runs dry, and most of all - Yukine.\\n\r\nYukine is one of the most annoying and whiny characters I have ever witnessed. If nothing else, I applaud this season for reducing this fact to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Noragami Aragoto has the same initial premise as the first season but this time is divided into 2 major arcs. The first arc focuses on the character of Bishamon, the strongest god of war who also has a deep hatred for Yato as he slaughtered her entire clan once before. By doing this though he saved her life, as requested by Kazuma, the only survivor of the clan. Everything begins when one of Bishamon's regalia is suddenly killed. No one however knows who killed the regalia and panic ensues. Also coincidentally before his death he befriends Yukine and when Yukine hears the news he turns into Emo Kid once more and goes to seek vengeance for his friend. \\n\r\nThe last season also gave a lot of hints that Kazuma knew Yato and their past is now unraveled. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc starts off by Yato receiving a shrine from Hiyori. In the Noragami universe gods who have shrines get special perks sorta say. Yato moves into the Heavenly Neighborhood or whatever other lame name you can think off and is now a proper god, being friends with everyone! After 1 episode of sunshine and rainbows Yato gets captured by Nora and a person she calls \"father\", who knew Yato for a long time as well as seen in the flashbacks of them holding hands.  So this is where the series went downhill for me. This arc just felt so unnecessarily rushed (I've heard so from people who read the manga as well so it isn't just me). So much content is just bundled together in this single arc and sadly, 7 episodes isn't nearly enough time to cover it well.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Studio Bones, all I can say is how fluid and nice it is. To be honest, the fight scenes can be lackluster sometimes but I really enjoy the character designs. I may be giving it too much credit because I just find it better than most of the animation this season though. Shame pretty colors can't save a show :^)\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto like the first season has a variety of music throughout the series and I'd like to say how much I like it like most people do but I really don't think it's anything that special. Sure it's better than the norm nowadays but it's not setting out to break any records. That being said, the opening theme is one of my favorites from this season.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, for the most part I don't like the characters in this series. Let's briefly go over the main characters of the first season: Yato is a god that will obey your every request (( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) for 5 yen but there's a twist to it - He has a dark past. This was revealed a bit in the end of the last season and now plays a big role in the plot. Hiyori is annoying at times but is generally okay and then there is Emo Kid. So now in this season we get more development for Bishamon and suprisingly, Kazuma. Bishamon has too much trust in all of her regalias and you could say that is her downfall. She is shown to be very stubborn when dealing with Yato, seemingly ignoring the fact that he saved her life.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat I wanna say that I feel like they handled the development of Suzuha alright but it may of been better to give him more screen time first since he is the plot device in this situation. The main antagonist of this season is also one of Bishamon's regalia by the name of Kugaha. He really isn't interesting much like the villain of the first season but hey at least he has a goal. We are then introduced to Ebisu who is one of the seven gods of luck, the god of fishing. He could of been a cool character if the series didn't decide to rush it so badly. Needless to say, he doesn't get nearly as much character development as needed for us to actually care about him. We also don't know a single thing about Nora or father, yay.\\n\\n\r\nNorgami Aragoto is a pretty enjoyable series really. As I said in the beginning, they made Yukine a lot more likable which I'm very happy about. The enjoyment does go down after the 2nd arc tags along but it was never to the point where I was forcing myself to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt's somewhat of an improvement from the first season and is an enjoyable series with cool fights and quirky characters (that get on my nerves sometimes but that's besides the point). It still struggles with the issues it had in the past like the plot and the character development in a lot of instances. The 1st arc is the pinnacle of the season (and I'd argue the series but I'm just a dirty hater of the first season), however the 2nd is inferior by a longshot due to how rushed it is. So all in all, while I enjoyed it more than the first season and you'll probably do too, Noragami Aragoto really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally uploaded on October 30th, 2015.",

            "content": "When thinking of Noragami, I often imagine the series as some sort of fairy tale. Only of course, it\u2019s a fairy tale in the modern world about a delivery God named Yato. His question to own his personal shrine makes him an unusual character as well. From previously established concepts, Noragami Arargato returns in full force. And I have to say, any fans of the first season and manga will be delighted to see what the sequel has to offer.\r\nThe second season takes directly after the first season and we get a full on course of the story from the beginning. Unlike some supernatural orshoujo stories that concentrates on romance and relationships, Noragami Aragato crafts human emotions out of fantasy. The previous season already build a lot about personal conflicts such as Bishamonten\u2019s troubled past. And in this sequel, it greatly expands on that as she takes vengeance against Yato. It\u2019s simple to say really though. This season is more of an emotional roller coaster ride. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s clearly shown that there\u2019s darker background building through its various flashbacks. Demonstrated by the appeal of character trauma and PTSD-like scenarios, each episode builds up to a grand climax of this season. At the center of it, we have Yato who struggles with his own problems. Although luckily, he still has trustworthy friends like Hiyori and Yukine at his side.\\n\\n\r\nA good portion of the season takes a look at characters from a personal approach. A key character and enemy to Yato is Bishamonten. Her troubled past links with Yato as viewers see how regalias (weapons made from the deceased) were killed by him. So in return, she wishes to gain revenge. Sounds plausible right? There\u2019s actually a lot more story to that and thankfully, this season nails revelations through its precise buildups. From the present viewpoint, the storyline also follows Bishamonten\u2019s followers as they are now. Some of her prominent regalias such as Kazuma and Aiha get their own roles with discrete purpose. At the same time, it creates some tension among her own group as tense feelings are expressed. Similarly, Yukine experiences grief as he loses a friend and learns about the destiny of being a shiki. Furthermore, Yato and Hiyori builds more of their relationship with trust that becomes stronger each episode. This can also be applied to Yato and Yukine as the latter even puts his own life at risk in battle. It goes to show how far these three\u2019s friendship has led to their strong loyalty. Unfortunately, there\u2019s also betrayal as viewers will learn the real mastermind who engineers suffering and despair throughout season. That\u2019s just the first half though, there\u2019s even bigger things that awaits those who is patient and eager to see how far the story develops. These include the origins of masked phantoms, how Gods exists, and what awaits for Yato\u2019s future.\\n\\n\r\nAs Bishamonten is upgraded to a much more prominent role this season, it\u2019s also important to realize her character. I think it goes beyond her vengeance against Yato as she is also a character with a compassionate nature. She clearly cares about her regalia both past in the present. And furthermore, she often tries to give those who have no place to go a home that they can appreciate. So no wonder, when her regalias were annihilated in the past, Bishamonten would go into a vengeful frenzy. In addition, Bishamonten is a strong willed woman, the type that doesn\u2019t give up easily. Although her reasoning may have flaws, she is merciless towards her enemies and guards her own personal feelings closely. This sometimes leads to backfire as well when she lets those personal feelings get the best of her that leads to reckless decisions. In retrospect though, I think Bishamonten is definitely a character that is important to the core of this season; whether it\u2019s her personality, morals, or actions. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there\u2019s a darker nature of the second season, comedy still retains its comedic nature. So yes, there will be plenty of time to laugh such as with Yato\u2019s childish moments. Anyone familiar with the first season will get to see how Yato\u2019s lack of common sense places him in ridiculous positions. While it may be a bit of or hit or miss at times, Noragami always retains its ability to entertain the audience through clever dialogues. It also shows that Gods can be like humans with their behavior and even relatable through what they do. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly the previous season, studio Bones does a terrific job at working with its animation. The character designs looks clear with Yato as he maintains both a humorous and cool side. Bishamon also returns with her battle gear and tough attitude that is translated by her facial expressions. And that\u2019s a fun thing to look at. Noragami often has fun with itself and this season is no different. Almost every comedic moment is demonstrated with effective expression of character reactions. Whether it\u2019s Yato or some other character, it\u2019s very amusing and feels natural. Hiyori, Yukine, and some of the returning cast also looks good as well while the Phantoms are designed with credibility with their malevolence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, we can\u2019t forget about the soundtrack. On a personal level, the first season\u2019s OP song has a catchier song with more stylistic choreography. But after examining at the sequel, I can say with confidence that the new OP song works quite well too. It has a similar style with fast paced action sequences and montage of the main and supporting characters. While there\u2019s some foreshadowing too, the show does a great job with its themes. The OST is also quite noticeable between scenes of sadness, anger, and humor. It\u2019s surprising at how the show can maintain it throughout the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragato is definitely a sequel that can appeal to just about anyone. Whether you\u2019re looking for some drama, action, or comedy, it has a little bit to offer from all angles. Our main characters return and it\u2019s fun to see where they are now. Bishamonten\u2019s personal rivalry with Yato is a pivotal part of this season so a fan of her character will be in for a treat. And even if you\u2019re not a fan of hers, the season is still entertaining with its concrete storytelling. It\u2019s really a show that\u2019s hard to pass by so what are you waiting for?\\n",

            "content": "The first thing that could be said about the second season of Noragami is that it is arguably better in terms of story and characters than the first season, yet may lack in other departments. This mainly concerns aspects such as expanding on the world and its phantoms, that were enticing in the afore-mentioned one. It is in fact quite an improvement, and was naturally quite enjoyable; nonetheless, it has its flaws as well, which will be discussed below in addition to its strengths.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story follows once again the main protagonists Yato, Yukine and Hiyori and their interactions with the world; yet in this seasonit begins to focus on the goddess of war Bishamon. She is known to be kind, which causes her to take in a lot of shinki's when saving them from phantoms: this will naturally cause her quite some problems, as she isn't able to tend to them all. Pain, insecurity and paranoia are on the order of the day, and the fact that Bishamon hates Yato doesn't ease the situation at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't entirely focus on the goddess of war; it also expands on the world of the gods, in addition to their importance. In addition, it provides a bit of an insight in the underworld, while mutually introducing numerous gods and characters. It could be said that the story in mainly character driven, as it expands on Yato's past, as well as Bishamon's and surprisingly, Kazuma. Quite a lot of action was provided, which was well executed - although having its share of plot convenient twists - in addition to keeping good levels of intrigue throughout the series. However, quite some things were very predictable, as well as their respective outcome, which was a bit of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nIt also shared its slice of life moments in which it focused more on the female lead character, yet these were uninteresting as it didn't provide any story progression, neither character development. The pacing of the series was overall well done, although it had its share of some inconsistent jumps. However, what was personally a drawback, was the fact that it didn't expand on the different worlds of Noragami, meaning how these are related, as well as the phantoms and how these affect the various worlds.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Noragami is by no means big; in fact, there are a handful of characters, which are for the most part distinguishable from each other, especially the main cast. Audiences will be rewarded with some more insight in Yato's past, as well some character development, albeit not impressive. This is because the main mysteries surrounding him are still not explained, and in fact, even more were added. Other positive aspect was the explanation on why Bishamon hated Yato, although the reason behind this were quite lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Yukine, who in my opinion was the most intolerable character in the prequel, did undergo some character development. The fact that his constant wining and sudden outbursts were much less pronounced in this season was a welcoming change, yet it still happened, being in some cases overly dramatic. However, the main problem lay with Hiyori, who underwent zero character development, as well as fleshing out. She plays no important role whatsoever, other than just being a female lead who supports Yato. It is as if her problems with the phantom world lay forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story also began focusing on some gods, in particular that of Ebisu. Although it was interesting, not enough information was released to even begin to care for the character, hence making the events that follow a bit tensionless. Other gods were introduced as well, yet were never expanded on; some seemed to be interesting character-wise.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Noragami is of high quality, what is expected of a show airing in 2015. The battle scenes are well executed, being diverse and well conveyed to the viewer in addition to being consistent: blood, anger, fear and the likes are well relayed to the viewer. The backgrounds are well drawn and detailed, matching with the different scenes. Character design is appealing to the eye, as well as diverse, yet a bit generic in some instances. In some cases inconsistencies could be found when for example these were in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used is quite strange at first, as viewers from the prequel may have thought as well; nevertheless, it is befitting and catchy is some instances. Voice actors performed their roles well, in most cases matching with the personality of the various characters.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nNoragami was overall quite an enjoyable anime which certainly maintained me entertained throughout the whole series with the different aspects and mysteries presented. Expanding on the different character's past was a pleasant sight, although some were annoying, as well as underdeveloped, which was a drawback personally. The art style was nice to look at, as well as the catchy soundtrack. Although the different outcomes where somewhat predictable, in addition to some convenient plot twists which weren't convincing, I certainly could recommend Noragami for an entertaining time. Just don't expect impressive characters or stories.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "The refreshing new season of Noragami directly starts off where the prequel ended, continuing to follow the interactions and daily lives of the dynamic trio of Hiyori, Yukine, and Yato. As a new season unfolds, new characters, relationships, and secrets are introduced. Past questions and plot holes as seen in the previous season now have answers.\r\nYato\u2019s infamous line of, \u201cYou, who desecrate this Land of the Rising Sun. With the advent, I [Yatogami], lay waste with the [Sekki] and expel thy vast defilement. Rend!\u201d makes a comeback in this season still accompanied by the famous usual track of \u201cNoratan\u201d. However, this season\u2019s OST lineupis far more captivating, emotional, and energetic. The diverse OST has songs ranging from classical, dubstep, electro house, and even rap. The songs are beautifully integrated throughout the series\u2019 heightening moments of hype and grief. Altogether, the Noragami series is known for its OST and new catchy OP (Kyouran Hey Kids!! By THE ORAL C!GARETTES).\\n\\n\r\nThe new season begins to unravel with the introduction of the Bishamon arc. As seen in the prequel, Yato and Bishamon hold grudges dating back centuries, their resentment for one another remains unknown to the audience. However, this arc does a great job of slowly unraveling the history and past of the two Gods and their regalia. Flashbacks and dialogues are naturally integrated, making the story interesting yet easy to follow. Not only does this arc dissolve the bad blood between the God of War and God of Calamity, but it also strengthens the relationship between them. Through this arc, new understandings and relationships are formed between characters, furthering their trust, faith, and hope in one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of the season introduces a new character: Ebisu. Ebisu, the God of Fortune is comically portrayed as the generic everyday Japanese salaryman. His introduction is rather abrupt, with little to no background information known about him. At first, this made me wonder if it was worth the time getting to understand his character making it difficult to feel emotionally connected to him. However, as the story progresses, the series does a great job of revealing his troubling past and motives, but unlike the Bishamon arc, it felt rather rushed. As the arc and series were near its end, closure was done in an awkward manner making the latter half of the series lackluster in comparison to the first half. Despite this problem, the arc still managed to tackle important personal revelations made by Yato.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series caters to the battle shounen audience, it does a great job avoiding common tropes that are typically seen. Unlike popular shounen heroes, Yato is a complex character shrouded in mystery, where his past is slowly being uncovered by those closest to him. Once known as the God of Calamity, Yato\u2019s past plays an important role in his shortcomings, forcing him to fall into a state of vulnerability numerous times. Friendship remains an important recurring theme that allows Yatogami to hold onto his humanity and slowly transform into the individual he desires to become.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragato as a whole does a beautiful job of amplifying the character development and storytelling, furthering the emotional bonds and ties between Hiyori, Yukine, and Yato. The trio\u2019s chemistry and friendship can be described as a puzzle with its pieces fitting together perfectly. Each individual\u2019s weaknesses and strengths bounce and play off of each other creating balance. What one lacks, the others possess. Despite their growth, moments of vulnerability, insecurity, and instability also continue to plague Yato. These brief moments of doubt reveal how Gods, figures of authority, worshipped by followers and the common also manifest very humanlike qualities, making them realistic and relatable to the audience. They too give rise to temptation, lust, greed, and fear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is highly enjoyable and worth the watch, especially if you enjoyed the prequel.  However, the ending cruelly hints at more and without a third season announcement your only option is the manga.\\n",

            "content": "[MINOR SPOILER ALERT]\r\nNoragami is a very special anime to me, because i watched it back when i was just getting into anime, and i was very impressed with it. I gave the first season a 9/10, but the second one didn't really hold up to my expectations.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis season went in a totally different direction from the first one, adding new characters, developing backstories, plot points, plot twists and so on. It was interesting to find out the reason behind Bishamon's hatred for Yato, and all the events related to Ebisu, Nora and Yato were also intriguing. However, i felt like this season tried tobe more serious, and it didn't work that well for me, since i was expecting a light-hearted action-comedy. Another downfall is the fact that this season didn't expand the world of Noragami, it's like all the phantoms lurking around the city were just forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters sure went through a lot of changes, especially Bishamon, who learnt to let go of her past and her hatred for Yato, and in the end actually tried to save him. Yato, however, took a turn for the worse in my opinion. I enjoyed the goofy, bombastic and overall hillarious Yato of season 1 more than this serious guy with an \"i will protect my dear ones no matter what\" attitude. Hyori... i guess she didn't really change. Then we have some new characters that didn't really impress me. Kugaha didn't strike me as an antagonist and i didn't get attached to Ebisu, since he was only around for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nCan't say much about the art and animation, it was consistent, similar to the first season, with lots of vivid colors and details, Bones did a really good job once again.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI felt like this was actually an improvement from the first season, adding new tracks, but being keeping the techno style with the occasional pipe sounds. The voice acting was well done, nothing worth mentiong about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough i expected more action and more comedy, i can't say that season 2 was a boring experience. The ending left me a bit disappointed, as i was wishing for a big fight between Yato and Izanami or at least some fight at all, but they chose to wrap it up in and anti-climactic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you have seen the first season you'll probably watch the second season anyway, so i recommend it for all Noragami fans out there. Even though i didn't enjoy it as much as season 1, i am eagerly wating for season 3, witch will probably happen since we got a lot of foreshadowing in the final episode.",

            "content": "Noragami is a very enjoyable and fun anime in today's modern anime seasons filled with pretty bad generic ecchi and shounen boy content over and over. It has a very deep underling to the story itself and expands on it pretty well to a point. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning and fits the mood of the story very well both in up and down moments.\r\nUnfortunately the story actually does fall very short to what would be considered a very complete storyline. It feels very rushed and goes from a very good story arch that was continued from the previous season, with the God of War,to a tacked on story about randomly controlling phantoms. This pretty much happens in the span of a few episodes, and fills the role of the climax of the show. With little to no build up to this plot point. It felt almost rushed to guarantee they got this point of the plot in the season so they didn't have to hope they got a season 3 to continue it, all while dropping the \"to be continued\" ending. It tried to make me care for a character with little screen time prior to these episodes, and therefore i didn't really feel too much a connection with them. All while shotgunning their life in about one episode. While it was a good plot line and it was a good character, it was very rushed to a point it was annoying to watch. The other points in the plot dealing with the more main characters were very good, and the development of those characters over time were really interesting to watch. However, the main focus of the anime seemed to steer off the development of these characters and made it more of a side point.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and sound were absolutely amazing. The OST is probably one of the most enjoyable OSTs I've ever listened to. The sound as well in conjunction with the OST in important parts or low parts in the anime matched perfectly and heightened my enjoyment of the show. The colors bursting from the screen to help give the show more flair is a huge enjoyment boost, and made the viewing experience enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was extremely enjoyable, the characters were lovable and interesting, the comedy in the show didn't distract from the serious parts. Combined with the sounds and art, the show was absolutely great. However the main story seems to be thrown into a disarray about halfway through, and it feels rushed.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nI've seen my fair share of negative reviews for Noragami Aragoto, for various reasons, but I'm writing this review to make the case for why Noragami is so popular, and why so many people love it: it makes you feel something. Actually, a lot of things. I'm a huge believer in the idea that what makes any piece of art gain success is the creator's ability to evoke an emotional response from the audience. This doesn't always mean its a good thing: terrorist groups, as an extreme example, achieve this \"success\" by evoking fear and torment. In most cases, however, the intent is tomake the audience feel happiness, sadness, anger, and/or suspense (ha, better add agony to that list, actually). Sometimes this comes as a retrospective realization, which often leaves lasting effects, while other times it comes as the journey unfolds, like Noragami. The advantage of having this evocation of emotion occur as the story unfolds is that it keeps the audience constantly engaged, without having to rely on curiosity or sudden changes that inevitably result in pacing inconsistencies. The disadvantage is that, while the feelings may be intense \"in the moment,\" they may or may not be memorable, but I can't make the case for everyone--it all depends on how much a person personally enjoys the series, and how long they watch it for, whether that's week by week or binging, like me. In addition, this being the second season means that (if season 1 did it's job) we're already attached to these characters (to a degree), making it easier to empathize with them and much easier to care about what happens to them.\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT--SKIP CHARACTER CATEGORY IF YOU CARE\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I even feel the need to differentiate \"Character\" from \"Story\" after already complimenting the character development is because of one character, essential to the second arc of the season: Ebisu. While MAL may categorize him as a supporting character, I beg to differ--he obviously has an extreme impact on Yato after he dies, ultimately causing the complete shift of his perspective and his releasing of Nora. Because of how important he was, I feel like the audience should have been given a bigger insight into his importance and his past, rather than just passing him off as \"that god who reincarnates a lot.\" All that being stated, Ebisu was still focused on enough throughout the second half of the season to have an impact on me when he died, especially considering his newfound desire to survive and the illegitimacy of his execution.\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art of Noragami Aragoto is very stylized, and the colors are vibrant and often meaningfully chosen, either to highlight certain elements of a scene or to create subliminal connections between specific characters and their personalities. While the style is pretty common, this use of colors is something rather unique, considering the otherwise flat shading (as opposed to either continual dull or vibrant tints throughout).\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music of the show is great. It always fits the mood of a scene, and is the type of OST that one could listen to independently after the anime has concluded. The OP is upbeat and never fails to get me pumped for what's to come (on top of how catchy it is), while the ED, though by far not my favorite, was choreographed well and had meaninful, emotional lyrics.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNo need to extrapolate here. I really enjoyed the show. In addition, it wrapped up in a way that leads us straight into season 3--suffice to say, I'm excited to see where the story takes us next.\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI recommend this show for fans of shounen, or people who appreciate continually dramatic, unpredictable, and intense plot, and those who enjoyed season 1.",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto \u30ce\u30e9\u30ac\u30df Review\r\nStory (8/10) Very Good\r\nNoragami Aragoto takes too arcs from the manga and adapts them in 13 episodes and as an anime only watcher I feel it was done very well from a pacing stand point. Only one episode really felt episodic and out of place but it wasn't a bad episode to say the least. Although the first arc felt more compelling than the second they both connected well when it came to Bishamon's character development, characterization and her relationship towards the MC. It left the ending of this season with a teaser of what's to come which I felt wasa very good cliff hanger and I hope it get's a season 3 to continue it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nBones did a very good job animating this season nothing mind blowing but it was still an eye candy to some extent. I do felt last season was animated a bit better but I guess that's only because of the final battle in season 1 that made me feel that way. Either way the art style and animation in the season was very good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM, voice acting (in both JP and Dub although the JP was better the Dub wasn't bad the only voice who doesn't fit their character in the dub is the MC himself) and opening music are all great in this season. I started watching it in Sub but then moved over to Dub even though I'm not a fan of Yato's voice it didn't bother me enough to not watch it but it was enough to point out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this season are all very good, almost every character got very good character development and are more likable this time around vs back in season 1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was very good even though I started watching this anime when it first aired and I put it on hold and didn't finish it until now. I still enjoyed my time with this season and I feel I enjoyed it more binge watching it as I did the first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.35/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nI felt Noragami Aragoto is a bit better than the first, I think it's a very good anime to binge watch like I said before and the pacing was well done. For them to cover to arcs in 13 episodes and not make it feel rush I think is an accomplishment.",

            "content": "[First of All]\r\nThis is going to be a combined review of Noragami and Noragami Aragoto. Since my feelings are the same for both seasons, this shouldn't be a problem. From now on, I will refer to season 1 as \"Noragami\" and season 2 as \"Aragoto\", just to further simplify things.\r\nNoragami the series is awesome. From beginning to end, this anime was a consistently good time. If there is any question about it, I highly recommend watching Noragami and Aragoto.\r\n[Writing]\r\nThis story manages to fuse comedy and tragedy like no other. It's very rare to see an anime that strikes that perfect balance, but when it does,it really does add to the experience. I love comedies and I love tragedies, but there are heavy consequences to having them in the same place. \\n\\n\r\nOne example of misusing the combination of tragedy and comedy is High School DXD. Yes, the fabled boobu festu anime. The writing is actually kind of good for an ecchi-harem anime, but the tone is all over the place. I mean, you can't go from having every girl get naked to killing off a protagonist in the same episode. Crazy tone shifts like that are what confuse the audience and thus kills any investment one might have in a series' story. In Noragami as well as Aragato, this isn't a problem. The comedy moderated to the point where the transition from tragedy to comedy is seamless. You never feel like the stakes are gone because comedy is usually done and dealt with before the drama starts to coalesce. That's only one possible result of misusing tragedy and comedy, though.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is hard to strike that perfect balance between ROFL and ROFC, as a writer, you really should try. Having more than one tone for an anime will increase its longevity significantly. One example of this rule is Dororo (2019). Very well made anime, but it's stuck in tragedy mode for 24 episodes straight. The drama is truly compelling, but I felt the need to put it on hold because I was simply growing bored of the depressing atmosphere. Noragami and Aragoto have several tones within their separate 24 minute confines. That's just separately, though. Incidentally, the overall tone of the series from beginning to end is like a gradient from comedy to tragedy. This works well to the show's favor since comedy is more likely to attract viewers while drama is more likely to keep them enthralled. That's a trap that I don't mind falling into, and you shouldn't either. It's good writing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've rated the story 9/10 for a reason. Despite all my praise, there was a minor hiccup at the end of Aragoto. If you decide to watch, you'll notice that the pacing and character building become rushed in the final arc. This is minor and the ending is still very much watchable, but it's disappointing especially considering the fact that a 3rd season is unlikely at best. Now, onto the art (and sound) [I'll call it presentation].\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a beautiful, polished anime. To begin with, the art style is simply amazing. The emphasis on specific colors as identification is a very good way of marketing. I have a theory that the people behind designing this anime were actually very passionate about it (I know, shocking), so they tried their absolute hardest to make it a successful franchise. Think about it: Yato is a sharp light blue, Yukine is a burning orange, and Hiyori is a bright pink. Even the minor characters get their own colors. Purple, violet, green, black, red. All of them distinctly related to a specific character. This concept is further emphasized by the series' kickass OPs. All the color is flushed out to make the marketing turn into straight up art. Not to mention, the music choice is very suitable for both seasons of the anime. Delving further into the sound, the voice acting is superb. Full disclosure, I am biased; Hiroshi Kamiya is listed as a \"favorite person\" on my MAL page, but objectively speaking, I think he was well cast. He can deliver great performances as Happy Yato, Sad Yato, and everything in between. I only decided to mention Yato's voice actor since he's the one you'll be hearing the most of should you decide to watch. Overall, masterful presentation all around. Now onto the characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are charming, relatable, and well written. Almost never do they break character for the sake of the story. The characters actually grow too- all of them. It's sort of amazing how an audience can like a character both before and after they change throughout a story. If only other writers would take note of this possibility and stop making garbage exposition deliverers, the industry would be even better. I don't have much else to say, since it'd be spoiling integral parts of the story, so now into the final stretch.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nWhen I'd first watched this series when I was still a young buck. Back then, the best anime i'd seen was High School DXD because it did magical things to the state of my pants. Now, roughly 4 years later, I've decided to re-watch to see if this series was worth the 10/10 I'd originally given it. Yes, it was. Noragami and Aragoto are great anime and you definitely should watch them.",

The fight scenes are very exciting to watch. They will have you on the edge of your seats. The next arc has a lot about Yato's relationship with Nora. This was also a very good arc. I also prefer this opening to thefirst season. Aragoto only made me love Noragami more and deserves a season 3. I definitely will be collecting all the mangas.",

However, once I had exited that phase, gained more of an interest in religion (that is, stories that apply religion rather than actual beliefs themselves) so I could understand better why people liked it, and learned of the sequel's existence, I watched the whole thing on Netflix and...well let's just say Igot through Nana in the span of a week and despite Noragami's much shorter length, it took me five days to finish it. It had a lot of interesting things to it, but so much time was spent on Yukine's stuff to the point of annoyance, and the final bad guy...I don't even remember what his deal was and I doubt anyone else does either. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to the sequel since fans told me that from here on out was when the series got into the meaty stuff and unlike light novels (looking at you...not gonna bother naming names), manga actually have a tendency to do that. And you know what? They were right.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the setup from what I can only describe as an incredibly overlong prologue completed, Noragami delves more into actual character struggles with this sequel as we focus on the truth behind Bishamon's hatred for Yato, Yato's previous familiar and her new owner, and Yato himself as we learn just how important being a god with an actual shrine is to him, along with what he'd do to accomplish said goal. The series takes a darker direction in order to tackle these arcs properly, with a bunch of arc-specific characters getting the ax and the shonen-esque humor involving Yato doing something stupid and Hiyori freaking out at his actions is toned down to only a single episode and one or two moments elsewhere. Now I make a policy to not spoil major events in my reviews unless it's bad enough to the point that no one with any sense of reality would bother defending, so I can't really tell you what actually happens in the show. But I will say that it's cool to see Yato make dual-wielding cool again after Kirito rained all over Lloyd Irving's parade and will continue to do so for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the non-story related good about Aragoto is pretty much the same good that was in Noragami, so there's no point in really describing it. Characters are still fun. Animation is still nice. Soundtrack is fitting. Blablabla. Actually, I'm surprised by how much I've grown to like Noragami's cast over time. I kinda forgot everyone but Bishamon and the main trio by the time the second season hit, so it was nice for me to remember more characters' names this go around. Well okay, I still can't remember the name of the \"bad luck\" god without using Wikipedia, but at least I remember she exists now. Amazing what giving some personal flaws and having said flaws fuel arcs can do for someone, isn't it Kazuma?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Noragami over say, Jojo, is that all the shonen action and character tropes are ultimately an accessibility tool for the mainstream crowd in order to explore actual religious lore and provide serious takes on what Japanese gods are being treated like today rather than the reverse the latter utilizes with its movie tributes and obsession with poses. Having said that, Noragami still hasn't fixed its problem of occasionally making things a little too accessible to the point that it sacrifices story impact. Whilst the Bishamon arc has been hyped as one of they greatest story moments of the series, I honestly prefer the one where Yato visits Izanami and causes Hiyori to almost forget him mainly because the former had a tendency to pull its punches right when it needed to squeeze the trigger. Gonna be hard to say why without spoilers, but basically a giant portion of the conflict was based around a stupid misunderstanding, the character who caused said misunderstanding to happen got off with a slap on the wrist after everything was over, and the true bad guy of that arc turned incredibly generic in the end, Tiger and Bunny-style. It's the biggest, but by no means the only time when Noragami seems to struggle with meshing the desires of the casual crowd and the elitist crowd into something that'll please them both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd similar to another shonen action anime that delved into serious issues, Tokyo Ghoul, whilst the action is pretty good for the most part, I'm not a fan of how shonen-esque it can be at times. You know, with all the cheesy lines and exposition mixed into all the fighting, along with how they stretch the fights out by revealing a loophole that was never hinted at before? It's like if you made a movie adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days that tried to impart the impact of Phileas Fogg's grand adventures through ludicrous karate fights with some of the locals he encounters...oh wait.\\n\\n\r\nBut those faults are hardly wait throwing the anime into Hell for, especially with everything else the show has going for it. In a medium where good follow-ups are harder to find than a presidential candidate that doesn't come with enough asterisk marks attached to their speeches to fill up ten pages in Microsoft Word, Noragami Aragoto should be held as a good standard for how anime sequels should be. Don't give us more of the same. Use what you had previously for something new, preferably bigger and better. And before people comment on this, I mean bigger and better whilst still retaining focus in the vein of something like The Dark Knight. Not the retardedly unfocused bigger and better that Resident Evil devolved into with its sixth installment.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I'm still not ready to consider Noragami a great anime as of yet. It feels like there's a bunch of cannons within its narrative that it has yet to fire, and whilst the ones that it has fired are quite loud, there's a bit of an annoying \"okay, that's enough for today\" after-feel to them by the time the series ends, right down to the main trio still having their relationship be the same as always, along with an incredibly unsubtle sequel hook that I am neither excited nor opposed to seeing what comes of it. The show is fun, but by the time it was over, I was already set to move on to the next thing with zero inclination to give it a second look. But who knows? Maybe the next Noragami sequel will change my mind. And then maybe the Republicans will stop denying the existence of global warming when the incredibly large amounts of evidence is shoved in their faces.",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto is the second season of the fun, never boring, and sometimes intellectual and deep Shounen anime Noragami. \r\nI'm going to keep this short, because honestly, this isn't \"psycho pass\"; There is no need for an essay on why this show is good, or whether its worth your time. \r\nThis is an anime for people who want to watch something light, something akin to a fighting Shounen, but with a little more depth, far less length, and some cool characters to befriend on the way. \r\nI personally hate Shounen, for the most part. Things with as many episodes as Bleach or Naruto don't needto exist, and honestly, they are basically like soap operas. \\n\\n\r\nSo, it was a nice suprise to find out that Noragami is actually quite short. Both the first and second season make up about as many episodes as one normal single season of this type of show. Shorter shows make it easier to jump in, as compared to longer running shounen that seem to have no end in sight. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami also has an interesting, unique story, and even though the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could have been, they are all fairly unique, and undergo many changes throughout the course of these two seasons. (FYI: the manga fleshes out the characters perfectly, and has a far deeper, psychological backdrop.)\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles things like coming of age, depression, and self-worth- so there is some depth and seriousness to the show. The fighting scenes often seem to be there, more than anything, to keep the story interesting and break up the scenes of the deep relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis season actually seemed to have more fights and conflict then the last, and the extra darkness/ uncertainty fit in perfectly with the world building that occurred during the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, but I fell in love with the characters enough to look past the rushed anime ending, and the (compared to the manga) sometimes thin plot. But, at least it didn't try to outdo itself, only to be full of plot holes like many anime today. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that knew what it wanted to be, and it achieved just that- a lighthearted, world weary shounen about a stray god, looking for belonging, and his rag-tag group of friends and accomplices along the way. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate:\\n\r\nAfter finishing the manga, I only wish that the show received more funding so that it could have fleshed itself out as well as the manga did. Sadly, it's been years since the last episode, so the chances of the story catching up to the manga and having a proper ending are slim to none. \\n\\n\r\nIt really is a shame, because Noragami's manga has such a great, life-affirming story, and the two women who write it under the joint pseudonym \"Adachitoka\" make such a wonderful team.  They deserved better, and so did Noragami.  Let's hope the anime industry stops churning out fast food garbage and stops cutting funding for shows before they have a chance to properly end. We see it too much these days...",

More past stories has been revealed, more plot twists will eventually unfold. Well, I can say that the plot \"Escalated quickly\" *insert that escalated quickly meme here*. I mean Noragami's story line is immediately exposed to the anime, no fillers at this moment. Episode 7's preview made me love it even more.\r\nI was dumbfounded when I watched Episode 8 zzz ASDFGHJKL! I wanna curse but, I can't. The new arc is. just. so. NOOOO!! IT CAN'TBE! NOOOOOOOO!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11 is just, PLAIN AWESOOME! ASDFGHJK. CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE zzz I almost died in ****'s speech. But, the ending is such a cliffhanger. It definitely needs a 3rd season. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 11/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just so asdfghjl! It's way too coooool! The animations fight scenes, the animated characters, and all! It's way too coooool! I mean, I'm pretty judgmental in terms of art, if the art doesn't look good, there's a huge probability that I'll not watch the anime. But this anime? With no second thoughts, I started watching this anime since the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nStarting from the first season until this season, the OST of Noragami never failed to amuse me. Especially the opening soundtracks, I just don't know. I like it! XD I even have the Opening Song in my iTunes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made. Some of them even changed personalities in this season. Specially ******, I hate him. But I won't say it in order to make this review \"Spoiler Free\" :p And also, I highly ship Yato x Hiyori xD (ep. 2 I guess) wait til' you see it :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Noragami hype is still the same as the first season! I really enjoy this season. Cool storyline, plot twists, fight scenes, and \"same old jokes\". Some jokes are repeated from the first season but, I still like it ;) \\n\r\nI REALLY LOVE THIS",

            "content": "Amongst the many sequels I've seen from 2015's offerings, the biggest and most welcome improvement I've seen would be from Noragami Aragoto. Even though I still like the 1st season, the fact remains that all we got was a basic introduction the characters before Angsty the Ghost and some boring filler antagonist took over the 2nd half. This time, Noragami brings out the big bats and swings hard, real hard.\r\nOn top of doing what any good shonen ought to past the introductory phase by introducing higher stake conflicts (something I felt was sorely lacking in the 1st season) this season gives even more focus tothe Gods themselves and what it takes to have that kind of status when imbued with emotions shared by the people that worship theme on top of their flawed ideologies. This, of course, means that Yukine and Hiyori feel more like they're a part of the periphery this time around, but I don't think this equates to either of them getting the shaft at all. Whilst I\u2019m not a big fan of seeing Hiyori play the role of damsel in distress, her presence in the 2nd half of the season as the primary reason for Yato keeping himself tethered to a life of peace (away from bad influences like Yato's Nora, who alway seems to be ready to lead Yato astray) and even to his very existence is enough for me. She feels more like an accessory to Yato than an interesting character in her own right, but she\u2019s a fine accessory nonetheless. Despite also not being a central character in either of the arcs this season, Yukine has still come a pretty long way from the lad who only thought about his misfortunes. Anyone who found themselves at their wit's end as a result of his endless whining will be happy to find out that Yukine has permanently washed all the salt out of his boipussy. I think it\u2019s also worth noting how characters like Yato, Bishamon and Ebisu have a lot more worth looking into because of their long, tragic histories. The Gods ought to be the ones driving the story here, and that's what this second season gets. \\n\\n\r\nThis time, we're split between two arcs. The 1st is centered around a mobilizing threat within Bishamon's ranks, consisting of scores of regalia picked up over the years. What made this arc work is the way in which it is driven by the flaws of the characters, and forces them to come terms with those flaws. Bishamon's main flaw being her Mother Theresa-esque impulses that compel her to collect as many needy regalia like some kind of compulsive cat hoarder. She lacked the proper means to properly shower love upon the many she has taken in, yet continues to bear the physical side-effects of maintaining a link with so many fallible souls. Kugaha, the antagonist of this arc, and one of Bishamon's most trusted regalia works as some kind of master manipulator of sorts in the way he schemes to eliminate everything between him and the creation of his idealized version of his master. The idea behind his character is a very interesting one. His motives aren't selfish, as he treats his actions as if they're bitter but necessary pills for Bishamon to swallow. The arc also highlights a lot of the problems with the God/regalia system as Kuguha is always able to use loopholes as workarounds for his heinous acts. We also learn a great deal about Kazuma (a character who appeared in the 1st season yet didn't leave much of an impression) and his complicated history with Bishamon and the burden he carries as her exemplar, which makes an already good arc even better, If their's anything wrong with this arc, then it's the fact that the way it wraps up was not quite as impactful as it should have been, as the consequences for the chaos that was the climax weren't quite there. A painful lesson for the main characters of a story ought to be painful for the audience as well, and I think Noragami Aragoto let me down a little in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have as much to say about the following arc as it didn't quite have the emotional highs of Bishamon's story, but it remained fairly strong from beginning to end nonetheless. The 2nd half of this season focuses on a newly introduced God, Ebisu, one of the Seven Gods of fortune (the real Ebisu, not that pink-haired, disaster-bringing piece of waifu material). Bishamon's arc made it clear that no one can pass judgment a God. Ebisu's arc, however, makes it clear that law only applies to those of the Near Shore, and that under the scrutiny of the heavens, a God must tread carefully. Historically speaking, Ebisu is a God that is prone to making bold moves (as is proven by the fact that he has a reputation of being killed and reincarnated for more regularly than his fellow deities). As a result, his current incarnation is not afraid to break the ironclad laws even Gods must abide by with his fascination with the idea of controlling phantoms. Initially framed as an antagonist, through his interactions with Yato, we get a much better picture of what Ebisu is aiming for and the type of God he really is. Speaking of Yato, he also gets some much-needed development with this storyline, as in the previous arc he was more of a supporting character necessary for getting the plot moving. Here we get a much fuller picture of not only the God he once was, but the God he wants to become. In doing so, Norgami's already likable lead character make his leap into being truly lovable here. \\n\\n\r\nWith the story lines presented this season, I say that the combination of Bones and Adachitoka (the original mangaka) lead to the creation of something that soundly nails all of the requirements expected of a worthwhile sequel. Compounding all of the emotional devastation, is Taku Iwasaki's return as the composer. Once again his distinctive South Asian influences are instantly identifiable, and the fantastic composition and music selection are always welcome additions to any scene at hand. Not only that but the opening theme, Kyouran Hey Kids! is cool as hell. Whilst obviously not without its share of blemishes (a couple of questionable decisions script-wise on top of what I described with Bishamon's arc and the fact the art quality dips somewhat in later episodes), there are still a lot of reasons to look forward to another season. I just hope it won't take so long to announce this time!",

            "content": "Fall 2015 was a season filled to the brim with disappointments.  Things like the failed trio of shows developed by Silver Link to other spinoffs and shows that just didn't really get up there in terms of quality.  Thankfully, Bones was able to provide us a second adaptation to the Noragami series to make up where the other shows failed or didn't do as proficiently.  \r\nStory: Aragato, as I will refer to this second season of Noragami as, continues the story of the our titular main trio of characters, Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine as they continue fighting Phantoms and dealing with variousgodly issues.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story standpoint, Aragato picks up directly where the first season ended, moving onto two more arcs, the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs, where the show puts more focus on those characters rather than our main cast.  What makes this season different than the first one is how more developed the world is.  More of the world of gods is introduced to us, as well as the backstory to previously unknown developments in the first season, including who Yato is (kind of), and what was up with Bishamon's boundless hatred towards Yato.  \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that makes this season better is the fact that the show really puts focus on Yato as a character, as the arcs that are presented here really put emphasis onto Yato as a character and really develop him as he works his way up the proverbial 'corporate ladder' in order to become an important god.  Not only for Yato though, the story arcs that are presented also develop the characters that they're named after; the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs.  These gods in addition get quite a bit of attention and really make sense.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the big issue that I have with this show is the fact that the show didn't really put much emphasis on Hiyori or Yukine.  Sure, the show was never really about either one of them personally, but as members of the main cast, they weren't really all THAT important in context, and because the show focused on Yato primarily, they were shelved off to the side most of the time.  Also, the last episode wasn't really all that grand.  It just kinda trailed off after everything happened.  I know the climax happened before, but it just seemed like it was just leading into another season which I do hope we get, cause this story is really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Character development\\n\r\n+  Interesting story arcs\\n\r\n-  Kind of a bland end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, the characters for Noragami are more or less split into characters that carry a lot of weight for the show, or just simply add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, we have Yato, the main protagonist in this entire Japanese god story.  Reprising his role as the Delivery God, Yato himself takes a huge brunt of development in this story, particularly in the second half, as he aids the two featured gods in this season with their issues and problems.  Yato changes, he changes over the course of the entire season so much that you the growth really becomes apparent from episode to episode.  It's great change that is really appreciated because you don't get to see the amount of development or attention he gets all that much anymore.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters that deserve mention are Ebisu and Bishamon.  As the two other gods that take the main role in this season, both of these gods have issues and major problems that Yato spends the entire arc fixing and helping.  In addition to Yato changing, these gods of fortune are shown to alter themselves as time goes on, growing alongside our main character, creating a change that is both noticeable and pleasant to watch.  (Sadly, I can't say how or why because...spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nThe one problem I have about this season comes with the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both are sort of shafted to the sidelines.  Both of these characters while extremely important in the first season, don't really have all that much of an impact as a whole in Aragato.  They're important to some extent, adding to the series since they are the two most important people to Yato, but in terms of importance and development, they don't really contribute to that aspect all too much.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters for the most part serve a similar role to Hiyori and Yukine.  Since they are more or less related to the respective gods that they are associated with, (Like Kazuma to Bishamon), their change or role in the series stems off from that part about them and really nothing else.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since they're supporting cast, yet they still take a good foothold and have quite a lot of importance in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good character development for featured gods\\n\r\n+  Good supporting cast\\n\r\n-  Most of the Main cast gets kind of shafted...\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The animation for Aragato was produced by Studio Bones, and as such, hosts a fantastic  artstyle that reflects the style of the series.  The artwork is very clean and holds both a mystical and eerie tone to it, as the Phantoms and Yomi both have that feel to it.  \\n\\n\r\nin addition, the fluidity of the battle scenes and the appearance of the more magical aspects (like huge magical rings) are both outstanding to look at.  While maybe not as fantastic as other things in terms of staggering beauty in terms of fight scenes like other fight scenes in recent years, but it's still great to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, clean art\\n\r\n+ Fight scene fluidity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Like last season, Noragami employed a rock band to give us once again, another great OP by the name of \"Hey Kids\" by the Oral Cigarettes which is not only an action heavy song that fits with the visuals of the OP, but is also very memorable and quite addicting to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand doesn't really fit with the show as it sounds...rather happy and joyful.  It's pretty memorable and it's a good song but...it doesn't really fit Noragami.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great and memorable songs\\n\r\n-  ED doesn't really fit...\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I enjoy Noragami.  As a series, it boasts a lot of connection to Shintoism and has great and enjoyable characters in addition to a very engaging plot that never deviates from what it wants to do.  It's a consistently great series that I very much enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a series that never fails to impress me.  There are virtually no flaws with it as for me, it never fails to engage me into its plot and throughout the whole series, I never lost any interest in watching it.  It gripped me in and I was always happy to see another epsiode come in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both really never make too much of an impact in this season.  Sure they are in the show and they help move the plot along quite frequently and well, but they just felt a lot less important this season and as such, I was a bit disappointed simply because they didn't have as much impact on the plot as they did before.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami as a series is one that I would recommend to watch.  It's a very well written story that I feel is just good period, something that you don't normally see with a lot of anime these days.  It's not without its flaws, but they're not so glaring that they would hinder the watching of the series.  That being said, only watch Aragato after the first season because it wouldn't really make sense to watch season 2 before season 1.",

            "content": "A bond between friends of any amount can be strong when you have shared all of your interests, strengths and weaknesses to each other to help understand one another. Similar to how friendship is portrayed in story, a convincing friendship involving people that try to fight off whatever conflicts they must face can be an emotional roller coaster of an experience. Sometimes this can be accomplished by simply adding enough time for us to take in the fact that they have grown together as friends before the inevitable climax. At first I was loving this friendship that Noragami presented in its first season, now I\u2019vegravitated towards them in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nMy love for Noragami has always been for the characters. I\u2019ve always loved their charisma, high energy shenanigans, and great chemistry that they create from their dialogue and actions. Not only did the writing serve a part in making this a reality, but also the talented voice cast that honed their voices for their roles to make each character distinctive and memorable. Now with Aragoto, things have started to change dramatically, to say the least. There is less comedy and more dramatic story arcs than in the previous season which was, for the most part, pretty light-hearted; mostly due to the jokey protagonist, Yato. Which is probably my only big issue with this season being as I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the serious plot elements of the 1st season as much as the comedy bits. I wished there was a bit more of it in this one than just serving it mostly on the first three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaint, I actually did find myself enthralled by how they did justice to the serious undertones of the series. My favorite main story arc, in particular, was the first one involving Bishamon and her regalia. The reason why is the fact that the story arc actually brings something new to the series that shifts a character into being three-dimensional rather than one that is one-note. I know the reason why she has a place with the story involving Yato because of her dark past, so her being a part of the story makes sense at adds a layer of depth to her that was desperately needed. Heading off after that arc is the biggest one in the season involving Yato confronting the demon\u2019s of his past. I felt as though this wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as I hoped it to be. There were parts that felt really rushed that didn\u2019t feel like a natural progression of Yato being a killing machine after being taken away from his friends. Not a bad arc to go through, but it could have been better paced with a few more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami has proven itself worthy of being a solid action anime with its spectacular artwork and animation. I\u2019ve always loved the type of color palettes the studio used to create a visual atmosphere of different kinds. Whether it is bright and colorful when the series is generally comedic and goofy or dark and cryptic whenever there is a dark and sinister moment to help gravitate the viewer into a distinctive mood. Of course this mood is also helped by the talented voice cast who do their job splendidly well, with Hiroshi Kamiya as Yato doing one of the best roles in his entire career. In fact, the voice cast is one of the other big reasons why Yukine, Hiyori, and Yato\u2019s chemistry works because the actors all play off each other naturally.\\n\\n\r\nAs multiple sequels keeping trudging along these past seasons, Noragami Aragoto has done the series a favor of improving previous problems I had with the story by adding in one that felt like it had some depth to it. There are still some minor issues that keep it from being the magnificence of what many might have hoped for. That all comes down to what they will do next. Hopefully one with more laughs and less dreariness.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "TAKE MY 5 YEN!\r\nThe thrilling sequel to the ever popular shounen that took the world by storm, Noragami Aragoto is definitely a step up from its prequel. It takes a much more serious approach to the themes of god and phantoms, and also reveals more about the mysterious Yatogami's past. Despite being much lower on the comedy aspect than its prequel, the intensity and suspense of its thrilling plot and action more than makes up for it.\r\nIn fact, I can agree that the Noragami franchise is a perfect mix of action, comedy, and drama, and truly shows what a shounen anime can be when doneright. It's jokes are hilarious when they occur, the drama is incredibly impactful and will bring tears to your eyes, the action is hardcore and intense, and there are even some really gorey and horror-like moments that will surprise you. Noragami is one of the few shows that can execute so many themes well!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great mix of everything that makes a shounen good.\\n\r\n- Great characters that are chock full of development and likable characteristics. Yato is a great lead character!\\n\r\n- A very interesting world and depictions of gods and spirits.\\n\r\n- Intense and engaging plot, full of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Pacing is fairly rushed at some points.\\n\r\n- Art and character designs may be good, but the action scenes can be somewhat of a letdown at parts.\\n\r\n- Some plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nUnlike the first season, this season splits its story into two, more serious arcs. The first arc deals heavily on Yato's relationship with Bishamon, as well as the history between them. The second arc deals with Yato's rise as a god, as well as his relationship with Nora (or Hiiro), whatever you wanna call her. Both of these arcs have extremely dark, dramatic, and highly thrilling moments. The uncovering of Yato's past is always taken in a really interesting way, as the more you dive into his past, the deeper you want to go. Despite having less comedy, the story of this season is much more intriguing, and the stakes are always shown to be really high.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs and artwork of this series is incredibly top notch. The animation is also relatively good, however, sometimes it gets a little lazy during some action scenes. There isn't that much high quality choreography, but even so, the artwork and the atmosphere that it gives off is enough to pull you into the action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is incredibly catchy, to the point where I never skipped it. The OST is also hype generating, especially during action scenes. However, the OST isn't anything remarkably special either. It's good and it supports the intensity of the show, but it doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nYato is probably the most moe man on earth. He is incredibly carefree and childish, and saying he has a mind of his own is an understatement. However, despite his seemingly innocent personality, his backstory is full of death and darkness. You would never expect such a happy person to have such a dark backstory, but Yato's backstory is incredibly dark and thrilling as well. Yukine is also a really good character due to his ability to redeem himself multiple times throughout the series. At first he is pretty annoying, seemingly spoiled and stubborn, but he has a good heart and means well, and proves that to the world in a spectacular fashion. Hiyori is also an incredibly lovable character, as she constantly helps Yato and Yukine through thick and thin. These three characters together make an incredibly colorful cast, full of amazing character interactions and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI definitely liked Noragami Aragoto more than the first season of Noragami. The story was really engaging and it was an amazing thrill ride. It also left a lot of potential for a third season, whenever that comes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nDefinitely something you must watch if you have already watched the first season of Noragami! It's an example of a great shounen series with a lot going for it!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: You, who desecrate this Land of the Weaboos! With my advent, I, Yatogami, lay waste with the Sekki and expel thy filthy casualness! --- Rend!\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Indirect Spoilers\r\nI just finished watching this, and it\u2019s amazing! Don\u2019t take my word for it, tho, lol, but I just really love the well-outlined plot and character development! While I find it unfortunate that some of the featured characters end up having to back up later on (specifically Hiyori & Bishamon), how the plot flowed and got the characters was wonderful! It\u2019s been quite a long time since I got to scream while watching or reading like that, ahaha,,,\r\nHnnngh I\u2019m running out of things to say. Well... some flaws I\u2019d like to point out is\r\n1. Hiyori\u2019s character. It\u2019s nice and all, and luckily nottoo pressed in my opinion, but I feel like she haven\u2019t really developed much as a character at all. Sure, her arc\u2019s already done with, so there\u2019s not much need, but wasn\u2019t her role generally just being Yato\u2019s motivation and reminder to live and stay justified? Her clich\u00e9 bath scenes are starting to get a little tiring, too, even if it lacks fanservice (I mean, we literally only see whatever\u2019s above her chest, no sideview of the naked butt or something, see). Just... it could be better ^^\\n\\n\r\n2. Clich\u00e9 reactions to angsty horrible things. How many times has we seen a character or two let out a taken-aback gasp as they lean forwards, stretching their hand forwards as whatever just happened causes their eyes to turn shineless? The shineless eyes themselves are a bit repetitive at any case. Still, a lot of horrific things happened, so it\u2019s pretty understandable.\\n\\n\r\n3. The switching between Hiyori\u2019s perspective and Yato\u2019s perspective when Yato was stuck in... well, you know. The anime could\u2019ve at least showed one perspective first, not switch back and forth. It slightly kills the mood to see Yato wringing in blight only to switch back to Hiyori laughing with her friends and then getting angsty again. Just saying,,,\\n\\n\r\n4. The pushed YaTori (Yato x Hiyori). Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do like YaTori; it\u2019s pretty cute and is a good ship with how it develops and works and all! It\u2019s just that it\u2019s a little... forced, maybe? Anyone who watched this could tell Hiyori really cared for Yato (Yukine, too, but Yato especially) and meant the world to Yato in return. It kind of came to the point where I felt a little bad for the people who don\u2019t like that ship... \\n\\n\r\nMmm I can\u2019t really think of anything more significant, but basically, it\u2019s just the notable clich\u00e9s that bother me. I\u2019m not the kind of person who dwells on flaws more than pros in an enjoyable anime, though, especially with an anime t h i s good! I mean, wicked character development! Intense plot! Cliffhangers that\u2019ll make me scream! Cryable scenes (not that I cried much, but as a person lacking empathetic and affectionate feelings, I still cried and got a little upset a couple of short times-)! The lack of difficulty in understanding emotions and what\u2019s going on! The admirable devotion & loyalty the characters have! \\n\\n\r\nJust,,, certainly recommendable! This is something I can look forward to showing my sister once I start rewatching the Noragami series with my sister (since it\u2019ll be her first time watching it)! Hope you enjoyed this series, too, if you already watched it! <3",

            "content": "Wow. What an epic rollercoaster ride. After finishing Noragami, I was so hooked that I just had to watch the second season ASAP. I\u2019ve found the cute, quirky moments have gotten way less frequent in this feature as we figure out more about Yato\u2019s past and the show has a dark and sombre feeling for the majority of the episodes, embedded with fast-paced, visually stunning battle scenes. The opening song is absolutely addictive also.\r\nFirstly, I would like to talk about how the group dynamics between Yato, Hiyori and Yukine have shifted in this season. Yato appears to be getting more reliant on Hiyori to helphim get over how much he hates his past and keep from becoming the person he used to be. I feel like Yato is more devoted to protecting Hiyori\u2019s admiration and memories of him as a God, rather than the emotional development of their relationship being the focus. I say this, because for a vast majority of the show, Yato and Hiyori are apart and they need each other, because their bonds are tied to their identities (Yato\u2019s as a God and Hiyori as a half-phantom). Hiyori feels conflict over building a relationship with a admiring stranger because her familial/romantic devotion to Yato and therefore Yukine seems to be coming through in this anime, though because of their separation, all we really see with their relationship dynamics is: Yato\u2019s turmoil over involving Hiyori and Yukine in his dangerous past affairs and Hiyori\u2019s desire to ensure that Yato stays alive and her God-Regalia-phantom family stays intact. So in summary, there is not a huge focus on the development of Yato-Hiyori relationship growth (romantic or otherwise), but the Yato-Yukine relationship really undergoes some major changes. Yukine shows his devotion towards being there for Yato and making sure that Hiyori can stay protected by aiming to improve his magic and keeping the group strong. I just missed the Yato-Yukine-Hiyori unity as a group and would love to see them fighting their demons together.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, some cute Hiyori-Yato scenes are definitely sprinkled in there..\\n\r\nSpeaking of improving magic, I forgot to mention this in the last review, but Hiyori can sometimes feel like a useless character. When she knows that she will be encountering more evil phantoms/Gods if she stays with Yato, then why doesn\u2019t she work on improving her fighting skills as a phantom? Her role in this season did not really win me over because she was most of the time either scared of Yato disappearing, was looking for Yato or was pretty much just standing and watching during the action scenes. It was like she was the cheerleading mom of the group and I was not impressed. Especially the scene in which she attempted to fight the phantom, ripped her skirt and then that suddenly meant that she could fight no longer. I mean REALLY.\\n\\n\r\nNow, moving away from my dissatisfaction with the changes in the group dynamics compared to the first season, the plot of Noragami Aragoto really takes the cake. It is basically set up into two major complications; the first involving answers to why Bishamon hates Yato and the truth behind Yato\u2019s seemingly dark actions of the past. I must say though that this plot complication wouldn\u2019t even have existed if Kazuma (Bishamon\u2019s Regalia) had been honest to her eons ago, which kind of irked me that he wasn\u2019t able to be truthful to save all the drama that followed as a result. Putting the validity of the plot complication aside, I really preferred the first six episodes as it was back to the same old teamwork dynamics with Hiyori captured (she really needs to get more powerful) and Yato and Yukine coming to her rescue.\\n\\n\r\nThe second complication is where a whole secret door to the world of Noragami which you didn\u2019t even know existed is unlocked. Here we are exposed to the colloquy of Gods where all the powerful and remembered Gods gather to discuss heavenly affairs and the plot complication of someone tampering with the phantoms of the underworld is raised. During this part of the show, Yato is also separated from Hiyori and Yukine which I absolutely hated and we are exposed to how absolutely vile Nora is.\\n\\n\r\nIn the final part of the show, it focuses on Yato\u2019s allure of the dark past and how he struggles to choose justice as the quality which he will adopt as a God. The focus on the character of Ebisu really didn\u2019t strike my fancy as well, because the secrets that I wanted answered about the ties of Yato to some briefly mentioned characters like \u2018Father\u2019 were taken up by screen time from him. He provided a pivotal role for Yato\u2019s growth, but I would have appreciated more about Yato\u2019s past.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes were better than ever before and my eyes were glued to the screen. They were especially stunning as multiple Gods including Kofuku and Bishamon got involved and the fighting was so fluid and just plain old bad ass that it did not leave me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I cannot dislike this anime because the things I used to love are still there and some improvements from the first season in some areas are also present, BUT a lot of things took an unwanted turn for me in this season. This is still highly recommended though, because it opens up the world of Noragami so much more\u2026and I absolutely love the world now. I am invested. Oh, and there is a major plot-twist, cliff hanger at the end which is seriously urging me to read the manga. I am certainly hoping that Yato and Hiyori sort out their feelings in the manga\u2026*sigh*",

Sometimes they could end up as passable or even fantastic works of fiction (i.e Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Darker than Black) or they could end up as complete failures (i.e Zetsuen no Tempest). Noragami on the other hand fits in between those; a mediator amidst the good and the bad. I still remember the first season quite well but as an urban fantasy shonen, it did not do anything out of the ordinary and felt a bit too similar to other shows of the same demographic. There were a lot ofinteresting concepts and some great character interactions but the show never fully explored those in greater detail. Most of the time the show was mainly filler and the story arc that was given to viewers was an anime original and rushed beyond belief. With Aragoto however, Bones finally catches up to its source material and adds more substance that should have existed in the first season beforehand.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aragoto takes place after the events of the first season. Viewers should be aware that this is a direct sequel to the first season and newcomers stumbling into this with little to no knowledge of that will be confused and lost. The best thing about the story this time is that there is less focus on the various \"jobs\" our main heroes are given and more of an overarching storyline this time around. There is little fooling about this time around as the story is given considerable focus. The show is split into two arcs, which I like to call the \"Bishamon arc\" and the \"Ebisu arc\" respectively. Both of them are quite well presented in their own way with the first one being a rather intense insight into Bishamon's character and her conflict with Yato and the second arc introduces a new character called Ebisu into the mix and revolves around a new world known as \"The Underworld.\" Both of these arcs have higher stakes and are more tension filled compared to the first season which I highly appreciate. However problems are visible in both. There were many moments where the writers seemed to have pulled out explanations from their asses in order to justify a certain event happening on screen that would seem implausible at first glance. The biggest issue I had was that they don't seem to be any different from other shonen I've watched. A lot of them in fact are rather predictable and lacking in worldbuilding or theme exploration. The human world is still given some focus, though not as much as the first season, and just feels bland and dull compared to the world of the gods.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters thankfully have a lot more development this time around. Yato's and Bishamon's backstories are explored in much greater depth than ever before and both of them actually develop as characters. In fact a lot of the characters from the first develop. The bond between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori feels a lot more palpable this time around and you could see that they have become much closer as friends. Yukine in particular grows from a whiny kid into a headstrong and confident individual who is more devoted to his master than ever. However this is not true for every character. Kofuku and her regalia for example still feel shallow in contrast to our main heroes and the show also tries to introduce more and more characters as the episodes fly by, most of which get little to no screentime. But so far characterization is an improvement and I can spot a third season coming soon which hopefully will improve these newly introduced entities.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty much on par for Bones standards. The backgrounds are very rich and detailed with a lot of them looking absolutely gorgeous. The Underworld for example is given a much needed feel of helplessness, isolation and darkness to compliment its grim atmosphere. Animation quality is usually very good in this show but the first episode has some glaring examples of distant shots of characters with practically no faces. This would annoy a lot of the viewers on their first go. Fight scenes look great with a lot of fluid movements and a nice array of supernatural moves to keep viewers enthralled. Tension is also high during many of these which should keep you on the edge of your seats. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is done by Taki Iwasaki who has incorporated a lot of eastern and middle eastern tunes to the mix. A lot of the tracks are reused from the first season which to me were incredibly pleasing to the ears. But the new tracks themselves feel completely different from Iwasaki's usual stuff and are quite forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami Aragoto is a much needed improvement to the first season in terms of pacing, character development and overall sense of progression. Sure it doesn't seem much different compared to your average shonen but fans of the first season are in for a treat, especially those who felt that the first season was lacking in terms of substance. If you have not watched the first season then I urge you to do so if you're interested in checking out Aragoto as it does a great job of introducing you to the world, its concepts and its characters.  \\n\\n\r\nNow that'll be 5 yen please.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter season 1 I was a little unsure where this season would go, but to my surprise it surpassed the first season on both story and character.\r\nThe story continues with Yato who carries on doing jobs for only 5 yen, but Bishamon is looking for revenge and wants to finally finish the fight she and Yato have had for centuries.\r\nTh story kinda paces just like a season of High School DxD as the first half concentrates on Bishamon while the second half concentrates more on Yato's past and Ebisu the God of Fortune.\r\nNow I really enjoyed both arcs, Bishamon was someone who wasunderused in the first season so concentrating on her was a good move plus you get to find out more about her character like the tortured past she has suffered and the extraordinary kindness she has for Regalia's shows she is a complex and emotional character, but it doesn't just focus on her it also focuses on Kazuma and how he is really the reason for Bishamon's suffering and not Yato, the first half really brought out the relationship between Bishamon and her Regalia's.\\n\r\nThe second half decided to concentrate more on Yato's past and Ebisu, it was interesting how Ebisu's character developed in the little time that was left in the show  and it really created some emotional moments that were very well done and you also get to see why Yato wanted to change from taking lives to saving lives so he can become a likeable God.\\n\r\nThis season was much more intense and action heavy, but this was a good thing since the fights were lacking a bit in the first season, plus we got to see more of the God's world and how it worked with their own society and we even got to see the depths of the Underworld which seemed pretty damn terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters definitely improved from the first season with soome characters who either didn't get enough screentime or were a little annoying certainly got better this season.\\n\r\nYato continued to be the lovable God we all know, but we find out his funny personality is a barrier of what truly lies within since he is a very scarred person and really wants to change his image from a God that kills to a God that saves people.\\n\r\nBishamon finally gets some concentration and you see the complex character she is, despite being a God of War she cares for her Regalia's and doesn't wish to lose them like she did before, you also see that the hatred she has for Yato is actually misplaced, but is technically what saved her life in the past.\\n\r\nEbisu who is the God of Fortune is a character that certainly throws you off, you think he is a bad guy, but really he is surprisingly a good guy as his main objective is to be a God that can protect humanity and you feel sorry for his character for what happens in the end.\\n\r\nKazuma who is Bishamon's oldest Regalia also gets some concentration as you find out he is a person full of guilt considering he was the one who turned to Yato to massacre Bishamon's clan, but he is very protective of Bishamon and wishes for her and the other Regalia's to be safe.\\n\r\nYukine and Hiyori don't get much development, but Yukine is a much better character in this series now that he has his new found loyalty to Yato and is willing to protect him and Hiyori from the threats that put them in danger, Hiyori continues to be Hiyori not much happens with her other than a few instances with another classmate, but other than that she pretty much remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is given new expansions in this series with the inclusion of the underworld which looked like somewhere you don't want to get lost in and you also get to see more of the God's realm which oddly reminded me of Asgard for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was good yet again with moments like Yato running away from Hiyori in a trash can which was a favourite of mine that worked very well, however the comedy is much less than season 1 which isn't a bad thing since the series concentrates on more serious subjects like Bishamon and Yato's past along with Ebisu's true goal as a God which had some emotional moments and had a lot of suspenseful and thrilling moments that did keep on my toes.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is also a cliffhanger at the end and this'll obviously make some people annoyed, but to me it was predictable and surprising with what it reveals and I am certainly looking forward to season 3 if it ever happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the second season was definitely better than the first every episode kept me hooked so if you enjoyed the first season then you'll definitely enjoy this season.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Noragami Aragoto. This second season did better than the first. \r\nThe story picks up after the events of the first. Yato and Bishamon are now the main focus of the first part of the story. The old hatred sparks up and events arise that cause these two to fight one another. We get to learn about all the events surrounding them and its a decent arc for lore purposes. It also has some plot holes. The gods(or at least Yato) are capable of teleportation which typically only gets used to quickly skip unimportant events, and never usedto solve issues. Gods also feel everything that their divine instruments feel, yet somehow mysteries arise around Bishamon that shouldn't be a secret to her. Maybe I am wrong or misunderstand but it feels like the gods powers are used as a convenience and never as actual power to aid them when needed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the Bishamon arc we get a quicker pace story, Hiyori granting Yato one of his wishes. Yato getting into trouble with Nora and the ending. I don't want to spoil it but the story this season was pretty well done. I enjoyed the ending episodes immensely. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound about the same as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have gotten a little more easy to listen to. Hiyori is still like Yato's more annoying Kagome. This time she had little in the way of screen time, other than a driver for certain actions. Yukine also calmed down a bit, though he did have some childish outbursts but nothing so annoying you would feel like strangling him like the first season. Yato again has some funny and great moments then gets serious and has a few really good moments towards the end. This season did a lot to tone down the annoying, but it did nothing to increase knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season more than the first, however it still felt like it could have been better. The constant annoying characters, the lack of dialogue, the constant misunderstanding and miscommunication makes it feel like force drama. The comedy was decent but not explored. The story isn't really existent, its more of the life of a god of calamity. This could have been better by simply picking a direction or even working more on the characters, simple things that even some low quality harems can do. Even after all the negatives the anime itself is still fun, and enjoyable and I'm glad I've seen it. I recommend it still, but don't go into it thinking its going to be the perfect show some make it out to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Pretty good again. Ending was great, characters a little less obnoxious, worth watching. Would recommend.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from its blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nNoragami, the first season, was actually one of the very first anime that I started following as it aired. I was a newbie back then, wondering what this strange, foreign medium had in store for me. I remember seeing the main visual for the anime \u2013 all three of them sitting atop a red-shrine entrance with the city far below and a gloomy sky at their backs. That instantly caught my attention (still does), and the anime ended up being favorable to me.\r\nNow, a few years later, with many more anime and hence more experienceunder my belt, Noragami Aragoto, the sequel to one of my starters, appears. And it\u2019s nice to know that this one holds up about just as well.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAragoto follows the first season, bringing back Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine for more god-related dilemmas. But this season, the anime splits itself up into two distinct arcs: Bishamon\u2019s arc and Ebisu\u2019s arc.\\n\\n\r\nBishamon\u2019s arc is easily the stronger of the two and, arguably, executed as well as it possibly could. As its name implies, these first six episodes revolve around Bishamon and her camp. Her role as a god of war, the Regalia she owns, and so on. Yato and his crew obviously take part \u2013 in more ways than one \u2013 but the true focus rests on the beautiful Bishamon.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s seen, however, is anything but pretty. Major backstabbing amidst Bishamon\u2019s group leads to deaths, misunderstandings, and turmoil. The loss of one of Bishamon\u2019s lesser Regalia spurs thoughts about her current, incessant \u201cgenerosity.\u201d Bishamon exiles Kazuma, her closest and oldest partner, when she learns of him aiding her sworn-enemy Yato. And Bishamon\u2019s almost-literal blind hatred for Yato made her unable to see the destruction happening within her own home.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the arc comes from the clever use of the past. In clich\u00e9 terms, history repeats itself. The destruction of Bishamon\u2019s clan happened once before, so, ironically for this god of fortune, she goes through the same misfortune again.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, a theme on pain and protection persists. Pain pushes people to react. When someone touches a hot stove, he or she pulls his or her hand away. A toothache leads to a dentist appointment. A small cut or scrap gets an equally small Band-Aid. That is, pain is often seen as something unwanted, a negative.\\n\\n\r\nBut Aragoto does not fully believe this sentiment. In the present, Bishamon suppresses her pain with medicine, rendering her unable to react to the needs of her numerous Regalia. By extension, her Regalia fake how they feel to make sure their master does not hurt, so them receiving a lack of attention continues.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Aragato argues that pain can be a positive part of life. Yes, pain hurts, but it lets one learn and understand. It\u2019s what makes people think twice about the actions they take.\\n\\n\r\nProtection has close ties to pain, for that\u2019s what people do on a regular basis: protect themselves from pain. Seatbelts are worn while driving. People sit in comfy chairs at their desks. Feather beds, not hardwood floors, are used for sleeping. Naturally, people view protection as something wanted, a positive.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, however, Aragato does not fully believe that statement. Kazuma groveling at Yato\u2019s feet protects Bishamon but leads to the destruction of hers and his family. Kugaha plotting to reincarnate Bishamon for her sake would protect her, albeit in a twisted manner. Even just Bishamon protecting as many stray souls as possible induces the problems at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, Aragoto argues that protection can be a negative. Yes, protection brings safety, but sometimes the cost to attain it cannot be justified.\\n\\n\r\nThe two ideas intertwine, creating most of the conflict of this arc. It\u2019s not until Bishamon embraces Aragoto\u2019s arguments that the conflict subsides. I.e., she accepts the pain of her family by saving them with death by her own hands, and she releases Kugaha from her protection as a sign of pity and change.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Ebisu\u2019s arc does not have the same level of execution as the first half. A lot of this weakness stems from the anime trying to do too much at once.\\n\\n\r\nLots of new ideas are created, introduced, and accepted without any basis. For instance, an extremely minor character can talk to trees, the heavens have atom bombs, and the quite-convenient Soul Call method of saving gods.\\n\\n\r\nThen the weird writing choices. Kugaha, the villain from the first half, reappears and disappears within the span of five minutes, his only purpose to prove how both weak and strong Yukine is. The whole aside with Hiyori getting kissed, and then easily getting her memories back after it turned into such a huge issue for her, was lame since none of it mattered. And the even-more-than-quite-convenient finding of Yato\u2019s true name during the Soul Call feels a bit unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nIt all comes together as sloppy. A shame, especially after the first half did so swell.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, Aragoto\u2019s second half still has many parts worth praising. The second half capitalizes on the idea of reincarnation that got introduced in the first half. Parallelism exists between the first and second half, such as with the releasing of Regalia and the inkling feelings of love between humans and gods. And even something as simple as Bishamon using Aiha in battle (the suit of armor Bishamon wears in the second half) reinforces the idea that a new leaf has been turned, a second chance given.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes are also exempt from the problems. Loneliness, not giving up, and self-discovery do not have the same nuanced construction as the first half\u2019s themes, but they still have connections. Yato, Yukine, and Hiyori are in separate plotlines (loneliness), doing their best to fight, train, or remember (not giving up) to better themselves (self-discovery).\\n\\n\r\nGranted, these details all rely on the first half setting them up, but they still help to bolster some of the weaknesses within Ebisu\u2019s arc. Plus, the series\u2019 signature comedy-and-drama mix persists. For example, Yukine, with money in his eyeballs, contemplates leaving Yato. Another example is Ebisu clumsily making eye contact with Phantoms in the underworld despite being told otherwise. Both examples demonstrate the show still knows when to and how to inject comedy at just the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, it\u2019s a tough call. A stellar first half leads into a mixed second half that\u2019s more positive than negative, leading to a generally positive narrative.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs within Aragoto are technically simple, but they \u201csay\u201d a lot about the characters. Hiyori\u2019s fading, pink tail highlights both her ghostly ability and her kindness. Yato\u2019s sharp blue eyes reflect the hardened person within. And Yukine\u2019s worker\u2019s outfit indicates the amount of effort he puts into making himself a stronger Blessed Vessel.\\n\\n\r\nBishamon and Ebisu have even better designs. Bishamon\u2019s long, blonde hair, purple eyes, and fierce expression turn her into the battle-born beauty she happens to be. Also, her professional look when she visits the heavens, with her hair in a bun and a general\u2019s outfit, is an awesome extra treat.\\n\\n\r\nEbisu, by contrast, does not stick out: short, black hair, deadened-green eyes, and a plain buttoned shirt with tie. It\u2019s quite symbolic \u2013 he constantly reincarnates, meaning his common appearance matches his repetitive life.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the rest of the art tends to be tiresome. The locations visited, such as Koufuku\u2019s home or Bishamon\u2019s castle, are not that detailed. But the second half gets the worst of it when much of the setting takes place in purple-walled caverns, eliminating any chance for artistry. Lighting at least gets played with \u2013 different colored lights and an emphasis on darkness provide the anime with opportunities for flashiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation as well does not keep up. Certain scenes, like Yato\u2019s rending or a Phantom\u2019s death, are reused. Battles include many explosions or cuts to give the illusion of fighting. And characters do not have fluid hair or eye movements unless extreme close-ups are used. Comedic moments, such as Hiyori flailing her arms or Yato jumping around, are not complete turnarounds, but they give the anime more movement than it usually used.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ED\u2019s visuals deserve a mention. The first season\u2019s ED\u2019s visuals had Hiyori running from right to left in order to catch up with Yato and Yukine. This time, the ED visuals have Yato running from left to right in order to catch up with Hiyori and Yukine. A subtle detail that puts Yato\u2019s own plight into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest aspect of Aragoto is its cast.\\n\\n\r\nMany members of the cast experience extensive change. The easiest example being Bishamon. She starts the season showcasing her multisided personality. In the heavens, she is the benevolent woman who saves wandering souls. On Earth, she is the mighty war god whose power knows no bounds. And around Yato, her seething hatred is almost disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for her hatred towards the god of calamity has been kept secret \u2013 until now. In the past, Bishamon led a different clan of people, people very similar to the ones she leads now. At some point, Bishamon began to get sick (or \u201cblighted\u201d as the lore of the anime puts it). Sickness of a god comes from Phantoms and their ilk, but it can also derive from unruly Regalia.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what presumably happens within Bishamon\u2019s old clan. As she gets sicker, her people begin to grow uneasy. Eventually, they start to blame each other, leading to infighting and mass violence.\\n\\n\r\nCue Kazuma. The audience was made aware of Bishamon\u2019s most loyal follower in the first season. Respectful, strategic, and powerful, Kazuma makes a case for being the best Regalia in existence. But, in that first season, he is seemingly in debt to Yato, the man that Bishamon hates more than anyone else alive. A strange detail that goes unexplained much like Bishamon\u2019s past. And, much like Bishamon\u2019s own reveal, comes to the surface.\\n\\n\r\nDuring that past infighting, Bishamon\u2019s clan turned into a massive, blob-like Phantom, having been consumed by their own sins. Kazuma\u2019s love for Bishamon drove him to seek out Yato \u2013 the god known for absolute destruction. Yato, thankfully, listened to Kazuma\u2019s cries. Yato arrives, easily slaying the beast. To Bishamon, however, he was not saving her or the others. To Bishamon, he killed her family.\\n\\n\r\nYato is Bishamon\u2019s (mistaken) enemy, and Yato is Kazuma\u2019s (unmistaken) savior. That\u2019s where their respective hatred and gratitude towards Yato come from, and it is their pasts and the current affairs that cause the present rift between them. Bishamon exiles Kazuma, her hatred for Yato consumes her, and Kazuma once again fails to protect his beloved. Combined with the loss of most of her clan once more, this tragic repetition of events hurts to see.\\n\\n\r\nBut said tragedy allows them to grow through a \u201cfool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\u201d mentality. Bishamon learns to take responsibility as the god she is. Rather than hating Yato to mask her own failure, which holds parallels with masking the pain from her various Regalia, she embraces her can-do-no-wrong status. She shoulders the pain and the suffering and the demise of her people, finally releasing herself from the torment and rage she has felt for all these years.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kazuma, his devotion to saving Bishamon (and the others) caused him to hurt Bishamon once more. But, as Yato says and she now understands, gods make decisions, not mistakes. Mistakes are reserved for humans like Kazuma, and that it\u2019s okay for him to make them. So she asks to have him back. And, while he knows he may mess up again in the future, he will no longer tarnish his relationship with the woman he serves. (Him hiding his face as he started to cry was a heartwarming way to end their arc, too.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the final half of the season, attention shifts away from Bishamon and Kazuma and moves towards Yato and Ebisu.\\n\\n\r\nEbisu does not initially seem to be a character worth remembering, but he proves that wrong time and again over the course of his arc. In the beginning, he comes off as evil, subduing Phantoms to bend to his will (using masks that the enemy likewise own). Such subjugations render him sick and feeble. So much so that he constantly finds himself reincarnating, passing on his knowledge and lineage to his next self.\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, Yato finds himself improving. Yukine\u2019s recent transformation and Bishamon dropping her grudge are no doubt positives. But it\u2019s his refusal to forsake Hiyori and his later breakdown after receiving his very own (dinky) shrine from her that begins to change him for the better.\\n\\n\r\nYet he unfortunately finds himself at the mercy of Nora and his father. He does their bidding, killing target after target \u2013 while slowly losing track of the time and world around him.\\n\\n\r\nLo and behold that Yato\u2019s path crosses with Ebisu in the underworld \u2013 a fitting place for the two shady men. Yet what Yato learns of the Phantom-controlling god is that he is not, in fact, out to harm the heavens. Instead, his (multi) life\u2019s work has been to find the ultimate means in controlling the Phantoms so that he may better protect humanity. I.e., he has sacrificed his position, his life, and his self for the betterment of people.\\n\\n\r\nYato can really relate to Ebisu\u2019s path since he has taken a similar one. Being the \u201cbad guy\u201d for Bishamon this season, the \u201cbad guy\u201d for Yukine last season, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEven more striking is how Yato can see himself in Ebisu. Yato has almost always been controlled by others: Nora, the heavens, and so on. So when Ebisu seemingly does not have a sense of self, that he believes he has no say in the life he leads since he \u201cshould\u201d inevitably reincarnate like all of the others before him, Yato empathizes with the god completely.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what makes Ebisu\u2019s shift in thought and tragic death so moving. It\u2019s not just Ebisu finally realizing that he wants to live and carve his own path only to have his life immediately taken from him. It\u2019s also Yato seeing someone with a truly good intent, someone that he somewhat understands, lose his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe outcome affects him severely. He laments to (the now little) Ebisu about how much stronger of a person Ebisu is compared to himself. He astonishingly releases Nora, the Regalia he has had for ages, from him, representing the new chapter in his life he wishes to unfold. And, with Yukine and Hiyori\u2019s help, he discovers what he wants to do with his life to bring about his and others\u2019 happiness: destroying Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nBishamon, Kazuma, Ebisu, and especially Yato demonstrate the nice execution of Aragoto\u2019s characters. Yukine and Kugaha join their camp, too. Yukine upgrades to a so-called Blessed Vessel, he trains under Kazuma, and he confronts his master. As for Kugaha, his sincere yet conniving plot to \u201chelp\u201d Bishamon has him become a main antagonist that the audience can both loathe and pity. (Him getting replaced by the anonymous heavens and the queen of the underworld was a clear step down.)\\n\\n\r\nThe only characters that have notable problems are Nora and Hiyori.\\n\\n\r\nFor Nora, she has a deep affection (perhaps obsession) with Yato. Despite how rudely he treats her, she always comes back to his side no matter what. But she rarely interacts with the other characters in the anime, and the miniscule backstory (given through quick, single-shot flashbacks) leaves her character in a rough spot.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori, though, has it even worse. The first arc has the excuse that she was not a major player in the festivities (besides acting as blackmail towards Yato). The second arc, however, does not have the same excuse. Her conflict revolves around her forgetting Yato and Yukine, blaming arrogance on her part. In essence, her problem matches Nora: She does not interact enough with everyone else to see change. Indeed, she more or less goes back to being the same person following her recollection of memories, and, besides yelling Yato\u2019s (fake) name a lot, she minimally impacts the proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAragoto\u2019s opening track looks to its first season\u2019s OP for inspiration, taking on the same cool vibe (and visuals). While the lyrics tread into silly territory (\u201cI swear I respect the hero!!\u201d), the catchiness of the beat and the background choir make the piece a nice lead-in and addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the ending track looks back at the original ED. But, dissimilar to the OP, the ED is as phenomenal as can be. The calm, joyful start, followed by the relaxed middle, and ending with the frantic yet optimistic tone, all the while laced with some strong vocal work, create a track that is emotional and sweet and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the sounds within Aragoto aim for ambiance. Signature tracks like the stepping, spooky chant or the chimed, techno one work to make the atmosphere as mysterious or as lighthearted as needed. Plus, the extra touches, like the handling and usage of Yato\u2019s swords and the broken speech of the Phantoms, help to make the anime that much more well-rounded.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, voice acting sees nice performances if only because the cast has many an opportunity to strut their stuff. Hiroshi Kamiya as Yato speaks both humorously and emotionally at just the right moments. Miyuki Sawashiro as Bishamon cries from the mental anguish she experiences. And Ryotaro Okiayu as Ebisu utters his (previous life\u2019s) last line in a way that could sway any heart.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI was quite impressed with the first arc of this season. So much going on both with the narrative and the characters that it was almost unfair. Lots of drama, of course, but the anime always managed to sneak in some comedy whenever it could, like when Yato was sending passive-aggressive messages to Hiyori\u2019s phone about Yukine because he was worried about the boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half was a toss-up.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, that ending scene with Ebisu and Yato\u2019s talk with the young boy afterwards got to me. Not totally crying, but I could feel the beginnings of it in my chest.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the whole aside with the one dude (who, turns out, is actually Yato\u2019s father in disguise) kissing Hiyori made me quite frustrated since I accept nothing less than Hiyori getting together with Yato. Thankfully, she was not interested at all, going so far as to rub her mouth with the back of her hand. Just that small gesture made me happy to see.\\n\\n\r\nBut none of that had to happened if they Hiyori would have been with Yukine and Yato. Which leads into my biggest complaint with this season: the main three were not together enough. Yes, none of the show would have happened if they were always together, but them being as distant with each other as they were made for less laughs, less interactions, and overall less entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto does well for itself. The story and the characters are not all perfect, but they have their strong points. As does the music. However, the unimpressive art and the characters splitting up does unwanted harm. Hopefully this one\u2019s main visual will evoke that same sense of wonder years from now\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, stellar first half gives way to a more-positive-than-negative second half\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, bland artistic direction, nice character designs, okay actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Bishamon, Kazuma, Ebisu, and Yato find strength, but Hiyori and Nora do not\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, great ED, nice OST, and nice VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, emotional moments are weighed down by frustrating and missing ones\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

The history is interesting enough, starting discovering Yato's past and that of Bishamon, though there were some chapters that turned out to be heavier, everything was enough good. The this animation well and Noragami's soundtrack always gives to speak (The OP might be considered of the best of the season). I liked characters enough in this season, showing a VERY MARKED evolution in the already mentioned \"enemies\"  (Vena and Yaboku) of the series. Kazuma and Yukine also showed an evolution though minor. Enjoyit enough, I am waiting for a third season.",

            "content": "Noragami is one of those series that managed to bring a set of conflicting feelings inside my heart, especially when it comes to this second season. Usually, I don't get conflicted easily, but this season managed to do it through several elements.\r\nStory - 6\r\nNoragami Aragato was the season of conclusions regarding several situations left open from the last series, patching up/ breaking relationships, moving on and introducing and developing new themes to the already fascinating world of Noragami; in particular I'm referring to the constant contrast between \"corruption\" and \"loyalty\". Normally, we'd think that falling into corruption is one of the few sins that onecan commit in Noragami, however the story proved that loyalty can be as much of a sharp blade, if not even more than \"evil\" and \"temptation\". It was something that was executed extremely well during the entirety of the show and I kept getting reminded by it through most of the Regalia characters. Their roles were also set in stone more clearly than in the first season which I appreciated because I was left with the impression that Regalias were nothing more than \"tools\" (which to a certain extent they are, but it's not the ultimate truth and not for all Regalias).\\n\\n\r\nAnother recurring thing was the line \"Gods can never do wrong.\". While momentarily confused with Yato's statement and thinking that he's definitely wrong and he's a hypocrite to say that because we all know what type of havoc and destruction Gods can bring, I managed to understand after giving it some thought. In the Noragami realm, Gods get born out of people's wishes. Ultimately, Gods are born with a goal and a nature that humans give them, but they don't have any morals or distinction between good and evil or life and death like a human does. However, realizing this, also makes me think that Yato probably didn't try to be a hypocrite, but similarly to Veena he partly tried to justify himself in some way to be able to deal with his own past and partly making her try to move on by using a more productive and positive mean. It's also to note that humans as well believe that Gods can indeed do no wrong and what they do, is because it's needed. Ebisu follows this exact line to the letter as well. The God Council is also the same even if ultimately we might find their judgement unfair; at the current time, they indeed did no wrong, only what was believed to be needed for the best of everybody.\\n\\n\r\nThis season covered only two arcs of the story and as such it felt as preparing grounds for something bigger. The story was very character driven and what did happen was executed fairly well up to episode 8. After that point (episode 9 if I remember right) we had this time skip that I just didn't know how to take; suddenly time passed, some characters moved on, others decided to cut ties with their pasts, some others were introduced-wait... I found it simply unforgivable how out of place this time skip resulted to be. It felt as they started a new story altogether and seeing the good pacing that it had during half of the series, I felt ripped from the Noragami-reality and thrown into a dream...where some important people were suddenly \"abandoned\", Hiyori added a spark of convenient dramatical-angst trying to horribly foreshadow something that happened at the end of the season, while Yato was chasing his Luck (literally) together with SPOILER-somebody while avoiding to get devoured by a skeleton lady. Hurray! \"Wait. What? My natural story and character development and pacing committed suicide\"-I thought. Then the romance, you ask? Bulshitting me for whole blighted 3 episodes (9-11). I'm a big HiyorixYato fangirl, I really am; shipping them is really easy, but not even then did I manage to justify any of the convenient-forced-angst around the situation (and no, I do not blame a certain light brown-haired guy, differently from other people). \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me was the ambiguity between Yato and his father. I don't care that it gets explained properly in the manga, in the anime i just couldn't see what was up. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, I managed to empathize with Ebisu and understand certain motivations and justifications during the last 2 episodes of the show, so while part of 8, 9,10,11 were painful, 12 and 13 partially redeemed the story in my eyes, making me excited for an eventual third season, if it will ever be made...If not, well I do plan to buy the manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nLet me just start and say that Yato is one of the most likable and unforgettable shonen protagonist ever. He is such because he's not valorous; despite being a God, Yato shows much more human behavior traits than other Gods and this became more obvious to me during this second season: he's greedy, lazy, sometimes not thankful, sometimes selfish and sometimes sneaky. \\n\\n\r\nActually, this is another reason why this season made me conflicted. I started questioning the real nature of the characters that I thought I knew. Are the good guys really that good? Are the bad guys really just bad guys? The answer is no. Everybody is selfish and stubborn in their own ways, starting with Veena (which just plain confuses me on a side and on the other I want to pat her head). The good-natured characters become painfully aware of their \"imperfections\" during this show and actually try to find motivation to become better people instead of keep standing on the same step. The antagonists on the other hand are more complicated.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with Kugaha (the Rabo copy lol) and I'm going to say that he was a surprisingly well-made side-villain. While I didn't exactly care for him more than a pain in the ass at the beginning, he ultimately made me question his real thoughts. Did he do everything for power? Or for good? Do the results excuse the means? After him, the anime constantly tried to put other characters in question, everybody besides Kazuma and Yukine and several Regalias. I was sad with the way that he was ultimately treated though. it's to see what happens to him later.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there's Nora. In the first season I simply disliked her, not as a character, but as a person. In this one, I was again conflicted. She is also painfully selfish, but I was surprised to see another side of her that can actually become likable to a certain degree and even making me feel sorry for her. Her connection with Yato and loyalty for him was deeper than I imagined on an emotional level (which I partly liked, partly disliked because I expected something else), but while she just simply wants her life with Yato back, her means are morally questionable. However, I'm not ready to dislike her anymore.\\n\\n\r\nGoing to Kazuma and Yukine, while the first didn't go through a radical change, but more coming to terms with his past with Veena, Yukine genuinely surprised me. Remember that bratty kid from the first season that kept nagging and stealing and having perverted thoughts over Hiyori? Well...he's nowhere to be seen in this season. The way his character was treated was simply amazing and looking back, I've felt like my child has just grown into an adult. \\n\\n\r\nEbisu was hard to sympathize with because at the time he appears in the Underworld I was already annoyed by the time skip, so I couldn't care less who he was and what his role was, while the comedy regarding him seemed simply misplaced. Indeed I didn't manage to actually care for him till episode 12 when it was already too late. However, the nice contrast and relationship formed between him and Yato was definitely one of the focal points that redeemed part of the story for me.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Hiyori which I almost forgot about. I find her likable, however there's little to say about her this season. She continues being Yato's drive for becoming a better person and...that's just it. She might have realized that her place near Yato and Yukine is not secured and she doesn't make part of their world, but for romance purposes, of course, this will get dragged till our main protagonists will have to bump their heads into it again. XD\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast also had some pieces of trivia about them revealed, but the show didn't manage to do much else with them. I expected something more on Kofuku and something more on Tenjin. I understand that it was because of lack of time, however. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8\\n\\n\r\nAs every show, Noragami also has highs and lows, however when it's good, then it's really good. The transitions during certain scenes of emotional impact or during action scenes are just so beautifully animated that combined with the awesome soundtrack just make me forget my rationality and start getting emotional for a while there. The opening video is also one of the most eye-catching openings that I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 7\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately part of it was recycled from last season, but it isn't any less amazing nor any less impact-full. Worth to mention Kainoratan as one of my favorite tracks. ( I can swear I heard Misogi in this second season too which was my favorite from the first !)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion - 7\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto was a nice ride overall. I was very salty for those 3 episodes to the point that everytime I had some hope, it kept dying after 2 minutes, so if it would have ended with those episodes I would have probably not been as kind. But it didn't and goddamn that plot twist after the end credits. Goddamn.",

            "content": "This review will contain no spoilers for neither Noragami Aragoto nor Noragami.\r\nNoragami Aragoto is a huge step up from its predecessor. I had my fair share of issues with the first season, mainly relegated to flat characters and slight lack of development and intrigue. Above all else, Noragami Aragoto has established an identity with better writing in general, greater organization, and a more refined sense of self. The change in quality is immediately evident within the first three episodes, and the entirety of the first half of the show is an impeccably strong showing in comparison to the first season of Noragami. If you areon the fence as to whether Noragami Aragoto is worth the watch (be it that you were not pleased with the first season or not sure if the second season is a great enough pay-off to watch the first), I would definitely recommend the watch for the first seven episodes alone. The well-constructed first half certainly does overshadow the weaker second half, but the second half still grabbed my interest.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto is split into two arcs. Both of which focus on the idea of being forgotten, and the central message of not letting your past define you shines through with this season. As with the last season, Phantoms are at large, but corruption in the heavens and the controlling of such Phantoms have become a larger issue than the Phantoms themselves. This season focuses a lot more on characters and the conflicts between them, which is a welcome improvement. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I still retained my qualms with Yukine, who feels almost like a cut-out character, he actually grew on me a bit even within the first two episodes. I absolutely loved the episode with Suzuha (Yukine's friend, the boy who cared for the tree), as it brought to light Yukine's growth as a character. I think the reason why I can accept Yukine's character growth as opposed to in the first season is that growth is reasonable with time, and it feels as though some time passed between the first and second season. This growth is in direct opposition to his prior immediate and awkward forced character development from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Yato's character in the first season and I love it again here. His multi-faceted personality allows him to provide both  humor and austerity which I felt necessary to the show. Yato brought both comedic relief and chills; truly a rounded character. This time, though, Yato was not the only character to shine nor the lone carrier of the show. Bishamon and her team of Regalia alongside Kugaha really gripped me. For once, it felt like characters had reasoning behind their unwavering drive. Bishamon's intent was thoroughly explained with great pacing. Whereas the enemies throughout the first season of Noragami felt as if their only trait was 'evil,' Kugaha, the villain of the first arc, is cunning and actually has a goal. Kugaha is smart and employs strategy instead of brute force.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not all characters were well written nor fleshed out, those who were really impressed me. The one character who annoyed me most in the previous season grew on me, and that was certainly part of why I enjoyed this season more than the last. Again, above all else, the portion of the anime which stood out the most was the phenomenal soundtrack. The OP is super catchy and every track fits well with what is presented.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season a lot more than the first. The weaker second half did damper my score, but it is certainly a daunting task to follow the phenomenal Bishamon arc. The last few seconds of Noragami Aragoto allow some hope that there will be a new season eventually, and I'll definitely be there to watch it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review: Noragami Aragoto (2015)\r\nNoragami Aragoto is the 2nd Season of Noragami (2014). I just recently got to watch both seasons and after finishing the first season I didn't think it lived up to the hype it gets. That is until I finished watching Noragami Aragoto. Aragoto deserves major props on the improvements it had on its first season.\r\n=STORY= (7)\r\nThe 13 episode series is split into 2 major arcs. Both being way better than anything the first season had to offer. The first arc is slightly detailed in the synopsis so I won't go into too much detail about it. But what generally happens in bothof these arcs is we get to know more about all the Gods & the ongoing relationship between the 3 main protagonists of the show. The 2nd arc of the story deals about the masked phantoms which leads us to the introduction of a new character and also focuses on Yato's Backstory.\\n\\n\r\n=Characters= (8)\\n\r\nThe most notable improvement upon the first season is the characters. Both arcs expand upon almost all the characters especially the 2 gods Bishamon & Yato. Yukine also saw major improvements as he is no longer a whiny kid but now he tries to do everything he can to protect & help Yato while also developing his relationship with him. Other characters worth mentioning are Kazuma as he is really one of if not the main protagonist of the first arc and also the new character introduced in the 2nd arc of the season Ebisu. I won't go into too much detail because I'll fall into spoiler territory but hes definitely an interesting character that will most probably be a key character in season 3. I feel as the weakest character is Hiyori. She doesn't feel like the true protagonist of the show anymore and she doesn't add too much to the story except keeping the \"relationship\" sub-plot alive which would honestly still work between Yukine & Yato.\\n\\n\r\n=Sound=(8)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show is quite good. It uses tracks from the first season and they are rather fitting for the show. The Opening for Noragami Aragoto is alright I don't think it's bad but just not my type I wasn't too fond    of the first season's opening either. the Ending song though is quite enjoyable. I found myself hearing it until the end for the few episodes that didn't end on making me want to see what happens next.\\n\\n\r\n=Art & Animation=(9)\\n\r\nNoragami is animated by studio Bones. For reference they are responsible for animating shows like Full Metal Alchemist,Soul Eater & Darker than Black.\\n\r\nThe show looks incredibly polished especially in the action-sequences which this season has more of than the last.\\n\\n\r\n=Enjoyment=(8)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season a lot more than the first. The bits of comedy where still good and add that with better Story & Characters and also\\n\r\nwell animated action and you get a pretty fun show.\\n\\n\r\n=Overall=(8)\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto shows how a sequel should be made. Multiple shows have over time gotten worse as the series progresses but Noragami avoids this and instead of getting worse it increases the quality of the show making a so-so series into something worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "[This is a spoiler free review]\r\nNoragami Aragoto is the perfect example of a sequel done right. Not that the first season had something particularly wrong to it: it was received really well by the audience and is has managed to obtain the rank #339. Knowing that, I now invite you to lift your eyes on the screen and look at the rank of Noragami Aragoto: #69 (it might change). Is it because it is new? That the audience like it so much because of the \u201chype\u201d? Yes, could be. But it is undeniable that the quality of this second season equal the first and evensurpass it. Now, let's review the continuation of the anime known as \u201cNoragami\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8/10]\\n\r\nIt is difficult to give a 10/10 for the story when it comes to following seasons. What I give Noragami Aragoto credit's for, is that it managed to conserve the first season story line, while including a whole new development. It could easily been a second season built up as a useless filler: nothing new added, no explorations of the story's possibilities, same focus... Well, the good thing is, it didn't make that mistake. Two \u201cworlds\u201d that were omnipresent but never really shown in the first season were now developed and shown: Heaven and Hell. The story weren't also only focusing on our main three characters (a.k.a Yato, Hiyori and Yukine), but a more deep explorations of other Gods surrounding them. \\n\r\nAny bad points? The story gets predictable really fast. Also, some information were keep to be revealed at the end, which doesn't give time to the viewer to fully capt and enjoy the revelations. Overall, the story was coherent with the first season and even add a bit more.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9/10]\\n\r\nThe art is the same of the first season. Nothing new on the art style add been add: what you liked in Noragami would be what you'll like in Noragami Aragoto. The vibrant colors, how it plays with the lighting for intensifying a scene... The design techniques are really what is enjoyable about the art. About the animation itself, it isn't bad: it's fluid and well done. Only, there's nothing spectacular to it. Props: the very last scene was really well executed.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8/10]\\n\r\nOne thing that was really appreciated in the sounds effects, is that they weren't trying to play the \u201cmelodrama\u201d card. The musics are energetic, rousing most of the time, but are still adequate for the moment they are use for. To feel a sad moment, the viewer doesn't necessarily needs a thousand of violins playing and, that, the anime understood it well.\\n\r\nAs for the opening Kyouran Hey Kids! It is reflecting exactly the point above: it is hype, it is going fast and it is foreshadowing a lot of actions. But in the same time, it also managed to have a calmer moment. The opening itself represents very well the mood of the anime: it was a really good choice.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 10/10]\\n\r\nThis is where Noragami Aragoto wins all the points. In this second season, the characters are strongly developed: Yato is about his past and his relation with the mysterious \u201cNora\u201d, the personality of Bishamon and her strong love for her shinkis, the ambitions of a certain Ebisu... Not only are we introduce to a lot more characters, but the ones already presented aren't left undeveloped. Except one: Hiyori. But even there, is it really a bad thing? The focus isn't on her life after all. This second season brings a back story to a lot of characters and it is really refreshing. We loved Yato in the first one: we now want to marry him after this one.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10/10]\\n\r\nAction after action, you don't want to miss one second of the episode. There're no fillers, as each episodes teach the viewer something new or, at least, develop a character or a situation. There's even some moments where the feels could surpass the excitements. Even with some mistakes, Noragami persists to be a really enjoyable anime. And it deserves it.\\n\\n\r\n                                                 OVERALL: 9\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto exceeds my expectations. Knowing that a third season is coming, I am even more thrilled to watch it than I was to watch season two. It was such a good continuation of an already really good story! There's no doubt: if you liked Noragami, at least with a score of 7, you'll like Noragami Aragoto! Go for it!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Incredible.\r\nI had the feeling that after a weird first season Noragami would flip the table and pull of a masterpiece with this second season, and i was right!\r\nNoragami Aragoto is the continuation of Noragami and follows up onto the story of the god of war Yato. \r\nThis season focuses mainly on two gods: Bishamon the mightiest god of war and Ebisu the god of fortune.\r\nBishamon character is completely amazing altough some people call out on her fanservice, i dont (she is a goddess and the anime doesnt try to portray her as sexy, she simply is naturally charming). Aside from looks and bath scenes weget a lot more information about her past, her team of divine instruments and Kazuma his faithful divine vessel.\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, Bishamon (and her arc) is simply and plainly pure baddasery. A strong independent (lol) goddess that is written on the right way.\\n\r\nThe first arc of Noragami explores her hatred and conflict with Yato. \\n\r\nThe second arc starts with a weird foot, taking Yukine out of the picture almost completely.\\n\r\nEbisu and Yato get some extremely quick character development but it's kinda forgiven since they are on the verge of death and everything.\\n\r\nWe also get a lot more Nora and some desperately needed explanations for Ayakashi, names, invocations, etc.\\n\r\nBishamon comes to save the day and Yato, Yukine and the power of friendship try to help but the show says a big no and we reach a sad but believable ending.\\n\r\nThere is a plot twist at the final seconds of the show but i feel it could have been made more properly as it didnt had a impact proper to the magnitude of the revelation.\\n\r\nHiyori once again fails to find a good place on the story just like she did on the first season but the rest of the character cast do a good enough job to create a great show.\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyement of this season vastly beats the first season.\\n",

            "content": "Woof, what a ride. Something you don't always get from sequels, in most cases your nostalgia would lead you to believe that the first season will always be superior no matter what, but no with this. there is an undeniable quality raise in this season, and that's apparent from the get-go.\r\nNoragami Aragoto was an improvement on top of the first season, Noragami, while the art style maintained its memorable quality, and the soundtracks too, the plot has seen some really exciting rollercoaster action, talking the IT languages, let's encrypt...\r\n- Story (9.2/10):\r\nThe first season was where it all started, but despite the massive information we gotout of it, we were still left with so many unanswered questions to fill up a library.\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto focuses on the origin of our protagonist Yato, where he originated from, and what made him the person he is now, what happened between him and Veen. It even dives deeper to explain some of the obscure stuff about the Nora that keeps appearing in front of him with no prior warning.\\n\r\nTo say the least, the story progressing in this season was far superior to the first's, whereas Noragami did deliver some really solid plot points, this is where the real hype resides, I mean every episode was filled with stuff interesting enough to shake the whole comment section.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI can't really complain, or else I would deserve to be smacked on the face, other shows would kill for this kind of care when it comes to animation.\\n\r\nI don't think it's any friction far superior to the first season's, but the quality remains and shines even more in fight scenes.\\n\r\nEverything from the opening and ending themes visuals, to the stunning fluid animation, to the stillest shots there are, nothing feels unfitting or unpleasant to look at, you're just being gift a great animation that keeps up the pace, and lets you focus on what's happening, not bad to let you disappointed, and not too outstanding to distract you either.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI misjudged the first season's soundtrack before and given it a lower score than this one, how rushful was I, I only got to notice to moving, how involved it was in this season, seeing how they kept the old OST.\\n\r\nOne of the things I was upset about when finishing the first season, was missing the opening, that was was spectacular, I dove in with zero expectation for this season's opening theme song, but was greeted with an even better one, oh, how many times I screamed along the lyrics at the beginning of each episode, it was just phenomenal. This should make me lose some points at those \u201cTry not to sign\u201d challenges.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\\n\r\nWhile keeping the old cast of characters, but with extras, being that they are no longer too annoying like Hiyori and Yukine were to some people, they really grew more mature and understanding, in a good way of course. Veena was really given a huge attention here, explaining her treats, dissecting her attitude and all, along with her servants.\\n\r\nA lot of other new characters were introduced too, that remained appealing from the moment of their introduction. more people to love other than Yato,\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.1/10):\\n\r\nI can definitely confirm that I did enjoy this season more than the first one, and I really dug the first one. unlike the first, every episode had many things to hook you on, I love the cliffhangers, and even more so the fast-paced storytelling, really makes you beg for a third season.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\\n\r\nIf the first season would have left me hesitant from recommending it to my fellow friends, this season alone makes me want to shove the franchise up their faces. Yes, I would say, this is a must watch for modern Anime series, because honestly, it's rare to find some really good shows these days.",

            "content": "Noragami is not perfect, despite whatever the masses shout. Now I love this anime, and it is great, but there are very big noticeable flaws which I will go through in a minute. I will try to keep it spoiler free but there will be scarce details on the final fight\r\nMy first biggest complaint is that this show is a weird ''Frankenstein's monster'' of Slice of Life, Comedy and Action. One minute Yato might be snooping in girls bathrooms spraying his number onto the walls, the next minute Hiyori is going to some festival with this boy she likes (who isn't important at all sofar in the anime, but gets a lot of screentime and the final scene leaves a lot to be desired from him.) If you like fusions of genres, check this one out, but if you're looking for a pure action, this may not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the ending was Deux Ex Machina. I'll have to give scarce details here. Yato and Bishamon are trapped in hell and have to battle the immortal God of Hell to escape. They're losing of course, but then Daikoku pulls a fuckin' Ora Ora out of his ass and says that Hiyori can use a ''Soul Call'' to bring them back. What the fuck? This wasn't mentioned at all in any episode prior, its literally just brought up to get the characters out of a corner the author wrote himself into. But oh no! Yato hasn't told anyone his real name because they'll know he used to be a really evil god!!!!!!1!! Literally makes no sense. But then Hiyori uses the POWER OF ONYOMI AND KUNYOMI to GUESS Yato's real name! What bullshit is that! It comes out of nowhere and only happens to add some conflict to such an easy way out\\n\\n\\n\r\nThird, the pacing near the end is terrible! Yato is held hostage by one of his past Regalias, but then literally in one shot it cuts to a month later. What?!?!?! A month passed in the time it took to change the camera angle?! Ebisu's arc was also a massive letdown, they couldn't do it in 5 episodes. He should have been introduced wayy sooner. I had no reason to root for him or to care when he does anythng with weight.\\n\\n\r\nAnime often has the problem of over-complicating plot points, but Noragami, the genius anime that it is, manages to avoid this hurdle by forgetting to conclude some arcs and overlooking character abilities. Like, Yato can teleport. He can literally teleport anywhere! ANYWHERE HE WANTS! HOW IS HE BEING HELD HOSTAGE?? TELEPORT AWAY! DID I MISS AN EPISODE? WHO IS THE ''FATHER'' DUDE, WHO IS THAT TEENAGER WHO (judging by the ending scene) IS THE SEED OF ALL EVIL? Who's remembering Yato? \\n\\n\r\nBut all that nitpickyness aside, this anime is truly amazing. It's story might be lacking, but the art is brilliant, especially the views of the regalias inside their weapons. The OST is goofy and funny and you can listen to it without the anime, and the OP is one of the best. Characters were so well done, especially Yato, and overall this anime was a blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend watching this. It's a good action comedy with truly heart wrenching and/or wholesome moments and amazing fight scenes.",

            "content": "So off the heels of finishing the first season, I bounded my way into season 2 or Aragoto in this case. I enjoyed my time with the first season and wanted to keep it up. So let's not waste time and continue onward.\r\nStory: 8\r\nSo we start off with a scene that, in all honesty, kinda pumped me up for the rest of the season. It shows Bishamon, a character that was cool but didn't get a lot of screen time, crying out in distress and begging for an attacker to stop. We watch as, this attacker turns out to be Yato. Immediately I thought, \"Startingoff with the explanation of why she hates his guts? Fuck yea, let's go\". the story then follows group after the events of the first season as the past seems to return and become an issue once again. Or at least the first half does. The second is centered around a god of Fortun and developing Yato even more. I'm not complaining since all in all I enjoyed the whole season. But the two halfs don't really connect well as far as sequencing goes. It's like the resolution of the first half happens and then the second half plot just starts like no time passes. The best way to describe it would be would be getting arrested for a crime right as you walk out of a court house and had just settled a case. I would of actually prefered a filler episode just to let it feel like there was a space of calm and peace. Other than that, great story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7 and 7\\n\r\nNothing too different here, it looks the same and sounds the same. The one thing I will say is that the opening is much better in my opinion. Very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis season is all about character developement. You have the same cast with new added characters for plot and what not. The cool thing is that the developement focuses on topics that pop up during season 1, but weren't really able to be addressed. We even see more about Yato and the kind of life he used to live. I honestly feel for the guy in a lot of ways. I won't spoil why but I will say we have all at some point been in his shoes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, I was rolling right of the ending of Season 1. I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it even more now. I really liked how the theme really centered around the idea of identity in one way or another. I know that was a bit of the theme last time but this time it's the prime focus. I would recommend this series as a whole to just about anybody. Yea, I know people didn't like the first season too much but they really improved and did much better here. Watch both seasons as a marathon. The ride is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it only cost 5 yen.",

            "content": "Should You Watch Noragami Aragoto?\r\nIn the first season of Noragami, we were introduced to a world where Phantoms gang up on spirits and humans alike, feeding on the vulnerable and corrupting the weak. We learned that Phantoms are not merely sources of corruption, but symptoms of it, and that even gods are not immune from the blight of corruption. We learned just how deep the bond between master and Regalia goes and how profoundly it affects both parties when the relationship is warped for any reason. We learned about Nora, the little creep with every god\u2019s name written across her arms and a sweet coldface that hides incalculable promise of betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these facts resurface again in new ways. This time, Yukine and Yato have learned enough from last season that they\u2019re actually communicating with one another fully and affectionately. This time, it\u2019s Bishamon who\u2019s in danger from the connection between Regalia and master. This time, Nora strikes again, though we have yet to fully understand how she\u2019s meddling in Bishamon\u2019s life and why she would choose to do so. The new episodes feel cohesive.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style and fluidity is still good, especially in the battle scenes.\\n\r\nFrom the eerie cold glint of Yato\u2019s eyes in the first scene of the new season to the battle in the first episode against a Phantom in the shape of a plush toy, the animation quality remains high. I\u2019m hesitant to praise any show\u2019s animation now, especially after the sad news behind Gangsta\u2019s abrupt decline in quality , but the \u201crend\u201d sequences that end Phantom battles look just as slick and flashy as they did in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters retain all the charm and beauty of their season 1 designs as well, with eyes bright and hair a-flowing. The new designs for characters like Bishamon\u2019s mysterious doctor and the good-hearted botanist Regalia fit right in.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the new opening and closing themes, what can I say aside from they look cool as hell and get me hyped for the upcoming episode? They do their job and do it well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have progressed from season 1 to season 2.\\n\r\nLast season, Yato and Yukine\u2019s failures to communicate almost cost them both their lives. This season, Yato treats Yukine as a person, not a tool. He takes the time to explain things to him and praises him for getting them done well. And this season, Yukine talks to his master instead of sulking or running away. When Yato is stung by Yukine\u2019s fears about Hiyori, Yukine doesn\u2019t hide. He talks to Yato instead. Their relationship this season is marked by mutual affection and care, though the ribbing and grousing remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Yukine\u2019s aching need for human connections becomes a plot point once more, when he makes a friend aside from Hiyori and Yato. Though it\u2019s far too early to tell what will become of it, the results of Yukine\u2019s new friendship seem all wound up in the greater plot occurring between Bishamon, her doctor, and sinister Nora. As for Hiyori, she is as brave and bright as she ever was, though she may not fully understand what will happen once Yato \u201cfixes\u201d her soul-slippage issue.\\n\\n\r\nThe character growth on Yukine and Yato\u2019s ends mean that we can\u2019t rely on the same dynamics from season 1. The shift in their dynamics should produce different results, meaning that our plot will head in unexpected ways. And that\u2019s exactly what we want from a story in any medium.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, should you watch Noragami: Aragoto?\\n\r\nAbsolutely yes. The second season of Noragami is right on track to offer more of what made the first season so damned good. Barring anything unexpected like the sudden dissolution of the studio making it, Noragami looks like it\u2019s on course for another season full of good humor, awesome supernatural battles, and deep emotional resonance.\\n\\n\r\ni would like to thnak RucyL for telling me about season 2\\n",

            "content": "Wow! Just...wow! Everything is almost a perfect 10. It was that good. But because we must please our overseers (sigh) I will go into required detail. So that this review will remain and be seen by as many as possible so that they do not miss out on an amazing story that was beyond well written by the mangaka and beyond well-done executed by Bones. Uwaaaahhh!! Subarashi!!\r\nStory: I just love a story about Japanese folklore. Especially when that story throws in some good action and a truck load of mystery. So much so that you have no freaking clue what is gonna happen the nextsecond. Those ones just do it for me. And Noragami is all this and then some! Well the first season started on a bit of a slow pace which had people misjudge it or forget about it with ease. Big mistake! Because all that needed to happen in order to set up for the massive stuff that was to happen in the second season. And boy was it massive. All the plot twists and craziness. All the grey areas and blurred lines with regards to the \"villains\" and the \"good guys\". It made for one hell of a ride. \\n\\n\r\nArt: the art was very good and well defined. (I don't really have much to say here other than it was visually inviting and I absolutely enjoyed marathoning through the series partly because of it too.lol)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was very good. The OP was very catchy. I liked the message and the upbeatness. Very fitting with the content of the show. The seiyuus too were great. Kamiya Hiroshi, Ono Daisuke (aka bae), Kaji Yuki, Fukuyama Jun. If you know your anime then you know this is a badass seiyuu combo. Duh it was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fuuuuaaaahhh the characters!! The characters were so layered and real! Aish! Had me going through all different kinds of emotions and feelings. What I absolutely love about Noragami is that the characters go through some deep life-changing experiences and they do grow from it! Man it is so satisfactorily done that I can't even appreciate it enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I was sitting in front of my laptop for two straight days only going for bathroom, shower and food breaks. Sometimes they were even done concurrently. If I could shower while watching this I would have!hahaha It was that good!",

            "content": "I figured I was right to expect great things from the sequel to Noragami (Stray God). I gave the first season an over all rating of 8, and predicted that I'd give the second season a 9. I was wrong... in a good way.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWith the setting being established and knowledge of how everything works in Noragami (first season) the story was now able to progress as much as it wanted to without confusing anyone. What I liked about this season is the character development. There were two arcs that focused on Bishamonten and Ebisu. Each arc focused on building on their assigned gods respectivelybut not without also developing the main characters as well. I love how the lead character's past life unfolded and he grew while we learnt more about Bishamon and Ebisu.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs with the first season the art was awesome, but since this season had a more action I got to see it play out with intensity and beauty regardless of the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGoing along with the action sequences or the sad moments, the OST plays out really well, so you can feel the moments you watch with empathy or intensity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before I truly appreciated the character development in this season. I cried at the end of the Bishamon arc and I cried at the end of the Ebisu arc. When there is good character development, I feel for them and that is what I can enjoy from a well development anime character. I love anime that make me feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime developed so well for me, it went from an 8 in season one to a 10 for season two~!\\n\r\nThis anime was so good to me, I will buy all the manga and read them. This story is so awesome, thank you very much, Adachitoka!",

            "content": "Noragami S2 picked off a season with a lot of promise and delivered.\r\nNowadays I find a lot of animes to have good parts then also really bad parts  which create this paradox where one minute you're enjoying the watch only to be ruined by something unnecessary. Noragami didn't do that all (or it did and I forgot).\r\nThe pacing was great and every episode was jam packed with significant events and great moments. Then there's the story which has a good balance of \"the unknown\" and new curve balls to allow the plot to thicken. All the questions you had in Season 1 are answeredin Season 2 only to be replaced by more for Season 3 (god willing). Honestly the execution of the story is just great.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were not UBW level spectacular but were enjoyable enough. There were no \"overpowering\" moments that questioned your suspension of belief like in a lot of shonen (well until the end). And there is no long-winded screaming or power-ups that many find too clique in this genre. It's rather refreshing actually. In terms of improvement, the phantoms could do with a significant upgrade in style but its not a big deal. Essentially this is a light version of Bleach but in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is awesome. All the main characters (the 3) get significant screen time to develop and you end up appreciating their role in the story. The protagonist God particularly is interesting in the sense that he has a dark past which still isn't fully revealed while presenting a totally opposite to him for the majority of the story. He somehow changed significantly to what he is now and we want to know how. The conflict he is always faced with, actually what all the main characters they are faced with makes the story the more fascinating. Their roles are developing quickly while addressing their internal conflicts at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics were all very enjoying. The soundtrack, the art, animation and humour were all spot on for a westerner such as myself. I laughed a few times and I'm difficult to please.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really loved this season because the writer/animation studio exercised moderation in all the key places and presented the story at a great pace. Getting all the smaller things right made for an very fun experience because I wasn't annoyed at a dumb protagonists or felt exhausted from putting up with poor pacing or japanese humour like I tend to come across. If you like the premise behind this story, this is a must watch. There was not a single moment where I was bored. That's the biggest positive.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I step into the world of MAL reviews with a review of Noragami + Noragami Aragoto! This is a review by someone who has only read the first volume of the manga and can safely say the manga is much more detailed and makes better sense than the anime, but let's see how the anime stacks up on its own without much knowledge of the manga's progression! Note: Spoilers for season 1!\r\nThe Noragami series is a very hyped and popular series among my friends, who talked about the fun storyline and an excellent cast of characters, enough so that it made me curious to seewhat all the hubbub was about and come to my own conclusion about it. I went in with high hopes, though not without a critical eye to not let myself get wrapped up in the group think of its popularity.\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Noragami is much like our own, except it is infested with creatures of the Far Shore called phantoms that go unseen by regular humans and can only be purified by the gods. One day, Hiyori, your every day average schoolgirl, finds herself literally knocked into an existence where she can suddenly see all of the beings of the Far Shore and begins interacting with them on a regular basis. She follows along with Yato, an eccentric god without a shrine who does tasks for people for the price of five yen in hopes of buying his own shrine someday. Hiyori asks him to return her body back to 'normal' and promises to keep following him and hassling him until he completes her wish, especially as Yato continuously keeps shirking his responsibilities to her off in favor of completing other tasks for other people who have made wishes to him instead.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this may have a nice start to it with a long-term plotline being to \"find a way to make Hiyori's body normal again\", it is actually one that loses its purpose in the first season when one of the gods tells Yato how to easily fix Hiyori's body, but neither Yato or Hiyori want to go along with it because it would mean cutting ties between them. Cutting ties would cause Hiyori to forget about Yato and the other mystical beings she had met along the way, something that she absolutely refuses to let happen. Hiyori and Yato decide to leave things be... rendering this overarching plot point a bit... useless because the main conflict of the introduction is apparently \"solved\". Then, later, in Aragoto, Hiyori mentions once again that she wants her body to become \"fixed\", even though they already know the way to do it is one that would result in a conclusion that neither of them really want. I was confused at this part because I thought she had given up on it in favor of keeping her connection to the gods. This wishy-washy and inconsistent storyline gives the entirety of Noragami a bit of an aimless feel overall when you'd think after two seasons, there would be some sort of direction the plot would at least seem to begin taking.\\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of Noragami Aragoto is done in two multi-episode arcs that take about half the season to cover that revolve around the stories of two different gods that the main characters encounter. These arcs bring out more details about the way their world works and expands on the scale of the story greatly, as well as showing the great diversity of personalities and types of gods that are in existence. The guest characters introduced all get their own developments that help you get to know them better and understand their motives and backstories more clearly, making the arcs fulfilling in their own way. However, these arcs often felt a little on the generic side, especially in the first of Aragoto's arcs where the \"villain\" is far too plain and irredeemable to be interesting. Bishamon also came off as a very inconsistent character to me. In the first season of Noragami, it was clear that she had a distinct hatred of Yato for killing her regalia... but even though Aragoto's first arc had a villain that killed a huge swath of her regalia, she let the villain go and somehow had more compassion for him than when it was Yato who had been the killer? It didn't really add up. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular opinion, I thought the second arc of Aragoto was the better one because it tugged at more philosophical ideas that made me feel more emotionally involved with the characters, even heartbreakingly so at times. It also seemed to contradict itself less and followed less generic shounen plot progression than the first arc, though it was still plagued by a mostly-unknown foe that we never really get much information about. One of the scenes near the end involves a powerful attack on Yato's part that makes me wonder why there wasn't more of a negative consequence towards him by his higher ups. Things went on as if his actions never mattered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is a mixed bag of high highs and rather blah lows with a plot purpose that feels a bit empty, as if the author themselves isn't actually sure what to do with it. A solution to Hiyori's \"problem\" shouldn't have been revealed so early as it really takes away from the main storyline. There is an amateurish feel to the writing at times, which is understandable since this is the mangaka's first time making the story of their own series. Inconsistencies aside, it was an easy story to follow along with and binge on for a marathon-style viewing. The pace is good and leaves off episodes with plenty of cliffhangers to make you crave the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Noragami have really good animation styles, making it clear what is happening in any given scene, which is important for a series with action and unusual creatures like the phantoms roaming around their world. The characters are all very well drawn and expressive in ways that keep true to their personalities and emotions, and the darker scenes got quite moody and intense at times, even haunting. Even so, it isn't a particularly distinctive or unique sort of animation, but it gets the job done by having some moments of glory and epic flashiness.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nAlong with the art and animation, the production value in the sound department was quite good. The soundtrack was quite memorable and interesting, suitable of a series taking place in the modern world but with its own mythical twist to it. \\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Noragami are a mixed bag, varying from fun and developed to completely bland and uninteresting, as if many of the characters were simply thrown in as an afterthought. Despite being the main character, Hiyori is ridiculously underdeveloped for the amount of screentime she gets and being the \"eyes\" of a common person that the viewer is gazing at the story's world through. She's a typical, happy-go-lucky and well-meaning schoolgirl who has a seemingly-random obsession with arena fighting. Aragoto doesn't add much to her compared to the first season, which is disappointing. Yato, while eccentric, outgoing and comedic, has a kind of boring dark past that ended up having little impact, or at least quite a bit less of an impact than I was hoping for out of him because I thought he was a really cool, interesting and mysterious character in the first season. Sadly, I was starting to feel a little tired of him by the end of Aragoto as he wasn't seeming to grow very much.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the third main character, Yukine, that I started to really want to see more of as I really enjoyed watching him change and grow from his first introduction to where he ended up at the end of Aragoto. To me, he ended up being quite the show-stealer because his growth was the most endearing and realistic to me. Of all the three mains, Yukine is the one who really learns the most about not only the world around him and how to interact with Yato, but about himself as well. Even when the other characters were starting to grow tiring or uninteresting to me, I kept wanting to see how things would play out for Yukine more than anyone else. He may have started out as an angsty, whiny little brat in the first season, but that low starting point allowed for him to have the greatest potential for growth, which he has clearly done well at in Aragoto. I can see myself reading the manga past where Aragoto ends all for the sake of seeing more of Yukine's future growth. But as much as I really loved Yukine, I know it's a bit of a bad sign when I start following a series for the sake of a single character.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nDespite its somewhat aimless overall storyline and mixed bag of characters, Noragami is actually a fairly enjoyable ride. When I first finished watching Aragoto, I was quite filled with feels and really positive energy as I was able to really relate to and attach to certain aspects of the characters and the plot arcs that were explored. I kept wanting the next episode as I was watching it to see how everything would resolve itself and wanting to know what became of the characters, both the mains and the side characters alike. It's an easy series to watch with some very likeable moments that will make you laugh and smile as well as moments that will make a dark feeling come over you. The emotions that come over the viewer throughout the series are those that the series intended to make you feel. The problems with the series don't come into mind until you sit down and start to think about the story and characters a bit more after the feels wear off a little, moving from emotional response to a thoughtful one. Once you go into a more reflective mode about the series, you start to see what the blaring flaws and inconsistencies in the series really are, bringing you back down to earth a little more than before. Initially feeling like a fun little shounen series, it is hardly the masterpiece that many fans make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, the anime ends on a sort of cliffhanger, so be prepared to have to pick up the manga if you want to find out what happens next!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 7/10",

It was well developed from the very start until the end. \r\nArt:\r\nThe art is great and awesome!\r\nSound: \r\nI am the biggest fan of the opening song. Kyouran Hey Kids!!

To start with the good things, the character design is gorgeous along with the animation.  There aren't that many varied tracks for this anime but the opening themes are amazing.  I don't think I ever skipped them as I was marathon-ing this series.  \r\nFor the bad part, there isn't that much depth in the story and character growth is almost non existent.  Because of that, the story is quite predictable and there aren't that many plot twists or tension.  However, Istill liked the characters a lot and they had their moments, especially in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I just wanted something entertaining and this anime was it!  It was such an easy watch and now that I've seen all of it, I kind of miss it.  It's not ground breaking by any means, but it was fun in its own way and I'll be looking forward to season 3 if it happens!",

            "content": "Overall, I really liked this series once it kicked into the more serious plot of the second season. The first season was a modest beginning to an action anime with some unique plot devices and reasonably good quality characters.\r\nThe comedy loses some punch as the same jokes repeat often. That said, the comedy is timed well so that it doesn't interfere with serious moments (and occasionally provides much needed relief of tension). \r\nThe characters are each memorable in a way that most anime just can't manage.  I really appreciated that the plot is 'small' enough that solid closure and denouement were possible. The endingis very satisfying because it was done with finesse, but it leaves you wanting to hear more stories from the noragami universe.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't fantastic, but the character development maintained a great lock-step with plot advancement. Despite the great character advancement, many of the characters having the emotional maturity of a 6 year old throwing a tantrum. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the style is well-developed and comfortably shifts between the realism of serious plot points and the cartoonishness of the comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nThere is enough good content in the anime to make it memorable, but there are some oversights. The framework of this series is remarkably mature and healthy, but unfortunately the execution of the manga wasn't always able to do it justice.",

            "content": "The second season of a show is usually one of two things, more of the same or an extension of the original premise. Only the very best shows are able to include both of these things without seeming overlong or, even worse, the product of filler. Noragami Aragoto is one of those shows that IS able to pull this off with resounding success. Not only that, but Noragami Aragoto expands from the original, focuses on the loose ends that were left from last season and finally gets over the teenage angst that pretty much drowned out the first half of the first season.\r\nNoragami Aragoto isthe story of an unknown war god known as Yato and his band of misfits. In the previous season, there was very little team spirit between the main cast. The first arc was all about Yukine and there was a lot of disconnect between him, Yato and the rest of the world. The second arc, which was much shorter, had a very vague and all around detached plot about Yato's past which didn't really reveal too much and left some incredibly interesting characters hanging. On top of that, the first season portrayed Yukine as a whiny, hormonal b*tch and it rendered the rest of the anime very 'slice of lifey' which, for such a cool premise, didn't do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami Aragoto fixes ALL OF THIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -  \\n\r\nAs mentioned just then, Noragami Aragoto has a far superior plot to its predecessor. This is because it provides us with historical relevance, modern events, past problems and current solutions - It possesses everything you need for a decent story that fits in perfectly with the world that's been built around us.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is all about Bishamon and Yato. Something that has been brought up in the past but never really been indulged in, at least not further than a light scuffle. This arc is jam-packed full of action and could probably be named my favourite arc of all time. Besides the characters, which I will discuss later, the plot behind this arc demonstrates an extreme amount of competence towards the overarching story and most of all satisfies every loose end left over from the first season. It's overwhelmingly satisfying to watch because of its as if the creators knew exactly what they needed to improve on in order to provide the most intriguing, bad-ass and cohesive arc possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, while providing less Yato, is just as satisfying. Much like the first one, it serves to tie up loose ends, provide a satisfying climax and put as many characters as possible on the show. It also does well to give us a peek into the politics of the gods. I personally loved this because it showed us how even the gods are accountable for their actions and are therefore vulnerable to the nature and condemnation of hierarchies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is very little I could scrutinise Noragami Aragoto for when it comes to its plot. It maintained that sense of wonder from the first season while developing on that and eventually provided us with something that we couldn't have fathomed being any better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nThe art is imaginative. From the design of the world to the depiction of the god's realm. As a side note, Bishamon's little corner of the world is depicted so well in this anime. It starts off as a paradise but slowly dissolves along with the story to the point where only chaos is left. Anyway, there are a few cut corners but overall, I was impressed by how fluid and colourful it was. Good job on that front.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise? Hang on... let me just listen to its intro again.....\\n\r\nF*ck yes.\\n\\n\r\nOn my review for the last season, I mentioned how I disliked the soundtrack (Except for the intro, that shit is my strawberry JAM). The same distaste for the music applies here (Except for blah blah blah) except I have to say I grew fond of it simply because of how well applied it was. Although I disliked it, I feel as if I've been conditioned into enjoying it simply because of all the bad ass moments that come with it. Had I enjoyed the sound track from the get-go, I think I would have scored this topic higher. however, I can't ignore my opinion in a subjective review, now, can I? That would just be pandering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nBishamon is probably one of my favourite characters in all of Noragami... and no, its not because she has her tits hanging out half the time. It's actually because she has such as strong demeanour but behind closed doors, she is caring, guilty, sympathetic, vulnerable and, in some cases, impulsive. This is another reason that I loved the first arc, all of this behaviour comes flooding out as the true history between her and Yato is revealed and it makes her so much better than a typical 'strong woman with power' that you often see in anime, who end up having very little humanity.\\n\\n\r\nSo ya know, Bishamon, if you ever need a safe place from Tumblr or whatever, I'm a MAL comment away. Just saying. (No, I don't own a body pillow of Bishamon. Yes, this is a (bad) joke. Yes, I'm stable)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, many of the other characters are worth your time. Yukine finally got out of his emo phase and Yato is less like Gintoki (branching out, good for him). Hiyori is still the same despite a few existential crisis'. Overall I would say that What you get from these characters is an amazing variety of comedy, seriousness, intelligence, ignorance and fun... always fun. They have developed a lot from the first season and continue to do some in some extreme ways despite the short amount of time they are given to do it in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nYou're probably getting just as bored of reading this as I am tired of writing this. Horizon: Zero Dawn unlocked a few days ago and It just got around to downloading it so I've got to get on that before I pass out in this chair.\\n\r\nTLDR; I'll keep these next bits short.\\n\\n\r\nYes. I loved Noragami Aragoto, Don't believe me? Then you clearly weren't reading. Its ability to bring so much to the table and truly distinguish itself from its predecessor is incredible and makes it so satisfying to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nIn summary, everything that matters is amazing (to me). [[Editing Note: I have no f*cking idea what that was supposed to mean.]] \\n\r\nIn summary, everything IN THIS SHOW is amazing (to me). I wholly recommend that you watch this season, even if you were ended up on the fence over the previous one, this is one of those few shows that rise above its first season and truly take you on a journey.\\n\r\nPlease, If you're even partially into this kind of genre or any neighbouring genres then this will be worth your time. Probably.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(For real, though, the intro is so f*cking good. Everything from the music to the art is just incredible, Its the f*cking theme tune to my life... if only there were any interesting points in my life that could make for good intro scenes.... /cry)",

It's divided with 2 stories which both are equally as good. The transistion between the stories continues flawless, so it doesn't feel like 2 seperate stories (eventhough they are)\r\nThe character interaction is less questionable in this season. It was really one of  the strongest points of this season. Especially the interaction between Yato and Ebisu. I never felt so much compassion for a character as Ebisu before. The other characters show more of theirpersonality, maybe it's because I see more of them now, that I understand them better now, \\n\\n\r\nOverall season 2 is as enjoyable as season 1. Which rarely happens. I'm kinda bummed the season ended with a cliffhanger about Yato's past. Can't wait for season 3!",

It was very, very funny(the ova was really funny as well).\r\nTheir is a very cool storyline and ability concept that does very good with moderate action throughout the show and there's also a very faint bit of romance. The characters really make this show, each oneis completely unique and you grow to love them all even in a short 12episodes. The art and music are very appealing and fit the eye and ears very nicely. I have high expectations to the English dub of this!\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/5. Why not 5/5? Well its kinda your typical shounen anime, but that doesn't mean that its not worth the watch. Its still very well made and a really fun watch that i think anyone would really enjoy. But i think its still missing that \"Umph\" that gives a really good anime that hook that makes it stand out from the typical to an outstanding, i have hopes that they'll find that spark in season 2 or the upcoming chapters of the manga(its still ongoing in japan as of this post).\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nWhat else to say than PERFECT! I loved the story and the plot of the second season much more than of the first one. It was intriguing, inspiring, emotional, action-loaded etc. It was really awesome. \r\nFirst of all the plot. It kinda consists of two parts. It was really surprising for Bishamonten to kinda be in the center of the story, but I loved it. You finally get the answer for the question from the first season: Why does Bishamonten hate Yato so much? It was a story about the past, which they both want to overcome in one or the otherway. Also it doesn't lack in action and epic fights. The fights between Bishamonten and Yato were so epic that I watched them over and over again. I think I don't overdo when I say they were one of the best fights I have ever seen. For all you action fans out there this is really an anime you should watch very soon.Some big swords, guns, awesome powers etc. I am sure you'll love it. Also, I have to mention how emotional the whole story is. It made me almost cry, almost. It is about trust, kindness, responsibility and family. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half is more about Yato and his past. His relationship with Nora and his father. Yes, Yato's father is also introduced but more trough the shadows, you don't see him but you get a grasp at the end, and that is exactly what I'll talk about now.  \\n\\n\r\nThe 13th episode of Noragami Aragoto. \\n\r\nThe 12th episode was definitely the highlight of the season and than the cliff-hanger in the end...I nearly died waiting for the last, 13th episode. And then...nothing...kinda. I mean it was an end but an undefined one. I don't know. The 12th episode was a BANG!, and then a sudden silence in the 13th one. And what do you think is the worst thing that the last episode of a season could have? A sad ending, a sudden death..NO! It is a immense cliff-hanger. An undefined end. A story that has not finished. I don't know if I was sad or angry at that moment. I only knew that I wanted to...cry. Still I am an optimist, and so I believe always in the best to happen, which would be season 3 of Noragami. I really wish for that to happen and until the producers of Noragami (Dentsu) announce it...well I'll probably watch some more anime and write my reviews for you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\\n\r\nAragato was definitely the season of character developments. \"Aragato\" when translated from Japanese means \"Rough Style\" and in my opinion it definitely fits the season as a name. Every character in this anime has been trough a rough past and definitely had it hard most of the time. If you have read some of my reviews before you've probably noticed how much I love and focus on character developments. I hate it when an anime does not have a single character development, especially for the mains. They get boring in time and change or a plot twist is always a good thing. Noragami Aragato hit the nail on the head when talked about characters. I loved it...What else to say! \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThis is, as I said, one of the rare anime, that were not ruined or even just worsened in the second season. Noragami aragoto was epic, I loved it and I really don't know if there is anything I could put down. Animation, Plot, Story Line, Characters, everything is perfect, I highly recommend you to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "I went into Noragami Aragoto with low expectations especially with regard to plot, seeing as the first season was a letdown in that aspect. I was therefore pleased to discover that, while not perfect, Noragami has come a long way in terms of plot and (certain) characters' development.\r\nThe story opens with the Bishamon arc, and while I don't want to drop any spoilers I'll admit that Bishamon and Yukine's growth here was enjoyable to perceive. The strengthening of trust between Yato and Yukine was really great through- up tiil episode 7 or 8 I'd say everything was close to perfect. Incidentally, the high quality ofart remains, and while I suspect the BGM from s1 has been recycled here it's not a bad match at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe second Ebisu arc was slightly more confusing, lapsing more into the narrative adopted by the first season which leaves a ton of questions unanswered and was generally quite annoying on a whole. Though it did have its moving moments, I also found myself skipping some scenes in a bid for them to just get to the point already and that's why I'm not giving s2 a higher score. That, and Hiyori's character growth is near-zero; I'm getting tired of her being the damsel in distress all the time and her inner monologue about how she can't forget them etcetc, and pretty disappointed with such a cliched, flat portrayal of a female protagonist. That coupled with the fact that the producers seem to be feeding the yato/hiyori and/or yato/yukine shippers by throwing in 'romantic' moments here and there, just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the obvious cliffhanger the season ended on (AFTER the ending song; if you're prone to skipping such things as I am DON'T), I'm pretty sure there'll be a season 3, and I'll probably give that a shot too. If you're wondering whether to pick this up, I'd urge you not to be put off by season 1's flaws (god knows I was) and give it a try!",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto is a rare case, where the second season was vastly better then its predecessor. \r\nThe plot line of both S1 and S2 is as such: In a world where Gods have power based on their following, Yato, a previous G-d of calamity, tried to build a following and right the wrongs of his past to become a respectable deity.\r\nWith that in mind, lets discuss what made S2 far superior in my eyes. \r\nSeason 2 is darker, more action packed, and far more developed. The lovable characters from season one got far more development, growth, and valuable participation in this season. They felt liketeammates more than side characters, each expressing new strengths and weaknesses. Besides Yukine and Hiyori, other deities also got far more screen time (dedicated Arcs) which were both very well done. The characters were more fluid, more compelling, and more intriguing then in the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nAnother perk to this season was the symbolism of weakness. In season one, humor was a large facet of downtime, while this season still used humor, I felt the humor was placed better, and other qualities were added to replace the unwarranted comedy of the first installment. Their was action, drama, convergent ideals, all expanded on for a truly remarkable showing.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for both seasons was very nice, and Noragami Aragoto had arguably the best OP of the season. Each character looks crisp, and the action scenes felt like they has true precision and movement. \\n\\n\r\nThe plotline for this season focused more on the Deity hierarchy and Yato's past which also was very nice for world building and character development. Yato's relations with nearly each character felt enhanced, and that the story had thickened.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was alot to offer. It had the characters and plot we already enjoyed, with added depth, darkness, development, and action. If you're looking for something with some Kick to it, that really invests you in the characters, this is my go to recommendation. If you haven't given it a shot, or your on the fence, I highly recommend you stick it out a few episodes, because if you're anything like me, you'll find it worth the wait. \\n",

This is my first ever review despite being with MAL for over 10 year.\r\nI am very fussy when it comes to anime, especially any anime that contains any  action and fight scenes as the majority suck at having an overall good plot line for anything.\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this. Not only is it funny, endearing, sweet but action-packed - but it has a to the point story line. I binged watched this and was sad when it ended. The only fall back for this anime is that, even though the plot followed a straight forward path, i feel that there are somemissing key parts ...\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler* such as to yato's past and who his father is and why was he the god of calamity. \\n\\n\r\nIt has a basis for deeper story line and it did leave me asking some questions, but a lot of other animes do this. \\n\\n\r\nAs i have stated this is my first review and I thought this anime is deserving of it's rating.",

            "content": "Out of all the series I watched this year to this point this one so far was the biggest disappointment. After final episode I was thinking \"How could this series turn into something like THIS?\".\r\nDetailed information is below.\r\nFirst, art and animation are on the same level as previous season. Characters are good looking, well animated, backgrounds are detailed. Music is... okay, but it is nothing memorable.\r\nThe problem is story and characters. I enjoyed previous season of Noragami because of unique atmosphere. In previous season there was some mystery, there were weird ayakashi, there was some sort of unique feeling of supernatural and unknown.... and therewere genuine moments of darkness and tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nIn this season, every single thing I enjoyed in previous season is gone, and the whole thing somehow degenerated in a cheap shounen anime. The story starts \"alright\" at episode one, progressively becomes worse and worse, reaches its absolute low at episode 12 (which is abysmally bad), and then episode 13 has ONE nice moment in the whole season, immediately followed by a cliffhanger. During the season, the anime hints at some VERY important details of character's past,  but ultimately doesn't elaborate, and leaves many things unexplained.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about the story is that it degenerated into completely cliched fighting anime. You have every single trick from the \"cliche book\" applied in every episode. There are characters repeating someone's name 50 times in row with shocked expressions, classic \"leave me behind! - no I can't!\", or \"we must do that very dangerous thing! - Gasp! - we're doing that very dangerous thing!\". Oh, and there are obvious villains who love talking while \"smiling in a very evil fashion\". It is beyond cringeworthy. Any interactions between two any characters in any critical scene are completely unbelievable and feel fake. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I just don't understand how something like this could happen. First season was enjoyable and displayed good potential of becoming something bigger, then 2nd season appeared and threw it all out of the window. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series are worth watching if you really, really, REALLY love Yato, or if you want to have another look at either Bishamonten, Kofuku or Hiyori.... or REALLY enjoy cliched fighting scenes. Aside from that, the anime has almost nothing to offer. It is well done, but the story ultimately ruined it. What a pity.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While many people will tell you that season 2 of noragami is WAYY better than season 1, I do agree but only to a certain extent. In fact, from the way I see it, both of them aren't really \"seasons\" per say, but just 2-3 arcs fit into a set of episodes, so when watching noragami, the highlight for me wasn't at the end of the season, but always somewhere in the middle. I'm not saying the ending is bad, but the climax really hit home in the middle that the ending in comparison is lacklustre. But why am I still giving it a 9you ask? Because I'm giving it a benefit of doubt that this show is an ongoing long ride and is far from ending. (season 3 please come out soon!!!) \\n\\n\r\nI shall assume that anyone reading review would have watched the first season, or at least have some background context about the series. Noragami appears on the surface as a fun shounen series about an unknown and broke god Yato trying to spread his name and increase his popularity among the humans. And at the beginning we brush this goal, along with his wish to get a shrine, off as another one of his silly antics, but slowly as we progress further, mysteries begin to unravel and we get glimpses of his past and we begin to understand better. Character development in noragami is absolutely top notch, and Bishamon gets the most of it in this season, along with her regalia Kazuma, and the portrayal of her dilemmas, her pain, her mistakes, her regrets, they are all done incredibly beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes in Noragami are absolute GEMS because yea its Bones we're talking about here, and there are significantly more action in aragoto than the first season so let us rejoice! My last complain would be once again Hiyori's lack of development, but I did hear that at the part where the season ends, the next arc that picks up at the manga is focused on Hiyori so I am looking forward to that! \\n\\n\r\nLastly, one thing I really love about this show is that it forces you to think deeper and question everything at surface value. It begs the question of what exactly is good and evil? It discusses the sins we humans commit, our selfishness and our greed, and the fatal consequences it may bring should we not keep it in check. But all these may just be me overthinking the anime xD But I assure you the chemistry between Yato and the rest of the gang is a joy to watch and Noragami Aragoto is definitely worth your time!",

            "content": "If you didn't like Noragami, you won't like Noragami Aragoto, because it's largely similar except in terms of character development. If you were annoyed by a whiny Yukine in Noragami, well, that's been eradicated here.\r\nStory: 6 for Fair.\r\nThe loose ends of Noragami's story will be tied up. I had quite a few questions from the first series, which were answered in this one.\r\nI now have questions pertaining to Noragami Aragoto, though. However, I'm sure that we're getting a third series of this. It's fairly popular and the ending made it seem as if there would be more.\r\nOne of the things that frustrates me about theworld of the gods is that there seems to be an exception to everything. Every rule is set in stone, until it isn't. For example, there's no way out of the underworld except for a Vent. Oh wait, there is a way out of the underworld and the solution is conveniently something beings can access. It just seems like things fall into place way too often.\\n\\n\r\nAnd okay, Yukine couldn't defeat one spirit, but he wielded powers that were BETTER than that? I know that this was done with Yato, but still, the logic to a lot of this series eludes me. And something was lost in translation because I don't understand how the Soul Call worked. I also don't understand why Ebisu wasn't pure of heart. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: both 7 for Good.\\n\\n\r\nThey were both good. Nothing to say here, except for the fact that I liked the song of the Opening Theme, and I liked the contrast in colour schemes between the opening and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 for Good.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS is where it gets better. There's major character development here. Hiyori is growing older and she doesn't focus so inwardly. Yukine's character development is immediate, intriguing, and obvious. He does have the teenage spite and many of the same desires, but his relationship with Yato has grown. \\n\\n\r\nWe discover a lot about Yato and it's all pretty interesting, in my opinion at least. There's a few loose ends that I feel they will/would pick up in the third series. Yato is also developing as a god and I genuinely hoped the best for him.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that frustrated me about Noragami was the constant bashing of Yato and everything he was, from the scarves he would wear to his aspirations. There's less of that here and I'm grateful for it, because the joke is old and tired and was never too funny to anyone, I imagine.\\n\\n\r\nYou also get a new perspective of Yato. He's a victim of gaslighting. \"You're nothing, you know nothing, everyone is always going to leave you, everyone has always abandoned you.\" And if you thought Yato was bothersome to other characters, you can see why he would be this way. Overall, the character development is the strongest point in this season and the creators didn't try to disguise their intents.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 for Great.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this series. It's addicting to watch because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 for Very Good.\\n\\n\r\nI know now what to expect from the characters and situations. I still love Yato, but I spend a lot of time trying to understand things, as well as editing my previous knowledge because there is always an exception to everything. But I recommend watching Noragami Aragoto.",

            "content": "Note: This review assumes you've read my review for the first season. Therefore, I would recommend reading that review first.\r\nOverview:\r\nThe first season of \"Noragami\" was certainly fun to watch, you couldn't help but believe that it had to think bigger with the concept. After all, in a world of god and ghosts, the possibilities are pretty much endless, right? Thankfully, Bones wasn't quite done with the series. \"Noragami Aragoto\" is the second season of the series which aired only in the autumn and winter of last year and I'm happy to report that, in several ways, this new season is even stronger than its predecessor.\r\nStory& World (8.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami Aragoto\" continues where the first season left off- Yato is still doing jobs for humans (then blowing the money on useless trinkets), Yukine continues to serve his Regalia and Hiyori continues to slip out of her body on occasion and become a half-Phantom. This time, however, the stakes are much higher as Hiyori and Yukine's worth to Yato starts to come into question, as he is still unable to escape from his dark, mysterious past. The story is split into two story arcs- the first revolves around Bishamon and her conflict with Yato, while the second revolves around Yato's past as well as the fortune god Ebisu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a huge improvement on the first season, as it greatly expands on the world of \"Noragami\", introducing many new gods as well as Takamagahara, the place where gods dwell. We also learn that gods aren't quite as above good and evil as Yato claims and that gods who commit vile acts (such as stuff involving Phantoms) are punished by a group of authoritarian gods known simply as the Heavens. The problem is that these Heavens are extremely paranoid and don't seem to be able to grasp the concept of doing the wrong things for the right reasons. However, to go into that would be a huge spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, with this season, the series finally starts to take full advantage of its awesome concept and brings some plot points from the first season to a satisfying conclusion. Add in a large amount of character development, backstory and hilarious comedy and you've got yourself a highly engrossing story that, unfortunately, ends on a cliffhanger which will leave you begging for a third season.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami Aragoto\" looks EXACTLY the same as the first season. From the characters to the environments to the Phantoms, everything about the visuals has stood completely still. And considering the first season of \"Noragami\" wasn't exactly a looker in its day, this is a problem. The rather basic character models, overuse of wacky facial expressions and occasional stiff animations look even more out of place two years down the line. That's not to say it isn't still nice to look at, with the awesome-looking Phantoms still being present. It's just that there are still all the same issues I had hoped they would have rectified.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack largely consists of tracks from the first season, but it also has more than a few new tracks, including the new opening and ending themes, just to keep things from getting stale. The voice acting is no better or worse than in the first season, and like that season I watched both the subbed and dubbed versions. I must say, though, the fact that Bryn Apprill is able to consistently match or even surpass Jason Liebrecht scene for scene, despite him being more than twice her age and been voice acting for much longer is extremely impressive. I guess you could call it natural born talent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami Aragoto\" features a ton of returning faces. Besides the main trio, we also have the God of Poverty Kofuku and her Regalia Daikoku, as well as the God of Combat Bishamon and her exemplar (as in, most treasured Regalia) Kazuma. The first arc puts a large focus on developing the latter pair. We know from the first season that Bishamon holds a serious grudge against Yato for killing her Regalias. However, it's soon revealed that the situation is a lot more complicated than it seems and that there are secrets that Kazuma has been keeping from her all these years. The arc brings Yato and Bishamon's conflict to a satisfying conclusion and results in some great development for both her and Kazuma, as well as some serious ship tease. However, there really is no denying that Bishamon is unbelievably stupid, to the point that Kazuma pretty much does all the thinking for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc focuses on developing Yato as he deals with his past. While in the first season, he came off as a greedy buffoon who did jobs for humans just so he could build a shrine and be worshipped by the masses, here his desire for a shrine is cast in a much more sympathetic light. He is also forced to settle matters with his childhood friend-turned-stalker, Nora. At the same time, Yukine also has to deal with serious insecurities, questioning his worth as Yato's Regalia due to him having another Regalia for much longer (Nora). He also becomes an advisor to Yato, due to being his exemplar in the same vein that Kazuma is to Bishamon.\\n\\n\r\nAnother focus is the ever-growing feelings between Yato and Hiyori. While there were hints there was a romance blossoming between the two in the first season, it is proven beyond doubt. Hiyori's desire to become fully human again hasn't changed, but even so she refuses to sever her ties with Yato (which would cause her to forget all the time she spent with him and Yukine) just so she can spend more time with him. At one point, Yato even says that he'll make Hiyori the happiest girl in the world. And while Hiyori doesn't do an awful lot in the way of fighting (though she certainly can if she has to), she does definitely help out Yato in other ways. Ultimately, the characters in general are brilliant, though Hiyori and Yato are easily my favourites.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nWhile the first season was very enjoyable, it could also be a bit boring due to the lack of anything significant happening for several episodes. Not true for this new season. This time, every single episode adds something new and the story is always moving forward, though the constant cliffhangers could get rather annoying. The comedy is also arguably even funnier than in the first season, especially considering none of Yato's friends seem to have any faith in him (when Hiyori sees Yato with a pile of money, her first thought is that he robbed a bank). This is definitely something you will want to see to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe first season of \"Noragami\" was certainly great in its own right, but \"Noragami Aragoto\" is easily superior. It's far more fast-paced and takes full advantage of the series' great concept, as well as giving us some great character development and the same hilarious comedy, only better. Unfortunately, the season ends on a serious cliffhanger, so hopefully we will be getting a third season sometime in the near future. In the meantime, if you enjoyed the first season, there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't watch this one. I guarantee you will be rewarded.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+8+9+9+9=43.5/50=8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Series Score: 8.5/10",

            "content": "tl;dr: A sequel that focused more on a stronger narrative and character development instead of comedy and lighthearted moments, and manages to mostly do well in that regard.\r\nAs one would expect, this is a direct continuation of\u00a0Nouragami, though one that plays out differently in that rather than a lot of smaller episodes it simply has two large arcs that much better tie into a larger narrative. The first arc is related to\u00a0Yato\u00a0and\u00a0Bishamon's\u00a0conflict, how it came to be centered around Bishamon's insecurities, and\u00a0Bishamon\u00a0growing such that she can overcome it when things start falling apart around her once more. This arc was much more focused on\u00a0Bishamon\u00a0and herregalia, because while\u00a0Yato\u00a0obviously was the target of her anger and the other half of the conflict between them, the conflict turns out to be pretty one sided, with\u00a0Yato\u00a0not actually having much of a personal stake in it. This is fine though, because\u00a0Bishamon\u00a0and Kazuma are both amazing characters, and while\u00a0Yato\u00a0and\u00a0Yukine\u00a0aren't invested enough for it to have any depth,\u00a0there's\u00a0still some strong development there too.\u00a0The second arc was a bit\u00a0messier, having what I felt like\u00a0were\u00a0two sides. The first revolved around\u00a0Yato\u00a0and Ebisu, and the relationship between them. This results in really strong character development for Ebisu, centered\u00a0around his desires, goals,\u00a0and what it meant to live,\u00a0which\u00a0results in growth in\u00a0Yato\u00a0in response as well. All of which is\u00a0beautifully\u00a0handled. The issue is the other half, wherein this arc also seems to focus heavily on\u00a0Yato's\u00a0past and background as well as how that impacts his relationship with\u00a0Yukine\u00a0and Hiyori. However, this entire portion felt like it didn't really come through all that well, and\u00a0ultimately,\u00a0I didn't feel his decision on how to deal with Nora was developed\u00a0properly at all, in\u00a0that it\u00a0actually\u00a0felt like it developed things in the opposite direction of what Yato actually decides to do. The cliffhanger concerning this also felt really out of place even for a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot was engrossing and very fast paced from beginning to end, the type of show that makes you want to watch through each arc all at once. However, because of this the comedy portion found in the previous season was heavily took a\u00a0back seat\u00a0this season and had very little presence. The action also didn't really develop any further, still being pretty random. The art and animation were still solid. The soundtrack was still really good, and the OP/ED were also good.\u00a0",

            "content": "Hey kids, go crazy because Noragami got a second season!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI was really looking forward to Noragami Aragoto from the moment it was announced, and I started counting down the days until the premiere.\r\nI'm going to say right off the bat that I have read the manga--I read it shortly after season 2 was announced and have reread it since Aragoto began to refresh my memory. I am going to be judging the anime based on adaptation quality since it's only fair to do so, but I'm going to do my best not to let my biases get in the way.\r\nSeason 1 adapted only theintroduction arc and the Yukine arc, so with this season we get to the really good stuff.\\n\r\nAragoto starts right off with adapting the Bishamon arc of the manga, which has a storytelling style like a high-stakes action thriller, and is, as a friend of mine said, a bit like a Western in some of the things it does. As the first major arc of the manga, finally anime-only fans get to see the real power that Noragami's story has. Cliffhanger after cliffhanger makes this arc what it is, as well as a lot of shock value added in. I don't mean shock value in a bad way at all, by the way. Noragami's really good about using it at appropriate times without making it seem overbearing or coming out of nowhere.\\n\r\nI've also seen some people commenting that this arc is more like a \"standard shounen\" formula, but I have to disagree on that because of the structure of the story. Sure, there's fighting going on, but it's not all about the big fight. There's plenty of time for character development and backstory, as well as a lot of exposition to set up said fight.\\n\r\nAnyway, the Bishamon arc was perfectly done, really. Very few things were dropped from the manga (and those that were weren't anything major), and certain scenes I'd been so excited to see animated were done PERFECTLY. One episode in particular was so beautifully done that I had chills the whole time, not to mention that it also happened to be the best part of the arc. Seeing it fully animated was surreal to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bishamon arc is a solid 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show is where we start to run into some problems. I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to adapt the Underworld arc due to how long I thought it was (in hindsight, it's only slightly longer than the Bishamon arc and nowhere near the monster that is the current manga arc). As it turns out, they had just enough time to adapt everything in the arc. Or, they would have, if they hadn't started to severely rush things at some parts, and drag other things out too long. They did end it at the best possible spot thankfully, but took some very roundabout routes to get there.\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of the first season OVA's. Without going too much into detail, those silly chapters that connected the Bishamon and Underworld arcs weren't just throwaway comic relief. Both ended up being important in this arc, and thus Bones had to deal with their mistake. I thought they'd incorporate clips from the OVA's to sum up the events without making it seem like you NEEDED to watch them to understand what was happening. But instead, Bones had to come up with all-new reasons for why that character was doing that, resulting in some messy cutting and replacing. Some parts felt a little weak, due to this error.\\n\\n\r\nAt least there was no anime-original this time, though. My friends and I were quite worried they were going that route near the last few episodes where things were going too fast, but Bones fixed their mistakes for the most part. There's some pretty important details that got cut, and by changing some other things for no real reason they created plot holes. There was also something they added which felt like a deus ex machina, and once again there was no need for it to be there.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did Bones make these changes? Most likely, they did it so that they could rearrange the brief fight near the end of the Underworld arc to be right at the end and thus have an action-packed finale. However, in doing so, they ruined the dramatic irony that plays a BIG role in this arc and very nearly screwed themselves over to the point where season 3 would never be possible. Thankfully, they fixed it, but there's still the matter of some big things being cut and rearranged for the sake of having a fight near the end. I really don't think adapting the Underworld arc faithfully would have felt underwhelming at all though. The arc is plenty strong on its own and I doubt it would have left audiences unsatisfied, like \"That fight should have been at the end!\" It has a solemn and humbling ending, and there's also the major use of dramatic irony I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one scene in the Underworld arc though, that was so perfectly animated I actually started crying while watching it. That's what an adaptation should be: Taking the original idea, transferring it perfectly, and maybe adding a subtle touch that doesn't seem overbearing. Unfortunately not the whole season was so, but on the other hand all my favorite scenes were kept intact. Said scene should also have been the end of an episode because of the mood of it, but the way they rearranged things, there wasn't much of a choice in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason the art section gets a 9 rather than a 10 is because of some weird animation slip-ups. I am glad they saved the budget for the fight scenes though, because it's pretty worth it to see the battles with such nice character animation. Other than that, there's moments where the characters move less than they probably should, or where their faces are blank despite not really being in the background of the scene. I also felt the colors got duller as the season drew on, whereas the beginning had really vibrant ones.\\n\r\nSpeaking of vibrant, the ED this time around has very bright colors. It works really well in contrast to the muted colors of season 1's ED. A great thing about this one, too, is that the animations are perfectly synchronized down to the last frame. If you watch the ED's side by side, the running animation of Yato and Hiyori line up perfectly so they appear to be running toward each other. It's a really nice and subtle detail that almost made me cry when I first saw it.\\n\r\nThe opening also has better animation than the first season's, and it also uses the same color scheme--monochrome characters, with the eyes colored in, and really bright blue and orange backgrounds. There's also a few parallels animation-wise with the first OP, but not as much as the ED. Bones also cleverly slipped in some foreshadowing (I recommend rewatching it if you finished this season), as well as a subtle frame you're only going to see if you hit pause at the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for this season, Kyouran Hey Kids, is probably my top favorite anime opening for anything ever. Never have I hit repeat on a song so much, and it doesn't get old. This opening was pretty much love at first sight too--from the moment I first heard it in one of the trailers, I thought it sounded good, and actually seeing the full thing was instant love. The lyrics also have the added bonus of matching up to the opening sequences, thus making it seem pretty ship-teasing.\\n\r\nThe song has an extremely catchy chorus, and also features heavy electric guitar. Stylistically, it's quite similar to the first season OP, but Kyouran Hey Kids has all the verve that Goya no Machiawase lacked, and now that opening seems tame in comparison.\\n\r\nThis band hasn't done any other anime openings or endings, but judging by the work they did here, I see a bright future ahead of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, Nirvana, is performed by the same girl who did Heart Realize for season 1. I think I like this one better too, because it's a more upbeat song that fit for this season, and also felt pretty insulting after some of the more painful episodes. The lyrics are also extremely relevant to the character development and the direction the story takes, as an added bonus for all us manga readers out there.\\n\r\nTia has a great voice, and it's really hard to believe she's only about 20. She performed the first season ED while she was still in high school, so I definitely see a bright future ahead of her too. If Noragami gets a third season, I'd love to hear her perform the ED for that as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is another thing that leveled up this season. While all your favorite weird yet good tracks from season 1 make a comeback, Noragami Aragoto also features a whopping 36 new tracks that add to an already amazing OST. This season uses more strings combined with the electronica/synthiness you heard last season, which is an interesting mix that works. It's only fitting to use orchestral music for such scenes, and I'm glad they did. Iwasaki Taku doesn't often go this route, but when he does it hits really hard, and this worked perfectly for the more emotional scenes this season. All of the tracks in this season's OST are really memorable and all are worth a listen. While the first season could be hit or miss depending on your taste, the Aragoto OST comes off as more universally appealing, particularly where the emotional songs are concerned.\\n\r\nBecause I'm a sucker for orchestral stuff, my favorite tracks from this OST are the ones with a lot of that. Two of my favorites are titled \"Pain\" and \"Obsessed,\" which coincidentally sums up this season and my personal viewing experience. Some other ones I really like are \"Zen,\" \"Footstep,\" and \"Yomi.\"\\n\r\nIwasaki Taku also composed a remix for one of the weirder songs in season 1, \"Noratan.\" The remix is really good, and is also titled as the \"Love Noragami Remix,\" so I think it's safe to say he knows his fanbase.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting. So the sub is perfect, obviously. Hiroshi Kamiya, who's sort of a god himself, is great to hear as Yato once more. He does a high-pitched silly voice for the comedy moments, and a deep voice for the serious ones. He really makes Yato come to life with his acting.\\n\r\nThe acting was really solid the whole time, especially so during some of the more dramatic scenes. My favorite scenes from the Bishamon and Underworld arcs had just the right amount of emotion, and as an added bonus it tears at the heartstrings too.\\n\r\nThere's some really good work from the voice actors of Bishamon and Kazuma, who didn't have as much screentime in season 1, but who were primarily the focus of the first half of this season. Newcomers to the show, such as Ebisu, also had really solid voice acting all around.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the sub, I also have to talk about the dub. I'm almost tempted to knock the overall sound score down a few points just to demonstrate how I feel about it, but just know I'm not counting the dub's score into the total.\\n\r\nSo the dub of this show could have been REALLY good, considering all the big-name voice actors in the sub, as well as the emotional scenes that require a solid dramatic performance. However, Funimation's work on this is merely mediocre. Yukine and Bishamon are the only two good voices out of the entire cast, the rest of whom range from average to just plain bad. Funimation did a broadcast dub of Aragoto, as I figured they would due to the show's popularity, but it's really not doing much for me. Because it was done so shortly after the first season got dubbed, all the characters sound the same, which is both good and bad. Good that there were no noticeable changes, bad in that the acting is still pretty atrocious at some points. Some of the casting is still just as cringe-worthy as last time, too.\\n\r\nThere's also some awkwardness that came out of dropping the honorifics, which led to words being spoken too fast or too slow. One particularly awkward moment was Kugaha's \"Hiiiiiyori-chan\" line in the sub being changed to \"Hiiiiiiiyorihithere.\" I get a huge kick out of that part, but not for the reasons I should.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, my favorite episode of the series was done completely perfectly. It's even more heartbreaking to hear it in English, and for once the voice acting was perfectly on point. Even the characters whose voices I don't really like sounded good in this episode, though it was mostly carried by Bishamon's voice actor who did a phenomenal job. She was already perfectly cast, and this episode only reinforced that. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more I could say about the dub, but I don't want this to turn into a rant, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character score being knocked down a point is solely due to the anime cutting out and changing some important moments that shouldn't have been because I'm a salty manga reader.\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot of room for development this season. While the first season only had time with the Yukine arc, both arcs in this season give heavy development to the main and supporting cast. Yato's probably the one who gets the most development, but there's quite a lot for Hiyori and Yukine too. There's also a strong focus on developing Bishamon, Kazuma, and Ebisu as the protagonists of their respective arcs. Nora gets some development later on too.\\n\\n\r\nYato, starting off as a bit of a jerk and inappropriately obnoxious, with a dark past as a god of calamity, works on bettering himself this season. He starts to correct himself when he steps out of line, and takes action to distance himself from his history and instead tries to be someone to make Hiyori happy. Yato's all around a great protagonist, and there's a lot more to say about him, but that involves spoilers.\\n\r\nYukine was a selfish brat at the beginning of season 1, and due to the events of both this season and the last, we see him grow into a strong and selfless Regalia for Yato. Honestly, if you only credit season 2 as showing \"less of his bratty side\" then you're missing the whole point of all the development he went through. Characters, changing as people? Shocking.\\n\r\nHiyori, meanwhile, is cast less as the damsel in distress as she was in season 1 (more specifically the anime-original arc), and instead becomes a girl who takes action to care for the ones she loves and to keep herself close to Yato and Yukine. There's a slight aside to the anime-original arc, which was a nice touch to show the small amount of development Hiyori got, but other than that they pretend it never happened, and it's for the better this way.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, there's also a lot of development for Bishamon and Kazuma, as the first half of this season is focused on them. We get to find out what exactly transpired between them and Yato in the past, as all those long-ago events become important again and come to a head in this arc.\\n\r\nNoragami also has a great and continuous habit of introducing characters that will be important in the next arc--this is why the two of them weren't showcased as much in season 1, because their arc hadn't arrived yet, but there also wasn't the problem of suddenly adding new characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of the villain. Saying anything about the villain at all runs the risk of spoilers, so I'll have to content myself with saying that the reveal was handled quite well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI had so much fun with Noragami Aragoto; probably more fun than I've had with any of the other shows I've seen. It was a wonderful treat to see a new episode every Friday, to watch it and freak out over the stuff that was animated, and to read the reactions of the non-manga readers.\\n\r\nI'd said prior to the first episode that I was really hyped for this season, but I could in no way predict the storm of emotions that hit when I watched the premiere with a friend of mine. We pretty much suffered simultaneous heart attacks for the entirety of the episode, literally screamed at all the foreshadowing in the opening and ending, and were barely coherent afterward. And that was only the first episode, which in hindsight was little more than an introduction to get the ball rolling.\\n\r\nAnyway, my friend and I proceeded to get all of our other friends into the series so that we could have the whole group as into it as we were. We also discussed the manga nonstop, rewatched the episodes, drew massive amounts of fanart, got together as often as possible to watch the new episodes, and participated in the fandom, making some new friends. All of this, combined with the actual experience of watching the episodes, made it that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI also take this time to suggest that you read the manga. Absolutely loved Aragoto with all your heart? Read the manga. Liked this season but thought some parts were weak? Read the manga. Thought the characters were cool but the story had major flaws? Manga. Didn't really like it at all? Manga's still worth a shot. Haven't watched this season yet? Read the manga first.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything can make it into the anime, and thus the little details that got dropped (Hiyori's fundraiser, Yato's fixation on Capyper Land, Yukine's various cute and dorky outfits, Kazuma's weird obsession with Bishamon, the list goes on) are all worth reading it for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, despite the screwups with the anime, these were the best and most painful 13 Fridays I've experienced, and I'm really sad that it's over now (having the finale air on Christmas was a kind of trauma all on its own). I had a lot of fun with Noragami Aragoto and I'm so sad to see it go, but of course there's still the OVA in March to look forward to, and the slim but possible chance of a season 3 in the future. Pray to Yato to make it happen!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nVery good and substantial. Only little deviations were made, making it more closely paced with the original work. Bridging the last season and this season is very well done (considering the small deviation in the first season's ending). I honestly like this one more than the manga (in terms of portrayal) since it was more appreciable (to me anyway). Bishamonten and Ebisu's arcs are not my fave in the manga, but after watching this it changed my mind. Truly awesome.\r\nArt:\r\nSoft textured drawings. Similar to the manga. Good animation (esp the fighting scenes, oh I so love them). I'm the type who watches anime regardless ofthe art, so I can't say a lot of things about this but I can assure you one thing: it's not sloppily made. I actually liked how it was drawn since it give off this sense of familiarity.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAwesome opening and closing themes. \"Hey kids!\" give off that action-packed anime feels plus it has that catchy beat that I can't help but love. \"Nirvana\" has the same feels with \"Heart Realize\" (last season's closing theme). Sweet, cute, cuddly, and adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nStrong female lead (Hiyori), hilarious and incredible male lead (Yato), and adorable second male lead (Yukine). If you love them last season, then you will still love them this season hehe. I have a pick of my new fave character as well (since they truly are amazing in this season) like Kazuma, Kofuku, and Ebisu. Oh my, young Ebisu is so cute I could die. Bishamonten is pretty awesome here too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAbsolutely enjoyed this show. Even enjoyed this more than the manga (pertaining to the respective arcs but the manga overall is still awesome hehe). This is my best pick last season.\\n\\n\r\nRated this 10/10 in MAL (personal taste hehe) but for now I'll go with 9/10. If you're looking for an action-packed anime with a lot of hilarious scenes that will make your heart flutter (sadly, the romance element wasn't emphasized but nevertheless it's still awesome), has a share of gore and blood (just a little bit), and drama I guess (well a small share too), then you definitely have to watch this. Time wasted while watching this is not even considered wasted time at all. Highly recommended. You didn't even need to read the manga for you to get a grip of things. But make sure you watch the first season (if you still haven't) to avoid unnecessary confusion.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's it. Ciao.",

            "content": "Noragami Aragoto has recently concluded and in my personal opinion improved on the franchise, however before this review I'd like to address 2 complaints I usually saw about the 1st season and have carried over to the 2nd.\r\nIf you wanna go straight to the review, go to [REVIEW]\r\nI see some people bashing this show for \"poor writing\" and \"nonsensical characters\" the Deities and Yukine being the target of most of these complaints.\r\nI've watched about 350 anime and at least from what I've seen (and what has been coming out the last 5 years) Aragoto's writing is at least above average, I could be wrong butcalling it \"poor\" makes me think that these people have really unreasonable and biased metrics (you can correct me by providing me with 100+ exceptionally written anime, in which case yeah Aragoto's writing wouldn't measure up beyond the \"mean\") \\n\r\nAs for the character complaints, you have a teenage boy, coping with the fact that he is dead and will probably never get to live like a human while being essentially a human being with human needs, I'm not sure what people (who have met real humans)actually expected from Yukine's character. \\n\r\nAnd as for the Deities, they are beings literally brought forth by people's wishes. They are meant to be how they are, they are meant to maintain a certain personality, Aragoto even explores that fact through the reincarnated characters as they have to learn their history and even exhibit that their core beliefs always transfer over. With all that out of the way.\\n\\n\r\n[REVIEW]\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Aragoto explores many themes & things, introduced in the previous season, as well introducing new ones. The story is divided in two main Arcs, the 1st one focuses on Bishamon and the internal struggle in her clan, things escalate and Yato is brought into the fold, this arc is rather juicy in terms of revelations and character interactions and does a great job of moving the characters forward. The 2nd arc gets us a bit deeper into Yato's dark past and what his life has been up to this point. We really get to see Yato's internal conflict all leading up to its resolution. While the story arcs are engaging and help the characters move forward, as well as making the story more exciting, I couldn't help but feel that the show was a bit rushed in some instances. I haven't read the manga up to that point, but I feel that the show could have benefited from a bigger episode count. The final episode was gratifying, it offered a resolution to a central plot point and it made me feel pretty excited for what's to come. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn this season the show focuses heavily on the beings of the Far Shore, specifically the Regalia, while I can't say much without spoiling, I can say that character interactions have gotten better since last season, the main ( and some of the supporting ) cast really get a chance to shine in the various situations, and you actually get to see Yato and Yukine grow both individually and as a God & Shinki unit. Hiyori and the rest of the cast both go through their own minor character arcs, but Yato and Yukine are definitely the ones taking the spotlight. We get to know a bit more about the Heavens and the relationships between the various deities and we get some really nice new characters introduced one of which actually caught me off-guard !! It's nice to see the characters being explored on a deeper level, but much like the story some characters seem to not get enough screen time, which sometimes diminishes their impact on both the story and the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs expected  by bones, presentation is top notch, backgrounds are detailed, lighting and color effects are put to great use, taking advantage of the variable settings,atmospheres and tones the show features. Combat & action scenes are fluid and well animated, with directing being the only thing that occasionally feels off. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above Noragami features a variety in settings, atmospheres and tone. The reason that it's able to pull it off so well is in no small part due to its soundtrack. Tracks seem to match their scenes perfectly, to the point where music might actually tip you off as to what may happen(which depending on the individual may bea good or a bad thing), tracks are used to reflect the characters' emotional states in some occasions which I found to have an enhancing effect on their interactions. Voice acting is pretty good, the seiyuus for Yato and Yukine make a really good job capturing the characters emotions and their intensity, the rest of the performances while good are not really anything outstanding, my only comment being that they \"fit well\" their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series and the manga, I really enjoyed Aragoto, the show kept a consistent quality across the board. Story was engaging and decently paced ( even if ti felt a bit rushed at times). Characters were delightful and entertaining, the show did a great job showcasing the main cast and developing them further and very importantly gave us a gratifying ending while setting fire to our anticipation for the show's continuation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "I have to say, in my completely biased opinion (yes this review will not be objective), this season of Noragami was AWESOME! Each episode had me on the edge of my seat and eager for the next week. All the comedy that Noragami fans enjoyed from the first season was there, except there were less silly Yato emotes and much more action!  There really was not any filler episodes that I can remember of, which is never a bad thing. I do have to say I was a bit worried about where the season was headed from the first episode, which was imo theweakest from some of the pointless exposition that we had already been exposed to in season 1 anyways, but the next twelve episodes made up for that in a big way. Yato, as always, is a very entertaining to watch and an absolute favorite (hence the avatar name). I really enjoyed seeing more character development between Yato, Yukine, and Hiori; aka the characters that drive the entire show. Also the other gods Bishamon and Ebisu were surprisingly enjoyable. *MINOR SPOLIER HERE* One of my favorite aspects of the show was the fact that we find out how Bishamon and Yato became such visceral enemies, and that was something left out in the first season that was exciting to learn about this time around. And that big reveal at the end?!? If my hopes are realized there will be much more Noragami to be had in the future, especially with the way they ended this season!",

            "content": "As an avid fan of the first season, I expected this season to be as amazing as the first and I'm very happy to admit that Noragami Aragoto did not disappiont. \r\nSTORY(8/10):\r\n I haven't read the manga so I don't know if the second season follows the manga, but there is everything in this department which you loved about the first season. Action, comedy, romance(more than the first season *wink wink*) and....YATO! The story is divided into two major arcs. The first arc centers around Bishamon and the second arc around Ebisu, a God of Commerce/Fortune. The first arc is pretty well done. Also theaction and the fighting scenes are amazingly handled. The second arc simmers down for me a bit but it is in no way lacking. Sure, the tension and the grabbing-the-edge-of-your-seat feeling takes time to build to finally climax into a good end but the first arc is better. \\n\\n\r\nART (10/10): The visuals for Noragami are beautiful and pleasing to look at. Everything from the background to the character designs is handled perfectly and shows intricacy. The eyes are alluring especially Yato's incandescent ones.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10): As was typical of the first season, an amazing OST has been provided to us in Aragoto. The OP carries the same upbeat tunes and adrenaline rushing effects as was true for the OP of season 1. The ED is fluid and calming.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER(10/10): For most anime nowadays, I think this is a tricky goal to achieve. Usually you can't make all the characters perfectly lovable and sometimes an attempt to \"sweeten\" up some characters tends to have the opposite effect making them unbearably obnoxious. Noragami here, I have to say, has some of the most amazing characters I have come across in anime. Yato, Hiyori, Yukine, Bishamon, Kofuku, Ebisu; you name it. Every character(even the Gods) are  characterized beautifully and are sometimes  found to show surprisingly humane flaws which is a good thing as this might help you relate more with the character at hand and sympathize with them. Also the humor you get out of these characters is bound to make you at least smile if not laugh once in awhile. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT (9/10): While my review sings praises for this anime, I have not supplied it with a 10 because I think it is reserved for an almost perfectly flawless anime which, in all fairness to Noragami, aren't that easy to find; at least not in my opinion. So even though, Aragoto has been an enjoyable ride there were places I feel could have been improved upon. Like the anime has kind of an inconclusive end(which very well may be a third season advertising) but things aren't as neatly tied up and presented to the viewers as I would've liked it too. I won't mention what events didn't receive a perfect conclusion but there are pointers that were left unexplained.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this sequel is not one to miss if you loved the first season. This anime promises you an enthralling ride.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal Scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10 Same as previous. Standard 2010ish era style. Crisp and clean as usual with this style, but no impressive detail. \r\nAnimation: 7/10 Action scenes were of the same quality as the previous season. This one didn't use that dumb fancy speech sequence too much this time so that was a plus. This season focused less on slaying the phantoms and more on actual meaningful fights. Even then there wasn't anything too noteworthy about the animation in this. It's about average for an action show.\r\nCharacters: 5/10 Pretty much the same cast with the addition of a few forgettable names.Character designs weren't memorable. Main girl's in a school uniform. Yato looks like he's homeless. Typical cutely dressed, pink hair'd girl with a perky and aloof external atmosphere but with the typical hidden edgy/serious persona. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10 Focuses less on the standard monster slaying and more on the development of characters and backstories. Still refuses to develop anything meaningful between Yato and Hiyori which ultimately leaves Hiyori in the same stupid spot as last season as the backseat tough damsel in distress. \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 5/10 Fleshes out Bishamon fully which is what was supposed to be done in S1. 2nd half of the show is some stupid arc with Ebisu and a final reveal at another big boss, Yato's dad I guess. 2nd half should have focused on strengthening Yuki's relationship with Yato as well as finalize some sort of feelings or resolution between Yato and Hiyori. The 2nd half of this S2 was spent on some pointless side-quest filler mission with some pointless development on Ebisu and Yato. There was even a reveal at Yato's real name and had potential in some real character dynamics and relationship growth among the 3 main cast, but no, it spent 2 whole episodes on some stupid relationship with Ebisu and trying to make us feel bad for Ebisu. Who cares about that loser even if it pulled some new plot point out of its ass with that whole Yato's dad using Ebisu as a scapegoat thing. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 4/10 Same music as S1 which is so low effort. Might as well have made Noragami into a single release rather than two separate seasons. I understand strategic season timing and scheduling constraints but the music gets old if the situation is 2 separate seasons. I would have been fine with the repetitive music if it was just a single 24 episode release, but if you're gonna make it two separate seasons at least mix it up a bit. No sound design to address.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 Open-ended with an epilogue with a cliffhanger. This type of open-ended ending was okay for the way the story played out at the end. It was able to pull out a reasonable explanation and resolution at the end to make this open-ended ending \"fine.\" The epilogue was stupid, uninspiring, and didn't hype me up at all. Rather, it made me disgusted at the idea of there being more of this storytelling and plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 Didn't mix up the standard supernatural monster slaying with my friends setup from S1. Same music, same bland cast. Did a decent job at improving at my gripes from S1 in which I wanted more character and backstory development. Still leaves the main issue unsolved which is any meaningful resolution or foundation between Yato and Hiyori; it's literally the first plot point introduced and LITERALLY stated as the sole thing holding their relationship together. That right there is enough for me to just give this a 4. It's so dumb. This anime does a real good job at making me annoyed and blatantly continues to tease about ACTUALLY making some progress in Yato and Hiyori's relationship. In other words, Yato and Hiyori's relationship is pretty much the same as it was in episode 2 or 3 in S1. Overall this is a standard romance-strip-tease supernatural monster slaying setup that did nothing to branch out, be interesting, be different or unique from the rest. Unmemorable. 5/10 The OP and ED were the only thing this had going for it lol\\n\\n\r\nRevised: 9-5-18 at 13:04 PST",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI will not go into too much detail on this review because \"Noragami Aragoto\" is a direct sequel to \"Noragami\" and practically all the sections follow the same line without changing too much. I will just comment on a few interesting new points, but they will be minor things. If you want to know in detail what I think of \"Noragami\", read my review of the first season.\r\nI have noticed that moments of humour (especially absurd \"Gintama-like\" humour) have decreased their presence in this second season. I guess there are some people who like this, not me. Basically because I thinkthat the humor of \"Noragami\" is quite good and adds variety and nuances to the development of the plot, apart from giving the whole its own personality, making it stand out from the cloned shonens of the moment. Luckily, they have not eliminated it, but my impression has been that they have reduced its importance and presence.\\n\\n\r\nIn return, I would say that the argument in general is better, more interesting and solid than in the first round of episodes. The two differentiated storylines (Bishamon and Ebisu/Underworld) are well laid out, with an almost perfect rhythm and development. Yato is gaining in importance and that probably causes Hiyori and Yukine (of whom I still don't like his pre-teen personality) to lose some weight in the plot. Let no one be confused, they are still the main protagonist trio, I am speaking only of a proportion of importance among themselves. In addition, there are secondary characters like Kazuma, Bishamon or Ebisu that become indispensables. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is still as spectacular as ever is the technical section. That includes the artistic one, with a sober, but very clean and detailed character design, with highest quality, especially for a shonen. And also the sound section, with a spectacular soundtrack. Very varied (ethnic melodies, electronic melodies, rock tones, classical...) and at a very high level. The opening (very good refrain) and the ending may not stand out so much, but they don't clash either.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Version (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nAviso a navegantes: no me voy a explayar demasiado con esta rese\u00f1a porque \"Noragami Aragoto\" es una secuela directa de \"Noragami\" y pr\u00e1cticamente todos los apartados siguen la misma l\u00ednea sin cambiar excesivamente. Me limitar\u00e9 a comentar alg\u00fan que otro punto novedoso que sea interesante, pero ser\u00e1n cosas menores. Si quieres saber en detalle lo que pienso de \"Noragami\", lee mi rese\u00f1a sobre la primera temporada.\\n\\n\r\nHe notado que los momentos de humor (especialmente de humor absurdo a lo Gintama) han disminuido su presencia en esta segunda temporada. Supongo que habr\u00e1 gente a la que esto le agrade, a m\u00ed personalmente no. B\u00e1sicamente porque creo que el humor de \"Noragami\" es bastante bueno y a\u00f1ade variedad y matices al desarrollo de la trama, aparte de dotar al conjunto de personalidad propia, haciendo que se desmarque de los shonens cl\u00f3nicos de turno. Por suerte no lo han eliminado, pero mi impresi\u00f3n ha sido que s\u00ed le han restado importancia y presencia.\\n\\n\r\nA cambio, dir\u00eda que el argumento en general es mejor, m\u00e1s interesante y s\u00f3lido, que en la primera tanda de episodios. Los dos arcos argumentales diferenciados (Bishamon y Ebisu/Inframundo) est\u00e1n bien planteados, con un ritmo y un desarrollo casi perfectos. Yato gana importancia y probablemente eso provoca que Hiyori y Yukine (del que sigue sin convencerme su personalidad preadolescente) pierdan algo de peso en la trama. Que nadie se confunda, siguen siendo el tr\u00edo protagonista, hablo solo de una proporci\u00f3n de importancia entre ellos mismos. Adem\u00e1s, hay secundarios como Kazuma, Bishamon o Ebisu que se convierten en imprescindibles. Otros como la adorable Kofuku siguen al pie del ca\u00f1\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nLo que s\u00ed contin\u00faa tan espectacular como siempre es el apartado t\u00e9cnico. Eso incluye el art\u00edstico, con un dise\u00f1o de personajes sobrio, pero limp\u00edsimo y detallado, de grand\u00edsima calidad, especialmente para ser un shonen. Y tambi\u00e9n el apartado sonoro, con una banda sonora espectacular. Variad\u00edsima (melod\u00edas \u00e9tnicas, electr\u00f3nicas, de tintes rockeros, cl\u00e1sica...) y a un nivel alt\u00edsimo. El opening (muy buen estribillo) y el ending quiz\u00e1 no destaquen tanto, pero tampoco desentonan.",

The art is lovely and the sound is good. The cleansing sequence is a bit repetitive but cool.\r\nThese mysteries and many others are never answered.

            "content": "As always, I usually come back to an anime one year later to see how it held up. Noragami Aragoto had little change, but there are definitely some things that I had missed my last watch, so let's talk about that.\r\nNoragami Aragoto! An anime about a gods, betrayals, and ghosts. It follows the story of Yato and Bishamon as they clash sword and whips for the last time as Bishamon learns the real reason of why she hates Yato. And of course Hiyori is back with her tail as she saves Yato and intervenes in godly quarrels. And Kofuku is still best girl.\r\nAnyways, the animeis split between two \"arcs.\" The first one is the fight with Yato and Bishamon, the second is more on the masks and their true origins. But really, if I'm going to be honest, I loved the first half, while the second half felt majorly rushed. Honestly though, this anime desperately needed more episodes, it felt far too fast and not enough detail was drawn out of the second half, almost like I was cheated. The characters do improve over the first season, however. As we get to see Yukine learn more about himself and get stronger, and even Hiyori learn that she's not so special after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art were both pretty good, but then again nothing special. I really do enjoy the OP of this anime, and the art style is great, but sometimes reverts to that weird \"mush\" look that just doesn't go well with everything else. The details could have been better too.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall I'd say this anime still lives up the the hype, even though it felt rushed. I recommend you watch this one, but try not to binge watch this anime in one go; savor every episode and really soak it in, it's a good watch!",

            "content": "Perhaps the Bones took the comments in the last review to heart or something but the second season of Noragami is an improvement by leaps and bounds. Yes, you still have the same cast and setting but it is just much more focused and thus leaves a much stronger impression. Now that all the character explications have been taken care of in the first season, this season is roughly divided into two arcs exploring other gods, namely Bishamon and Ebisu, both gods of fortune. Bishamon has a nasty past with Yato and it's all fully explained here. The second arc focuses more on the reincarnationand the \"life cycle\", if you will, of the gods. All in all, it's an action packed season that has all the coolness of the first season while dropping the whiny aspects of Yukine. If you've watched the first season of this you really shouldn't skip out on this one, even if (like me) the first season left a bitter aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt might just be me but I felt this season was a bit more consistently drawn than the last season. Other than that, you can expect a very similar style to the previous season with crazy Ayakashis and lots of effects. Most of the important characters are easily recognizable though there are way too many supportive shinki in the show. There are a lot of additional new characters in the show as well, including a shinki with a striking resemblance to Jiraiya from Naruto. Expressions still aren't the best but, given the low bar set by the previous season, they're not bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles will definitely be one of the selling points of the season with lots of action and tension- this time spread out throughout the show rather than being concentrated in a particular arc. Expect heavy bleeding and some amputations (though shinki are already technically dead...). While Yato's annoyingly long final move prep sequence does get repetitive, he doesn't spam it as much as in the previous season. Luckily, you get some variety here as other gods also show more of their cards this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a fittingly fast-paced rock OP; it isn't particularly melodic but fits the chaotic and action-heavy nature of the show. The ED is more of a cool down piece with a light melody. The BGM includes many familiar tunes from the previous season, maintaining the vocodized sound of battles and mystery moments.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Sawashiro gets a much expanded role this season so expect to hear her deep presence more often. That said, Maaya Uchida still gives a great performance as Hiyori and earns my pick of VA of the show. The rest is a bit mixed but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest improvement from the first season. There is now a clear and distinct purpose throughout the episodes, and the overall tonality has shifted for the better to a more somber and serious tonality. As mentioned above, there are two main arcs each with its own rising action and climax. To be honest, the first of the two arcs is stronger in my opinion; though a tad predictable it was a fun watch. The second arc has a more nefarious undertone, and you don't really get a good feel for what's happening until it's basically over. Expect a few cliff hangers and a fair amount of plot twists along the way.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the previous season, Bones manages to execute this season well. There's a good balance of action, tension, and character development- oh and a touch of humor occasionally. Overall, the story was entertaining and satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYou learn quite a bit more about a lot of the characters this season. Unfortunately, Hiyori feels like more of a supporting character here but at least, thankfully, Yukine has calmed down. A good amount of character development takes place for Yato and many of the other gods and their Shiki (yes Yukine included). Bishamon's past for one is pretty interesting- straight-faced Ebisu, not so much. There still are way too many supporting characters but I guess Japan needs to churn out more figurines somehow. Yes, I'm still bitter that Hiyori hasn't gotten any real development after two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis was a surprise for me as I was expecting more of the same from last season. The second season is a strong step in the right direction for the franchise and an entertaining watch for followers of the series. Given the nature of the conclusion, I wouldn't say that a third season is out of the question. Regardless, this was a solid season with good plot progression and more grounded characters.",

            "content": "Story and Character: The second season of Noragami is just as enjoyable as the first, thanks to all the plot twists and well-timed comedic relief. Noragami Aragato centers mostly on delving into the past of Bishamonten, Yato, and Ebisu. This sequel starts with the unraveling of Bishamonten's past, and the events that explains her deep-seated grudge for Yato. Characters from the first season gain depth in this season, making them more personable and permanent to the viewer. Meanwhile, an important figure of Yato's past emerges to control him through their mutual link, Nora, into doing his bidding. Yato's last mission requires him to aid Ebisu,one of the gods of fortune, who is causing quite a stir in the heavens. During this mission, we get to see Yato's character development which I think makes for good material to build up on in a 3rd season. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The art has not diminished since the 1st season. Everything is as vibrant as usual, from the colors and changing pupil sizes of the characters' eyes to the details and designs of the phantoms. In addition, Oral Cigarettes does another great job in the opening theme song. The song, in addition to the PV is so masterfully done it always hypes me up before the start of each episode.",

            "content": "I've only considered myself a hardcore anime fan for about a year now (granted I've have been watching them for almost 10 years now), so I've been mostly playing catch up on \"must see\" series from the last decade or so. That makes Noragami Aragoto special for me, being the first series I've ever watched as it was airing. I purchased a Funimation subscription for the first time specifically so I could watch it as it came out. I was ecstatic to find out that it would be getting a broadcast dub but, as it turned out, I enjoyed the series so much, I couldn'twait for it to finish, making Noragami Aragoto the first show I ever saw a Japanese-Dubbed episode of. It's probably needless to say, but I loved every second of this series. \\n\\n\r\nStory:9/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the weaker elements of the first season was it's story. Plot points were introduced and then cast away with the final battle near the series end feeling tacked on for the sake of making it to 12 episodes. Luckily, Aragoto covers two major story arcs. The first lasts 6 episodes, and fleshes out the Yato and Bishamon that was merely touched on in season 1. The second half is 7 episodes, and introduces a few new characters and reveals some surprising things. Both halves of Aragoto feature a mix of action and comedy, but fans of the first season that enjoyed the comedy aspect of it may be dissapointed to know that it takes a backseat to a more serious storyline. There is still comedy to be had, but it's few and far between by comparison to the season 1.  Aragoto also covers a great deal of Yato's backstory, as well as other character's pasts, but does it in a way that meshes well with the action that is taking place. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Aragoto is top-notch. There is a diversity in the setpeices used throughout the series, from the elegant halls of Bishamon's Manor, to the dingy, maze-like corridors of \"The Underworld\". The animation is wonderful and fluid during it's more serious, action driven moments, as well as more silly during the comedic moments of the series. The character design is the most impressive thing about the art. Each character has distinctive traits, none more-so than their eyes. Each character has a set piercing eyes that are uniquely colored to match each ones personality. Yato, who's light blue eyes represent Loyalty, and Faith. Yukine's orange that signify youthfulness and recklessness. Hiyori's Purple eyes that help emphasize her involvement in the world of Gods and Regalias. \\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the voice acting of both the Japanese and English dub. The English dub felt a tad off at a few moments, but I would attribute that to Aragoto being one of Funimation's \"Broadcast Dubs\". It isn't bad by any means. I assume the dub will be cleaned up for the BD release, whenever that may be. The sound effects along with the OST are serviceable, without being too memorable. There are a few tracks that help add to the action taking place, but nothing that jumps out and grabs you. I would like to mention that both the intro \"Kyouran Key Kids!!\" by THE ORAL CIGARETTES and the ending \"Nirvana\" by Tia ft. Ryo from Supercell are great songs on their own and serve as excellent openings and endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the characters in Noragami Aragoto. Yato is an awesome blend of hilariously immature and deathly serious when he needed to be. I do wish in some moments he would show some more emotion towards the people that care about him, primarily Hiyori and Yukine. Yato and Yukine develop quite a bit as characters in Aragoto, most notably in the 2nd half, as the pair become more mature in their positions as God and Regalia. Yukine makes a few decisions that reflect this point. However, he makes some rash ones, especially early on, that can be attributed to the fact that he is essentially a 12 year old boy. I personally would have liked to see some more development in Hiyori as I feel she isn't much more than a way to advance the plot. She does play an important role at times, but for the most part she acts as a plot device. With that said, Hiyori plays as a good contrast to Yato and Yukine during the not-so-serious moments. I also like the supporting cast. Bishamon gets her character fleshed out through flashbacks that explain her involvement with Yato. Ebisu doesn't change much from his intro to the finale, however he plays a major part in Yato's development. Even the villians are good, as their motives can be related to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show on a week-to-week basis was very hard to do because whenever an episode ended, all I wanted to do was watch the next one. I enjoyed it so much, I switched over to the Japanese dub, just so I could see what happened next (and also since most episode end on a cliffhanger). \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think that Noragami Aragoto is a very good follow up to the series' first season. It expands on storylines introduced in the first season while developing most of its characters in a solid and steady way. If you enjoyed the first season, you will like this one. If you haven't seen either, give them a try.",

            "content": "Noragami is one of those series that stirr up positive as well as negative comments among its viewers, and with good reason as i agree that there are plenty of flaws to pinpoint. But the reason i stand strongly on the positive side with this anime is because it is highly outstanding in one aspect that i consider essential for qualifying a series as enjotable and that is character development. \r\nThe character development that we get in Noragami Aragoto is easily one of the best i have seen so far (though it is not much anyways considering the small amount of anime i have seen:) Anyways i have been amazed to how the characters seem to be \"completed\" when this series ended in some sort of way. And i am mainly talking about Bishamon, Yato, Yukine and Ebisu, though i also appreciate how the focus has also been turned over to some other minor characters too such as Hiiro and Kofuku and her shinki. I would have liked though to see a little more of hiyori as i felt that of all the main characters hers is the one that seemed somehow to evolve the less. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot has been well built, both arcs have been amazingly entertaining and the increasing tension throughout the series has been notable. There were though some small gaps in the plot that i rather have covered, like lack of explanation to one or two facts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami\u00b4s return has been more powerful than what i would have expected, with the same traces of amazing comedy mixed up with serious moments of tension that are sriously badass and the best character development ever. \\n\\n\r\nIf for some reason you have dropped Noragami in the first season i highly recommend keeping it up until the second one and see for yourself if you want to continue on, as it is really an amazing work. \\n\\n\r\nPS: i have to add-- Yukine\u00b4s character is what surprised me the most in the series. What was an annoying, immature and childish character on the first season turned up to be truthfully a great example and i have to clap for him on my feet because i hated him on the first season, and now he is easily one of my favourite characters of Noragami.",
