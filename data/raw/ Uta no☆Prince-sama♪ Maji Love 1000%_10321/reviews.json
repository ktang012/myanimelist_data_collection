            "content": "To put it bluntly, don't watch Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%. \r\nSome exceptions to this rule are as follows: \r\n- If you're competing with a friend at a drinking game (drink every time the lead girl stutters, you'll lose consciousness fast - you're welcome). \r\nThere are no other exceptions . . . only excruciating elaboration. \r\nUta no star prince hyphen sama music note maji love 1000 percent sign (it has not earnt the familiarity of UtaPri with me) is a depressingly high-budget anime of a dating sim aimed towards women. Ostensibly about the power of music, love and friendship, it is, realistically speaking, actually aboutjack shit. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a modern day Yamato Nadeshiko with eyes the colour of soup, who wears a short skirt and can't do anything by herself, except play piano. So of course she enters a prestigious idol-making music academy (disguised as a gigolo school) where the ratio of male to female students is astonishingly unbalanced. Despite a personality that is as inviting as her pet cactus and terrifying, terrifying eyes she manages to attract several of potential suitors, apparently through magic, or, as yaoi would put it \"sex smell\". By the end of this 13 episode series (or, as I like to think of it, six and a half hours of my life I will never get back) Soup-chan has to pick one of the guys to duet with for her graduation audition. Thus the achingly vacuous reverse-harem sausagefest begins.\\n\\n\r\nDaringly, unlike several music-based anime series that came before it, such as Nodame Cantabile, Detroit Metal City, Beck, K-On!, and so on, Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000% decides to forego having any listenable music tracks in its OST. The OP is as dull as the protagonist's personality and the ED (which you will hear in various instrumental and acapella forms throughout) is the musical equivalent of putting a cotton bud too far in your ear and experiencing the crippling though dull facial pain that follows. Other tracks in the OST are just forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nLike a song that's so cute it angers you, the talented vocal cast in this show fail to shine. Miyuki Sawashiro, for example, is just incessantly irritating as the voice of our main character - and similarly with Mamoru Miyano, as all I wanted to do was give his character a surprise tracheotomy with a pen for that goddamn vibrato he used in every song. It's the same with the other voice actors, though those two were particularly grating. Most of the male characters, except the slightly shady evil twins and split personalities, of course, have bizarrely high voices in a desperate bid to sound cute. Or maybe there's an implicit rule that all male Japanese singers are eunuchs, I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a music academy that caters to exclusively creating idols that sing pop songs, rather than to cultivate actual talent, is an apt metaphor for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the art is pretty, bright and cheerful, but it soon becomes clear how the studio cut corners with the budget - the horrific spasms the male characters experience when dancing, the occasionally over-bright scenes where characters are standing in thick fog though they are indoors, and - I can't express my anger enough over this - the chibi. It's like the art director (cunningly disguised as the manager of Death Records) went \"bitches love chibi, give them MORE chibi, FUCK!\" and that is what they did. If I had a drink every time there was chibi, I would be dead.  \\n\\n\r\nThough I enjoyed hating this anime, and laughing at the incredible stupidity (talking to her grandmother in her head - presumably her grandmother is dead - presumably that cat has the spirit of her grandmother - did her grandmother just turn into a bishie?), there is a more serious issue with this show. That is, the reason for its very existence - to perpetuate the kind of obsessive fan culture that encourages people to watch pretty boys in every stereotype you can imagine, from sweet to suave and silly to tsundere, have ~subtext~ with each other while still being interested in the [insert yourself here] main role. The same kind of people that would buy the merchandise and image CDs. It leaves a pretty sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like staring into our lead girl's eyes, watching this anime, you will realise it has no soul - and that watching it probably devalues your own. Like an egotistical person, the show is admittedly pretty, but, boy, doesn't it know it.",

            "content": "O_O Now I've seen it all *shoots self* \r\nStory [7/10]: The concept of having a music academy to train students to become future idols. That itself sounds really interesting. In the 2nd episode there was good development in the story through assignment given to the students where one has to compose other to write lyrics and record it. Alas such challenges were never shown after ep 2. The heroine has been given extra special attention by all the guys right from ep 1 without any reason(maybe typical of a reverse harem). A big letdown. I mean why cant the feelings develop slowly as the daysof all characters together progress. Pace of the story is really slow in terms of development. Episodes are wasted on introducing all the guys (6 + one magical creature/guy perhaps- yeah talking about Cecile) no excitment to watch except seing the bishonens in different angles. The way the story is revealed looks very plastic- unrealistic and made up for visual feast to the girls exclusively. The only other good point storywise is the continuity it has kept from one episode to the next. Inspite of all this I dont know why but I am still continuing to watch the show. So if you are okay with a not too interesting plot development then go on ahead to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: No doubt in this. All the guys are awesome. Haruka's eyes though is a heavy disappointment. I actually avoid looking too much in her eyes (cause then maybe I'll get hypnotised :P). Background scenery is good. The campus seems really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: Need I say anything about this. AWESOME SONGS!!!! Just listen to the tunes and you'll be fluttering like a leaf in the wind. Voice actors all have done a good job for their characters as well. AWESOME SONGS\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [8/10]: All guys have a distinct personality. Though I would have preferred genuinely smiling characters as a change. i mean come on, you cant have an expression like this =.= all the time and expect the audience's mindset to change forcefully towards the character by suddenly seeing him singing and dancing. Smile is a must while performing (well with expections of course for songs which are supposed to be grim). And it is the only thing that also adds vibrance to the idol image of the character. Still most of the guys have this feature so its all good. and Haruka completely fails to give any impact on screen for me. Her personality is absolutely weak. Even Ringo the supporting character has her screen presence felt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]: I give this ratings because of the following points:\\n\r\n1) Pop music theme. This is the first series which I actually came across with a full fledged pop music theme. Though I agree skip beat also had some of it.\\n\r\n2) Bishounens.\\n\r\nNo interesting scenes showing the actual process of training students to be future idols. Though i have to admit songs are groovy in each episode. Wait songs are AWESOME. Amazing grace !!!!!\\n\r\nAll in all its the kind of show to get caught up watching in all the hype.",

            "content": "What you will find in this anime is a group of cute guys who are pros at music.\r\n~Story: There is nothing particularly special about the plot of UtaPri. It follows the journey of a girl who got accepted to a very extravagant music school. There she met a group of cute guys who gradually got to love her music. This anime is a typical reverse harem. Do not expect to find any major plot twists because UtaPri is quite light-hearted and often uses comedy.\r\n~Art: The first time I looked at the main girl character, I was like \"Why does she have such creepy eyes?!\" Ihave to say the other characters' eyes are less creepy and look more normal. The art of UtaPri really has an elegant tone to it(please excuse the times when they dance like robots). What I really like about the visuals in UtaPri is the colors. There is always a happy feeling in this anime because of the use of a range of colors.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound: UtaPri is an anime about music. I am sure anyone would be disappointed if this aspect of the anime was not done well. i think that the background soundtrack is quite suitable. The singing however has been the part that I really enjoyed. When people keep asking the question \"Can music change the world?\", I really have to give a yes as an answer. I felt that the songs in UtaPri are all quite emotional.\\n\\n\r\n~Character: Every character has been briefly explored in the anime. I haven't played the game UtaPri but after reading Wikipedia, I would assume that it is a lot more detailed and the characters are more thoroughly explained. While all sharing the love for music, the characters each have their own distinct personality. Each of the characters is assigned with a certain color. Sometimes, I find that the colors really expresses their personality.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment: I wouldn't say that I really like this anime. The only enjoyment I got from watching UtaPri came from the voices. I have to admit that I only watched this anime because Mamoru Miyano starred in it. For me, the singing has made the best moments for me in UtaPri.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a short anime based around music or enjoys watching a reverse harem  with cute guys, UtaPri is the anime for you.",

            "content": "At surface level this appears to be another reverse-harem otome kind of anime, but it\u2019s actually much better than that. There is a reverse harem element, with all 6 of the guys vying for Haruka's attention, but there isn\u2019t any actual romance (well, a little), which makes it an oddity amongst the shoujo genre. The biggest draw for me when watching was that Haruka, while still the female party of a massive love-hexagon, doesn\u2019t just fall into the shadows and become a Mary-Sue type character; she\u2019s a great female lead, and without her personality the way that it is, there\u2019s no way any of thiswould\u2019ve happened. She is the reason things turn out the way they do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the biggest audience for this anime is young females, as there are many sexy guys, and each of them has their own distinct personality, some clashing violently with others, some of which are not very common in shoujo anime: the obliviously innocent one, the stoic serious one, the childish-yet-yandere one, the tsundere, the ladies man, and the I\u2019m-gonna-close-myself-off-to-you-because-I-don\u2019t-want-your-help-but-I\u2019ll-warm-up-to-you-eventually one. And each one of them is hot as hell. (There\u2019s also plenty of room for yaoi ships, which is a plus but doesn\u2019t draw interest away from the actual plot.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters were great as well. There was the best friend who, while she could be considered prettier than our heroine, doesn\u2019t out-shine her but instead plays a big role just as being her friend. There\u2019s the headmaster, who\u2026 I just don\u2019t know with this guy. And there\u2019s a trap character! Haruka\u2019s teacher is a crossdresser, and boy does he make an attractive lady. Other sub-characters are interesting as well, and I\u2019m glad that they weren\u2019t just there to be, well, there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it\u2019s very smooth and pretty. Characters are well fleshed-out and look amazing (Haruka has the prettiest eyes on any anime female ever and you can\u2019t tell me otherwise), and the plot is decent. In fact, the plot is not very good compared to how amazing the rest of it is. There are multiple plot holes, parts that don\u2019t make sense, things that move too slow, and the ending has a giant \u201cwhere the fuck did this come from?\u201d moment (there was something to do with magic and cats and Greek Muses and God damn he\u2019s hot), but overall it wasn\u2019t horrible, there was good comedic moments, and even the minor characters are very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the music: HOLY HELL is there good music, but in an anime that\u2019s all about music, did you really expect anything less? The opening is good, maybe not the best, but the ending? \u201cMaji Love 1000%\u201d is amazingly good. This is one of the few rare instances where the ending theme out-shines the opening theme, and it makes us sit through the credits every time, just to listen to it all. The music within the show is also great; the songs are straight from the character\u2019s hearts, and they\u2019re sung with such passion that it pulls you in and really makes you listen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is definitely worth your time to watch as it's very interesting and entertaining. \\n",

            "content": "Uta no Prince-sama was originally a dating simulation game which has been adapted into an anime and manga. It\u2019s a reverse harem which is basically a whole lot of bishi guys, the main female protagonist and her one female friend who really has no point or purpose in being there asides from stopping Nanami from looking like some friendless loser.\r\nSo why a 6? It\u2019s not that I hated this anime, in fact most people would thoroughly enjoy it, it\u2019s not bad, but at the same token it\u2019s not great. It has a lot of floors which I just couldn\u2019t look past despite enjoying bishie\u2019s.\r\nFirst offthe whole theme and feeling of the anime is off, it tries to invite you to this real shoujo loving land where the background music is lovey dovey piano pieces, the progression is slow and there is a lot of wide shots, yes its trying to build atmosphere. Yet it fails because as soon as we\u2019ve settled into a shoujo feeling, sitting on clouds, sipping tea mood, we are hit with up beat pop songs, quirky actions from the bishie characters and what appears to be an attempt at a \u2018cool\u2019 anime feel.\\n\r\nThis really shouldn\u2019t have been done, the mixture of most of the time piano background tunes to pop songs is just really awkward, not to mention after watching the boring Nanami talk about her grandmother for the majority of a shot to suddenly swing to a joke being had by one of the male characters, just kills it. You can\u2019t enjoy that joke because you\u2019ve become so bored by Nanami.\\n\r\nThey honestly should have cute out all the over the top shoujo feel and background piano tunes and shortened the shots considerably because a lot of the time while I\u2019m watching Nanami seemingly do nothing I feel like fast forwarding anyway.\\n\r\nWhy? Because she\u2019s got to be one of the most boring, lifeless, spineless shoujo character\u2019s I have ever come across. The writers attempt at a sweet, grandma loving girl is completely over the top, and in real life a guy wouldn\u2019t take a second look at a girl who seems like such a blank book.\\n\r\nIt really hit me how much I loathed this character in Ren\u2019s episode, while he\u2019s being a prissy weakling ripping his lyrics up into tiny little pieces of paper and letting the wind carry them off this high castle like balcony to the large garden of the academy. (Realistically speaking, such a gust of wind would carry those pieces of paper\u2019s kilometres away...) Nanami perks up \u2018I will go find your lyrics for you!\u2019 is she STUPID?! That\u2019s completely impossible! But hey, this is shoujo\u2026nothing is impossible. She spends her whole night finding these pieces of paper until sunrise.\\n\r\nWas this meant to make me feel heart warmed towards her? It did the absolute opposite.\\n\r\nNow, there is a saving grace to this anime, because if I looked past the girl character I could concentrate on the bishi guys, some who are actually pretty damn hilarious. My favourite was instantly Ittoki, he was refreshing and hell we needed it after the first episode of Nanami! Then there was Shou the short and fiery fellow who\u2019s always getting teased by his roommate Natsuki (obsessed with cute small things), who if you take the glasses off of turns into his dark side Satsuki. I adored these characters!\\n\r\nThat said I found all the other guys either boring, arrogant or in Ren\u2019s case a total loser.\\n\r\nThe art is also pretty damn good, and despite Nanami having no personality to boot she\u2019s good to look at. The artists obviously put a lot of effort into the background and the lighting. So it\u2019s always very aesthetically pleasing.\\n\r\nFinally what kept me hooked asides from those loveable character\u2019s I mentioned was the music! I really loved some of the tunes done by the idols and it left me wondering who sings them in real life. I did bob along in my seat to the songs and rewind to watch them again. I really love how each song matches that character who is singing it, and I always looked forward to the next idol\u2019s song and seeing what they came out with!\\n\r\nReally sorry if this review upsets you hardcore fans, I\u2019m just being honest with my opinions and justifying them the best I can. I will finish watching this series, for those three characters I adore and the idol music! \\n\r\n(But I really, REALLY wish they gave Nanami some kind of quirk!)\\n",

I knew i couldn't watch another episode when everyone had to pair up for a song, one is supposed to write while the other sings, naturally all the guys wanted to team up with her, so what does she do? She picks them all, and she is allowed to do it, never mind that several other song writers would be left with no partner to sing their songs. apparently all the guys want to sing her songs because she is supposed to be so good, but I have yet to hear a song from her that was anything but LAME.\\n\\n\r\nthe guys- Stereotypical dating Sim guys, shallow, with nothing going on but cute looks, of course one or two would have a \"deep\" past or something, but it's worn like a fashionable coat, in other words, it's something the main girl can just smile away.  Not only that, but as shallow and stereotypical as the guys are, they are still more interesting than the girl which leads to a VERY important question...why do they all want her?? She has no personality, she's boring as hell, her eyes are freaky, and she writes lame songs. but then again the guys are just as lame. Whatever small measure of cool points they had were flushed down the toilet with this ridiculous dance scene that was just laughably bad and no it wasn't funny on purpose. anyway, if you love boy bands then you might gush and live through the lead girl that pretty much proves that no matter how unexciting you are you too can get a full boy band to desire you but if you want to hear good songs, not laugh yourself to death watching lame dance moves, or not suffer through a freaky eyed boring leading girl, then watch Nana or Beck",

Like when you know something is BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD and it's an insult foryour mind to enjoy it - f.e. Twilight, Jonas Brothers' singing... But you do!  That's the essence of the whole anime. \r\nStory is - assumedly - about a life of Nanami Haruka, yellow-eyed typical shoujo girl, who happens to get into famous school for future idols and compositors. Why? Oh, it's not that she has any ambitions or something. She wants to write a song for Hayato, an idol... who is strangelyalike her schoolmate, Ichinose Tokiya. Hayato's song helped her when she moved to the city... she couldn't hear her own thoughts but his song? Oh yes, no problem!\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are also flat like a wall. They've got usually one episode/one song/one problem for our cheerful schizophrenic Haruka to solve per person, and within just this one episode they are fascinated with her and simply fall in love. Easy, huh? \\n\\n\r\nMusic can be cool sometimes.  I liked the first song, weird dance and lyrics... So darn catchy! Others are pretty bland, except Satsuki's (that guy rocks!). I also hate Nanami's seiyuu. Her constant \"eeeh?\" drives me mad!\\n\\n\r\nArt is ok. I liked most of the background and images of main characters... except for Haruka and her stupid eyes. Their constant gaze gives me shiver.\\n\\n\r\nOver all... I hate to admit that I enjoy watching this stuff. I love permanent cliches, random talks, idiocy of situations... It's like watching a kid show. You know there's nothing bad inside that can hurt you. It's fluffy, cute and makes you laugh... at it. But it's nice to watch a fairytale from time to time.",

            "content": "(This is my first review)\r\nWARNING: Do not watch this show if you have a problem with the following--singing and/or music, harems, or BISHOUNENS!\r\nWhen I first heard about this show, I already had suspected that it was going to be a harem, for I had already watched La Corda d'Oro, which also had a musical theme to it. \r\nHowever, the only differences... Uta no Prince-Sama Maji Love 1000% doesn't center around magic, and the talent is all real.\r\nStory: I gave the story a nine simply because I've gotten up to episode 7 and only now has a plot began to unfold. Each of the characters havetheir own separate back-stories, and they all begin to center around their passions for the main heroine Haruka Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now, I will use my weakness for bishounens to give the art a nine! And not just the guys! The landscaping art out by the patio, the snow scenes, the rain, and even the academy is absolutely breathtaking, and the characters are all well drawn out... My only real flaw in the art? Haruka's eyes tended to freak me out sometimes. Maybe they colored her eyes a bit too much. Otherwise, I found ways to overlook that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A perfect ten for the sake of song! All of the voice acting was flawless, and the singing... TREMENDOUS. I really admire that they picked the right voice to fit each character--some surprises for me including Yuuichi Nakamura as their teacher: cross-dressing Ringo, Kenichi Suzumura as Masato (Which I didn't even recognize until I caught a slight hint of his normal \"cocky\" voice while he was singing), and even Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A nine! Most of the characters had their own spunk to them, and my overall favorites at this moment are Otoya Ittoki, Masato Hijirikawa, and Tokiya Ichinose (No particular order), simply because their personalities were among some of the most human. My least favorite character? Haruka. She just seems too... plain. I even question how the guys fall for her sometimes. I hope that we get to see more of her true personality during episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While there were certain flaws to the story that could be tweaked, and even certain moments that made me go \"WHAT WAS THAT?\" in an angry tone, I have to say that I overall enjoy this show so far because it's rather... cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm torn between a nine and a ten because of the character development, but if it solely came down to the sound and the art, the series would be a ten in my book!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like music, breathtaking art, or even just cute guys, then take a look at Uta no Prince-Sama Maji Love 1000%!",

            "content": "Uta no Prince-sama does get a lot of hate, but I am actually going to tell you why I think that it shouldn't and why it's underrated by people. But first I will go into the different aspects that make Uta-Pri good.\r\nFirst let's say a bit about myself. I like anime with story and good characters. I will spot these things out quickly. Prince-sama does not have a good story, but characters popped out. But back to me- I do not get influenced by \"handsome\" men dancing and singing. As much as the guys were attractive to me; I can push that aside and focuson everything else.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Not really much to see here. You have the main girl, Haruka Nanami, a young teen looking to be a composer. She wants to become a composer- something that a lot of background characters in Uta-Pri didn't seem to want to do. Haruka is naturally talented at picking up music and playing it, but she can't read music. This takes us to the horrible bullying that takes us to Otoya Ittoki's \"arc\". \\n\r\nDuring this arc, you see a bit more of Otoya in this. But the story of the arc wasn't much. We continue on throughout this anime through the guys and how they got that way and so on and so on. \\n\r\nBy the end- she has to pick a partner for the Graduation Audition. This was brought up in the very beginning; so it makes sense that this can be counted as the main plot for this anime. Sure it isn't original and you can find this anywhere. But the pacing done for this and how it was handled \"realistically\" was perfectly good. They went through it as a team and at the end of the day- Uta-Pri is about friendship and music; which is what was shown by the end. Only other problem with the story is that it did seem like the people were a bit high on music- which is totally fine since music does power the soul.\\n\r\nStory is good, but nothing special. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was one of the best parts of Uta no Prince-sama. The guys and girls and minor characters were all done right. Even the background characters had faces which some anime lazily drops out. The art goes through different changes from bright to dark to even a bit choppy. The choppy is the only fault in the art. The choppy is only on the dancing which isn't shown much- but it does bring it one score down. But besides that-\\n\r\nThe art was really great! The character designs are really good and you don't see it much. Otoya has a similar appearance to Avan Hardins in Valkyira Chronicles 2, but even then- Otoya is more bishie. The design of the men were obviously done to show that they are the main characters. They have weird hair color and stand out from most of the other \"generic\" guys in the show. They also have pretty boy appearances which we all know- most anime has. \\n\r\nHaruka Nanami and Tomochika Shibuya are really good design wise. Tomochika, Haruka's friend, is really unique looking. Her poofy red hair with lipstick hasn't been done quite often. Adding her magenta eyes to the mix- and you got on unique girl. Haruka, the main girl, is stunning in appearance. Her eyes are seen 'creepy' by many, but I think they are beautiful. It shows the mysteries the girl does hold into her heart. From her eyes to hair to face shape and all the way to her body- the girl is unique and very well drawn.\\n\r\nI give art 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was another key point in this anime. What would a singing anime be without the sound? The music was heaven in your ears. The voice acting done by the guys in the singing area was done really well. I'm not a fan of japanese voices since I usually watch mine in english, but I did enjoy Uta-Pri's voices since I thought the singing was done really well.\\n\r\nThe background noises like rain and footsteps were done flawlessly. You could hear every little details from the noises to the music that sent chills through your spine. I'm not a big sound person so...\\n\r\nSound gets a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters is a big part of Uta-Pri. Most shoujo anime and/or manga don't really have good characters. Ouran Highschool Host Club's characters are a bit flat compared to Prince-sama's. Uta no Prince-sama's characters were very good, and here is why.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Nanami is your 'mary-sue' main girl. She doesn't seem to have much going on with her at first glance and her character seems as shallow as a kid's pool. But once you get to the end, you realize that she is actually pretty good for a main lead. She has a background story which has been use many a times, but gives it a nice twist with her natural ear for music. She is on her way to 'mary-sue' but I don't think she is one. She is that \"flawless\" girl, but when you look at Nanami- she has a lot of issues. The girl may have a talent that not much people have (even though I know a lot of people who do in real life) , but she is a kind-hearted girl with deep issues. The anime doesn't get much into depth with her, but she was frail and her personality is quite cheerful. She isn't flawless though because a lot of the gossiping teens in that school like to talk smack about her. Haruka's relationship with each of the characters is touching as well.\\n\\n\r\nTokiya Ichinose is the main guy. He is this stoic douchebag in the beginning that I honestly couldn't stand. He thought he was so cool and thought that he can beat everyone. He didn't even give Haruka the time of the day and completely ignored some of the others. Tokiya is my favorite character due to the fact that he is the most developed. He goes from a guy I want to punch to a 'changed man'. He didn't do a complete 180 and change everything about himself. He still is a bit 'mean' but is actually very kind. He messes with the others and smiles after all this time, and he develops at a nice pace for 13 episodes. Just like the other reverse harem, Tokiya falls for Haruka. Tokiya and Haruka's relationship is sweet since you was the meanest to her. He didn't like her and it took awhile until she was the reason for him to open up. Haruka loves Hayato-sama and actually almost picked Tokiya for the mere reason that he was Hayato. Soon realized, Haruka falls for him(friend way) as who he is and decides that even if Hayato saved her life, it was really Tokiya who did.\\n\\n\r\nOtoya Ittoki is your 'genki' guy. He is outgoing and a bit messy as seen from his room. He is light-hearted and full of spirit. He isn't actually that well written since he doesn't change much. He's cheerful as hell in the beginning, but by the end; he's slightly less. He's still cheerful as hell which is why Otoya isn't that well of a character. His personality though is different from usual happy males. He is a bit shy, but outgoing. His personality is hard to describe without it seeming like he is indeed a generic 'genki' boy. His relationship with Haruka was by far the sweetest. He made sure to tell people off and even stand up for her. All he wanted was to sing her songs and make her happy. Which he ended up doing; making him extremely close with her.\\n\\n\r\nRen Jinguuji isn't your typical flirty male. From the beginning you thought he was- Especially did I. Ren is actually really developed- even Masato points out that he has changed. He was another douche in the beginning almost all the way until the end, but only difference from him, Tokiya, and Syo is that he is a flirt. Ren was the second best character due to he changed a lot. He was harsh and cold by the end, but changed for the better. He wasn't going to be bossed by his family for too long, especially since his mom and Haruka were the only reasons he attended the school. Haruka and Ren's relationship are close friends, but like the others- Ren likes her.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Shinomiya and Syo Kurusu are two teens that get along well- on Natsuki's side that is. Natsuki is a 'kawaii' lover who enjoys all things 'kawaii'. He is really outgoing, annoying, and a bit of a weird teen. When his glasses come off, Satsuki is now in control. Satsuki is another douche if he counts- making it a grand total of 6 males in Uta-Pri that are this way. Natsuki seems to enjoy Haruka's company, but I assume that's all it is, maybe not love quite yet. Natsuki is the third best character since he is developed. He goes from outgoing to a lot serious and actually takes time to think instead of cute things everywhere. Syo is one of the 6 males that are douchey. Syo is the bishie blond who enjoys having time alone while looking up to his idol. He has a fear of heights from a traumatizing experience involving him and Natsuki when they were younger. Syo gets a lot nicer by the end is actually really sweet. Haruka and Syo have another great friendship. Syo clearly enjoys Haruka's company and has a crush on her, even thinking that she was the main heroine for his own story involving his idol.\\n\\n\r\nMasato Hijirikawa is the last main character of this cast. Masato is a serious traditional man. He has the generic strict done in which he somehow gets his father to say yes for letting him go to the academy. His type reminds me a lot of Kyoya Ootori- just not a douche. Masato and Haruka's relationship is really touching. He probably loves her the 3rd most right after Otoya and Tokiya. Haruka is really grateful since he helped her get past the bullying and do what she loves.\\n\\n\r\nMinor characters like Tomo, Ringo, Hyuuga, Shining, and Cecil were all important in their own way. They all served a purpose even if they didn't have much to them. They did help the main cast in getting as far as they did.\\n\r\nWant more of a background story with these characters? Play the game. Characters are very good so they get a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this show and that's all I have to say. We all have different opinions and minds. You guys may not like it or you may do, either way- we all have a different reason for liking or hating it. So MY enjoyment for this amazing anime was a 9/10... \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this show was very good with art, sound, and characters. The rounds this all about to a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review so I hope it was decent enough~\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I'm sorry if I can't express my thoughts clearly, because English isn't my mother language. Well, Utapri... I've finished this anime few months ago and suddenly remembering it while I'm browsing MAL, so here we go:\r\nStory: 4\r\nSo here's the story: a typical shoujo entering a prestigious music school in order to study how to write good music, so she could someday deliver her music for her favorite singer--- what's his name, to sing. And as the story goes on, she meets lots of your also typical bishounens, and somehow attracted them all. Therefore, she builds her own harem, and by her so-calledwonderful music, she was like, rockin' the world. To me, there's absolutely nothing special about the story, instead, it was kinda dull. I mean, it's not realistic at all. And the part where all the boys are just stuck to her is---- ugh, holy. And then, she's said to be a wonderful composer, but her songs themselves weren't showed to us back then. She only made one WOAH song and everybody's going on praising her. Kay.....\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nWell, the only good part of this anime is the art. The art is so flashy and colorful with lots of rainbows whenever you watch this. The bishonens are pretty cool. I like almost all of them. The animation is also pretty soft and well, worth praising. On the other hand, I especially disliked the main character's eyes-- they're so ugh, scary, freaky, horrible, what do you call it. Can't they make it more, dunno, alive?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThis anime is about music, so I was expecting more on the sound... but actually there was nothing impressive at all. Just like what I've mentioned above, they should've posted more of the main character's song. And also, the BGMs weren't special. As the seiyuu... hmm I think it was well-done and they fit the characters (yes, the main chara's voice really fit her stupid personality).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nFrom all of the aspects of this anime, character makes it the worst. Nanami Haruka, as the main character, didn't stand out AT ALL. Heck, she doesn't even have a character. What's so special about her, what makes her different from all heroines in the other animes, and what even makes us come to like her as the main protagonist? She doesn't have anything. She stands out just because of her horrifying eyes that gives me thrills whenever she's being closed-up. She doesn't even have anything to be liked about. In the other side, all of the guys that liked her all of the sudden are also annoying. They're all-- duh, your typical wall-display that just appeared to make the anime happier. They don't also have interesting background/past that makes us sympathizing. To say, all of the characters are just alive for us to see, and not to feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite all of this anime's stupid mistakes and flaws, this is kinda enjoyable. If you like harem with cool boys with slight of humor, you could watch this. Even though just, beware, that you might hate the main character. Hahahahahaha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't stand out as a fabulous music anime at all. If you guys are looking for a matured and well composed music-themed anime, I don't recommend this to you. Because this anime isn't even about music--- heck, I'm out of words. This anime doesn't know nothing about music. Well, there were some cute quotes from this anime, but that's all. There's nothing we can learn from this. This anime is soo like Kiniro no Corda. If you're a fan of that series, you can go on and watch this. But if you once watch Nodame Cantabile and want to give this a try, you better don't get disappointed because this anime is nothing like Nodame Cantabile, which is an awesome music anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo... that's it?",

            "content": "Watching this anime was like getting braces tightened; painful to endure and restricting. \r\nTo put it mildly, I did not enjoy this anime. I often found myself dozing off because it was so incredibly dull. I initially tolerated the story line but that was before I actually started to watch it.  This anime was pure torture to watch for me and I am completely amazed that I even managed to finish it. Every episode felt much longer than the approximately twenty four minutes air time. Overall I found it to be extremely tiresome. \r\nI give this anime an one out of ten for itsstory.\\n\\n\r\nOne word for the art: bleh.\\n\r\nI give the art a two out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters. I measure annoying characters on the scale of one to Haruka. She is a complete door mat and fails to assert herself when it is necessary. I got tired of her little crying fits very quickly. I didn't like most of the male characters with the exception of Ichinose Tokiya. \\n\r\nI give this anime an one out of ten for the characters. Trust me, I would give this anime a zero out of ten if it were possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I like Ichinose Tokiya? Well because of his seiyuu Mamoru Miyano whom voiced Tamaki Suoh from OHSHC, Sho Fuwa from Skip Beat, Zero Kiryuu from Vampire Knight (incidentally one of the few characters I like from VK), Light Yagami from Death Note and Rin Matsuoka from Free. He is the only reason why I tolerated this anime for so long. As for the soundtrack, what a load of crap. I despise boy bands by nature and the songs were so disgustingly cheesy...I can deal with cheesy songs as long as there are comedic moments. I laughed like once during the course of this anime. \\n\r\nI give this anime a three out of ten for the sound. \\n\\n\r\nI found this anime to be tedious and dull. There is a second season? Oh I shudder to think...\\n\r\nI give this anime a two out of ten for enjoyment.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of torture, by all means watch away. Also you must receive a thorough diagnosis that you are in fact losing your mind.",

            "content": "This review is based on the first two episodes of  Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%. As more episodes come out, I will edit the review.\r\nAs most people know, Uta No Prince is based on a Visual Novel, (PS2 Game if I am not mistaken.) Involving 6 Bishies. (Bishonen boys.) \r\nStory: 7 (Based on two episodes.)\r\nThe heroine Nanami enrolls into a school specially for composers and etc. At the entrance exam she is late because on her way she had stopped to help a lost child find their mother. Because of this, the officers do not let her in.  She then meets Ittoki andRen, who manage to get her in by persuading the officers. \\n\\n\r\nThere is hinted romance currently, but I won't type it on here because of the spoilers. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, I'm guessing that this anime will be separated into arcs. (Something like Amagami SS or Starry Sky.) Where the heroine (Considering there are 6 male protagonists, each male gets 2 episodes- if the anime ends at the 12th episode.) is with a different male protagonist in each episode (This case, 2?).  \\n\\n\r\nThe story looks pretty consistent, as I have watched Amagami SS, I believe it will suit those who are looking for a light romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nThis included a bit of my personal opinion, as I found Starry Sky's art more appealing. Either way, the anime has great cell-shaded characters, nicely colored, the body proportions (Oh thank you!) They are consisnt and great throughout the episodes. I have not yet found huge eyes, sudden weird movement, or really skinny fingers and legs during the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very smooth and I'm happy to say that the animators aren't that lazy, as sometimes one of the major flaws of Visual Novels that is turned into an anime is that animators get lazy and use simple skills like scanning e.g to waste time- which Uta No Prince does not have often. The best evidence of great animation is the ED (Was the OP of Episode 1.) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI was too focused on the settings and the plot to really hear the music in the background, either way, the OP and ED are really appealing and amusing to watch (especially the ED.). \\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job (which can be told just by watching 1 episode.) the character personalities and the voices go together really well, and the singing is just 'awesome'. Many of the voice actors have sung before, and I think I've heard one of their voices in the \"Nico Nico Chorus\". Which just adds more to the sound and voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\\n\r\nI am hoping to see some good background stories for each of the characters in the arcs, because I have only watched 2 episodes- I cannot rate this any higher than a 6. Some of these characters feel to stereotypical, and after seeing many types of anime- Stereotypes don't really stand out.\\n\r\nGenerally, the character designs are really nice and they seem to have interesting personalities.  \\n\r\nI'm wanting to see how they flip the Stereotypes and create characters that can be remembered and liked. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThough I have rated \"Enjoyment\" higher than the others, this at the end is just a little personal opinion. (I find Shou's hairstyle awesome xD ) \\n\\n\\n\r\n~This anime will satisfy you if you are simply looking for a lighthearted, hinted romance, little comedy and school setting, and if you are searching for something music related- as they do sing :3 (Awfully well.)~\\n\\n\r\n[Note: Or if you are just looking for some spicy bishies]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Ok, now that this 13 episode anime has ended, I probably say that this is one fine musical drama, the plot of this story only plays a minimal role, because like any musical drama show be it live or animated, it is always the climax that's important co'z the featured song is the climax, and this this case it is \"Maji Love 100%\" or in English \"'True Love 1000%,\" so for the story I'll give it a \"Fair\"6.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- Mediocre number 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime needs no explanation it has similarities with another anime \"Starry Sky\" with minor adjustments.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Great number 9.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's just say that I kinda like all the songs being played in this anime especially the ending theme \"Maji Love 1000%.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime only focuses on Haruka Nanami a girl form the countryside who came to Saotome Academy to study because of her love for music, her personality can be compared to that with another character Kelsi Neilsen from \"High School Musical\" who is shy and doesn't have much confidence with herself, however thanks to the support and motivation of friends she was able to find the will to go on, the rating for this anime is actually for her, since it's all about her and how she struggles with the predicament she has . Since this anime has a harem genre in it, its said genre is actually a reverse harem, but it still follows the usual harem arc where the male members fell for the girl's (Haruka) simplicity, naivety, sense of compassion and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nJust who were her harem? Here they are:\\n\\n\r\n Hijirikawa Masato - a rich guy groomed to take over his family's business empire.\\n\\n\r\nIchinose Tokiya - a pop idol who goes by the name Hayato who hates being demoted to become a soap opera star, comes to the academy for a fresh start.\\n\\n\r\nIttoki Otoya- the first guy Haruka met and the one who motivated her to not give up on her dream.\\n\\n\r\nRen Jinguuji- a campus playboy, who is a laid back son of a wealthy businessman. \\n\\n\r\nShou Kurusu - a small dude with a great sense of fashion.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Shinomiya - a cheerful individual with 2 personalities, one is the violent Satsuki and the other is the witty and happy Natsuki.\\n\\n\r\nOf course no harem genre would be complete if Haruka doesn't have a best friend in Tomochika Shibuya, who always stand by her side. As for rest like:\\n\\n\r\nShining Saotome- an enigmatic school principal with the flare for the extravagant.\\n\\n\r\nRingo Tsukimiya- the cross-dressing fag who is Haruka's Homeroom teacher.\\n\\n\r\nHyuuga Ryuuya- a teacher every student wanna hates, who happens to be Tokiya's hoomeroom teacher.\\n\\n\r\nThey serve more like the antagonist, but in a subtle way.\\n\\n\r\nand there is this dude who dresses like Aladdin, Cecil Aijima,  Info states that he's the prince of Angapolis and curse to become a cat, but it kinda look like that he's more of a cameo and a guest singer than anything else in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall- good number 7\\n\\n\r\nWhat make this enjoyable are the songs especially the ending theme, though this anime also has a romance genre in it, the said genre serves like  a predicament for the main female character, however it did ended like a harem genre would, where it didn't feature anybody whom the main female lead would pick, but, what really has the big impact in the ending of this anime is the main climax which is the feature song itself which the male seiyu performed well, so.\\n\\n\r\n7\\n\r\n6\\n\r\n5  Tokiya: Are you ready?\\n\r\n4  Ren: Are you ready?\\n\r\n3  Shou: Are you ready?\\n\\n\r\n2\\n\r\n1\\n\\n\r\nAll: Come!

While this anime focuses on building a band and watching them fall in love with our Lime Eyes. I found that this was pretty lacking for character development. \r\nThis anime reflects my life me as a person. I have lime eyes and all of the boys in mylife keep wanting to date me. I'm not sure how I could find an anime that relates to me as a person but it actually exist! I am HAPPY with how this anime starts off but it left me wanting more after the season ended. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have lime eyes and are looking for your own harem of boys that will sing to you but you can't date any of them because you only truly love music. This is the anime for you. Please do take time out of your life from a fellow lime eyes having user to another and enjoy this master piece.",

The beginning was really hard for me to understand, but as I kept watching this anime, it started to get a little bit more interesting. The ending also left me in tears of happiness. It was truly a beautiful ending, and the ending was not a disappointment at all. \r\n[ART] - 8/10\r\n-----------\r\nFor an anime that was released from 2011, I expected the qualities and graphics to be a little bit more 'stable'. When the scenes were both dark and bright, the sceneswere very blurry and there was a lot of small pixels I could see throughout this anime as well. The background and the scenery was very well put together. The school architect and the nature of this anime was spot on.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI do admit, the opening and the ending themes were alright surprisingly. At first, the ending was kind of cringe, and the more I heard it, the more I was like, \"ok I need to stop watching this now\", but when I got to know the characters of this anime a little better, the ending theme actually sounded quite nice because it made sense to me. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nSome of the character's appearances were very disappointing, especially Nanami, Haruka. Her eye color and hair color (in my opinion) didn't really match at all, but her personality reminded me a little bit of my school life. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI try not to watch anime music related anime, because my whole life was filled with being around music. If I watched something music related, I would usually end up either in tears or being very angry at the story. It's hard to explain, but that's how it works for me. I wouldn't be disappointed if this anime didn't have a next season, but it seems like there are like, what, 4-5 seasons more? I honestly don't know if I'll watch them right away. I'll probably get back to this series if I'm ever needing something to watch in the future. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI wouldn't probably enjoy this anime if I watched it again, so I'll just leave this anime at that. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "I was pretty skeptic about this anime since it was originally an otome game. Don't get me wrong - I love otome games and I'm huge fan of them, but from the adaption I have seen, the animes has just made it gone downhill.. . proberly from the lack of development like the games and since they have to squeeze this all in 25 mins, it's impossible to take interest.\r\nHowever, Uta No Prince Sama wasn't what I expected. Take note that I have NEVER played the game ( i have only read reviews).\r\nFirstly, the main character, Haruka, is your typically shy girl in which everyonewalks all over.. and most of her actions can be annoying (cue loads of eye rolling). However, throughout the anime, she does have a hidden strength and she does have a goal she wants to achieve. Sometimes you can't help but appreciate her. I do think, in some ways, Haruka IS a character ANYONE can relate too. The side characters are not too bad either - most of them adding comic or reassurance to the show to make it enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the guys, of course, unlike the game, each episodes can't express the characters fully, but you do get a grasp on what each of them are like and why they wanted to become idols in the first place. There are some of those typical characters (the cheery idiot, the rich guy, the player, the manly shota, the guy with twin personalities, the guy that's in too deep etc),  which I am not bothered about tbh, since it made the show enjoyable.  It does sadden me a TINY bit that they missed of some important parts from the game but it didn't matter too much. It made the show less complicated therefore making the story flow a little bit easier for first time viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, putting aside the characters, I think the storyline is done quite well - most of the episodes did link so the plot didn't love control along the way. The more I watched, the more I was intrigued and found myself singing along to some of the songs. That aside, what I didn't expect was some... odd paranormal things to happen in this anime, which added the WTF factor, but ehh, shit happens *shrugs*.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can say this anime is enjoyable and not as bad as it seems. It's most ideal if you're looking for nothing too serious. If you're into shoujos with a light hearted comedy and romance, this anime I could reccomend. I'm not sure if my opinions will differ if I have played the game but all in all I still like this anime. Afterall, they have a second season and in making for the 3rd so I guess it's all up to you :) \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching a few episodes, I came to the conclusion that this anime is extremely corny. Yes, there are many corny anime shows, but this is the corniest one I have probably ever come across. I would most definitely like it more if the characters had more distinct personalities and problems. Sure, each of them were different, but I couldn't find myself being emotionally attached to any of them, and that includes the harem. \r\n I felt like everyone revolved around the harem and Starish, like the principal, for instance. He followed them everywhere and did all kinds of things for them and Icouldn't help but wonder, 'Doesn't he have an entire music school to run?' Also, the harem really wasn't very interesting or relatable when it comes to her dreams and struggles.\\n\\n\r\n Usually in every anime, I like the music, but with this one, I didn't find any of the music that good. . . and the show is supposed to be about music. Why don't I like it? Well, to me it sounds like a generic J pop group with similar songs. It needed more originality. That could have been the reason why they become popular because their music is different from everyone else.The music should of had some sort of twist, maybe to convey the hardships of Starish as a group.\\n\\n\r\n Which brings me to another point. The struggles of the group were kind of silly and melodramatic. It would have been better if each of the members had very different backgrounds and were not all that popular. The struggle would be them working together to become different and reach their dreams in music as a group with Nanami to influence them; Trying to be original yet popular in the process. They should have each used their own personal talents and abilities to contribute to the group, but they all acted the same. I'd say the most developed character in this anime was Ichinose because he changed throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\n I suggest that if you like things like High School Musical, then this is the perfect anime for you, but if you like anime shows with an original plot, engaging characters, and touching aftertaste, don't watch this one.",

There is no major conflict. There are interesting back stories of the characters which keep the anime progressing but that\u2019s about it. \r\nUta no Prince-Sama is a musical (and another otome based anime hrngggggggg). (You have been warned.) But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as intense as High School Musical. And I found myself liking most of the OSTs!\r\nBecause it\u2019s a musical, there\u2019s a lot of dancing, singing and all that jazz. The animation company does a crappyjob at animating it (especially dancing).\\n\\n\r\nDuring the beginning of the anime, there was a particular bias to one of the characters, which was surprising since this is an otome anime. The anime kind of strings you along (well, at least I was strung along) believing the main character, Haruka, will actually end up with that one specific guy but\u2026 UtiPri stays true to the otome nature. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, if it weren\u2019t for the cute, funny moments and the great music, I wouldn\u2019t have continued watching largely because it\u2019s so predictable! If Haruka is caught in a little problem, you probably have a 99.9% chance of correctly guessing what is going to happen and how she\u2019s going to get out of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, watch for the great music and the cute jokes! I had a surprisingly good time with this anime!",

            "content": "To put it bluntly, don't watch Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%. \r\nSome exceptions to this rule are as follows: \r\n- If you're competing with a friend at a drinking game (drink every time the lead girl stutters, you'll lose consciousness fast - you're welcome). \r\nThere are no other exceptions . . . only excruciating elaboration. \r\nUta no star prince hyphen sama music note maji love 1000 percent sign (it has not earnt the familiarity of UtaPri with me) is a depressingly high-budget anime of a dating sim aimed towards women. Ostensibly about the power of music, love and friendship, it is, realistically speaking, actually aboutjack shit. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a modern day Yamato Nadeshiko with eyes the colour of soup, who wears a short skirt and can't do anything by herself, except play piano. So of course she enters a prestigious idol-making music academy (disguised as a gigolo school) where the ratio of male to female students is astonishingly unbalanced. Despite a personality that is as inviting as her pet cactus and terrifying, terrifying eyes she manages to attract several of potential suitors, apparently through magic, or, as yaoi would put it \"sex smell\". By the end of this 13 episode series (or, as I like to think of it, six and a half hours of my life I will never get back) Soup-chan has to pick one of the guys to duet with for her graduation audition. Thus the achingly vacuous reverse-harem sausagefest begins.\\n\\n\r\nDaringly, unlike several music-based anime series that came before it, such as Nodame Cantabile, Detroit Metal City, Beck, K-On!, and so on, Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000% decides to forego having any listenable music tracks in its OST. The OP is as dull as the protagonist's personality and the ED (which you will hear in various instrumental and acapella forms throughout) is the musical equivalent of putting a cotton bud too far in your ear and experiencing the crippling though dull facial pain that follows. Other tracks in the OST are just forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nLike a song that's so cute it angers you, the talented vocal cast in this show fail to shine. Miyuki Sawashiro, for example, is just incessantly irritating as the voice of our main character - and similarly with Mamoru Miyano, as all I wanted to do was give his character a surprise tracheotomy with a pen for that goddamn vibrato he used in every song. It's the same with the other voice actors, though those two were particularly grating. Most of the male characters, except the slightly shady evil twins and split personalities, of course, have bizarrely high voices in a desperate bid to sound cute. Or maybe there's an implicit rule that all male Japanese singers are eunuchs, I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a music academy that caters to exclusively creating idols that sing pop songs, rather than to cultivate actual talent, is an apt metaphor for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the art is pretty, bright and cheerful, but it soon becomes clear how the studio cut corners with the budget - the horrific spasms the male characters experience when dancing, the occasionally over-bright scenes where characters are standing in thick fog though they are indoors, and - I can't express my anger enough over this - the chibi. It's like the art director (cunningly disguised as the manager of Death Records) went \"bitches love chibi, give them MORE chibi, FUCK!\" and that is what they did. If I had a drink every time there was chibi, I would be dead.  \\n\\n\r\nThough I enjoyed hating this anime, and laughing at the incredible stupidity (talking to her grandmother in her head - presumably her grandmother is dead - presumably that cat has the spirit of her grandmother - did her grandmother just turn into a bishie?), there is a more serious issue with this show. That is, the reason for its very existence - to perpetuate the kind of obsessive fan culture that encourages people to watch pretty boys in every stereotype you can imagine, from sweet to suave and silly to tsundere, have ~subtext~ with each other while still being interested in the [insert yourself here] main role. The same kind of people that would buy the merchandise and image CDs. It leaves a pretty sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like staring into our lead girl's eyes, watching this anime, you will realise it has no soul - and that watching it probably devalues your own. Like an egotistical person, the show is admittedly pretty, but, boy, doesn't it know it.",

            "content": "O_O Now I've seen it all *shoots self* \r\nStory [7/10]: The concept of having a music academy to train students to become future idols. That itself sounds really interesting. In the 2nd episode there was good development in the story through assignment given to the students where one has to compose other to write lyrics and record it. Alas such challenges were never shown after ep 2. The heroine has been given extra special attention by all the guys right from ep 1 without any reason(maybe typical of a reverse harem). A big letdown. I mean why cant the feelings develop slowly as the daysof all characters together progress. Pace of the story is really slow in terms of development. Episodes are wasted on introducing all the guys (6 + one magical creature/guy perhaps- yeah talking about Cecile) no excitment to watch except seing the bishonens in different angles. The way the story is revealed looks very plastic- unrealistic and made up for visual feast to the girls exclusively. The only other good point storywise is the continuity it has kept from one episode to the next. Inspite of all this I dont know why but I am still continuing to watch the show. So if you are okay with a not too interesting plot development then go on ahead to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: No doubt in this. All the guys are awesome. Haruka's eyes though is a heavy disappointment. I actually avoid looking too much in her eyes (cause then maybe I'll get hypnotised :P). Background scenery is good. The campus seems really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: Need I say anything about this. AWESOME SONGS!!!! Just listen to the tunes and you'll be fluttering like a leaf in the wind. Voice actors all have done a good job for their characters as well. AWESOME SONGS\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [8/10]: All guys have a distinct personality. Though I would have preferred genuinely smiling characters as a change. i mean come on, you cant have an expression like this =.= all the time and expect the audience's mindset to change forcefully towards the character by suddenly seeing him singing and dancing. Smile is a must while performing (well with expections of course for songs which are supposed to be grim). And it is the only thing that also adds vibrance to the idol image of the character. Still most of the guys have this feature so its all good. and Haruka completely fails to give any impact on screen for me. Her personality is absolutely weak. Even Ringo the supporting character has her screen presence felt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]: I give this ratings because of the following points:\\n\r\n1) Pop music theme. This is the first series which I actually came across with a full fledged pop music theme. Though I agree skip beat also had some of it.\\n\r\n2) Bishounens.\\n\r\nNo interesting scenes showing the actual process of training students to be future idols. Though i have to admit songs are groovy in each episode. Wait songs are AWESOME. Amazing grace !!!!!\\n\r\nAll in all its the kind of show to get caught up watching in all the hype.",

            "content": "What you will find in this anime is a group of cute guys who are pros at music.\r\n~Story: There is nothing particularly special about the plot of UtaPri. It follows the journey of a girl who got accepted to a very extravagant music school. There she met a group of cute guys who gradually got to love her music. This anime is a typical reverse harem. Do not expect to find any major plot twists because UtaPri is quite light-hearted and often uses comedy.\r\n~Art: The first time I looked at the main girl character, I was like \"Why does she have such creepy eyes?!\" Ihave to say the other characters' eyes are less creepy and look more normal. The art of UtaPri really has an elegant tone to it(please excuse the times when they dance like robots). What I really like about the visuals in UtaPri is the colors. There is always a happy feeling in this anime because of the use of a range of colors.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound: UtaPri is an anime about music. I am sure anyone would be disappointed if this aspect of the anime was not done well. i think that the background soundtrack is quite suitable. The singing however has been the part that I really enjoyed. When people keep asking the question \"Can music change the world?\", I really have to give a yes as an answer. I felt that the songs in UtaPri are all quite emotional.\\n\\n\r\n~Character: Every character has been briefly explored in the anime. I haven't played the game UtaPri but after reading Wikipedia, I would assume that it is a lot more detailed and the characters are more thoroughly explained. While all sharing the love for music, the characters each have their own distinct personality. Each of the characters is assigned with a certain color. Sometimes, I find that the colors really expresses their personality.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment: I wouldn't say that I really like this anime. The only enjoyment I got from watching UtaPri came from the voices. I have to admit that I only watched this anime because Mamoru Miyano starred in it. For me, the singing has made the best moments for me in UtaPri.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a short anime based around music or enjoys watching a reverse harem  with cute guys, UtaPri is the anime for you.",

            "content": "At surface level this appears to be another reverse-harem otome kind of anime, but it\u2019s actually much better than that. There is a reverse harem element, with all 6 of the guys vying for Haruka's attention, but there isn\u2019t any actual romance (well, a little), which makes it an oddity amongst the shoujo genre. The biggest draw for me when watching was that Haruka, while still the female party of a massive love-hexagon, doesn\u2019t just fall into the shadows and become a Mary-Sue type character; she\u2019s a great female lead, and without her personality the way that it is, there\u2019s no way any of thiswould\u2019ve happened. She is the reason things turn out the way they do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the biggest audience for this anime is young females, as there are many sexy guys, and each of them has their own distinct personality, some clashing violently with others, some of which are not very common in shoujo anime: the obliviously innocent one, the stoic serious one, the childish-yet-yandere one, the tsundere, the ladies man, and the I\u2019m-gonna-close-myself-off-to-you-because-I-don\u2019t-want-your-help-but-I\u2019ll-warm-up-to-you-eventually one. And each one of them is hot as hell. (There\u2019s also plenty of room for yaoi ships, which is a plus but doesn\u2019t draw interest away from the actual plot.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters were great as well. There was the best friend who, while she could be considered prettier than our heroine, doesn\u2019t out-shine her but instead plays a big role just as being her friend. There\u2019s the headmaster, who\u2026 I just don\u2019t know with this guy. And there\u2019s a trap character! Haruka\u2019s teacher is a crossdresser, and boy does he make an attractive lady. Other sub-characters are interesting as well, and I\u2019m glad that they weren\u2019t just there to be, well, there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it\u2019s very smooth and pretty. Characters are well fleshed-out and look amazing (Haruka has the prettiest eyes on any anime female ever and you can\u2019t tell me otherwise), and the plot is decent. In fact, the plot is not very good compared to how amazing the rest of it is. There are multiple plot holes, parts that don\u2019t make sense, things that move too slow, and the ending has a giant \u201cwhere the fuck did this come from?\u201d moment (there was something to do with magic and cats and Greek Muses and God damn he\u2019s hot), but overall it wasn\u2019t horrible, there was good comedic moments, and even the minor characters are very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the music: HOLY HELL is there good music, but in an anime that\u2019s all about music, did you really expect anything less? The opening is good, maybe not the best, but the ending? \u201cMaji Love 1000%\u201d is amazingly good. This is one of the few rare instances where the ending theme out-shines the opening theme, and it makes us sit through the credits every time, just to listen to it all. The music within the show is also great; the songs are straight from the character\u2019s hearts, and they\u2019re sung with such passion that it pulls you in and really makes you listen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is definitely worth your time to watch as it's very interesting and entertaining. \\n",

            "content": "Uta no Prince-sama was originally a dating simulation game which has been adapted into an anime and manga. It\u2019s a reverse harem which is basically a whole lot of bishi guys, the main female protagonist and her one female friend who really has no point or purpose in being there asides from stopping Nanami from looking like some friendless loser.\r\nSo why a 6? It\u2019s not that I hated this anime, in fact most people would thoroughly enjoy it, it\u2019s not bad, but at the same token it\u2019s not great. It has a lot of floors which I just couldn\u2019t look past despite enjoying bishie\u2019s.\r\nFirst offthe whole theme and feeling of the anime is off, it tries to invite you to this real shoujo loving land where the background music is lovey dovey piano pieces, the progression is slow and there is a lot of wide shots, yes its trying to build atmosphere. Yet it fails because as soon as we\u2019ve settled into a shoujo feeling, sitting on clouds, sipping tea mood, we are hit with up beat pop songs, quirky actions from the bishie characters and what appears to be an attempt at a \u2018cool\u2019 anime feel.\\n\r\nThis really shouldn\u2019t have been done, the mixture of most of the time piano background tunes to pop songs is just really awkward, not to mention after watching the boring Nanami talk about her grandmother for the majority of a shot to suddenly swing to a joke being had by one of the male characters, just kills it. You can\u2019t enjoy that joke because you\u2019ve become so bored by Nanami.\\n\r\nThey honestly should have cute out all the over the top shoujo feel and background piano tunes and shortened the shots considerably because a lot of the time while I\u2019m watching Nanami seemingly do nothing I feel like fast forwarding anyway.\\n\r\nWhy? Because she\u2019s got to be one of the most boring, lifeless, spineless shoujo character\u2019s I have ever come across. The writers attempt at a sweet, grandma loving girl is completely over the top, and in real life a guy wouldn\u2019t take a second look at a girl who seems like such a blank book.\\n\r\nIt really hit me how much I loathed this character in Ren\u2019s episode, while he\u2019s being a prissy weakling ripping his lyrics up into tiny little pieces of paper and letting the wind carry them off this high castle like balcony to the large garden of the academy. (Realistically speaking, such a gust of wind would carry those pieces of paper\u2019s kilometres away...) Nanami perks up \u2018I will go find your lyrics for you!\u2019 is she STUPID?! That\u2019s completely impossible! But hey, this is shoujo\u2026nothing is impossible. She spends her whole night finding these pieces of paper until sunrise.\\n\r\nWas this meant to make me feel heart warmed towards her? It did the absolute opposite.\\n\r\nNow, there is a saving grace to this anime, because if I looked past the girl character I could concentrate on the bishi guys, some who are actually pretty damn hilarious. My favourite was instantly Ittoki, he was refreshing and hell we needed it after the first episode of Nanami! Then there was Shou the short and fiery fellow who\u2019s always getting teased by his roommate Natsuki (obsessed with cute small things), who if you take the glasses off of turns into his dark side Satsuki. I adored these characters!\\n\r\nThat said I found all the other guys either boring, arrogant or in Ren\u2019s case a total loser.\\n\r\nThe art is also pretty damn good, and despite Nanami having no personality to boot she\u2019s good to look at. The artists obviously put a lot of effort into the background and the lighting. So it\u2019s always very aesthetically pleasing.\\n\r\nFinally what kept me hooked asides from those loveable character\u2019s I mentioned was the music! I really loved some of the tunes done by the idols and it left me wondering who sings them in real life. I did bob along in my seat to the songs and rewind to watch them again. I really love how each song matches that character who is singing it, and I always looked forward to the next idol\u2019s song and seeing what they came out with!\\n\r\nReally sorry if this review upsets you hardcore fans, I\u2019m just being honest with my opinions and justifying them the best I can. I will finish watching this series, for those three characters I adore and the idol music! \\n\r\n(But I really, REALLY wish they gave Nanami some kind of quirk!)\\n",

            "content": "Bad, like I can't believe I watched this for about 7 episodes bad. LOL! I'm really trying to come up with SOMETHING good about this anime but I just have nothing. \r\nLet me breakdown how bad this is.\r\nThe lead girl- She has weird eyes and is just plain DULL as dish water! She's one of those typical goody two shoes girls I can't stand, the type who tries to please everyone but really she just uses her goodness as an excuse to not make a clear decision so she just strings the guys along. But of course her heart is PURE and therefore she reallyisn't stringing anyone along, because she's soooooo good. I knew i couldn't watch another episode when everyone had to pair up for a song, one is supposed to write while the other sings, naturally all the guys wanted to team up with her, so what does she do? She picks them all, and she is allowed to do it, never mind that several other song writers would be left with no partner to sing their songs. apparently all the guys want to sing her songs because she is supposed to be so good, but I have yet to hear a song from her that was anything but LAME.\\n\\n\r\nthe guys- Stereotypical dating Sim guys, shallow, with nothing going on but cute looks, of course one or two would have a \"deep\" past or something, but it's worn like a fashionable coat, in other words, it's something the main girl can just smile away.  Not only that, but as shallow and stereotypical as the guys are, they are still more interesting than the girl which leads to a VERY important question...why do they all want her?? She has no personality, she's boring as hell, her eyes are freaky, and she writes lame songs. but then again the guys are just as lame. Whatever small measure of cool points they had were flushed down the toilet with this ridiculous dance scene that was just laughably bad and no it wasn't funny on purpose. anyway, if you love boy bands then you might gush and live through the lead girl that pretty much proves that no matter how unexciting you are you too can get a full boy band to desire you but if you want to hear good songs, not laugh yourself to death watching lame dance moves, or not suffer through a freaky eyed boring leading girl, then watch Nana or Beck",

Like when you know something is BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD and it's an insult foryour mind to enjoy it - f.e. Twilight, Jonas Brothers' singing... But you do!  That's the essence of the whole anime. \r\nStory is - assumedly - about a life of Nanami Haruka, yellow-eyed typical shoujo girl, who happens to get into famous school for future idols and compositors. Why? Oh, it's not that she has any ambitions or something. She wants to write a song for Hayato, an idol... who is strangelyalike her schoolmate, Ichinose Tokiya. Hayato's song helped her when she moved to the city... she couldn't hear her own thoughts but his song? Oh yes, no problem!\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are also flat like a wall. They've got usually one episode/one song/one problem for our cheerful schizophrenic Haruka to solve per person, and within just this one episode they are fascinated with her and simply fall in love. Easy, huh? \\n\\n\r\nMusic can be cool sometimes.  I liked the first song, weird dance and lyrics... So darn catchy! Others are pretty bland, except Satsuki's (that guy rocks!). I also hate Nanami's seiyuu. Her constant \"eeeh?\" drives me mad!\\n\\n\r\nArt is ok. I liked most of the background and images of main characters... except for Haruka and her stupid eyes. Their constant gaze gives me shiver.\\n\\n\r\nOver all... I hate to admit that I enjoy watching this stuff. I love permanent cliches, random talks, idiocy of situations... It's like watching a kid show. You know there's nothing bad inside that can hurt you. It's fluffy, cute and makes you laugh... at it. But it's nice to watch a fairytale from time to time.",

            "content": "(This is my first review)\r\nWARNING: Do not watch this show if you have a problem with the following--singing and/or music, harems, or BISHOUNENS!\r\nWhen I first heard about this show, I already had suspected that it was going to be a harem, for I had already watched La Corda d'Oro, which also had a musical theme to it. \r\nHowever, the only differences... Uta no Prince-Sama Maji Love 1000% doesn't center around magic, and the talent is all real.\r\nStory: I gave the story a nine simply because I've gotten up to episode 7 and only now has a plot began to unfold. Each of the characters havetheir own separate back-stories, and they all begin to center around their passions for the main heroine Haruka Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now, I will use my weakness for bishounens to give the art a nine! And not just the guys! The landscaping art out by the patio, the snow scenes, the rain, and even the academy is absolutely breathtaking, and the characters are all well drawn out... My only real flaw in the art? Haruka's eyes tended to freak me out sometimes. Maybe they colored her eyes a bit too much. Otherwise, I found ways to overlook that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A perfect ten for the sake of song! All of the voice acting was flawless, and the singing... TREMENDOUS. I really admire that they picked the right voice to fit each character--some surprises for me including Yuuichi Nakamura as their teacher: cross-dressing Ringo, Kenichi Suzumura as Masato (Which I didn't even recognize until I caught a slight hint of his normal \"cocky\" voice while he was singing), and even Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A nine! Most of the characters had their own spunk to them, and my overall favorites at this moment are Otoya Ittoki, Masato Hijirikawa, and Tokiya Ichinose (No particular order), simply because their personalities were among some of the most human. My least favorite character? Haruka. She just seems too... plain. I even question how the guys fall for her sometimes. I hope that we get to see more of her true personality during episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While there were certain flaws to the story that could be tweaked, and even certain moments that made me go \"WHAT WAS THAT?\" in an angry tone, I have to say that I overall enjoy this show so far because it's rather... cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm torn between a nine and a ten because of the character development, but if it solely came down to the sound and the art, the series would be a ten in my book!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like music, breathtaking art, or even just cute guys, then take a look at Uta no Prince-Sama Maji Love 1000%!",

            "content": "Uta no Prince-sama does get a lot of hate, but I am actually going to tell you why I think that it shouldn't and why it's underrated by people. But first I will go into the different aspects that make Uta-Pri good.\r\nFirst let's say a bit about myself. I like anime with story and good characters. I will spot these things out quickly. Prince-sama does not have a good story, but characters popped out. But back to me- I do not get influenced by \"handsome\" men dancing and singing. As much as the guys were attractive to me; I can push that aside and focuson everything else.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Not really much to see here. You have the main girl, Haruka Nanami, a young teen looking to be a composer. She wants to become a composer- something that a lot of background characters in Uta-Pri didn't seem to want to do. Haruka is naturally talented at picking up music and playing it, but she can't read music. This takes us to the horrible bullying that takes us to Otoya Ittoki's \"arc\". \\n\r\nDuring this arc, you see a bit more of Otoya in this. But the story of the arc wasn't much. We continue on throughout this anime through the guys and how they got that way and so on and so on. \\n\r\nBy the end- she has to pick a partner for the Graduation Audition. This was brought up in the very beginning; so it makes sense that this can be counted as the main plot for this anime. Sure it isn't original and you can find this anywhere. But the pacing done for this and how it was handled \"realistically\" was perfectly good. They went through it as a team and at the end of the day- Uta-Pri is about friendship and music; which is what was shown by the end. Only other problem with the story is that it did seem like the people were a bit high on music- which is totally fine since music does power the soul.\\n\r\nStory is good, but nothing special. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was one of the best parts of Uta no Prince-sama. The guys and girls and minor characters were all done right. Even the background characters had faces which some anime lazily drops out. The art goes through different changes from bright to dark to even a bit choppy. The choppy is the only fault in the art. The choppy is only on the dancing which isn't shown much- but it does bring it one score down. But besides that-\\n\r\nThe art was really great! The character designs are really good and you don't see it much. Otoya has a similar appearance to Avan Hardins in Valkyira Chronicles 2, but even then- Otoya is more bishie. The design of the men were obviously done to show that they are the main characters. They have weird hair color and stand out from most of the other \"generic\" guys in the show. They also have pretty boy appearances which we all know- most anime has. \\n\r\nHaruka Nanami and Tomochika Shibuya are really good design wise. Tomochika, Haruka's friend, is really unique looking. Her poofy red hair with lipstick hasn't been done quite often. Adding her magenta eyes to the mix- and you got on unique girl. Haruka, the main girl, is stunning in appearance. Her eyes are seen 'creepy' by many, but I think they are beautiful. It shows the mysteries the girl does hold into her heart. From her eyes to hair to face shape and all the way to her body- the girl is unique and very well drawn.\\n\r\nI give art 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was another key point in this anime. What would a singing anime be without the sound? The music was heaven in your ears. The voice acting done by the guys in the singing area was done really well. I'm not a fan of japanese voices since I usually watch mine in english, but I did enjoy Uta-Pri's voices since I thought the singing was done really well.\\n\r\nThe background noises like rain and footsteps were done flawlessly. You could hear every little details from the noises to the music that sent chills through your spine. I'm not a big sound person so...\\n\r\nSound gets a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters is a big part of Uta-Pri. Most shoujo anime and/or manga don't really have good characters. Ouran Highschool Host Club's characters are a bit flat compared to Prince-sama's. Uta no Prince-sama's characters were very good, and here is why.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Nanami is your 'mary-sue' main girl. She doesn't seem to have much going on with her at first glance and her character seems as shallow as a kid's pool. But once you get to the end, you realize that she is actually pretty good for a main lead. She has a background story which has been use many a times, but gives it a nice twist with her natural ear for music. She is on her way to 'mary-sue' but I don't think she is one. She is that \"flawless\" girl, but when you look at Nanami- she has a lot of issues. The girl may have a talent that not much people have (even though I know a lot of people who do in real life) , but she is a kind-hearted girl with deep issues. The anime doesn't get much into depth with her, but she was frail and her personality is quite cheerful. She isn't flawless though because a lot of the gossiping teens in that school like to talk smack about her. Haruka's relationship with each of the characters is touching as well.\\n\\n\r\nTokiya Ichinose is the main guy. He is this stoic douchebag in the beginning that I honestly couldn't stand. He thought he was so cool and thought that he can beat everyone. He didn't even give Haruka the time of the day and completely ignored some of the others. Tokiya is my favorite character due to the fact that he is the most developed. He goes from a guy I want to punch to a 'changed man'. He didn't do a complete 180 and change everything about himself. He still is a bit 'mean' but is actually very kind. He messes with the others and smiles after all this time, and he develops at a nice pace for 13 episodes. Just like the other reverse harem, Tokiya falls for Haruka. Tokiya and Haruka's relationship is sweet since you was the meanest to her. He didn't like her and it took awhile until she was the reason for him to open up. Haruka loves Hayato-sama and actually almost picked Tokiya for the mere reason that he was Hayato. Soon realized, Haruka falls for him(friend way) as who he is and decides that even if Hayato saved her life, it was really Tokiya who did.\\n\\n\r\nOtoya Ittoki is your 'genki' guy. He is outgoing and a bit messy as seen from his room. He is light-hearted and full of spirit. He isn't actually that well written since he doesn't change much. He's cheerful as hell in the beginning, but by the end; he's slightly less. He's still cheerful as hell which is why Otoya isn't that well of a character. His personality though is different from usual happy males. He is a bit shy, but outgoing. His personality is hard to describe without it seeming like he is indeed a generic 'genki' boy. His relationship with Haruka was by far the sweetest. He made sure to tell people off and even stand up for her. All he wanted was to sing her songs and make her happy. Which he ended up doing; making him extremely close with her.\\n\\n\r\nRen Jinguuji isn't your typical flirty male. From the beginning you thought he was- Especially did I. Ren is actually really developed- even Masato points out that he has changed. He was another douche in the beginning almost all the way until the end, but only difference from him, Tokiya, and Syo is that he is a flirt. Ren was the second best character due to he changed a lot. He was harsh and cold by the end, but changed for the better. He wasn't going to be bossed by his family for too long, especially since his mom and Haruka were the only reasons he attended the school. Haruka and Ren's relationship are close friends, but like the others- Ren likes her.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Shinomiya and Syo Kurusu are two teens that get along well- on Natsuki's side that is. Natsuki is a 'kawaii' lover who enjoys all things 'kawaii'. He is really outgoing, annoying, and a bit of a weird teen. When his glasses come off, Satsuki is now in control. Satsuki is another douche if he counts- making it a grand total of 6 males in Uta-Pri that are this way. Natsuki seems to enjoy Haruka's company, but I assume that's all it is, maybe not love quite yet. Natsuki is the third best character since he is developed. He goes from outgoing to a lot serious and actually takes time to think instead of cute things everywhere. Syo is one of the 6 males that are douchey. Syo is the bishie blond who enjoys having time alone while looking up to his idol. He has a fear of heights from a traumatizing experience involving him and Natsuki when they were younger. Syo gets a lot nicer by the end is actually really sweet. Haruka and Syo have another great friendship. Syo clearly enjoys Haruka's company and has a crush on her, even thinking that she was the main heroine for his own story involving his idol.\\n\\n\r\nMasato Hijirikawa is the last main character of this cast. Masato is a serious traditional man. He has the generic strict done in which he somehow gets his father to say yes for letting him go to the academy. His type reminds me a lot of Kyoya Ootori- just not a douche. Masato and Haruka's relationship is really touching. He probably loves her the 3rd most right after Otoya and Tokiya. Haruka is really grateful since he helped her get past the bullying and do what she loves.\\n\\n\r\nMinor characters like Tomo, Ringo, Hyuuga, Shining, and Cecil were all important in their own way. They all served a purpose even if they didn't have much to them. They did help the main cast in getting as far as they did.\\n\r\nWant more of a background story with these characters? Play the game. Characters are very good so they get a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this show and that's all I have to say. We all have different opinions and minds. You guys may not like it or you may do, either way- we all have a different reason for liking or hating it. So MY enjoyment for this amazing anime was a 9/10... \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this show was very good with art, sound, and characters. The rounds this all about to a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review so I hope it was decent enough~\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I'm sorry if I can't express my thoughts clearly, because English isn't my mother language. Well, Utapri... I've finished this anime few months ago and suddenly remembering it while I'm browsing MAL, so here we go:\r\nStory: 4\r\nSo here's the story: a typical shoujo entering a prestigious music school in order to study how to write good music, so she could someday deliver her music for her favorite singer--- what's his name, to sing. And as the story goes on, she meets lots of your also typical bishounens, and somehow attracted them all. Therefore, she builds her own harem, and by her so-calledwonderful music, she was like, rockin' the world. To me, there's absolutely nothing special about the story, instead, it was kinda dull. I mean, it's not realistic at all. And the part where all the boys are just stuck to her is---- ugh, holy. And then, she's said to be a wonderful composer, but her songs themselves weren't showed to us back then. She only made one WOAH song and everybody's going on praising her. Kay.....\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nWell, the only good part of this anime is the art. The art is so flashy and colorful with lots of rainbows whenever you watch this. The bishonens are pretty cool. I like almost all of them. The animation is also pretty soft and well, worth praising. On the other hand, I especially disliked the main character's eyes-- they're so ugh, scary, freaky, horrible, what do you call it. Can't they make it more, dunno, alive?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThis anime is about music, so I was expecting more on the sound... but actually there was nothing impressive at all. Just like what I've mentioned above, they should've posted more of the main character's song. And also, the BGMs weren't special. As the seiyuu... hmm I think it was well-done and they fit the characters (yes, the main chara's voice really fit her stupid personality).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nFrom all of the aspects of this anime, character makes it the worst. Nanami Haruka, as the main character, didn't stand out AT ALL. Heck, she doesn't even have a character. What's so special about her, what makes her different from all heroines in the other animes, and what even makes us come to like her as the main protagonist? She doesn't have anything. She stands out just because of her horrifying eyes that gives me thrills whenever she's being closed-up. She doesn't even have anything to be liked about. In the other side, all of the guys that liked her all of the sudden are also annoying. They're all-- duh, your typical wall-display that just appeared to make the anime happier. They don't also have interesting background/past that makes us sympathizing. To say, all of the characters are just alive for us to see, and not to feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite all of this anime's stupid mistakes and flaws, this is kinda enjoyable. If you like harem with cool boys with slight of humor, you could watch this. Even though just, beware, that you might hate the main character. Hahahahahaha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't stand out as a fabulous music anime at all. If you guys are looking for a matured and well composed music-themed anime, I don't recommend this to you. Because this anime isn't even about music--- heck, I'm out of words. This anime doesn't know nothing about music. Well, there were some cute quotes from this anime, but that's all. There's nothing we can learn from this. This anime is soo like Kiniro no Corda. If you're a fan of that series, you can go on and watch this. But if you once watch Nodame Cantabile and want to give this a try, you better don't get disappointed because this anime is nothing like Nodame Cantabile, which is an awesome music anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo... that's it?",

            "content": "Watching this anime was like getting braces tightened; painful to endure and restricting. \r\nTo put it mildly, I did not enjoy this anime. I often found myself dozing off because it was so incredibly dull. I initially tolerated the story line but that was before I actually started to watch it.  This anime was pure torture to watch for me and I am completely amazed that I even managed to finish it. Every episode felt much longer than the approximately twenty four minutes air time. Overall I found it to be extremely tiresome. \r\nI give this anime an one out of ten for itsstory.\\n\\n\r\nOne word for the art: bleh.\\n\r\nI give the art a two out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters. I measure annoying characters on the scale of one to Haruka. She is a complete door mat and fails to assert herself when it is necessary. I got tired of her little crying fits very quickly. I didn't like most of the male characters with the exception of Ichinose Tokiya. \\n\r\nI give this anime an one out of ten for the characters. Trust me, I would give this anime a zero out of ten if it were possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I like Ichinose Tokiya? Well because of his seiyuu Mamoru Miyano whom voiced Tamaki Suoh from OHSHC, Sho Fuwa from Skip Beat, Zero Kiryuu from Vampire Knight (incidentally one of the few characters I like from VK), Light Yagami from Death Note and Rin Matsuoka from Free. He is the only reason why I tolerated this anime for so long. As for the soundtrack, what a load of crap. I despise boy bands by nature and the songs were so disgustingly cheesy...I can deal with cheesy songs as long as there are comedic moments. I laughed like once during the course of this anime. \\n\r\nI give this anime a three out of ten for the sound. \\n\\n\r\nI found this anime to be tedious and dull. There is a second season? Oh I shudder to think...\\n\r\nI give this anime a two out of ten for enjoyment.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of torture, by all means watch away. Also you must receive a thorough diagnosis that you are in fact losing your mind.",

            "content": "This review is based on the first two episodes of  Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%. As more episodes come out, I will edit the review.\r\nAs most people know, Uta No Prince is based on a Visual Novel, (PS2 Game if I am not mistaken.) Involving 6 Bishies. (Bishonen boys.) \r\nStory: 7 (Based on two episodes.)\r\nThe heroine Nanami enrolls into a school specially for composers and etc. At the entrance exam she is late because on her way she had stopped to help a lost child find their mother. Because of this, the officers do not let her in.  She then meets Ittoki andRen, who manage to get her in by persuading the officers. \\n\\n\r\nThere is hinted romance currently, but I won't type it on here because of the spoilers. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, I'm guessing that this anime will be separated into arcs. (Something like Amagami SS or Starry Sky.) Where the heroine (Considering there are 6 male protagonists, each male gets 2 episodes- if the anime ends at the 12th episode.) is with a different male protagonist in each episode (This case, 2?).  \\n\\n\r\nThe story looks pretty consistent, as I have watched Amagami SS, I believe it will suit those who are looking for a light romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nThis included a bit of my personal opinion, as I found Starry Sky's art more appealing. Either way, the anime has great cell-shaded characters, nicely colored, the body proportions (Oh thank you!) They are consisnt and great throughout the episodes. I have not yet found huge eyes, sudden weird movement, or really skinny fingers and legs during the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very smooth and I'm happy to say that the animators aren't that lazy, as sometimes one of the major flaws of Visual Novels that is turned into an anime is that animators get lazy and use simple skills like scanning e.g to waste time- which Uta No Prince does not have often. The best evidence of great animation is the ED (Was the OP of Episode 1.) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI was too focused on the settings and the plot to really hear the music in the background, either way, the OP and ED are really appealing and amusing to watch (especially the ED.). \\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job (which can be told just by watching 1 episode.) the character personalities and the voices go together really well, and the singing is just 'awesome'. Many of the voice actors have sung before, and I think I've heard one of their voices in the \"Nico Nico Chorus\". Which just adds more to the sound and voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\\n\r\nI am hoping to see some good background stories for each of the characters in the arcs, because I have only watched 2 episodes- I cannot rate this any higher than a 6. Some of these characters feel to stereotypical, and after seeing many types of anime- Stereotypes don't really stand out.\\n\r\nGenerally, the character designs are really nice and they seem to have interesting personalities.  \\n\r\nI'm wanting to see how they flip the Stereotypes and create characters that can be remembered and liked. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThough I have rated \"Enjoyment\" higher than the others, this at the end is just a little personal opinion. (I find Shou's hairstyle awesome xD ) \\n\\n\\n\r\n~This anime will satisfy you if you are simply looking for a lighthearted, hinted romance, little comedy and school setting, and if you are searching for something music related- as they do sing :3 (Awfully well.)~\\n\\n\r\n[Note: Or if you are just looking for some spicy bishies]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Ok, now that this 13 episode anime has ended, I probably say that this is one fine musical drama, the plot of this story only plays a minimal role, because like any musical drama show be it live or animated, it is always the climax that's important co'z the featured song is the climax, and this this case it is \"Maji Love 100%\" or in English \"'True Love 1000%,\" so for the story I'll give it a \"Fair\"6.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- Mediocre number 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime needs no explanation it has similarities with another anime \"Starry Sky\" with minor adjustments.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Great number 9.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's just say that I kinda like all the songs being played in this anime especially the ending theme \"Maji Love 1000%.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime only focuses on Haruka Nanami a girl form the countryside who came to Saotome Academy to study because of her love for music, her personality can be compared to that with another character Kelsi Neilsen from \"High School Musical\" who is shy and doesn't have much confidence with herself, however thanks to the support and motivation of friends she was able to find the will to go on, the rating for this anime is actually for her, since it's all about her and how she struggles with the predicament she has . Since this anime has a harem genre in it, its said genre is actually a reverse harem, but it still follows the usual harem arc where the male members fell for the girl's (Haruka) simplicity, naivety, sense of compassion and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nJust who were her harem? Here they are:\\n\\n\r\n Hijirikawa Masato - a rich guy groomed to take over his family's business empire.\\n\\n\r\nIchinose Tokiya - a pop idol who goes by the name Hayato who hates being demoted to become a soap opera star, comes to the academy for a fresh start.\\n\\n\r\nIttoki Otoya- the first guy Haruka met and the one who motivated her to not give up on her dream.\\n\\n\r\nRen Jinguuji- a campus playboy, who is a laid back son of a wealthy businessman. \\n\\n\r\nShou Kurusu - a small dude with a great sense of fashion.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Shinomiya - a cheerful individual with 2 personalities, one is the violent Satsuki and the other is the witty and happy Natsuki.\\n\\n\r\nOf course no harem genre would be complete if Haruka doesn't have a best friend in Tomochika Shibuya, who always stand by her side. As for rest like:\\n\\n\r\nShining Saotome- an enigmatic school principal with the flare for the extravagant.\\n\\n\r\nRingo Tsukimiya- the cross-dressing fag who is Haruka's Homeroom teacher.\\n\\n\r\nHyuuga Ryuuya- a teacher every student wanna hates, who happens to be Tokiya's hoomeroom teacher.\\n\\n\r\nThey serve more like the antagonist, but in a subtle way.\\n\\n\r\nand there is this dude who dresses like Aladdin, Cecil Aijima,  Info states that he's the prince of Angapolis and curse to become a cat, but it kinda look like that he's more of a cameo and a guest singer than anything else in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall- good number 7\\n\\n\r\nWhat make this enjoyable are the songs especially the ending theme, though this anime also has a romance genre in it, the said genre serves like  a predicament for the main female character, however it did ended like a harem genre would, where it didn't feature anybody whom the main female lead would pick, but, what really has the big impact in the ending of this anime is the main climax which is the feature song itself which the male seiyu performed well, so.\\n\\n\r\n7\\n\r\n6\\n\r\n5  Tokiya: Are you ready?\\n\r\n4  Ren: Are you ready?\\n\r\n3  Shou: Are you ready?\\n\\n\r\n2\\n\r\n1\\n\\n\r\nAll: Come!

I've never wanted to watch a girl with lime eyes succeed in the world of Music. \r\nMy biggest complaint about this anime is Diabolik lovers is just a better story. While this anime focuses on building a band and watching them fall in love with our Lime Eyes. I found that this was pretty lacking for character development. \r\nThis anime reflects my life me as a person. I have lime eyes and all of the boys in mylife keep wanting to date me. I'm not sure how I could find an anime that relates to me as a person but it actually exist! I am HAPPY with how this anime starts off but it left me wanting more after the season ended. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have lime eyes and are looking for your own harem of boys that will sing to you but you can't date any of them because you only truly love music. This is the anime for you. Please do take time out of your life from a fellow lime eyes having user to another and enjoy this master piece.",

            "content": "[STORY] - 8/10\r\n-----------\r\nThe story, climax, and the ending of this anime was not the worst, but it was also not the very best. The beginning was really hard for me to understand, but as I kept watching this anime, it started to get a little bit more interesting. The ending also left me in tears of happiness. It was truly a beautiful ending, and the ending was not a disappointment at all. \r\n[ART] - 8/10\r\n-----------\r\nFor an anime that was released from 2011, I expected the qualities and graphics to be a little bit more 'stable'. When the scenes were both dark and bright, the sceneswere very blurry and there was a lot of small pixels I could see throughout this anime as well. The background and the scenery was very well put together. The school architect and the nature of this anime was spot on.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI do admit, the opening and the ending themes were alright surprisingly. At first, the ending was kind of cringe, and the more I heard it, the more I was like, \"ok I need to stop watching this now\", but when I got to know the characters of this anime a little better, the ending theme actually sounded quite nice because it made sense to me. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nSome of the character's appearances were very disappointing, especially Nanami, Haruka. Her eye color and hair color (in my opinion) didn't really match at all, but her personality reminded me a little bit of my school life. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI try not to watch anime music related anime, because my whole life was filled with being around music. If I watched something music related, I would usually end up either in tears or being very angry at the story. It's hard to explain, but that's how it works for me. I wouldn't be disappointed if this anime didn't have a next season, but it seems like there are like, what, 4-5 seasons more? I honestly don't know if I'll watch them right away. I'll probably get back to this series if I'm ever needing something to watch in the future. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI wouldn't probably enjoy this anime if I watched it again, so I'll just leave this anime at that. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "I was pretty skeptic about this anime since it was originally an otome game. Don't get me wrong - I love otome games and I'm huge fan of them, but from the adaption I have seen, the animes has just made it gone downhill.. . proberly from the lack of development like the games and since they have to squeeze this all in 25 mins, it's impossible to take interest.\r\nHowever, Uta No Prince Sama wasn't what I expected. Take note that I have NEVER played the game ( i have only read reviews).\r\nFirstly, the main character, Haruka, is your typically shy girl in which everyonewalks all over.. and most of her actions can be annoying (cue loads of eye rolling). However, throughout the anime, she does have a hidden strength and she does have a goal she wants to achieve. Sometimes you can't help but appreciate her. I do think, in some ways, Haruka IS a character ANYONE can relate too. The side characters are not too bad either - most of them adding comic or reassurance to the show to make it enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the guys, of course, unlike the game, each episodes can't express the characters fully, but you do get a grasp on what each of them are like and why they wanted to become idols in the first place. There are some of those typical characters (the cheery idiot, the rich guy, the player, the manly shota, the guy with twin personalities, the guy that's in too deep etc),  which I am not bothered about tbh, since it made the show enjoyable.  It does sadden me a TINY bit that they missed of some important parts from the game but it didn't matter too much. It made the show less complicated therefore making the story flow a little bit easier for first time viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, putting aside the characters, I think the storyline is done quite well - most of the episodes did link so the plot didn't love control along the way. The more I watched, the more I was intrigued and found myself singing along to some of the songs. That aside, what I didn't expect was some... odd paranormal things to happen in this anime, which added the WTF factor, but ehh, shit happens *shrugs*.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can say this anime is enjoyable and not as bad as it seems. It's most ideal if you're looking for nothing too serious. If you're into shoujos with a light hearted comedy and romance, this anime I could reccomend. I'm not sure if my opinions will differ if I have played the game but all in all I still like this anime. Afterall, they have a second season and in making for the 3rd so I guess it's all up to you :) \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching a few episodes, I came to the conclusion that this anime is extremely corny. Yes, there are many corny anime shows, but this is the corniest one I have probably ever come across. I would most definitely like it more if the characters had more distinct personalities and problems. Sure, each of them were different, but I couldn't find myself being emotionally attached to any of them, and that includes the harem. \r\n I felt like everyone revolved around the harem and Starish, like the principal, for instance. He followed them everywhere and did all kinds of things for them and Icouldn't help but wonder, 'Doesn't he have an entire music school to run?' Also, the harem really wasn't very interesting or relatable when it comes to her dreams and struggles.\\n\\n\r\n Usually in every anime, I like the music, but with this one, I didn't find any of the music that good. . . and the show is supposed to be about music. Why don't I like it? Well, to me it sounds like a generic J pop group with similar songs. It needed more originality. That could have been the reason why they become popular because their music is different from everyone else.The music should of had some sort of twist, maybe to convey the hardships of Starish as a group.\\n\\n\r\n Which brings me to another point. The struggles of the group were kind of silly and melodramatic. It would have been better if each of the members had very different backgrounds and were not all that popular. The struggle would be them working together to become different and reach their dreams in music as a group with Nanami to influence them; Trying to be original yet popular in the process. They should have each used their own personal talents and abilities to contribute to the group, but they all acted the same. I'd say the most developed character in this anime was Ichinose because he changed throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\n I suggest that if you like things like High School Musical, then this is the perfect anime for you, but if you like anime shows with an original plot, engaging characters, and touching aftertaste, don't watch this one.",

There is no major conflict. There are interesting back stories of the characters which keep the anime progressing but that\u2019s about it. \r\nUta no Prince-Sama is a musical (and another otome based anime hrngggggggg). (You have been warned.) But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as intense as High School Musical. And I found myself liking most of the OSTs!\r\nBecause it\u2019s a musical, there\u2019s a lot of dancing, singing and all that jazz. The animation company does a crappyjob at animating it (especially dancing).\\n\\n\r\nDuring the beginning of the anime, there was a particular bias to one of the characters, which was surprising since this is an otome anime. The anime kind of strings you along (well, at least I was strung along) believing the main character, Haruka, will actually end up with that one specific guy but\u2026 UtiPri stays true to the otome nature. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, if it weren\u2019t for the cute, funny moments and the great music, I wouldn\u2019t have continued watching largely because it\u2019s so predictable! If Haruka is caught in a little problem, you probably have a 99.9% chance of correctly guessing what is going to happen and how she\u2019s going to get out of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, watch for the great music and the cute jokes! I had a surprisingly good time with this anime!",

Some really think it's terrible and that they do poor adaptations. I disagree with this especially since there is UtaPri. Some sign it off as dumb but there are great elements here I think don't get noticed not that  much. \r\nStory 8\r\nAt first it's simple as they can get and it has a formula that it follows . But there is nothing wrong with that. In both seasons everyone in Starish gets an episodeto themselves and Haruka also gets some focus. Then the rest of the episodes they try to focus on solving the problem. We know the ending at the first moment but we get to see how. And this works greatly. They also balance comedy and drama nicely . Though at times they dont flesh out world elements greatly.That is the only thing that holds the story back from getting an 9 but look past that and you have a great story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5\\n\r\nHakura is possibly one of the most overhated characters I've seen. People always sign her off as useless,dumb, and boring. But without her some of the events in the series wouldn't happen, she has a personality, motivation ,goal,and helps people. Plus she develops so in other words she is a three dimensional character who is likable.  The other guys also get development and are likable and well rounded. The side characters are fun to see too. Bonds are strong here and almost everyone is likable. Sadly some sides don't devolp though others do get some development. That's why it's an 8.5 and not a 9.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art 10\\n\r\nAnimation is fluently done,designs stand out ,and it has a color pallet that fits the series. Overall a big highlight to the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nThere is no dub sadly but the sub is great. Everyone stands out and dose there parts well. The ops and eds are memorable and very nice. The sound track is very good and fitting. The songs the characters sing are great and fit the tone and feelings they have for that song. Overall the sound is great and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI really love this series. I can see why some wouldn't but I enjoyed it till the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nI know it's not perfect but I love it despite that. I do think it's worth at least a try if you think it's worth it.\\n",

            "content": "Apparently a lot of people really enjoyed this based on its score, so I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it straight off the bat. I am however going to leave some notes that I wrote down while watching it and my final thoughts after watching the final episode.\r\n* They made sooo many scenes excessively dramatic (especially the ones that really didn't need to be) to the point where I find myself laughing at what I presume is all the wrong places, not because it's actually funny but because I don't know what else to do because it's so absurd and uncomfortable.\r\n* Istopped in the middle of this anime to read the reviews to see if it gets any better and in a review someone mentioned that the girl's eyes has the color of soup. Now I can't unsee it and it's turned into a show of 6 hungry guys (literally).\\n\r\n* The headmaster's constantly on crack, and not in the funny kind of way but in the I hope he gets help someday kind of way.\\n\r\n* Not only is he on crack, but he's also creepy AF. He's got cameras and microphones everywhere and when he's not stalking his students from behind a screen, he's personally out and about lurking in a bush somewhere to stalk and/or ambush his students. I guess this is supposed to be like a funny quirk of his or something.\\n\r\n* I feel like the thought behind this was probably good, because I like the idea of the anime and the idea of the ending, but I do not like the way they ended up doing it. It's like they took a good thing and amplified it to the point where it's just too much of everything and everyone and SOUP EYES.\\n\r\n* Only 2 (the candy colored redhead and the lil' hat guy) out of the 6 hot guys are actually hot. They are also the only 2 whose personalities aren't exaggerated through the roof, but this is all based on personal preference.\\n\r\n* As soon as I was actually able to completely ignore the lyrics used, I really started to like the songs. The music's nicely done and there's nothing wrong with their voices. It's catchy.\\n\r\n* The art is nicely done. I'll admit that there's a lot of chibi, but I don't mind. It actually helps by taking the focus off the super tense dramatic feeling every once in a while.\\n\r\n* The amount of magical beings showing up to help soupy-eyes bothers me since the anime doesn't appear to take place in a magical universe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, final thoughts after watching the final episode:\\n\r\nIt's not a romantic anime, but it's not a drama either, yet it's not a comedy. Or it's all of these, I don't even know anymore. All I know is that it's definitely not hentai and I think that's a shame since it's the only thing it would've been really good at. 6 good lookin' guys passing around 1 confused little soup lady until they finally decide to come together like one big happy family and just go for her all at once? 10/10 would watch.",

            "content": "(*INCLUDES MINOR SPOILERS*) Alright, so I admit... I barely watched this show. I couldn't stand it; still can\u2019t. The girl is an absolute loser, she can barely do anything by herself. I'm currently under the impression that she couldn't even read music before entering some prestigious school for MUSIC, so that she could meet a famous singer like an annoying fangirl (at least learn before going, not while you are there). This show reduced to its bare essence is about a girl who can't do very much and to me doesn't seem to able to inspire anyone (if she can't do anything, then how isshe going to inspire anyone?!) manages, despite all her lameness gets six guys to fall in love with her. She's not even pretty. Those eyes *cringe*.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As I said. Haruka, the main character, cannot do very much, doesn't write good lyrics (come on, the lyrics are ridiculous) is horribly naive, and full of indecision (made to look like she's just too sweet, and kind, and adoringly naive to come to a decision in which would displease, God forbid, one single useless person). She manages to get six insanely gorgeous (*snort* well maybe just one) and talented (*hurdurdurdur*) boys to fall in love with her.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't like it. I gave it a six because it's not bad per se, but it's not my style. I hate the strange hair colors, eye colors, the strangely matched clothes, the haircuts...the list just goes on. I could live with it though. If this was an amazing anime, the art wouldn't have even been an issue (or at least, not that big of an issue). But it\u2019s not an amazing anime now, is it?\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music isn't what I would normally listen to. In all honesty I was looking for something like Mozart or Rachmaninoff (Haruka plays the piano for God's sake, doesn't she know at least some of the classics? And no \u2018Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u2019 does not count). It isn't bad music, and in all honesty, I find it to be engaging and upbeat, but it's not what I hoping for (Going to a prestigious school to practically become a new 'One Direction', hahaha, NO.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, there are some background to each character, but it seems cliche and doesn't create any empathy with them. Their reasons for their actions aren't fully explained and their reactions are too damn trusting and stupid (e.g.: Haruka and Ittoki (or whatever his name is) met for 1 day, and he's already in love. I don't believe you can fall in love without even knowing ANYTHING about this person). Haruka is portrayed to be too nice for her own good. She is late for her entrance exam to go to the so called \"Prestigious-School-for-One-Direction-Wannabees\" because she was helping a lost kid find their mother. Now please do not misunderstand, that was kind and very nice of her. I'm happy she did that, but please do not repeat that same kindness at least five times in one episode. No one is that kind. Horribly unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well...I gave it a four for it's humor, but...their dancing...(*ugghhhh*).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I DO NOT LIKE IT. There is nothing, I repeat NOTHING, special about this butt trumpet they call Haruka. There is nothing to differentiate this anime among the hundreds of others like it. It's not special. The main character is not a very strong person (although her tenacity is to be admired (I guess) and her perseverance is something to be rivaled (high unrealistic though). It doesn't captivate the audience with anything worthwhile (except for this Hayato guy, but even then...). I'm afraid I cannot recommend this at all.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the poor grammar. \\n\\n\\n",

I didn't expect much from it, I thought it would be average, I was half-right. It is a pretty average plot, but the characters, the art, and mostly the sound gave an awesome feel to it.

            "content": "I found UtaPri to be basically your regular reverse-harem type anime. It's a cast of handsome guys centered around one 'somehow special' girl. Not horribly unique. As far as the story goes, I have to say, there wasn't much to it. No crazy plot twists or suspense to speak of. Everything that happened was pretty predictable, though I will say that except for some slow parts, the story did at least flow well. \r\nI did find the art to be pretty fun. I would have rated it higher, but the main heroine has some pretty freaky eyes that aren't emulated in any of the othercharacters, and I found that to be extremely off-putting throughout the series. Otherwise, the art features mainly bright colors, and there were very few parts where the art was particularly lacking. I thought the random chibified scenes were cute, too, which was a plus. \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the music for this anime was surprisingly good. I know it's supposed to be about boys becoming idols, but the music was still pretty high quality, and the voice actors they chose all had voices that were pleasing to the ear. No weak vocals to speak of, so that was a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this anime a 7. It's not a bad watch, but if you're looking for something particularly engaging, I would suggest going somewhere else. This is a good series if you just want to sit back, relax, and take a load off your mind (oh, and listen to pretty anime boys sing). \\n\\n",

It is anime about music, so it would suck if the music was no unique or interesting. So yes, the music is good in the fact that not only pop chords are used but the melody in each song are very unique and different fromeach other, and most songs being sung by pretty boys with sexy voices, what more can you ask for?! Kya! \\n\\n\r\nThe only let down would be the characters, they are a little typical to most shoujo animes, and out of the guys, there is the one guy with the interesting background story. And the girl is shy and weak, calling to be protected so I found her most boring at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good, but contain some flaws. As a musician and composer myself, it is incredibly hard to write music, so to see that music is being pumped out so easily is a little nonsensical. Anyways, it is an anime, so you would expect not everything to work like reality.\\n\\n\r\nPlease give it a shot if you are into good looking guys with amazing singing voices though. :) It was overall still very enjoyable to watch!",

Why, how, or when?\r\nThe characters themselves don't give you a lot of reasons to genuinely like and care for them, especially with Haruka since she's another example of a main girl that's just there, simply. Each one ofthe main boys got an individual episode which has fleshed them out, but not much or in a way that's immediately obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good for idol anime standards, you could say it's fitting at most, but only that much. There are some good tunes here & there though.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay somewhat. A-1 is known for making stuff that has a lot of visual appeal to it, but the dancing animations are a distraction and Haruka's eyes, in particular, make her look like a living corpse.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't like how this series has presented itself like, let it be known that I don't hate it. I like idol anime, at least subjectively, and me not giving the series a hard 1 or 2 in total is thanks to that and I'll give it another shot for season 2. I believe this is a good enough score for it overall, though if you don't love idol anime, don't watch this.\\n",

Let me enlighten you.\r\n[Story] Here you get your typical-reverse-harem-cliched dose of idiotic story in which, of course, the main guys all fall for the same girl, which happens to be a kind-hearted, stupid, useless girl that got accepted at a luxurious music academy withoutknowing how to fucking read scores.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] If you don't mind the robotic dance moves and the spasms on their faces while singing, i think the art is beautiful and bright. BUT i need to point out the main character's avocado eyes (when I first saw them, I really thought she was blind).\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] I actually started the anime because I knew Mamoru Miyano was voice acting, and I won't complain, because he did a great job. The other characters voices are on point, and the soundtrack was quite good. However, despite the \"songs need heart to be beautiful\" thingy, most of them sounded dull or forced. What I can't believe myself is that I got to like the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] Now we get to the deep stuff. While the main character is so annoying that she became one of the reasons I dropped the show, there are, thankfully, characters who bring a ray of light into the show, but they cannot overcome the dullness of the main guy, which has, you got it, a depressing past. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're not a hardcore yaoi fangirl who needs material for fanfiction or someone who gave up on life, don't waste your time watching something I can say ,without doubt, you won't be able to enjoy.\\n\r\nOr, maybe, you could have a cringe challenge with your friends and use this crap as reference.",

            "content": "Where to start with Uta no Prince-sama... An anime that's about composing music and trying to be an idol with the most annoying main character on Earth and the only reason I had to put this anime on pause. Will I drop it? No... But only because I'm waiting for something interesting to happen, though something tells me it won't. I've seen about 5 episodes and I've already had enough of it. The only thing that's good about the anime is the male characters. Even the animation is pretty horrible, even when they're singing and dancing, which is supposed to look good. \r\nThis is theonly anime I've ever had to put on pause because of how not enjoyable it was.\\n\\n\r\nI guess we can start talking about the good, the bad, and the ugly of Uta no Prince-sama.\\n\\n\r\nTo note, I understand this is reverse harem. But that is no excuse.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4)\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect to be watching Uta no Prince-sama for the story. I won't tell you about it since the essentials are above for your liking, but it really isn't all that good. Haruka wants to be a composer when she falls in love with a singer she hears. That's about as compelling as it gets, really. She goes to a composing arts school to try and learn how to make music for singers, and the best part is, when she goes, she doesn't even know anything about it and can't even read notes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother boring heroine who can't do anything in the story and needs the side characters to hold her hand. This alone is really boring.\\n\\n\r\nSince there isn't much to say about the story, I guess we can move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6)\\n\\n\r\nThe art for most of the characters is good, and I admire the details taken into the background characters and the area where the story takes place. The art of the anime is actually pretty good. I can't help but admire many of the male characters, especially Tokiya and Otoya, who look exactly as nice as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the animation, which makes the art quality drop dramatically. The animation in this is horrendous. When the characters are singing or dancing, the movements are gimmicky and look very stupid. The lips move very unrealistically when they sing. Dance moves don't look fluid and the arms just swing around. Way to go. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5)\\n\\n\r\nEh... I can't really remember individual character songs and stuff. The sound quality is mediocre and the songs aren't really special. The only song in this anime I can even slightly remember is the ending song. And even then the only thing I remember is the words \"Are you ready?\" \\n\\n\r\nI hear people quite liked the music... I don't see what's so great about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\\n\r\nI can write down one hundred things that make the male characters in this anime interesting. But that isn't enough to cover the horrible main heroine, where everyone who has watched this anime will entirely agree with me she is absolutely, without a doubt, positively the most stupid person among anime history. People will try to defend this anime and say it's because she's a character from a reverse harem, but even if that is the case, she's STILL the main character. Let's start by writing down what makes this girl so bad.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about her is bad. She has no talent, her eyes are a disgusting mix of color and look very bad, her hair style and general character design is horrible, her attitude is among the worst I've seen, and many other things. She has no personality, not even a little. She has no idea what she's doing and doesn't even add humor to the anime. I was sitting through it and thinking about how much longer I was going to have to tolerate her. I eventually surrendered to the stupidity and went to watch Psycho-Pass instead.\\n\\n\r\nThinking about this heroine sets my mind on fire. She's just the most clueless person on the face of the planet and constantly just stammers and blushes. Everyone calls her cute and adorable, but go ahead and google her. That's cute? \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that makes the characters good are the males. They all have some personality, their pros and cons that they need to fix, and actually have singing talent. Their character designs look good and they don't have wunky hair styles and nasty looking eyes that I literally had to look away from the screen to avoid. There are some pretty hot males in this anime, and it was one of, it not the, only reason I started watching Uta no Prince-sama. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like watching nasty looking anime girls constantly fail and try to be good people, you might like this anime. The only thing I enjoyed about it were the male characters, and their moments are so far and few in between that I couldn't motivate myself to continue. I'm being very generous with this anime by giving it a 5. The main character alone gives this anime a 2 or a 3. Honestly, unless you are among the most tolerant person on Earth, or like stupid clueless females, go ahead and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not kidding when I said I'm being generous for giving this anime a 5. It really isn't all that good. Maybe it's because watching dumb anime girls stammer and try to be good people and fail isn't my cup of tea, but even the story and animation doesn't make this anime better. With humor that's barely added, the anime doesn't keep the audience held on long enough because of the lack of interesting scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI am not even slightly joking - the heroine ALONE is going to kill your impression of this anime. Every other aspect of this anime is OK... but this heroine needs to go home and never needs to be repeated in another anime because I cannot see how anyone tolerates her.\\n\\n\r\nI lasted 5 episodes and might wait another 6 months before I continue watching it. How long will you last?",

            "content": "Story: 6/10 I like the idea of a music school and training their pupils to become future idols and such. But the story can be extremely unrealistic. At the beginning, Haruka happens to help out a kid and then happened to be late for an exam and then two \"nice\" guys happened to \"help\" her. How can that be a coincidences. Plus isn't Itoki Otoya sitting the exam? Why will he be going outside to help a girl and then going back inside? It makes no sense. And if Haruka is actually in a hurry and desperately and seriously wants to take the exam, whywill she even help the girl? I suppose she's just being the stereotypical goody two shoes... (read character, I don't want to risk changing the subject)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 I personally quite like the art. I like the amount of detail put into the characters and background. The colours used are vibrant and eye-catching. In addition, the expressions can be easily read just by looking at the eyes so we can have an idea what each character might be thinking. However, the animations can be a bit \"stiff\" at times. for example how the clouds are floating across the sky at a terrific speed when the trees are still. So is there wind or not? Not, the only the background, the characters don't have a smooth animation at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 I love the openings and endings, and the songs can be quite catchy. The singing is really good as well. The voice actors are also really good singers. But the best part is the background music. The choice of background music clicks in with the contemporary theme and atmosphere. I also really like the voice acting. The voices are neither too high pitched or too low. Usually, females are pitched too high and the males' voices can be pitched too low. When that happens, I usually turn off the volume and listen to something else(preferably Paramore) while reading the subtitles instead because I just don't like high pitched girly voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10 I personally think character development is the weakest point. The personalities of each character varies and it is obvious what type of character each of them are. That's mainly because the characters are mainly stereotypes. Like how Masato is the emotionless kid and Haruka is the kind and gentle kid and how Ringo is the \"trap\" kid so on. The characters in this anime is comprised of nothing, but stereotypes and shallow personalities. I can see that the producers of this anime had attempted to give each guy a dramatic or at least a dramatic-ish type of past just to erase the shallow-ness of the characters. No, giving characters a past does not change the fact that a character is shallow. You'll just need to add more into the personality to refrain a character from becoming a dating sim stereotype, not more into their histories. This only means some of the viewers will rate this show a 10/10 because they're just only going for the looks as this show has decent artwork even though the guys are seriously shallow(yes, I have used the word \"shallow\" quite a few times but I can't find another word to describe it at the moment). Well, that's what happens in real life anyway. Girls just go for the shallow guys...\\n\\n\r\nI also don't understand why every single guy falls in love with the main character. What's so special about her? She's the usual naive and kind-hearted student in a school. And I mean every. single. friggin'. guy. And what does the protagonist do? Smile off. Hey, there's a whole boy band in love with her. What else can she do? This is like the entire one direction all falling in love with a directioner. Well, apart from the fact that the directioner will squeal and smile instead of just smiling.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is similar to Free. A load of shallow animated guys with real-life girls falling in love with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 When I watched it the first time, I didn't really enjoy it. Now I'm re-watching it, this anime is actually okay. I don't typically enjoy watching this but I am able to watch the whole two seasons. But I've mostly enjoyed listening to the songs. But I could just listen to vocaloid instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 Other than the poor character development, this will be a really good anime. Fair plot + awesome music and great voice acting + aesthetically pleasing artwork + crap character development = ???",

This anime contains singing, so if you dislike \"musicals\", I would recommend not watching this. Overall all, the anime is mediocre and watchable. But in the end I don't know why I watched it.

            "content": "Hey guys, I don't normally write reviews but I am trying to write more. So here it goes:\r\nI have been debating watching this anime for about a year now. Everyone says it's great, when I am looking at which anime to watch next this one pops up multiple times but I was questioning whether or not it would be worth my time. Most people have listed it as a romance anime so here I figured, \"okay a girl gets to choose between 6 guys. We've all seen it before and quite honestly I prefer anime where it is a constant relationship with common ups anddowns apposed to getting a choice. Personal preference.\" But this was quite the opposite and I was disappointed to see that there was no romance, though you could see some starting to bloom, nothing happened in that field. \\n\r\nWhat i did find though.\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt has a great story line that is easy to follow and when there is a problem with another secondary character you see their past so that even if the main character doesn't know it yet you do so you can sympathize with both parties.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was great, there was so many bright colours, which at times could be hard on the eyes but most of the time it made me smile and laugh and cry along with the characters. You know when it's raining outside and it makes you feel gloomy? This anime also portrayed that perfectly .\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOMG the sound, I loved almost all of the songs, in the subbed version many known songs (twinkle twinkle little star) was sung in english so we could enjoy it too and sing along. I think there was 2 or 3 songs like that, played multiple times in memories ect. for our enjoyment. Though many songs were sung in Japanese with english subtitles so we too could enjoy the meaning behind the songs. I would re-watch certain episodes of this anime just to rehear the songs, my favorites are the intro and ending songs (hence why they were picked). Also because it is an \"arts academy\" when people were about ready to burst with feelings, sad or happy and even mad, they sang which I can't really relate to but hearing them sing I wanted to join in, just because.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main character has so much improvement throughout the anime and honestly I love that, when you are introduced to the character in the beginning of their new environment and you are able to grow with them. The only downside was #1-like I said before no romance (or hardly any) and #2-the secondary characters didn't improve much with personality though their hardships were resolved. \\n\r\nCharacter I liked the least was the director, he popped up at random time with no real reason to show up other than to make peoples lives difficult and I found that he was too much to handle, he entered and exited with a bang leaving your head reeling.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall I liked the anime and am looking forward for season 2.\\n\r\nI honestly think you should give this anime a shot.",

            "content": "I am dropping this anime for the time being, so my review is based onthe first three absolutely aweful 12-minute episodes.\r\nDon't get me wrong, if you're thinking about watching this, I'm not trying to desuade you from doing so.  However, it really just wasn't my cup of tea and I'm rather bored of the whole thing.  I think I'll just comment on the three chief aspects of this very cliche anime; the art, music, and plot.\r\nI'm not a fan of the art itself, but the colors are rather vibrant and there aren't a lot of short-cuts in drawing like in some other animeIve seen. (drawing chibis every time you arent zoomed in on a character's face, for example).  However, it seems like all the charcters look faintly similar as far as coloring- blue hair, red hair, or blonde hair.  The xception is the man character, whose eyes are a hideous shade of eerie acid yellow.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime based on a musical boarding school, I wouldn't expect anything but outstanding as far as the sound goes.  The voicing here is a pretty solid OK but the singing is beautiful and the lyrics are that marvelously corny love song stuff aaaaall the time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot: I didn't go into this expecting much.  I was basically in it for the whole harem thing, which Im pretty into. However, the characters are pretty typical and the plot doesn't have anything special at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, based on my very limited knowledge of the anime, I give it a solidly OKAY rating.\\n\\n",

However, the girl has a unique idol, Hayato and it is because of him that she wants to be a songwriter.\r\nThe anime begins with Nanami trying to prove, but as it arrives late the guards not to let in, but Nanami gets help from Otoya and Ren trying to convince them to let her in. In its firstday at school Nanami discovers that serious Masato (another classmate) and Ren celebrities are owners of famous producers. Then Nanami also know Syo, Shinomiya and Ichinose, apparently the twin brother Hayato, the girl idol.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime we get to know better each character and how Nanami enters their lives. In addition, we see the protagonist overcoming its limitations in pursuit of his dream.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not much anime fan with harem, but when it is inverted, ie many beautiful men trying to win a single woman, I even try to watch a little more willingly! Nanami is not a pretty girl super or hyper talented, but his charisma will the little conquering the attention of everyone, especially the most popular boys.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally \"Uta no Prince-sama\" does not show anything new, the plot is a bit obvious and much man for little woman does not convince me because I look like a failure in the novel aspect. Characters can be beautiful, but have characteristics ever seen before: the serious, the rebel, the gentle, funny, the womanizer and excited. These cliches are the only regrets in my view.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: this anime is simply five star. I have nothing to complain about(except what I explain before). The story is quite unique and interesting. There are some scenes that make us laugh and others that make us cry. Being a music anime, its soundtrack could not be better. Each of the faces and each of the thousand voices deserve praise, entering a tune with each personality. Another curious fact is that usually anime idols are like \"musical protagonists\" girls, but Uta no Prince-sama, beautiful guys with wonderful voices (no homo -qq) !!",

Well, pulled through and finished the anime and overall, it was great art, great music, but crappy job done with the plot. I wouldn't really recommend it but watch it if you like art and music more than caring about the plot and if you love bishounens (one thing that got me watching XD) but honestly speaking it wasn'tnice, almost every episode has at least someone confessing to the girl about how great her music is and how nice she plays the piano and stuff like that but really, if you don't like those predictable 'as expected' shows i really don't think you'll be able to enjoy this anime. But, as i say, everybody has different thoughts, i personally only liked the art and music and trust me, i was sitting down insulting this anime the whole way through every episode, really. But it's a habit of mine to finish watching anime till the last episode. Well, overall, i'd give it a 5 rating, mostly for the art and music of course XD (sorry to those fans though :] )",

Because there were so many main characters, episodes 1-8 were spent almost solely in introducing them and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that the first half of the series sucked, just that what happened then wasn't very relevant to the main point of the story. \r\nCHARACTERS AND ENJOYMENT 9/10\r\nWhat made this first half enjoyable were the different male characters. Besides being lovely bishies, they were very likable intheir own way. I didn't dislike Haruka, but she wasn't memorable or a strong enough lead in my view.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND 10/10\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that I absolutely loved about this anime was the soundtrack and the art. The characters were gorgeous, the scenery was beautiful, and the colours dazzling. It was actually one of the anime with the best art I've seen - though part of that may be due to the fact that I watched this in DVD quality. And not only were the songs sung by the characters amazing, but also the sound effects.

            "content": "When I began to watch Uta No Prince Sama, or UtaPri, I didn't go in with high expectations. I've read all of the negative reviews, but I figured since I was simply looking for something light-hearted and fun I'd enjoy it well enough. Surprisingly, it surpassed my expectations in some ways.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nObviously, one of the most important parts of this anime was the music, considering it's placed in an academy for idols and composers. This was my absolute FAVORITE thing about UtaPri -- each song touched me in some way, and I found myself listening to \"1000% Love\" multiple times, and humming along each time.If you take anything away from this anime at all, it will be the music. The voice acting was also well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where most people's problem with UtaPri lies, in my opinion. Haruka, our main heroine, was clearly supposed to be cute. Everything about her was designed that way, from her voice, her klutziness, the number of times she stutters, etc. Many people had a problem with her oddly colored eyes, but I didn't mind them. I figured that Haruka could use the extra flair, because she certainly wasn't memorable. I don't think they failed on making her \"cute\", per say, but she was ultimately forgettable, even a little aggravating at times. However, she's easily overlooked because of the other cast. The boys were all interesting to me in some way, and even though their personalities were certainly stereotypical and not unique in the slightest, I enjoyed all of them respectively. It was very annoying how all of these boys instantly fell in love with Haruka and were clambering over themselves to introduce themselves to her, but it's a fact that can be overlooked, because frankly that type of thing is in the majority of harems/reverse harems.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile decent, the story was nothing special. Typical boarding school reverse harem setting, with the added interest of being a school for idols and composers. If they didn't add that last bit, then honestly the anime would be a lot worse. However, the setting worked out for the better, although it's nothing unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis one is a given. Being a fan of bishies and shoujo style art, I automatically fell in love with the art style in UtaPri. It uses many bright colors and has an overall happy feel to it. Two words - eye candy. If you're a fan of bishies, then you'll absolutely love the art.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI feel like this needs some explaining. For me personally, I enjoyed UtaPri very much. It wasn't anything special or even attention grabbing, but it was heart warming and entertaining. Although I'm giving this anime an 8 because of it's flaws such as a forgettable main character (often a problem in shoujos), the relative lack of creativity, and the fact that all of the guys instantly loved Haruka, I'm giving it a 9 for enjoyment because it's a quick, light-hearted series that I finished easily in two days. Whether you enjoy UtaPri or not really depends on the type of anime you normally like and how seriously you take it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something fresh and unique, with a strong heroine and dramatic scenes, then you've come to the wrong anime. However, if you can not take it so seriously, turn off your brain for a bit and let yourself ENJOY the fantastic music and fun characters, then I can surely say that you will like UtaPri.",

            "content": "Dang guyyys. So many 3, 4, 5 O.O. You must really really not like this anime at ALLLLL. xD\r\nMmmmmm. I'd admit, this is quite a very very typical anime. A lot of the guys falls in love with the main character but the main character cannot choose. \r\nEven if I have seen this kind of typical anime, I think it's the good looking guys and the music and the animation that I liked the anime overall. The story plot mainly isn't just very good.\r\nI would only recommend this anime to anyone who likes singer/music types of focused anime. And who is kind of a \"newbie\"to animes who likes these types of anime romance.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is about a main girl, Nanami, who really wants to compose because she has discovered a new music video from Hayato. And from there on, her idol is Hayato because of his one song and her dream is to compose a music for him to sing.\\n\r\nSo.. in order for her to pursue her dream, she has to go onto a prodigious school. And while she is learning how to compose, she met 6 guys along the way and she helped them in each episode with their own music problems. That is how each guy felt they have some kind of connection with her since they feel she understands them like no one else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a cute story :C. But... not a well, planned good story plot since for an anime experience, this story plot is cliche. So that's why it's \"Fair\" for the most port.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI feel the art is very good. The way they drew the scenery, the music when the characters sang, the way they drew the characters, were all good for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe design on how they drew each guy differently was good too, but typical, again.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI thought the sound was good. When they sang, the voice of each character was really well played. The opening and the ending theme song was good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character personality is very typical again.\\n\\n\r\nIn almost each anime you see, you'll see at least ONE guy who is the most careless, outgoing person. You'll see at least ONE guy who is the serious type. You'll see at least ONE guy who is the flirty type. You get the point.\\n\r\nEach of these personalities are put into each 6 characters and that's how it keeps me entertained, since I like these types in each anime. It's how the anime keeps on getting interesting.. regardless of the story plot. So I don't mind seeing these personalities all over again and again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSince I'm a girl, of course I would like fan girl all over the place. They seriously made all the guys look cute xD. \\n\r\nBut.. for a guy watching this... errrr, yeah. Don't waste your time then. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for my enjoyment, I liked the songs that they sing in the episodes... when each character has their own songs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a fair anime where for a girl, it might be alright, but for a guy, they will seriously hate it because they won't be interested in some cute guys and the main character along the way.",

            "content": "After a while without even caring about this anime, I wanted to finally complete all 13 episodes so I could write a good review. What I didn't know is that I already did. Two years ago. I didn't even remember I'd finished it. That's how bad it is.\r\nStory: 1.\r\nYou know, it could have been a great series, but creators must think we are kind of plain.\r\nYou may like music and you may like pretty boys too, but you'll find exactly NOTHING else in the whole show. Girl is trying to be a composer and there are a bunch of guys who know how to sing.That's okay.\\n\r\nWhat's not so okay? Harem. They all love the main girl, who -to put it simply- is kind of pathetic. She's portrayed like the perfect girl. She's the dream of six or seven boys, who (of course) are devoted to her. Come on, that doesn't happen, neither in reality nor anime. (I forgot we are watching reverse harem. Of course). \\n\r\nThe thing I disliked the most about UtaPri wasn't this harem thing. I hated that they all end up being happy. Yes, these boys kind of get sad and jealous and fight with each other when the girl doesn't pay them enough atention, but that's not what I mean. I'm not into sadism or anything, however, people just doesn't get always what they want. This is no paradise. \"This is a TV show!\", well, people get unhappy in anime too and I hoped that there was a tiny moment when the whole gang wasn't succesful.\\n\r\nAnd what the hell was that crap at the end of the season?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.\\n\r\nI think this was what kept me watching the series till the end. There's color, dynamism, brightness. Characters' desing was great too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.\\n\r\nWell, this anime is about music. We all love music. So it's supposed to be somehow good. Okay. It's not. I listened to the soundtrack after I finished the series because there was a couple of songs that I liked. While in the anime these songs match with the context, they kinda disappoint when you listen to them without watching the anime. They are all too similar to each other, boring and cheesy and you may feel you are listening to the same song all over again.\\n\r\nWhy did I gave it a 4? There was A LOT of music. So I'm sure everyone will find at least one song they enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1.\\n\r\nI remember Otoya dearly, but it's the only one.\\n\r\nI cannot help but hate perfect characters, I feel unconnected to them. I know anime characters are not real, but they can be relatable, can't they?\\n\r\nI hated the main girl, I don't even know how she's called. I hated her. She's a cry baby, incapable of standing up for herself, irritating to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1.\\n\r\nAt first I thought the anime was going to get better, but that was an illusion. Usually I start and finish one series in three, four days. It took me months to finish UtaPri because I watched one episode and got bored.  I wish I could rewind and drop this anime at episode 1 because it was absolutely terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.\\n\r\nI give a 2 because art was great but it's not worth it. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this, I don't even know how I managed to end it.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review so bear with me, guys and if there are any errors or grammatical mistakes, I apologize in advance - English is not my mother-tongue.\r\nFor some reason, summertime has always been anime-binge-watching-time and I have watched a lot of anime over the past few weeks. The reason I chose UtaPri as my first review is because I'm completely baffled by the turn this show took.\r\nI might go into spoiler territory here, so if you don't want to know anything before watching this show, you better stop reading now.\r\nAfter the first few episodes, I was honestly pleasantly surprised. Yes, it isa reverse-harem show and yes, the main characters eyes are so ugly, but after a while you get used to it and even though it's reverse-harem, most of the side-characters are pretty well fleshed out and/or have a decent backstory and even the main story is ok. Not thrilling or exciting, but just ok. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a show about a girl who goes to a prestigious musical school and we are following her on her journey to succes. We see her struggling for a while, interacting with the different guys, working on some music, so far so good.\\n\\n\r\nBut then something happened that made me drop this whole anime all together. For some reason, there is one character that can transform himself into a cat and vice versa, he seems to be some cursed prince from a far away land or whatever and the MC seems to be his muse. I seem to remember my first reaction was \"Urmpf???\" and I had to rewind, because it was like I went from 'Glee' to 'Charmed' in a smooth second.\\n\\n\r\nNow look, I am all for fantasy and even science fiction if it's executed properly, but this seemed so odd and totally ridiculous to me that I had to turn off my tv. It was like they mashed two different anime together. I have no idea why they did that, maybe they will explain in it in later seasons, but I am probably not going to find that out. Like, what are we doing here? Annoying-looking eyes and a lot of guys fawning over one girl while also focusing on music and stardom are all fine by me, but throw in a cursed prince who is also a cat, that's where I draw the line. It just didn't fit and raises all kinds of different questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the music is above average, some of the characters are interesting and if you are really into reverse-harems and highschool-like anime, I would give it a chance. It is not THAT bad. But that \"twist\" felt so out of place to me that I couldn't take the rest of it serious. It might be an overreaction and maybe I will continue watching it when there is nothing else on CR, but for now it's a no for me. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore I changed my first grade (7) into a 4.\\n\\n\r\nI like anime so much and there are many shows I watched over the past few weeks that had me either enthralled to the points of insanity or rolling on the floor laughing. UtaPri was a bit of a let down for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW]\r\nWow. I did not expect myself to enjoy the anime as much as I did. If you have read my other reviews you know that I am strict when it comes to what I enjoy out of a reverse harem (even though I am a girl). Uta no Prince Sama was something I had to force myself to continue watch because I kept thinking \"This has to get better somehow\". In some way what I thought was true. I still don't know if I can say I like it or not.\r\nThe story was definitely unique, but it didn't make mewant to keep watching. Like I said, I had to force myself to keep going. This was also one of those animes where I found it REALLY hard to have sympathy for any of the characters. I kept wondering how Nanami was crying so much when she just met the boys. It made me feel like I had a black heart. Then I realised that this anime is just trying really hard to get me to cry but its failing. Not only that, but there were to many guys. I was having the same problems I came across when I watched Brother's Conflict. I couldn't remember any names! I'm watching the show thinking \"That red head guy, oh whats his name? I think it starts with an I\". It made my brain hurt.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty amazing. It reminded me a lot of Amnesia with its vibrant colors. Besides that the art is pretty straightforward. I need to go ahead and skip to talking about the music because that was pretty much the main point of this show. In most shows I find myself trying not to cringe at the songs they sing. In this show I found so many songs that I liked. For example, the ending song where everyone says \"Are you ready?\" I am sitting on my couch screaming \"OH YEAH I'M READY!\".\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with the characters. They seemed to bland and not thought out. Don't get me wrong, I really like it when otome games/animes have a variety of personalities. However I feel like this anime tried to do that and failed. I tried to pinpoint which were the tsunderes and I asumed which ones they were. I noticed a couple guys who are weird also. That's all I could really take from the 6 guys who were there. I have seen animes that did a better job with this kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess you can say I didn't like this show. There was a little bit of hope I had from beginning to end but I never felt like this anime was for me. Regardless what I say in the review I think I will end up watching season 2. I would definitely recommend this anime to those who like large scale reverse harems and hot boys who do nothing but want YOU. In the end if you are a lonely girl with no boyfriend, this anime will fill you empty heart.",

A section in the anime universe where girls (and guys) can escape to and fangirl over unnecessary fanservice and have their expectations set at an unrealistic rate. I must admit, I am one of those girls, and I'm not ashamed of it. After finishing an action-packed anime, I thought I'd calm things down with this anime, and I was not disappointed.\u00a0\r\nIf you're looking for a show that has romance, comedy, drama, amazing music, AND a great plot, you're in the right place.\u00a0\r\nThe art in this show was incredible. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was colorful in a bright and beautiful way thatreally expanded on the cheerful atmosphere that the anime was giving. The design of the characters was also one to be thankful for. Having attractive male leads in a reverse harem is a must have, and this anime did a GREAT job on that one. The way they were designed also reflected nicely on their personalities - such as big, round eyes for Otoya for his bubbly personality, and narrow, sharp eyes for Tokiya to show his dark and somewhat cruel attitude.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, all I can say is that every single song that was sung, no matter who was singing, made me speechless. The beats, the lyrics, the instruments used, EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect. Some of the songs that I heard in this show were some of the best J-Pop songs I've ever heard.",

            "content": "So, the songs were bomb. They kind of had to be with the seiyuus in this anime, right?\r\nUm, so the story in this anime was lacking to say the least. Honestly, it wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it didn't really have a direction to speak of until the end. Actually, I think my main issue was that the anime couldn't really pick a genre, which messed up the flow of the story. It was a comedy, it was a drama, it was a shoujo, it was way too much. \r\nOne thing it undoubtedly was, though, was a harem. I'm sure there aresome good reverse harems out there, but this one was very blatant about it. What I mean by that is that you'd have a couple guys that were into this main girl that had a bit of a basis behind why they liked her, but the rest of them? Zero. They would have like one conversation by themselves, and then the guy was in love with her (or her music, whatever, same difference). Harems are unrealistic, and I get that, but it didn't help my enjoyment of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not bad, actually. Stereotypical? Yeah, but still entertaining. Back to the seiyuus, I think the stellar voice acting saved the anime. Other than the needlessly corny bits, I really enjoyed listening to the boys when they were together. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest? I enjoyed this anime a hell of a lot. I do have negatives, but if I hadn't been looking for criticisms, I would've thought this was a fun (slightly strange) anime. The art was mostly a plus for me. Especially-- and stay with me here-- the hair. The blending that was done on the hair of the characters was really satisfying to see every episode. Although, maybe three redheads is a bit much. The music was, as I said, amazing. In fact, there was a song or two that made me tear up a bit because the circumstances and the seiyuus voice. \\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you what, though it may be a bit trashy, I'll be finishing the series. I really wanna hang out with these characters more and hear them sing if nothing else. If you're not too picky, or if you love these seiyuus, give this a shot. It may make you cringe, but it may also make you happy. It'll certainly make you wanna break out in song. If that's not enough of a reason to watch it, I don't know what to tell you.",

            "content": "ENJOYMENT: Oh the bishies. They're so yum. And the show moves so quickly that it's hard to stop and wonder if you're enjoying it or not. \r\nSTORY: Innocent girl raised by her grandma in the country goes to an elite school where everyone has had serious training. Wow, that would make for a good story about bullying or something right? Wrong. Instead everyone immediately loves her, and those that don't are only heard whispering about her every once in awhile. Story focuses on her incredibly quick and intimate relationship with a bunch of guys. Typical harem fare.\r\nCHARACTERS: I get that this was based on areverse harem game, so the lead has very little character development. She's not very likeable at all (and let's not get into her weird eyes). Then there's the guys: I loved them all. Yet all but 2 of them had a whopping one episode devoted to them in which they had to pour out their problems, their adorableness, and of course fall for the main character for some unknown reason. Episode 8 introduced a new character who I found laughable. There was just way too much going on with the characters to really stop and enjoy it. This should have been a full season, not 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/ART: Watch the OP through to the end: THE BIRDS EXPLODE! All of the doves EXPLODE! Sure, they explode into golden sparkles and music notes but still... they EXPLODE! Other than that? It's done in a very strange style: like a multiply and blur overlay on the whole animation. It's contrasty and dark for most of the show. This seems to be a style that was popular in the late '00s and early '10s, but it really detracts from the show if you let it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I'm a fan of musical anime, but this one just did not stick with me in terms of the music. It's all so blandly bubble gum. Even the \"hardcore\" characters get sickeningly sweet music. For a school run by top idols they sure pump out a bunch of carbon copy singers. \\n\\n",

Besides the fact that the art style is absolutely fantastic, seeing about five different guys fall instantly for the female protagonist - in the first few episodes - is just golden. \r\nThe show is basically romantic schlock for teeny girls; utterly harmless and full of fluff, if not eyeroll inducing. Pretty much all ofthe characters are at least somewhat likable, even the grumpy black haired fellow who pretends he's something he's not is somewhat sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and -spoiler alert- I basically guessed half way that she'd take these dudes and make them into a boyband.

            "content": "Let me begin by saying this:\r\nI had dismissed this show for being total fujioshi fluff but watched the first episode  one night out of boredom. Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it and watched it all.\r\nIf you're looking for something hardcore, thought-provoking and a interesting twist on the music business---nah who are we kidding? UtaPri proudly wears its hat as this: A cute girl comes to music academy and studies music and befriends/falls/works with six hot guys. \r\nStory: 8\r\nAs I said, want something thought-provoking on music? Go read Rolling Stone. This is just based from an otome(gal)game and it shows. Mainly the first eightepisodes introduce our cast  and the last few are how the song at the ED comes together. Oh, you will never ever EVER get rid of that song in your head, despite it's horrible Engrish. Along the way we get a trap teacher, a beach episode(yes at least one Fish has fanservice) a former action star as a teacher and the principal is a former pop idol himself who frequently pops in with words of advice.....or WTFness.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that comes close to a story is that one of the Fish wants to escape his past as an idol(whom Haruka loved and inspired her to go into music) and debut as his own person. Does Haruka wind up with him in the end? Stay tuned for season two...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere's some seriously pretty animation and character design here. Everything is so candy colored and girly girl.  Though....seriously UtaPri, what's the deal on Haruka's eyes?  Her eyes are piss yellow! \\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music, much to my surprise, is actually a delight, despite the ED song.  The OP is actually performed by Mamoru Miyano, who plays the former idol looking to start over and......it's actually quite good! \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I rather have the Fish perform solo individual songs, as they are mostly LESS cloying then the Fish's songs.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad we didn't hear from the trap teacher though. We even hear from a character that only makes an cameo in the beach episode. And I would've loved to have heard from Wakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nLOL. All of the tropes are there, but let's start with Haruka\\n\\n\r\nPro: Has a dream to make a song for her idol....which she kind of does anyway in a roundabout way. She's sincere and sweet, but not in a cloying way. It's easy to see why the male cast is enamored of her...music.\\n\\n\r\nCon: She trips(take a drink everytime she does), cries and has beautiful eyes.....the color of pee. Glow in the dark pee. She does all of what airheads do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIchinose: tsundere/Emo Justin Timberlake\\n\\n\r\nPro: He's a great singer and is played by Mamoru Miyano. Hard to believe that the same person who plays Tamaki, Light and muthafuckin' Okiabe is in this.\\n\\n\r\nCon: He's also kind of a dick to Haruka. \\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nShou: ShotaBait\\n\\n\r\nPro: One of the few characters I personally liked. And unlike the other boys, his reason for wanting Haruka is to protect her from herself and because he's found someone who knows what fanboying after a person is like *see anime.\\n\\n\r\nCon: He can't sing. He's a cutie....but he can't sing. He's not bad, but he's scores behind the more smoother voices of the other Fish....except Ittoki\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nIttoki: boy next door\\n\\n\r\nPro: Out of the cast(and this is my theory), he seems to really love Haruka and wants more with her. I wonder if the anime plans to hook him and her up, but I have a feeling that he'll be friendzoned in favor of Ichi.\\n\\n\r\nCon: He can't sing either, at least not as well as the other fish. Though I've heard that his VA is much better. \\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nRen: Lady Killer with Swag\\n\\n\r\nPro: Yeah, he's hot. Also has a rather sad backstory. He, along with Ittoki and Masato, are probaly my favorites to wind up with Haruka. He seems to be rather enchanted with the Piss Yellow Songtress himself, as he tells Ichinose 'She changed me.' \\n\\n\r\nBonus points, because he's voiced by Junichi Suwabe.\\n\\n\r\nCon: I hope he gets a new schtick in season two other than all the ladies want Ren while Ren only has his eyes for the 'Little Lamb'. Also, I've heard bardrunks give better pickup lines.\\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nMasato: tsundere/Japanese Housewife\\n\\n\r\nPro: He's the other guy that I believe truly loves Haruka. All because of how he meets her. Also has a nice ass.\\n\\n\r\nCon: Suzumara needs some better songs to show off his voice.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nNatsuki: Cloudcuckoolander\\n\\n\r\nPro: Natsuki is my favorite hands down. He's a goofball who plays violin like Itzak Pearlman but yet wants to become an idol. Why? Dunno. Also, out of all of the cast, he's the best singer in the group. Sorry Miyano fans...\\n\\n\r\nAnd watch out when Natsuki goes into alterego mode........\\n\\n\r\nCon: Nothing really. XD \\n\\n\r\n=======\\n\\n\r\nI also liked Tomo, who's Haruka's roomie, that's aspiring to become an idol herself. Too bad this is aimed at women because I would've liked to see her and Haruka work together on a song. And lastly, my second favorite is Cecil whose idenitiy I'll keep secret for now. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said, anyone looking for a deeper show......go somewhere else. UtaPri is as deep as that DOKI DOKI song that's at the end of each episode. If the second season's a hit, then perhaps they'll make a third season where the Fish and Haruka are celebrities. Ichinose can give them tips since he was down that road himself.\\n\\n\r\nIs it the best series out there? Hell no. But it is enjoyable, fun and I TRIPLE dare ANYONE who doesn't have a smile on their face throughout the whole season. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, onto my review for this anime, I really wanted to a review for this anime, I just loved it so much.\r\nBut I think I should state how I actually got into this. What revealed the anime to be was a rather funny story. I had been looking for pictures on google for a good red haired guy to use as a character for an RP I was joining. Well, I just happened upon one of Otoya-kun and I had looked up it. I looked up the anime and saw how I knew so many of the voices in it. And so, after watching thefirst episode, I was totally hooked. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the real review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was so...what's the word...umm, mindblowing? Maybe, I can't think up the word. I was so caught up with it that I had ended up watching it in only two days. XD But the story was so interesting and I just couldn't stop. Now that I finished it, I am hyper for the second season and going to go read the manga. Too bad I can't get the games, that would make it even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was so eye-catching, I was truely brought in with it. Though, I do have to admit, it does take a while to get to the two girls look, Haru-chan and Tomo-chan, they had just interesting hair and eye colors that I was a tad disturbed by it at first. But as I continued to watch it I got used to and eventually began to like it. The background is well done and you can tell they did just half-assed, everything was so detailed and clear.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so inviting, it sometimes has a beat you can dance to and the opening/ending/main song '1000% Love', I could just listen to that over and over again. But there were also songs that just felt so peaceful, or sad. You couldn't help but love it all. I also found it rather interesting that they added a few classics, like 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' and 'Amazing Grace', and they were in English! It was so clear and you could clearly hear the words. I was in tears when I heard 'Amazing Grace', the only time I did cry through out the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather interesting. You want to know more as you watch, and you can help but love all of them. And I dont just mean the main boys, I'm talking about everyone. At least the people who showed up more than once (cept Cacil, he just want to see more of him all the time). I enjoyed the personalties that were show-cased and it made it seem real with it. (Though there were times that they made it seem unreal but that's anime for you). There are even characters that I'm sure everyone could connect with, I know I did with this one character ^^\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it so much that I watched it within two days of finding it. I even got my friend into it when I first found it. She still has yet to watch it but I'm sure she'll love it. I am very tempted to watch it over again I enjoyed it so much. But that may have to wait, since I do have school to focus on too XD Being an Otaku and a student is hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a huge 10, I would give it more if I could XD I'm sure anyone who loves music as well as large amount of cute guys would enjoy this. I hope this review helped others to enjoy this anime just as much as I did.",

            "content": "If you've ever watched reverse harem anime, you know that it  usually involves a plain, clueless girl surrounded by a bunch of attractive guys (ranging from \"cute\" to \"hot\") who all fall for her / fawn over her for seemingly no reason whatsoever. The story then consists of the girl interacting with each one of the guys and learning a bit about their backstories before feeling \"conflicted\" and deciding to fall for the guy who is the most mysterious and tsundere of all (aka a jerk). However, even her weak effort at choosing a single guy usually offers little resolution, romance, or satisfaction, forby the time she comes to terms with her \"feelings\" it's usually time to wrap up the show and you're left guessing about the rest.\\n\\n\r\nUta no Prince-Sama follows this exact same format with the addition of the themes of idols, composers and music. Since something similar has already been done before with Kiniro no Corda, the writers seem to have tried to throw in some plot twists and other \"mysteries\", but unfortunately, as with most reverse harems, these are pretty predictable and hardly surprising. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this show is far from being terrible or completely unenjoyable. In the reverse harem spectrum it's definitely somewhere in the middle, for it is neither a masterpiece like \"Ouran Koukou Host Club\" nor a complete abomination like \"Diabolik Lovers\". Rather, it stays in the mediocre-but-almost-good comfort zone with the likes of Kiniro no Corda, Fruits Basket, Vampire Knight, Bonjour Koiaji P\u00e2tisserie, and many others. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the art is certainly much nicer than in the modern classics mentioned above, the animation could have used some improvement. Scenes involving singing and dancing often appear awkward or disjointed and would have greatly benefitted from more frames or even a little CGI. Additionally, the protagonist's eyes are a bit unattractive and disturbing to look at (although this is probably a matter of personal taste). \\n\\n\r\nThe music is perhaps one of the strongest points in this series, for it is fitting and enjoyable. While nothing out of this world, Mamoru Miyano does a great job at singing the opening as well as some other songs, and overall the seiyuus' work really shines. \\n\\n\r\nBesides most seiyuus in this anime being well-known and award-winning, it was also refreshing to see (or hear) them do something different. Although I could tell that Mamoru Miyano would be in this series from the first episode, I actually had trouble identifying his character because he did not use the usual sugary sweet voice I've become accustomed to hearing in most eye-candy series in which he is featured. Additionally, Nakamura Yuuichi also voices a character that is completely different from his usual work, hence making things all the more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIt is mainly thanks to the great performances from the voice actors as well as the lovely art from the animators that I was able to enjoy this series (which would have otherwise been an extremely generic reverse harem).\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of (or are at least familiar with) this genre of anime and know what you're getting into, then this can definitely be an entertaining little show. If you have no interest in a bunch of mini-romances with generic subplots as well as pretty art and bubbly Jpop music, then you would probably be best advised to skip this.",

Well, for any fan of music and for most girls/women that like nice eye candy, I'd say yes! \r\nI admit I am a sucker for reverse harems, but I am interested to see whether the plot of the series makes it out to be even more worthwhile or just another pretty show. I have mixed emotions about the plot because of the main character, Haruka Nanami. Sure, she is innocent and hardworking, and that's great; however, the truth of the matter is that in areal-life scenario, our lovely Nanami would not even get into such a prestigious school. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside, throughout the series you do get to see each of the prospective idols interact with her and you get to know them individually. Of course for any girl who's to say you can't love them all!? The guys were handsome in their own ways and you see their specific talents, along with small, rural town Nanami growing into a more confident and musical young lady.  The animation is detailed and the colors are crisp and unique, which was another draw-in factor, but not the main one.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the quality of music, I'd say it's just slightly above average. The songs are catchy and fun. Some characters (or actual voice actors) try hard to sing well. I can hear strain and some inconsistency with this. Some shine more than others though. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor is above average as well. The voice acting really pushes through, though as mentioned earlier, plot and character value are those weaknesses. Since this series has a second arc, I will be continuing to see what develops as our potential idols shoot for the stars!",

DO NOT LOOSE HOPE! there are good shows in this genre... Ouran High School Host Club and Fruit Basket would be on the top (particularly the mangas) However, If one wishes to explore this genre more, and find MANY good animes/mangas... i'm sorry but there are not too terribly many.. after a while you will begin to see a pattern in most/all of the characters and plotlines...",

            "content": "Those wondering why I gave it a middle score, even though all you are going to see is me mostly complaining, is because it's pretty similar to most otome games turned anime shows. Plus I normally use these as a way to find new otome games that may peak my interest compared to a actual anime to watch on its own.\r\nOK, so first things first... OMG THE FEMALE CHARACTER!!  I understand this whole \"lets make the main female as bland and submissive as possible\" so people can think of them self's as that character, but oml save me please. Just throw her and theno-name girl from amnesia in a room together, they have so much in common they'd be BFFL's. What would of made it better even though it wouldn't have happened would be if they made her red headed friend the main character instead, she had more going for her, like a personality and multiple emotions.\\n\\n\r\nShe basically has no personality apart from being kind and liking music but only knows how to play the piano but is somehow one hell of a composure?\\n\r\nSomehow all these guy fall in love with her so quickly for the simplest of reasons it's as if they've never had a girl look in their direction before, then this country punkin pops out of no where and their brain just completely go south basically... \\n\\n\r\nI understand that it is not many episodes so the romance will be rushed, along with the fact that it was a game, so most of time in such cases it gets left out in favour to keep it in the game and not spoiling the routes but this can lead to lack of development and plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe dudes were nice but cliche, clearly one of those pick you favourite husbando from these stereotypical looking and personality boys! Oh look a flirtatious guy, oohh look he plays the saxophone, who would've guessed? Sometimes a bit of cliche/stereotyping is nice, but not when it's the only thing really going for them.\\n\\n\r\nconclusion: basically a make your own fantasy \"I'm a composer surrounded by good looking guys a reality\"\\n\r\nMostly fan service, some singing and music.\\n\r\nTHE MUSIC IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD ALL CONSIDERED AND IS WASTED ON THIS.\\n\r\nArt style is pretty...",

            "content": "I honestly don't understand why this series gets so much hate.\r\nHonestly, I can see why people giving this horrible reviews, I don't care for this season too much myself. However, I still think you should give it a shot.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThis is the least exciting season of the series, and the lowest scoring section in this review. Yes, there is a conflict, but it doesn't make for a dramatic story. Also, most of the season has what I call \"focus episodes,\" meaning there are episodes dedicated to concentration on one particular character and Nanami's interactions with them. Some of these are good episodes, others are abit lacking but do have funny gag reels. Yet once we get past these episodes, you're already more than halfway through the series and its a bit of a scramble to make it to the finish line. Despite that, its not that bad, and the last 2 or 3 episodes are a pretty good wrap-up of the pilot season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWith the exception of Nanami's eyes, I love the character art. Sure, once in a while a shot will be a bit off-model, but everyone is very well drawn. The background art is amazing. It's got enough detail to really transport you into their world without being overbearing. Even the lighting is perfect. The studio did a fantastic job in that department.\\n\r\nAlso: I love the opening song animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI LOVE THE MUSIC!!! I have a playlist of every song that has ever come from this series (including the video games, drama CDs, etc.) and it makes me happy when I've had a sucky day. Sure, one or two of them aren't my favorites, but they're enough to bring you a sense of each guy's style. The background music is good too; it sets the mood nicely. Also, the opening song is pretty fantastic. Mamoru Miyano has a great voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAlso one of the lower scoring sections. I didn't care for the personalities of certain people until season 2. Nanami is a bit helpless at first (although I don't 100% blame her for it), and I could not stand Ren or Tokiya for a while (the former being an overbearing flirt and way too passive and sarcastic, and the later was rude and a bit too stoic for my taste). Shining Saotome freaked me out (and still does), and everyone else felt like they were missing something. Don't let that stop you; there's this lovely thing called character development and that helps a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI like this series, but sometimes the series felt a bit slow.\\n\r\nAnd it was (see \"Story\"), but there were plenty of things to enjoy. There are plenty of funny bits here and there, and I enjoyed listening to the music. The focus episodes varied on how much I enjoyed them depending on who it was (*cough*Ren&Tokiya*cough*), and the rest was \"meh,\" but I still had fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis series has its ups and downs, and if you've seen any other reverse harem, you'll know they're all like that. This is a series started with a simple PSP game 6 years ago and is now one of the most popular reverse-harem series in Japan (their most recent live event was in the Super Saitama Arena, which seats 36,500 and was to capacity that night). If you like music, a full spectrum of cute/hot guys with various personalities, this is certainly something for you.",

The main pointer I have though, is the art style of the anime. When it switches to the more vivid colours, it looks to bright. Maybe I'm being a bit too picky, but I generally feel like it just too bright. Of course, I understand that this is just the individual style of the publisher, but i feel like it could have been toned down a bit. Also, the opening is rather catchy,and has an impact from the start. None the less, i like the art style of the anime, it's unique in it's own way. On the other, it wins with it's humour, as from the very first episode you can expect to have a laugh. I can defiantly say that I was having a laugh, just half way through the first episode. Therefore, if you want something a bit different, and something that includes music, and will make you laugh then, have a go watching Uta no Prince-same.",

There is some romance in the show since there are one girl and many many boys, but it goes through how she helps them get famous and bring out their true potential.\r\nThe storyline wasn't the best but it is worth watching if you have watched this I advise you to watch the second one, I have yet to watch the third but at some point,i plan to.",

Just keep in mind that the heroine is a real pain.",

            "content": "(I'm shit at writing reviews so read this at your own risk XD)\r\nOkay, my first thought about this show:\r\nSO CHEESY.\r\nI first heard about this from Youtube, off an AMV actually. Basically I saw the bishies and thought \u201cOHHHH LOOKS GOOD!\u201d and then looked it up MAL. And you know what MAL put in it\u2019s description?\r\nYou don't? Look at the top of this page and see for yourself. //me reads and cringes in horror.\r\nThat description totally put me off the show however I still went and got myself a copy of the episodes out so far and figured I could trudge through it slowly when Ihad time since the art looked shiny and pretty[definitely AMV material] but what I was not expecting was that I\u2019d actually enjoy it. Now let\u2019s get reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile not entirely new, it\u2019s certainly refreshing. As with most shoujo animes, it\u2019s in a highschool setting. But it\u2019s no ordinary highschool. It\u2019s a school for LEARNING MUSIC! Mainly for idols and composers who write songs for those idols. Now that\u2019s where the bishies come in, I mean you can\u2019t really be an idol unless you\u2019re pleasing to the eye to some extent right? So yush, I\u2019m loving the bishies. Especially Shou, dammit he\u2019s just too cute! He\u2019s like one of those little puppies or soft plushies you just wanna hug and squish to death. Uh yeah now I\u2019m going off track. *cough* Anyway that\u2019s not to say this show doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s negatives, for starters the pacing is completely weird and I\u2019m not just talking about the last episode[13]. I just felt like the entire show's time space was just screwed up. For the most part I had no idea why and what was happening because it was just thrust into our faces(eg. the beach vacation for finding your partner shiz) And since I just finished Ep13, let's add a summary for that. IT'S NOT EVEN SPOILERISH SINCE IT'S SO PREDICTABLE. Really, I was sitting there literally waiting for things to happen because I already knew what was gonna happen. o__o\\n\\n\r\n[EP13 SUMMARY]\\n\\n\r\nFirstly she\u2019s all shocked that the Headmaster doesn\u2019t approve of her, then when everyone is backing her up she tells them to STFU and get on with their debut while being cool beans about everything, then she runs off from the school and to her grandma\u2019s place acting all depressed, Mrs Grandma being the awesome Grandma she is lends her a shoulder to cry on and to help her get over her depressingness and OMG GUESS WHAT, the hot guys come to her Grandma\u2019s place and sings her a song to cheer her up and then the Headmaster pops up in the countryside too!\\n\\n\r\nSay, how much weirder can an episode get? Not to mention lame. Really. I was very confuddled. I wasn\u2019t even hesitant about including the plot for episode 13 in this review because it\u2019s completely predictable and anyone who complains about it being spoilerific should be shot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso with the exception of Tokiya, everyone was SO friendly with her at first sight. Whatever happened to relationship building over time HUH?! NO PAIN NO GAIN REMEMBER!\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget the cheesiness.....it's really cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh it\u2019s so shiny and pretty. *__* So sparkly and glowy. Excellent AMV material and eye candy. And I mean it has bishies, HOW GOOD CAN IT GET?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked a few of the songs, mainly the ending. The other ones just felt totally lame but it does express their emotions well in each part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEveryone was likeable minus the Headmaster. Yes even Haruka and her very annoying \u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m not as good as you guys\u201d and very \u201cairhead-like\u201d attitude. The guys all have unique personalities and unique background stories which makes them very interesting that helps leave an impression on viewers. The Headmaster while being interesting in his own way just pissed me off for the entire show with his annoying speech and his crappy way of assessing people. What a loser.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI started watching for the bishies and actually surprised myself with how much I liked this show in general. Because minus some of the extremely cheesy lines and lame singing/dancing parts, this show was pretty enjoyable to watch",

If successful there, she\u2019ll be able to join the Shining Agency after graduation. However, it won\u2019t be so easy when Haruka is already surrounded by potential idols and composers. On top of that, her homeroom teacher is a current idol, the headmaster was a record-breaking singer, and the academy itself is a chaotic place where anything can happen. Which prince of song will be paired up with Haruka?! \r\nSource: www.animefreak.tv\r\nAbout the story, if you hate dramatic anime, I wouldnot recommend this anime. The story moves on very slowly and believe me, the main character (Nanami Haruka) will start annoying you at some point. As I already said about the story, it's a good story and fun to watch but it moves on very slowly. You will have to be very patient watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, I have to say, I think the producers did a terrific job. It was very well drawn and the colours were really bright. Although I think they could have used a little less sparkles.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also of a very good quality, but there's not always the right soundtrack at the right moment. During normal conversations, they put on a very dramatic soundtrack. This anime is one big drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are sort of realistic. Nanami Haruka, the protagonist really started annoying me. When I mean annoying, I mean she was crying for no reason at all. I did really enjoy the male characters. But all their conversations were with Nanami Haruka, that sort of ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed the anime, and I am looking forward to season 2. They will also bring in new male characters in the new season. If I'm correct, it will air somewhere in April 2013.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this anime. I enjoyed this so much that I even rewatched it ( which I don't do very often!) Please watch this anime!!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not sure if it's because I haven't seen any other reverse harems (except OHSHC) or because of the fact that I love cute boys that sing and dance to cliche'd pop music (hello, One Direction), but I enjoyed the hell out of this series. Now, by all means, it's definitely not a masterpiece, and nowhere near original, but for what it is, it's entertaining.\r\nSpeaking of originality, there is next to none when it comes to, well, everything. The story (which gets a 5, by the way) takes place in a school devoted to training singers and composers, with six boys and one girl tochoose which one she wishes to do the most. Although, she never really does choose, does she? In fact, it sets itself up as a harem, but really, it's more about friendship, and doesn't go beyond some 'sincere' words and a whole lot of blushing. That's fine and all, but the romance is... nonexistent. So if your looking for that, you won't find here.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if I had the emotionless personality and the satanic looking eyes like her, guys would be lining up for me in no time, according to this. And they would be some of the most stereotypical guys, too. The main character, as said before, has no personality to speak of, but she still has that \"special something,\" which, I guess?, is composing music. Her roommate is the stereotypical friend, but doesn't really do much and is so irrelevant, I forgot her name. The boys range from emotionless to the too-friendly to the playa boy archetypes. The only guy really worth mentioning is the one with glasses for reasons that would go into spoiler territory. The characters get a 7 because they played their stereotypes well and felt like they had a connection. They also sang good together. And were pretty bang-able. Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't really anything special, except the end song, which I found myself singing along to so loud that my mom had to come into my room and tell me to shut up. I can't help it, I really like cliche'd pop music, especially j-pop with engrish mixed in. It's a weakness, I know. The opening was skip-worthy and nothing else really popped. So, 7 again.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (6) was alright. The character designs were great for the guys (they were hot, what can I say). The main character, who really should invest in regular colored contacts, or take out the ones she currently wearing, looked average aside from those eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCall this a guilty pleasure, if you will, because my overall enjoyment was a 9. However, looking at it from a reviewers perspective, like I am, the characters and story were unoriginal, the sound wasn't anything amazing and the art was average. It was good for what it was, and exceeded my exceptions (because they were unbelievable low). It is an anime worth watching if you're bored one day and don't have anything else to watch. Or, sexy boys could be your thing, in which case watch this, and watch it now.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: satanic eyes + sexy guys = hot sex (see what I did there?)",

            "content": "Believe it or not, I didn't start watching this show because of the reverse harem aspect - although that is something I have no objections to ;). The reason I started watching this is because I've always been fascinated by the music industry in Japan - especially by the concept of whole schools made for mass-producing boybands for teenage girls like myself to drool over. Being a successful musician only partially involves being good at singing - there's dancing, character, style, almost a new personality you have to adopt to be an idol of the public.\r\nAnyway, so yes I watched this because I was interestedin the manufacturing process behind jpop bands, but I'll get on to reviewing the damn thing now. Before I say anything else though, I will say that if you're a straight guy, you should really turn tail and run because you will gain absolutely nothing from watching Utapri.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nAlthough I really liked the setting, there was quite a lot of angsting to be done. I could tell that it didn't have an amazing or overly intellectual plot while I was watching it. I know for a fact that it won't win any prizes for screenwriting. But, for once, I found that I didn't actually care that much. It was so much fun to watch, the somewhat underdeveloped story didn't matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nLots of flowery, sparkly, shiny, starry shoujo goodness. Need more be said? If you wanna make a reverse harem, you wanna make sure that those guys are damn fine looking. There's nothing worse than a harem filled with ugly creatures! Utapri has most certainly ticked that box.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nHere's where I start to really, really, really like Utapri... I'm listening to the soundtrack now, and I will be for a long, long time. It is perhaps - no, certainly - the catchiest damn anime soundtrack ever. It's an anime ALL ABOUT MAKING CATCHY SONGS. And catchy songs it has. Better than some actual jpop groups. Every guy gets their own song, and they're all pretty talented. If you don't believe me, just look up the main Maji Love 1000% song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nUsually the failing of harems is to drop down into stereotypes. Although there are some hints of those in the characters, they are only vague, and all the characters get about an episode or so of development (which is a lot for something only 13 eps long). Haruka is quite emotive, but not in a way that makes her annoying - emotive in a way that makes the audience feel sympathy and emote right along with her.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the guys are all *cough* very attractive. With *cough* attractive qualities. I like all of them so much that I don't want to see Haruka reject them! They have some quite unique personalities that you wouldn't see in another harem. Schizophrenia is a quality I never expected to see in a romane interest like that.\\n\r\nBut even though all the guys get some good character development, Tokiya is the clear stand-out. Much of the plot revolves around his past and struggles. I would bet good money that Haruka will choose him eventually. (And I don't blame her just look at him honestly)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIt's difficult for a harem that takes itself seriously not to feel awkward and forced. (I'm looking at you, Kanigami no Asobi). But Utapri does this very successfully. There's so much fun to be had watching it, from drooling, to singing along with the songs, to laughing at the hijinks, to shouting at the screen 'GODDAMN ICHINOSE JUST KISS HER ALREADY'. Really I just loved every second I spent watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nUta no Prince Sama is an absolute blast to watch. There's a kind of enjoyment that only a harem can create. So far on my list, Utapri is second only in its genre to Ouran.",

            "content": "Good music, and a pleasant, light-hearted feeling.\r\nUtapri's story line really has nothing special to it. In a way, it's a stereotypical reverse harem where a girl is thrown into a situation where she is somehow surrounded by a group of cute guys. In this case, it's some sort of top class music school that, not so surprisingly, is a boarding school as well. Can't say that something similar hasn't been done before. On the other hand, though the idea is on the unoriginal side, the feeling of it is very unique to me. I find that many reverse harem anime's tend to be filled tothe brim with drama and plot-twists, while this one was simply fluffy, happy, and dreamy, throwing some tiny, intense moments in as well just to drawl the viewer in a bit more, but overall, it had a very nice, light feeling to it which I thoroughly enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was above average, but not something I feel to be gawk worthy. Haruka's eyes are a complete hiccup in my opinion, not only are they big and soulless, but then they turned around and colored them some ghastly yellow. They give off creepy vibes here and there, not pleasant,considering it messes with her sweet and kind character. Aside from that though, I felt everything else meshed well and was very fitting. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, sound and characters were the major selling points of this anime for me. The sound is fantastic! But I mean, you can't expect anything less from a musical related show. If you're gonna base an anime on music, do it right, and I felt the anime was spot on with it. As for the characters, I felt everyone was very unique. They all had their own niche, and they played them well, which I really liked. I kinda wish it had gone more in depth with each character.....but I can imagine that being kinda difficult to do with all six guys in only 13 episodes.I'm hoping the sequel will shed some more light onto them, but I still liked and enjoyed them, so I guess that's what mainly counts. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who enjoys music, and wants a show with a more low-key vibe to it, I feel this will be a good match-up. Also, there's some good bishounens in there as well, for those who are interested~ ;P It's definitely worth giving a try at the very least c:",

            "content": "Ok, Uta no Prince Sama gets a lot of hate. I will admit it looks a whole lot like a reverse harem anime, and at some points it even begins to feel like one, but if that's all you see in it then you're missing the point completely. Uta no Price Sama is about 7 teens chasing their dreams in today's harsh world of record deals and mega-hits. It's about how the people who make music really captivate souls and create dreams. And in the end, it nails exactly what it was trying for. And for that reason, it is one of my all timefavorite anime. But hey~ cute guys and great music helps a little too :)\\n\\n\r\nStory: Well, I'm not going to lie, Uta no Prince Sama gets off track sometimes. They spend a bit too much time explaining the characters then I would've liked, but it turned out to be a bit necessary to the plot, so that's ok I guess. I think the side plots, no matter how useless at times, give the show part of it's charm. In the middle of the show, it starts to feel like it's going nowhere for a mere millisecond, but suddenly by the last few episodes everything clicks into place and the plot is heartbeat by heartbeat perfection. Looking at it all together, the plot managed to take this show in the right direction and managed not to be cheesy, though at times it was evident that plot was the weak point of the show. But it had it's moments, and was all ok in the end, so I give plot an 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was absolutely gorgeous! The character designs perfectly accented their personalities, and the backgrounds and scenery were pretty too. They were not at all lazy with the background characters and such, absolutely everything was pretty. I feel like if the art was any different, the show would lose some of it's appeal. It just wouldn't be the same. That's saying a lot. And don't think I'm just saying this cuz I only watched it because of the hot guys XD 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I came into the show half expecting all of the music to be sub-par the actual content, I mean it's an anime, it's not like they're going to spend all the time writing songs, right? But the music surprised me by being heartfelt and catchy, music that doesn't even just supplement the show fantastically, even define it to some extent (which it does), it's even music I would like to have on my iPod. \\n\r\nThe voice actors were fantastic. I usually watch my anime dubbed, but the sub was so great that I couldn't even imagine it in English, especially the singing and the character's music.\\n\r\nTHE SINGING! All of the voice actors had great singing voices.\\n\r\nI was overall impressed and delighted with the sound. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really the core of the show, more than anything else. They may seem a bit half baked and stereotypical at a glance, but they are all very complex and realistic. I promise! They have great background and are much more than to what meets the eye, while still keeping you interested. They characters are really truly wonderful overall. 10/10  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was basically a floating happy cloud of rainbow whilst watching this anime. It is always enjoyable, even for someone like me who is bored easily. I almost never took my eyes off the screen, and yes, I do admit to jumping around and dancing to the songs. But you will too, no matter how much you think you will hate it. It hit all the right notes. (bad pun huehuehue)  10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can sum up Uta no Prince Sama in one scene, from the last episode: (very minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nAll of the boys hi five Haruka on the way out to the stage, with huge smiles on their faces. Haruka looks on proundly, eyes glistening as they go out. They dance and sing their hearts out with more passion than you could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Uta no Prince Sama is amazing show about living your dreams and spreading cheer through the magic of music, And no matter how dumb that sounds, you'll want to hive Haruka anyways and sing your heart out with some hot bishies. What could possibly go wrong tonight?\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n",

On a side note, she looks kinda blind, even though she can see perfectly fine. Who applies to a musical academy when /you can't read sheet music/???\r\nWhat really makes this show enjoyable is how much importance they put on pop music. It literally can make people kneel in awe or explode withpleasure. Some things that are readily accepted even though they are super strange. Our male love interests are fun and honestly, that's what you came here for right?\\n\\n\r\nOther than the catchy theme song Maji 100% Love, the music is... difficult to enjoy for me. The artwork though is very pretty, the way they color and shade the characters is very lovely.",

And there's a lot less aggression, possessiveness, and sadism. Characters are actually likable rather than being just fanservice. \r\nIf me saying \"Diabolik Lovers\" hasn't warded you off yet (I despised DL but went onto season DL More Blood for the hot guys obvi), I suggest giving it a try. I mean it IS an otome turned anime so it's as much as you'll expect out of it. \r\nTobe honest, if you're looking at the review page, chances are you're already leaning towards not watching it cuz you probably want a deep or revolutionary anime worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nThe demographic of this anime is essentially shallow and vain people who just wanna watch hot anime men act in various romantic scenes with music and singing (i.e. me).  But, it is a FAIR and DECENT anime.",

            "content": "I guess you could say Uta no Prince Sama is so bad that it is actually good. I'm not sure how else to describe this show.\r\nStory 6/10: The show is kind of clich\u00e9, a bunch of people try to get into the music school so they can become superstars or something along those lines. But it is different because they managed to toss in some kind of magical element. I won't really get into the magic thing, you will just have to see for yourself.\r\nArt 4/10: Oh my gosh, everybody has said it already but I'm going to say it again: the main girl hassome seriously freaky eyes. Her eyes look like they belong in some horror anime rather than in a romance anime! They have like some, weird film over them or something. Also, maybe I am not a fashionable person but I think the school uniforms are pretty ugly. I mean you got stripes and plaid and nothing really matches. It is just a lot to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Now since this show is all about music, how does it stack up? I think the show was pretty good in this department. Most of the songs are pretty enjoyable. I really love the opening Orpheus Heart but the ending song is really annoying. But even if you hate the ending song it is still kind of catchy. They have a lot of other songs too that the characters sing in the show. So at least you won't be bored.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: To sum up, Haruka is a stalker. She came to the school because of....wait for it....yup, some guy. You have some really happy characters and some dark/antisocial/brooding characters, that creep with the saxophone, and that crazy guy with the glasses. Oh yeah, and the headmaster is kind of a stalker too. The show tries to give the characters some depth by providing some backstory and struggles, but all of that kind of goes out the window when all of them start freaking out on the dance floor. I mean, the dance scenes are pretty hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Despite it's many flaws, I really enjoyed this show. It was funny, probably not in the way it was supposed to be, but that doesn't really matter, if it manages to make you smile. Like this :D!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Do NOT take this show seriously, it's supposed to be fun and ridiculous. In fact have fun with it while your watching, try and see if you could do the dances or sing along with the songs! Oh and if you hate it; make fun of it! Either way it's a win win situation!",

However, I don't like the female lead. She's not unique enough for reverse harem. I personally like strong spirited female leads, such as Kajika (from another anime). Kajika is strong willed, outgoing and cheers the others up. She's not \"the typical girl\" out there. Haruka is the one who needs cheering up and is rather shy. If anything, Tomochika, Haruka's friend, should be the main lead.\r\nMusic: 7\r\nNot as good as I thought. There's a couple in herethat have unique, memorable melodies, but not good enough for an anime focusing on music. I know a lot of anime out there that have way better music, the kind of music that captivates me on the spot, ones that I listen to over and over. Those anime don't even focus on music.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art I admit is pretty good. It's just Haruka's eyes that creep me out. I mean, no one has yellow iris and a green pupil.\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe plot is different and there's very few set in a music school, but then again there aren't many reverse harems...\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nIt did kill some time and it wasn't super boring, so I give it a 6.",

Well then , you must watch Uta no Prince-sama.\r\nThe story isn't anything special , it's quite cliche actually , but it's stunning art , lovable characters and sweet songs definitely make up for that. \r\nWe've seen so many animes/movies and read so many books with a group of boys fighting over a girl , but nothing quite like this . What makes UtaPri unique is , of course , it's characters . The boys are each different , and there's something forevery type of girl (or boy ) to love.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm not an expert in art ,so there's not much I can say about the art. I'm sure it won't give you an eye-sore though ;)\\n\\n\r\nNow , I'm a musician , so I can judge the music : At first , you'd think it's nothing special , just boy-band cr*p , so rockers or rappers wouldn't seem to interested . But after you've listened to the songs a few times , you will realize how much work the voice-actors put into it . I don't know about all the other people who watched this , but I have all of their songs on my iPod , and listening to one of them , just makes me happy. The songs are pretty good , and the voices are incredible . \\n\\n\r\nNow , to the characters. As I said , there's something for each girl/boy to love. Just not Otoya . He's mine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I'm giving this one a ten. Time flew while I was watching this ,and I forgot all about the cold weather or the annoying teachers . \\n\\n\r\nIf you love yaoi , this anime is totally worth a watch . It's full of yaoi potential , and I will not give up hope that some of the guys will end up with each other, but that isn't the point . If you don't love yaoi , it's okay , you should still watch it . That was all from me . Hope you found my review helpful .\\n\\n",

The innocence can get a little annoying at times, but over all its fairly enjoyable. The male cast if more interesting then Haruka.",

A girl, in a school, helping boys trying to make their debut. It's a teensy bit rushed, but that's due to the lack of episodes.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIT'S THAT ONE GIRL. THAT ONE GIRL RUINS EVERYTHING. Her hair, orange/pink/tinted sunset. And her eyes are yellow. Is she a witch? Everyone else, is definitely JUST FINE. IT'S HER. IT'S JUST HER...\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nTheir voices arenot always totally in sync, and suit the characters very well. The music is awesome. (It's a musical, get over it. :P)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nI SWEAR, IT'S JUST THAT ONE GIRL, WHO JUST HAD TO RUIN EVERYTHING. Her eyes are scary... I mean, everything is absolutely adorable about her! But since no one noticed that she's annoying, they all think she's 'wonderful'. Someone kill me, and kill me now. No, wait. Kill her. To be honest, it's just her. She's scared of haunted house, enjoys composing, KEEPS getting lost, is a certified damsel in distress, cries too much, and keeps saying : \"I'm so happy to hear that!\" \"I'm so glad!\" She's incredibly cheesy. But then again, so is everyone else. For example, when they sing a new song, they'll be like: \"Wow...It's so...amazing...\" All out of breath. Like, seriously? \\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nFor every reverse harem lover, congratulations, you've reached paradise. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9/10\\n\r\nI liked it a lot, except-say it with me now, THAT ONE GIRL. It would've gotten more, but it's just...ready for it... THAT ONE GIRL. \\n",

The story was interesting and after each episode, I kept wanting more. It is focused on a shy girl named Nanami. She is very nervous upon entering the music academy. She meets who she thinks is Hayato, but the boy says that he is his twin brother (Ichinose Tokiya). When moments such as this happen, the viewer can pretty much predict what is going to happen next. Nanami explores music with her new friends and create a new music group. Ithink that viewers will be able to connect to this story and will definitely be sucked in. \\n\\n\r\nART: When I pick an anime to watch, I always check the art first. Uta no Prince-Sama did not let me down. It was great to watch and I was never bored. Very detailed. Got my fangirl feels on. Twas a great night\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Loved the music, instantly downloaded it on my iPod. Whenever Tokiya popped up on my screen or his voice in the songs on my iPod, I would start giggling like a crazed fangirl. Thank god no one is here watching me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: ICHINOSE TOKIYA. NEED I SAY MORE?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: great art, great music, great character development, reverse harem? Hell yeah I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Hmmm...Let's see. I liked the music, the art and the story. There were a lot of HOT guys that can sing. I'm giving this a 10",

This anime is not for everyone it is incredibly cheesy there is a lot of music is the meaning of life and music is what makes the world go round type stuff in here and I didn't really like that yet I still give the story a 7 because for some reason I couldn't stop watching, I guess it's the romantic and comedic elements that I enjoyed. I found the art to bevey good for the most part which aids in the enjoyment of the series but not that significantly. As it is a musical anime I believe the sound quality had to be good so it didn't detract from the show however it doesn't do much to make the anime more enjoyable. On the whole characterisation was good however Haruka's character did annoy me at times but this was too a minimum. Finally enjoyment and overall experience were good i did dislike the heavy emphasis put on music but it was somehow compensated for by the rest of the story. As I said before it is not for everyone and I can't promise that you will like it if you have seen similar anime but if you can get pt the singing and dancing and quite frankly some very wired plot twists you might enjoy it so give it a try!",

            "content": "So I really like the concept of this series. The storyline is very typical anime, so there isn't any real surprises, but still pleasant to watch. The Art was the best part. Everything scene was drawn beautiful, but at some part, the episode had them flying and confetti of stars, hearts, and circles of all colors exploded everywhere. I found that kind of childish. The story is based on people who want to become composers and singers aka celebrities. So the music was good, but not amazing. I found some of the male leads voice pleasant, but others not so much. The characters all havetheir own distinct personalities, which is a good thing, but the main female character was slightly annoying. She's noisy, a cry baby, and doesn't know what she wants\u2026. typical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it because of all the male characters and usually there isn't a lot of reverse harem.  This is a 7/10 in my book.",
