            "content": "Shomin Sample is one of those rare ecchi harems which actually feels genuinely original and refreshing to watch. Not just because the setting is somewhat unusual, but also because its ecchi elements feel perfectly natural and that it's actually really funny. It's even got a likable harem protagonist for once, just how rare is that?\r\nThe idea of having a sheltered all-girls high school for rich young ladies and then letting a lone male student transfer into it is nothing new to the world of anime. But for the ladies to be completely and utterly clueless about how the world of ordinary citizens works, and forthem to have a misconception that the protagonist is actually gay and has a serious fetish for muscle men? Yeah I don't think that one has been done anywhere else before.\\n\\n\r\nThat is to say, our main character Kimito is one day kidnapped and forced to enroll in the school in order to help the female students to learn how to interact with not only a commoner, but also a person of the opposite gender for the first time. And I dare you, do *not* underestimate just how unbelievably ignorant these girls are about how the real world functions. In their eyes, ordering food at McDonald's is equivalent to the second coming of Jesus. That's how disconnected they are from reality in this series, and it's also the main source of the comedy that Shomin Sample has to offer. It's incredibly silly, but that's also what makes it so charming and original.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also emphasized a lot by the fact that Kimito is, in lack of a better phrasing, quite simply a huge troll. Since the girls are not only clueless but also about as gullible as it gets, he time and time again tricks them into learning things about commoners which are complete nonsense, and then watches them make fools out of themselves before springing the truth upon them a bit later on. It might be considered rude, but it's done in a very light-hearted and comedic fashion, and it rarely fails to make you laugh as a result.\\n\\n\r\nOf course seeing as this is a harem, the anime still hinges on the likability of the main heroines. There are primarily 5 of them in Shomin Sample. First we have Aika, the so-called \"Tsun-pure\" girl of the series. She is a loner who has a very hard time making friends with the other students, but desperately wants to be popular on the inside and she therefore asks Kimito to help her. She is also mind-bogglingly easy to trick as she believes literally anything Kimito tells her without a second thought. Secondly there's Reiko, one of the most respected ladies in the school and pretty much your stereotypical Ojou-sama character, albeit a lot less haughty. For what it's worth, she's probably the most generic and least interesting character of the show. Thirdly we have Karen, a beautiful black-haired woman who carries around a katana. More unexpectedly though is that on the inside... she's also a pretty hardcore lolicon of all things, which becomes very noticeable in the presence of the fourth girl: Hakua. She is the emotionless loli of the series who is supposedly 14 years old but looks quite a lot younger than that. She's also a genius who has her own laboratory in the school where she helps resolve serious issues in the fields of math, science and engineering. And fifth, there is the school's head maid: Miyuki. She is... also quite emotionless as far as her facial expression goes, but on the other hand the words coming out of her mouth are incredibly blunt and rude. Out of obligation she comes to wake Kimito up every morning, but instead of politely greeting him, her catchphrase would rather be \"I wish you had never woken up.\" There's also a sixth girl called Eri who is Kimito's childhood friend, but we don't get to see her too much in the anime as she is not a student in the school, however she works as a voice actress and you can see Kimito playing games starring her sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the character cast is a very mixed bag, but there ought to be someone for everyone in there at least. Personally I think Hakua is irresistibly cute, but Aika's gullibility and Karen's incorrigible behavior are certainly treats to see as well, and let's not even get started on Miyuki. That, and I also have to say that for a harem protagonist, Kimito really deserves an honorable mention here. He's honestly one of the better ones I've seen. He knows what he wants and he's not afraid to show it, he's not shy in any way when dealing with the girls, he's got a great sense of humor and he's just a very friendly person in general.\\n\\n\r\nNow it should be stated that at heart, Shomin Sample is primarily a comedy anime, and the ecchi elements are only secondary, not the other way around. That being said, there is still a decent amount of ecchi in it, and what it has is actually very tastefully executed. It's not just half-assedly slapped on as it is in so many other anime out there, but rather it generally stems from the characters' personalities. First of all, although the girls may incorrectly believe him to be a homosexual with a fetish for muscle men, the truth is that Kimito is most certainly hetero, and more so he actually has a pretty serious thigh fetish instead. He doesn't particularly care much for tits or asses; instead he's all about the legs. Many times throughout the series, we get to hear Kimito having an unbelievably rich and detailed internal monologue about just how and why the girls' legs in front of him are as beautiful as he believes them to be. Meanwhile, Hakua has the tendency to sometimes get flashes of inspiration which causes her to start writing down complex mathematical formulas all over the walls and the floor, and for some reason she also subconsciously starts stripping while she does so. This is also much to the joy of Karen who then really can't keep herself from panting like a dog in heat and having nosebleeds all over the floor as she greedily ogles Hakua's naked body. And there's plenty of eye candy starring the other girls as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value is... well probably the weakest part of this anime. Especially the animation, made by Silver Link, is quite clearly a very low-budget production. It looks pretty rough around the edges a lot of the time and it's not exactly pretty to look at. But at least it isn't straight-up ugly, and it doesn't really hamper the enjoyment of the comedy or ecchi scenes anyway. The soundtrack is about what you'd expect it to be, in other words barely noticeable. I like the OP quite a lot though, it's pretty catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat perplexes me the most is just how much lower rated this anime currently is compared to its own light novel and manga versions. I have not read the novel since it's not translated very far, but I have read the manga since quite a while ago, and honestly I don't think the anime is any worse at all. Apparently a lot of people seem to say otherwise but I personally don't see why at least.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, Shomin Sample was something I did not expect would ever get an anime adaptation just based on the fact that unorthodox ecchi series like this rarely do, but I'm so glad it did. Compared to the abundance of magic academy ecchi harems we normally get (this season included), Shomin Sample is better in just about every category to me. It's funny, it's cute, it's original and it doesn't feel forced at all. And for an anime of this type, that's about as much as you can ever ask for.\\n\\n\r\nGets!",

            "content": "On paper, this one looks like your typical harem series where the male protagonist enjoys (or doesn't) moments with the each of the girls. While I can't deny that this aspect did exist in this series, there was also something which felt a bit different. Lets get right into it, then. \r\n[STORY: 8/10]\r\nThe main concept of Shomin Sample isn't anything out of the ordinary. For those not new to this genre, I'm sure this isn't the first time you've seen a male protagonist somehow pulled into a situation where he ends up being the only male student in an all-girls school. While this set-up issimilar to some other series, it's the progression from that point onwards which I feel differentiates this series from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of heading towards the ecchi and overly fanservicey route, this series chooses to focus more on the development of the relationship between characters. The former route still exists here and there throughout, but the latter covers up that fact well. The episodes tend to be episodic, which the exception of a couple of them, yet we can clearly see how this group of one dude and four girls develop as a team and work together as a team, fighting for one another at times. A pity that this is just a one-cour series, which inevitably hastens that process. \\n\\n\r\n[ART: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nNot exactly the best, but still decent enough for you to find a best girl in it. The art style certainly fits a simple RomCom series like this, although arguably for those who are really picky about art there are times when the animation quality can be considered low. But overall, it's still on an acceptable scale for me, who is a sucker for series with bishoujo. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nReally catchy OP that may not sound so when you first hear it, and a good ED as well befitting of a series with multiple \"feel trips\" here and there. Fans of anime songs will probably enjoy these two. In addition, the background music played during the scenes itself are good, especially during emotional periods. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nLike aforementioned, the development of characters is what boosts the rating of this series up for me. None of the characters are perfect. They all have their own fair share of flaws and problems. This is what made them cute and likeable. Also, all four of the main girls have differing personalities and traits, so viewers will surely have a clear-cut decision on who is their best girl. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 8/10] \\n\r\nI didn't think I would, but I ended up really enjoying this from start to finish. The jokes they cracked got me good and the few references they made to some other series were hilarious. It was also heart-warming to see the characters interact with each other, helping one another in times of distress and, most of all, have fun with their daily activities for our viewing.  \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nGreat humour and unexpected feel trips. Shomin Sample is definitely one of the dark horses of this Fall 2015 season. A decent series to watch if you're looking for a simple, school, romantic comedy, slice-of-life series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've read till here, I thank you for giving me your time and wish you a MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR! :)",

            "content": "Execution is important when telling a story. An idea may sound good on paper, but when implemented, many things can and will go wrong. Sometimes, this is the fault of the talent or lack there-of putting it together, as there was too much going on and they had to cut it down. Other times, it was too vague and it goes someplace the creator didn't originally want it to go, or wasn't open to experimentation. Or it was just all slapped together, and/or relied on too much ass pulling and so it just falls apart. But then there are ideas that simply just don't work,and nothing, not even good talent, will save it unless it doesn't take itself seriously from the start\u2014but even that doesn't always work.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d exists. Creators rely on, perhaps even expect their audience to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show/book, because it's only for entertainment. In reality, it can only handle so much before it gets broken. For the most part, the story lays its rules out in such a manner that unless something very ridiculous happens that doesn't follow the rules as such, it's easy to roll with it. Universes are easy to create, they're just harder to keep it well-oiled and functioned without having to throw in a wrench to \u201cfind and fix\u201d a problem.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOre ga Ojousama Gakkou ni 'Shomin Sample' Toshite Gets-Sareta Ken\u201d, another light novel adaptation with such a ridiculously long title that it's shortened simply to \u201cShomin Sample\u201d, tries too hard to get its audience to just \u201croll with it\u201d. The synopsis already tells you what to expect, yet it just doesn't work because even in its own little universe, it doesn't work, and they acknowledge it's a failure. Newsflash: Being meta at the door is not enough to save your little harem from self-destruction.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Kimito Kagurazaka was just chilling in school one day when suddenly, militaristic muscle men nab him from the hallways, drag him into a limousine where they sexually fawn over him, and take him to a secluded prestige all-girls academy. The reason is because he was chosen to be a subject to help teach the girls more about the outside world, but he can only stay as a student if he was a raging homosexual with a muscle fetish. Since he wants to keep his penis intact, he has no choice but to roll with it, and he begins to develop a friendly relationship with the girls and correcting their misconceptions on the \u201ccommoner world\u201d, as they call it. At the same time, he attracts a few socially inept girls who becomes his harem on the side, but he is not allowed to romance them. And even then, would he really want to?\\n\\n\r\nHere's where my suspension of disbelief is thrown out the window from the first episode: the fact all of these girls don't know anything about the outside world, and they become shut-ins because of it. And here I thought I was a sheltered girl, but they all take the cake and eat it, too. Becoming shut-ins aside, how the hell do they even function in life? Are we to just assume that from the day of their birth they weren't allowed to leave their premises? I don't care that they're rich and they have maids waiting hand and foot to cater to their every little needs, they clearly are living in a messed up world where they don't know about other people\u2014I'm sorry, \u201ccommoners\u201d. Apparently, this was such a huge problem with their graduates that the administration had to bring in someone from the \u201coutside world\u201d to teach them. This is proof they are warped in the head, blinded by their own perfect little bubble where nothing bad happens to their perfect little angels, and the concept of boys and how they function as people are close to a thing of fiction. Just what the fuck were they expecting? \\n\\n\r\nIdiots.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's really no way one \u201ccommoner\u201d boy can tell all of these girls everything about the outside world unless he was to really go into politics and social cues (which he himself has to understand, but he's \u201cnormal\u201d, so apparently he does), because that's how the outside world works, ladies and gentlemen. It's not just about the kind of phone you own, or what clothes you wear, or what food you eat, it's about interaction with the people around you. I don't expect these girls to go out and find work when they're probably just going to be married off to wealthy businessmen, but they should still at least be able to go out in public and be normal, and make friends. If they can't even do that, which is what the school and parents are supposed to prepare them for, then they are failures because they were set up to be failures. And since there's only one of him, they can't all personally interact with him, and many of them don't.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what this school is? A gilded cage, plain and simple, it's just that at least they're getting some kind of education. It's probably why they haven't gone mad yet, but maybe that'd make for a more interesting harem to have a cast of loons. And speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: One of the issues (albeit it's an attraction) with the harem genre are its character archetypes, which is believed to have been set in stone by \u201cLove Hina\u201d. \u201cShomin Sample\u201d doesn't appear to have been inspired by it, but the female leads still show signs, just in a \u201cdifferent\u201d light. The saying \u201cOnce you've seen X, you've seen them all\u201d pretty much sums up the genre, and this is no exception to its characters. Character archetypes aren't bad on their own, mind you, it's when the characters are stagnant that it becomes a problem.\\n\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazaka has my sympathy for being forced into a school and become someone he's not. The raging homosexual with a muscle fetish they label him with? That was all a misinterpretation of his normal everyday life, because he was interacting more with his male peers than female peers\u2014even though he has a female childhood friend they personally interviewed. The school believed her lies, but they refused to take responsibility for their mistakes, let alone listen to what Kimito had to say in his attempts to correct them, and pretty much threatened him to cover it up. So now, he has to put up with all of these loony bins who have attached themselves to him all while hoping he'll still get to keep it in his pants or it'll get snipped. But unlike with other harem protagonists, his penis is honest-to-goodness in real peril to the point I'm shocked it hasn't shrunken into him, he's constantly on his toes.\\n\\n\r\nPenile peril and humiliation is grade-A comedy in romcoms, apparently.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'll have to give him some credit in that he's actually rather nice and helpful to the girls and doesn't ogle them\u2014usually; this is because he has a thigh fetish, so most of his ogling is focused on the thighs and going on monologues about them. Although it's generalization to label every harem protagonist as a pervert, it hasn't always been the case since they're typically thrust into a harem they didn't want. It's pretty clear Kimito respects them, and that he's managed to stay sane despite being watched like a hawk, however, he still has his perverse moments that he still ends up getting into on accident\u2014like every other harem protagonist. At the very least, he's not getting himself beat up for this, but his genitals still run for the hills each and every time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the roll call of your classic one-dimensional harem girls obliviously trying to get him castrated in the process of getting in his pants, politely. From sane to the less sane:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of personality, Reiko Arisugawa is the most normal of the harem girls, very ladylike and formal, but can't socially interact with a \u201ccommoner\u201d. It's a form of anxiety for her, although there's nothing that proves she improved since Kimito basically is always there to hold her hand. Then episode four happened, in which she went very much out-of-character, and became borderline yandere, if not clingy. It was very jarring, and I don't know if this is out-of-line or not, but she only acts like this around Aika and not with the other girls for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, Aika Tenkuubashi is introduced trying to force herself on Kimito because she was told by a classmate, and believed 100%, that kissing a commoner would make her dreams come true. Of course, she's also the odd one out, because she believes she doesn't fit in, even though she's not actively interacting with everyone despite others attempting to (or so they say). And yet, she wants to be popular when she won't talk to anyone, which is why she forced her Commoner Club upon Kimito. She's ditzy, loud-mouthed, and clingy, but not in a good way with her lack of social cues. Some girls do come forward wanting to be her friends, yet somehow, this gets reversed, so she remains stuck in square one.\\n\\n\r\nKujo Miyuki is Kimito's personal maid while he's a student, and although her mannerisms are as such, she clearly doesn't like him and is cold around him. She reminds him (more like calmly threatens with giant scissors) that if he puts so much as a toe out-of-line, he'll be castrated (or emasculated), and she'll most likely be the one doing the snipping. But of course, like all of the girls, she comes to love him, too, she's just more stoic about it.\\n\\n\r\nKaren Jinryou is the supposedly-Yamato Nadeshiko girl with tsundere tendencies who neurotically pulled a katana on him in her introduction. As to be expected from wildly swinging an actual sharp weapon around, after exposing him, herself, and all the girls in the sidelines, she gives herself to Kimito\u2014although nothing has come out of it. There's hidden depths of her wanting to be girly, but it goes nowhere. She immediately gave me bad \u201cLove Hina\u201d flashbacks, and she is the least-developed of the girls (which doesn't say much, since hardly anyone develops).\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the token loli character, Hakua Shiodome, except let's pull the rug out from under the feet of lolicons because\u2014gasp!\u2014she's actually fourteen. (So are loli-traps a thing, now?) Unless she just has really recessive genes or she was forced to stay a certain size for life (which is all sorts of messed up on its own especially because she can't even dress herself), I'm calling bullshit, because this character is clearly the size of an elementary school child, about six-to-seven years, maybe less. And apparently she's also a genius, even though she's in the exact same boat as every last one of these girls despite being locked away in a lab for most of her life. I can't tell if she's the metaphorical sultan of the group of students, or if the lab's a gilded cage in a gilded cage and she's just as cuckoo, if her stripping like a toddler every time she does equations is anything to go by.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: Silver Link at least is talented in this department, but as with all productions, the quality has taken a steady dip after the first episode with occasional spurts of energy here and there, like the dance sequence in episode two, Hakua's epiphany in episode three, and the so-totally-not-DDR sequence in episode six. It doesn't automatically mean the animation has become stilted, though, there's still fluidity in parts when it calls for it, reflecting the grace of being a lady. The colors have a pastel look to draw your eye to them, particularly in the hair, eyes, and panties, complimenting with the mo\u00e9 style. However, the only thing that really pops in this category is the opening, but that's only because it's on a sugar rush and has a few different stylistic choices going on throughout. The ending also deserves a little bit of mention for looking like a sketchbook, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: It's rather generic, to be frank. No voices stand out (although Aika's is a bit bothersome when shrilly, and Miyuki sounds collective at the least), no piece of score has left an impression lasting longer than the scene it's played in, there is nothing to be said here. Far as I can tell, it probably does fit the elegance of being prestige, but it's all blended in together that there's no way to really pick them apart. Same goes for the opening and ending, although the opening at the very least has something to it in being cute and light-hearted, but not enough for me to care outside of wondering what the hell I'm looking at during the opening. But damn it, I can't say it's not an earworm, albeit one I don't want. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: If it couldn't be gleaned from this review, then I'll come out and say I had not enjoyed this show, let alone have any care for it outside of my snarky comments here and there. While I have run into a few pleasant surprises, the harem genre is not for me, but it unfortunately is part of the package in some romance anime. If the characters weren't so chiseled out from their respective archetypes and more was done with them, then maybe I wouldn't have too much of a problem, but it'd still be another generic anime series that'll end up being forgotten except among the fans\u2014maybe. So it tries to at least stand out a bit from other harems by having a stupid, broken premise, but it became like every other harem anime almost immediately, it's just that Kimito is falsely accused of being gay. Clever. Bet that took the creator months to plan out rough drafts for.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hadn't been for the stupid premise and the fact it's animated by Silver Link, I'd have glossed over this one and not given it a second thought this season. It's clearly made for fans of the harem genre, and since they seem to come back to the same thing over and over again and don't bother caring about its story, I'm not going to take that enjoyment away from them. I'm just disappointed in how homogeneous the genre tends to be, in all honesty.\\n",

Everyone has a different opinion so understanding is the key point.\\n\\n\r\nWithout further, let\u2019s go to the Shomin Sample Review.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a concept where, these girls are in a high class academy, where they are more like damsels and polite civilians, however due to such academy the girls became closed from the outside world, where the \u201ccommoners\u201d (aka the outsiders), and in recent times, more graduates are failing to get into the modern society, so they decided to go upon and kidnap our main protagonist Kimito, a male student commoner, in order for him to show the young female girls about the modern world to become part of the place they all live upon.\\n\\n\r\nTo start things off, the concept is rather original and refreshing, unlike your other shows around, the show has an idea where its concept is mainly focused on the group of our main protagonist or also known as the \u201charem\u201d to learn about the modern world, and it does it pretty well to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nAs well with the show adding this idea of the main protagonist having to say that he\u2019s gay, and having muscle fetishes. I really think this type of idea has not been done before in an anime (unless I am wrong and someone shoots me at the head).\\n\\n\r\nEach Episode cooperates with the themes of the show by showing how the main protagonist helping these girls and at the same time showing them the stuff outside of the spectrum of the school. By adding these ideas the girls gets a solution and it\u2019s quite something to say the least. It just looks nice and it just feels different than your average school show.\\n\\n\r\nThis idea also helps with the comedy, as it works well with the show when they add these ideas of the modern world\u2019s usual life and the technology they use, also the amount of other things I can mention.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy can be considered as solid and on point with its themes and its setting, in fact; I will say this, the comedy is also ridiculous and at the same time laughable in a way for my eyes. But of course, the comedy part is subjective.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for the show is rather slow though to say the least, however it does help with the anime because the slow pacing helps the comedy and the themes execute them nicely without seeming to be dragged out for my eyes, it\u2019s a nice way to do the show for my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nFor the dialogue, well, I wouldn\u2019t say MUCH about the dialogue considering this is considered as a show that shouldn\u2019t be complex at all, so at the very least I will say the dialogue works with the setting they\u2019re in for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fanservice part I will say that the show does have fanservice, but for the most part it\u2019s concentrated on the thighs. If you are a thighs lover or rider, you will actually love this one since each or so episode does show thighs. \\n\\n\r\nI will say the show does a nice job in terms of the modern idea themes, ridiculous comedy (this is subjective), nice and original concept and a nice executed idea. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few departments where I really don't have to explain much (which is just usually absurd unless when it comes to bland characters).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this type of setting for the outside of the male cast, each said character has their own trait and personality (as in the main female cast of characters) and each said one of the cast of characters gets involved into ridiculous and also laughable situations.\\n\\n\r\nEach said female character has their different ways to become rather cute and likeable, and many would go and have a different taste on personalities so here you would have some for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nFor the main male protagonist I will say that he's one of those rare and unusual main protagonists though, it's really hard to explain which why he stands out on his own (terms of general main protagonist) but somehow his gags, and his moments through the anime makes him somewhat likeable and tolerable enough for me. Though this is coming from a rather personal view.\\n\\n\r\nI guess to say the characters are one fun of a ride to say the least because along with the story they help at least with the plot and its comedy moments, which all of them participating is like a nail in the cake.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the weak components of the anime series, being produced by Silver Link (by the same people that are behind the shows as Rakudai and Taimadou for the Fall season, and completed for example Kokoro Connect and Fate/kaleid) the budget for the show is quite a bit lacking. Not saying that this is bad, but it's not all that great either.\\n\\n\r\nFor example the production quality of the show is quite decent enough, although there are parts in the production quality where the faces aren't really well done, or to say the least not well produced, but it doesn't mean it equals as atrocious. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation it seems quite mediocre at the times, at some points they just concentrate on the budget on the thighs at most case, at times it looks nice as a standard moments, but at times it just seems rather lazy since a little bit of the parts seems rather inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nFor the backgrounds it seems rather fitting for the designs, as at the school setting backgrounds it looks quite light and alright. Not one of the best out there but it works for the designs at least.\\n\\n\r\nFor the character designs they look quite clean and pretty looking (I am saying this because I have no other words to say for description) at the same time the characters in the series at most stands out from your typical designs for the most part for these type of settings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Art/Animation department is essentially one part of the downs of the show. Yes, one of. There's more to it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few weakest components of the show, by far the weakest part. The music soundtrack would be considered as fitting for the scenarios, but quite unoticeable. That's because this could have been heard loads of times before from my eyes. It's kind of a mellow and soft instruments, not rough or anything there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the sound it's really mediocre. To say it's really not that BAD but it's not all that amazing either. So I will say this is at least passable at least it doesn't sound like a ground breaking ear screech.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Opening and Ending, the Opening seems rather catchy and at the same time ridiculously engaging for me. I've heard this 100 times around and for some reason I can't stop hearing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song however... not my type of music to say the least. It's not bad but it's not for my personal taste either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment standpoint of my review I will say I like the show because it's kind of like this. After one comedy show ends from today (Wednesday) I have another one to actually enjoy. It's pretty funny and ridiculous, some very cute characters that I really like, it doesn't seem to be dragged out at least.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of my enjoyment I would say, should I recommend this show? Well, sure I suppose. It's not for everyone, but if you want something to pass the time and enjoy yourself then you may have a nice time with this.\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this is a review for Shomin Sample. I'd like to start off by saying this was a splendid anime. I've read a few of the negative reviews, don't pay them any head. Do you like comedy? Do you like harems? If yes is the answer then give this show a watch. If the answer is no, then why are you here at all?\r\n    We begin our story with the male MC(Kimito Kagurazaka) being kidnapped and forcibly transferred to a new school. This new school is for wealthy young women to learn how to be brides. Hisrole is to teach these women about commoners and how to interact with males so when the girls graduate there isn't a large culture shock. Apparently some women have had a hard time adjusting and even became shut ins because of they couldn't adapt.\\n\\n\r\n    Now when see a guy going to an all girls school you may be a tad worried that its going to be terrible(that was what I thought too). However this anime does a splendid job of setting up the world so even though its unrealistic, we don't feel like its pandering to the \"Male Otaku\" image that people constantly try thrust onto every harem on the market. Of course I don't want to bash that image, I myself enjoy those shows but, I must admit that they do get tiring. This show was refreshing and a joy to watch. There isn't much in the way of story. The first half is dedicated to learning about the school and introducing the girls and some of their particular quirks and traits. The pacing is well done and I cant complain about the lack of story because the slice of life feel fits.\\n\\n\r\n    The second half of the show continues in much the same way as the first. Though they did throw in some unnecessary semi dramatic events at the end but it wasn't terrible. There is no completed romance, as is the standard of your typical harem. The show does a great job showing its worth in the comedy field. I was constantly smiling and laughing at the jokes and moments in the show. There are running jokes, parody skits, and small things that I find funny though that seems to depend on each person.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters are what makes a slice of life show and Shomin sample doesn't disappoint. We ultimately have a small cast of characters and even though we don't have any deep, intricate, or sad/destiny type characters we can still enjoy what we are given. The girls personalities come out clearly. Aika is \"tsun-pure\" she says whatever she is thinking and constantly worries about talking around people, thus she lacks friends. Reiko is the proper model of a rich young woman though seems to be easily swayed by thoughts of marriage and some naughty ideas. Karen is a self proclaimed swords woman who even though shows amazing powers with the sword is a complete klutz, and an over the top tsundere. Hakua is the loli character who is a quiet genius. Kimito is our male lead who is pretty much your standard protagonist but he is forced to take on the role of a homosexual man who enjoys muscles. Of course I wish they done more to expand on these characters and give us some more time to experience them. However the amount of screen time is well divided and we get to know the characters well enough I can tell you a bit about each one, again something I cant say about some anime.\\n\\n\r\n    The art is well done. The eyes in particular are noticeable however its pretty even among the other shows released this season. The music was catchy and fit the mood, voice acting was great as well. I really enjoyed Chitose Morinaga, who voiced Karen who was my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this show immensely and will be looking for a season 2. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these genres. For those of you worried about how much \"Ecchi\" is in the show, there is a some. but nothing as outrageous as shows like Maken ki or Highschool DxD. Comedy, semi decent mini stories, nice art, and a harem full of pretty girls. What else could we ask for?",

Gets!\r\nOverall: Good 7. Gets!\r\nFeliz Navidad everybody, so this anime has ended, so no more BS at let's GETS down to business.....Gets!\r\nStory (up).\r\nOk, I gave this anime's category its score since it was still the usual romcom/harem genre, and as usual it still involve one guy, in a club , with the usual set of  girls and everyday crazy antics that come with it. But, then again the anime's title plot did live up as to what was expected , it maybe the usual butoriginal creator Nanasuki Takafumi  did made some nice tweak in it , which would otherwise be just another harem based rom com anime. Gets!\\n\\n\r\nArt (up).\\n\\n\r\nTbh, the fanservice was the good part in this anime....well, at least the score is for the fanservice . But, set aside from it, it looks like Hakua's attire wasn't very much uniformed, at one point we see her wearing  a white blouse and black skirt,and in some occasion she's wearing what can be describe as the school's standard middle school uniform. But then again at least in this anime them girls' school uniform don't look like rompers from the manga, now I can't say if that's manga illustrator Uru Gekka's way of keeping the fanservice at bay, but here in the anime FUNnimation sure was brazen enough to go through the usual panty shot.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for both the opening and closing theme of this anime, cu'z I see both of which as a good fit for the anime, and frankly I don't give a shit about them VA's who did the character's voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nUsually in a harem the guy is either the strongest or the most obnoxious, thought the character's here can be describe as the usual , it is not always where there is a reversal were the guy is the normal one and it's them girls who were the obnoxious ones, so despite to the usual character roles and characteristics, the fact that such reversal was implemented was enough for me to give this category a high score, I say, Kimito's role really did play up in here as a commoner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really does deserve a 7 , since it maybe good, we can't deny that it was still a usual romcom/harem based anime, and that it still has to rely on the fanservice to sell, not enough for me to give it a higher score than 7, but not too much for me to rate it any lower, so, season 2?????? I don't see why not, GETS!\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas, essess, Gets! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nothing much to say. An anime with a guy who (is forced to) love muscles and men in a school full of girls?  Sounds good to me!\r\nEven though the plot is not too unique: a boy suddenly changes to a female school, Nanatsuki-sensei has expanded it: more situations, more secrets and in fact it adds more colors to this series, so don\u2019t dismiss this hastily. Let\u2019s read this review instead and take a few second to decide whether you want to spend time with it or not.  \r\nWhen people see something beautiful, attractive and very expensive compare to their normal stuff, notsurprising to know their feelings. But we are talking about the wealthy people\u2019s daughters who use its every day. Since they were born, they have lived in a prosperity life that separated them from outside world, no wonder they act awkwardly while contacting with commoner people.  That\u2019s why the value of a thing is relative.   \\n\\n\r\nShomin sample\u2019s context is about a school which teaches influential family\u2019s daughters only to guide them to the government. In this school, they have to learn like the way princesses had been taught long time ago. After realized that they had been struggle with communicating with normal people, the principal offers to add a male normal student as a \u2018commoner sample\u2019 to teach those girls everything about outside world except staining them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazaka: a man who kidnapped by the school under the assumption that he prefers men. He is to summarize \u2019average\u2018. \\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Kujou: A head maid and Kimito\u2019s personal maid. She\u2019s very cold and cruel toward Kimito.\\n\\n\r\nReiko Arisugawa: She\u2019s the monitor in Kimito\u2019s class. As one of the most influential member in school, Reiko usually acts like a princess .\\n\\n\r\nAika Tenkuubashi: A childish, tsun-pure girl who has great trouble socializing with the other girls in the academy, but she\u2019s very confident in front of Kimito.\\n\\n\r\nHakua Shidome. A 14-year-old loli has \u2019Savant Syndrome \u2018. For Kimito, she\u2019s like his little sister.\\n\\n\r\nKaren Jinryou: A strange student who loves katana and always wants for challenging. She\u2019s definitely one of the strangest students in the academy. Also her suddenly appearance makes me confuse. \\n\\n\r\nEri Hanae: Kimito\u2019s childhood friend.\\n\r\nMost of their pasts are still unknown which is very interesting to find out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow talk about the art. Well, it\u2019s not too good or you can say it\u2019s just average. Even though I can\u2019t deny the fact that ecchi scenes have a good quality, the character designs aren\u2019t fit too well to their characteristics, and the details, structures might be better if Silver Link focused on.  Luckily, it doesn\u2019t affect too much to the series which has hundreds cute girls cover your eyes.\\n\r\nI just saw manga\u2019s and LN\u2019s posters and claimed that their art styles are really different to each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComedy, ecchi and slice of life combination is always fun and relax to watch and Shomin Sample isn\u2019t an exception. There are many missing pieces in this series that I want to find out, so it still has a lot of potential. I am also curious about what will happen after that open ending so that if Kimito and his muscle buddies showed up for ss2, it would be fascinating.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll try to be helpful with this one.\r\nThis is a harem comedy with some Haganai vibes. I recommend the dubbed version because it's hilarious (in a good way). I'd put it on par with the dub of D-Frag! as far as harem comedies go.\r\nStory:\r\nA boy is enrolled at an all-girls academy for extremely rich and refined high school students. It's out in the boonies and is kept secret from the public, so you know these chicks are as isolated and sheltered as Tarzan--except instead of being unfamiliar with the civilized world, they're strangers to the life of the \"commoner.\" The MC is one such commoner.He's introduced to the academy as an experiment and is allowed to stay, provided that he pretends he's into dudes (which is more of a running joke than a plot point) and manly muscles (even though he's a thigh-man). He makes a club that does random stuff. You know, your typical harem affair.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be up-front with this, since I believe it's not a spoiler: this show ends without a winner, meaning no one girl definitively ends up with the protagonist. In other words, it has a \"go-read-the-LN\" sort of open ending. If that's not an immediate turnoff, I'm sure you'll enjoy the comedic banter the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is passable. There's some ecchi with an ass-man bias, but I managed to ignore that aspect for the most part. But hey, if you're into impossible wedgie outlines in every uniform, more power to 'ya.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis animu has music. The track wasn't uniquely stylistic like Kill la Kill or No Game No Life, and no songs particularly stuck out like \"Lost My Pieces\" from Toradora! or \"You Say Run\" from MHA. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFor a harem protagonist, the MC is a pretty cool dude, but not in a badass sort of way. He's just a funny guy who acts like a normal person would if thrust into a 2D world. You've also got your four heroines: a spunky/socially-awkward best friend type (AKA, \"best girl\"), the perfect popular one, the loli kuudere genius, and the katana-wielding samurai who tries to be badass but is easily flustered and loves cute things. There is also a sadistic maid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you've already watched all the good stuff and you're looking for more, I say give this show a shot. It's a nice way to pass the time.\\n",

I do not buy expensive clothes. I do not own exquisite pieces of art. I do not seek out caviar taste-tasting parties.\r\nThe fanciest I have ever been treated is at Disney. More specifically, the Disney cruise. Like any cruise, the ocean, the boat, and the activities are abundant. However, whatseparates a Disney cruise from most other cruises are the unique restaurants they contain. But the restaurants were not the best part.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part was that each family got not one but two personal waiters or waitresses. I sadly cannot remember their names, but they were jovial and kind, waiting on our beck and call for food, drink, and anything else we needed. For just a few days, my family and I were not treated as guests \u2013 we were treated as royalty. At dinner anyways.\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample (shortening the title because the official title is a little absurd), does not have waiters and waitresses, but it does have maids. A lot of maids. But still not enough maids to clean up what this one offered.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample takes a look at a rather interesting situation. Kimito, a boy, or more commonly called a commoner, is thrust into an all-girls school. But this is not one\u2019s run-of-the-mill all-girls school. This all-girls school contains girls of the upper-upper class. The rich beyond words. The classy.\\n\\n\r\nThis dichotomy between common and class gives the anime its comedic edge. Having these girls, who are so na\u00efve of the normal world outside of their exorbitant bubble, creates one funny episode after another. One episode has them visiting a replicated, commoner city. Another episode has them learning about a popular gesture. Another still has them discovering the \u201creliability\u201d of horoscopes.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the dichotomy, Shomin Sample introduces a harem element. Karen, Reiko, Aika, and Hakua each fall for the thigh-loving boy in their own way, but there are three main problems with the approach.\\n\\n\r\nOne, the anime does not give equal proportion to the whole cast. Karen and Hakua in particular are not given the same amount of time. They have scenes and even half of episodes dedicated to them, but whole episodes and arcs are reserved for Aika and Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the harem element does not serve much of a purpose. Nothing ever comes of the relationships between Kimito and the girls, and, when it does, the anime makes a point to regress it.\\n\\n\r\nThree, the harem element arguably conflicts with the main motif. The anime is (mainly) about what common people do, what classy people do, and how these two camps coincide. Common people usually do not have multiple suitors, settling with one man or one woman \u2018till death do they part. And while classy people may have the money to have multiple partners, as Reiko\u2019s arc shows, classy people likewise settle with one man or woman (and through arranged marriages no less).\\n\\n\r\nThe sexualized nature of the anime can also be called into question. Mostly because it is rather pointless. Having both Reiko and Aika in nothing but their bra and underwear, wrestling on Kimito\u2019s bed, does not help the narrative all that much. Arguably, though, the girls \u201clowering\u201d themselves to such levels matches the commoner versus class motif.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime includes this weird side plot. Eri, Kimito\u2019s female childhood friend, is shown quite sparingly throughout the season, wondering where her friend has disappeared to. Like the sexual content, it\u2019s pointless, but it may be unfair to criticize it given that her plotline did nothing whatsoever. Still, they do allude to it, indicating some modicum of importance, importance that is not present.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the comedy, the harem, and the random plotlines, Shomin Sample has a more dramatic side when it so chooses, drama that does not lend itself to a grander message. There may be something to be said about common folk and classy people \u2013 that the two sides can be together despite their financial and societal differences. But the show does not explore this route until the end when it tries to tie together every single episode in a few lines of dialogue. I.e., shallow exploration. Instead, Shomin Sample remains content with the muscle-men comedy and the up-skirt ecchi-ness.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this is a misstep since the anime wanted to be nothing more than this. However, having drama that goes mostly nowhere does mostly nothing for the show.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample\u2019s art treads into difficult territory more so than it may wish to.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the character designs are cute or attractive in their own right. Reiko and Karen have ample figures, Aika\u2019s orange hair matches her fiery, bubbly personality, and Hakua is an adorable-looking kid. The characters have an odd sheen to them, and they regularly stick to their black-and-white, plain school outfits, but, as harem members, they class it up well enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt is everything else that sours the experience. The rest of the art tends to be bland due to the same locations shown over and over \u2013 namely, Kimito\u2019s room and the surrounding grounds of the school. The anime does try to diversify its art through comedic representations, like with funny faces and imaginative depictions, but, for the most part, the art is not that impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode, in fact, earns a special negative shout-out. It gets quite rough: Some wonky drawings and even missing animation make the final stretch disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of animation, the animation overall sticks more on the low end. Action sequences are not prevalent (and they are not expected to be), but even the everyday happenings like dressing up as maids or playing a dance-centric video game do not have the characters moving all that much.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, as an aside, there is a sneaky picture of a dude giving two peace signs in the moon depicted in the OP. He\u2019s upside down and faded, blending in with the craters and colors. Perhaps he is related to the standup comedian they emulate. Probably pointless, but it was at least worth pointing out.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Shomin Sample are a mixed bag, but, ultimately, they are financially unstable.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it is best to start with the best: Reiko. Reiko is perfect beyond words: She is unbelievably kind, articulate in action, and a beauty to boot. Naturally, she falls in love with Kimito, wanting nothing less than to take his hand in marriage. Her time in the club and, more specifically, around Aika reveals that she may not be as perfect as one is led to believe. She has difficulty grasping commoner topics, and she (initially) despises Aika and Aika\u2019s behavior. And, for a time, this is all that is given of Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until the final few episodes that more to her character appears. Forced into an arranged marriage, she finds herself not wanting to follow the tradition of her household. Instead, she desperately wants to be with Kimito and her best friends \u2013 Aika included. After they come to her rescue, Reiko demonstrates courage in standing up for what she wants, proving that, however slightly, her character has changed for the better.\\n\\n\r\nAika comes next. Aika is initially shown to be quite shy. Seemingly ostracized from the rest of the school, she finds it difficult interacting with anyone due to her accent and due to her accidentally (and constantly) blurting out what isreally on her mind. Thankfully, Kimito arrives, giving her the opportunity to form the \u201cCommoner\u2019s Club\u201d and the chance to finally attain the social life she has always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nTo get to that point takes several episodes filled with foregone chances and comedic asides, but, eventually, Aika finds comfort in friendship from the other students. This friendship almost immediately gets revoked, however, calling into question the point of her conflict to begin with. At the minimum, her time in the club provided her with everlasting friends and a social life that is a sure step up from where it was before.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the rest of the cast sharply falls off in terms of strength. The other two main female protagonists \u2013 Karen and Hakua \u2013 miss out on the character investigation that Reiko and Aika received before them. Their characteristics are more than made known. Karen\u2019s swordplay is unrivaled, but her willpower is weak. Hakua\u2019s genius literally causes her to strip naked, and she has quite the adorable crush on Kimito. But as relatable people, ascharacters, they more than fall short.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for Miyuki, Kimito\u2019s personal maid at the school. She is oddly passive-aggressive towards Kimito, yet her true feelings for him are apparent when the secret of her \u201cI wish you had never woken up\u201d mantra is made known.\\n\\n\r\nBut, again, very little else about her character is given. Their past connection is not shown. The reason for her actions and feelings is not shown. Even something as simple as having her interact with the other cast members is not shown.\\n\\n\r\nYet the worst character in Shomin Sample is undoubtedly Kimito. Now, yes, Kimito is designed as more or less a self-insert male lead. He is nice, he is plain (impressive relative to the school and the students), and he is followed by a harem of pretty girls. I.e., Kimito is a rather bland character. But these traits are somewhat expected given the harem, ecchi, and comedy genres that the anime steeps itself in. So his traits are not so much negatives as they are acceptances.\\n\\n\r\nNo, what makes Kimito the worst character is something that he never gets. To reiterate from earlier, the main motif of the anime is the common versus the classy. And, for the most part, the classy people learn a lot through the commoner Kimito. But the opposite, that Kimito learns a lot through the classy Aika, Reiko, Karen, and Hakua, is almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls learn and grow and change as a result of Kimito\u2019s arrival and subsequent help, but it almost never seems as if Kimito takes advantage of the same chances. Arguably, the events are designed not for him but for everyone else, but, by failing to reciprocate Kimito for what he did for all of them, his character consequently fails to make his experience a worthwhile one.\\n\\n\r\nHe even gets in the way of the main theme of the cast: the tried-and-true importance of friendship. As has been said, Reiko and Aika both better themselves through the friends they find. Karen and Hakua, despite not having their own exploration, are no longer lonely (due to, arguably, personal estrangement) because of the friends they make.\\n\\n\r\nFor Kimito, friendship is usually on his mind. After all, he did not aid Aika, fight for Reiko, and put up with Karen and Hakua for the fun of it. He did it because he considers them his friends. Then what is the problem?\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that friendship, while a staple part of his character, does not affect his character. He did not seem to have trouble making friends. (\u201cDid not seem\u201d because his past life is almost never shown.) He never has any conflict that requires the girls, his friends, to help him out. And although he sets up the opportunities for friendship for Reiko, Aika, and the others, he rarely explores the concept of friendship \u2013 what friendship is, how friendship is obtained, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAs has been mentioned, Shomin Sample likes its comedy and its sex, so it not having deeply explored themes is not necessarily an issue. Still, when it tries to push one but cannot even get its main character involved, the theme falls flat. Combined with the problems with the other characters, it is easy to see just how much in debt they end up being.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound-work of Shomin Sample is arguably the anime\u2019s best trait.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is surprisingly silly, relying on onomatopoeia for many of its parts as well as strange sound-effects. The upbeat tone and the fast-paced nature of the piece continue the silliness. It also helps that the piece includes multiple vocalists, symbolizing the group of four girls. While the OP is not superb, it is a fun little song that fitsShomin Sample nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track slows down the tempo slightly when compared to the OP. It also ditches the multiple vocalists in favor of a single one \u2013 the childhood idol friend. It is still a happy song and is a pretty catchy one, too. But the ED is not particularly unique enough or emotional enough to make it into a piece worth remembering.\\n\\n\r\nEven more forgettable is the original soundtrack. One piece includes a serene, floaty composition filled with pianos and pipes. One piece is backed by a choir to accompany Kimito\u2019s fantasies. And another is more triumphant in tone. Most of the pieces have an air of class to them. As though they would be played in a tranquil garden or at some ritzy auditorium. Hence, they may be forgettable, but they are quite fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\n(As an aside, the water-droplet sound-effect that accompanies some of the steamier moments made those moments that much funnier.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting performances, they are generally above average in quality. Rika Tachibana as Reiko drips her words in refinement. Yuu Serizawa as Aika gives the peppy girl a thick accent wrapped in happiness galore. And Yuuki Kuwahara as Hakua whispers her way to cuteness. Chitose Morinaga as Karen and Saori Oonishi as Miyuki deserve shout-outs for their oft weird and intimidating voices, respectively. And for Ms. Tachibana and Ms. Morinaga, these roles are their first major roles, earning them even further accolades for a job more than well-done.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the problems the anime may have, I quite liked this one.\\n\\n\r\nIt achieves the rare feat in a harem: Each girl is likable. Karen is easily my favorite of the bunch. She is hilarious in mannerisms, attractive in her actions, and crazy in her sword skills. Karen is followed closely by Reiko and Miyuki. (Miyuki may not count as a member of the harem at this point because of her lack of screen presence, but still.) Reiko\u2019s constant romance angle made me overjoyed and Miyuki\u2019s horrible attitude towards Kimito, while undoubtedly rude, never failed to make me smile. And the ecchi content helped to make Karen, Reiko, and Miyuki that much more attractive.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the other half of the cast. Hakua is adorable. Whenever she grabbed onto Kimito\u2019s sleeve with her tiny hand, I let out an audible \u201cAww!\u201d Then when she got upset and very lightly punched Kimito, I just had to \u201cAwwww!\u201d even longer and louder. However, I was not a fan of the slight sexualizing of her. She is already a cute and fun character; she is also a child. So when the anime gave her a naked running joke, I frowned and shook my head at the unnecessary inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAika and Kimito were funny in their own right as well \u2013 Kimito less so than the girls, but he still had his moments. Aika\u2019s genuine efforts, Kimito\u2019s \u201cYou got me mad now!\u201d joke, and their silly interactions together added that much more to the hilarity. And when they were all together, the anime had no trouble getting as many laughs out of me as it could.\\n\\n\r\nOre ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \u201cShomin Sample\u201d Toshite Gets\u2665Sareta Ken has a lot of shortcomings. Its art is weak, its story is weaker, and its characters are weakest. Still, parts of the sound are composed well, and the anime makes it difficult to doubt just how funny it is. Be it served by maids or waiters, this anime ends up as quite the mixed dish.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, commoner versus class motif creates comedy, but the pointless harem, the distracting sex and plotlines, and the improper handling of its common-and-class theme shrinks the narrative\u2019s strength\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, nice character designs, bland artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Reiko and Aika are mediocre characters, Karen, Hakua, and Miyuki needed more, and Kimito ruins the whole experience\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, fun characters, hilarious moments, but Hakua\u2019s naked running joke was unnecessary\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Gets\u2665Sareta Ken anime is an anime about a protagonist who gets dragged into a world of rich and high class ladies who doesn't know how the outside world operates. In a world like this the main character Kagurazaka Kimito is dragged into their life to be their sample to learn the ways of the common people. However, I found that this anime is a little different from the usual hentai Ecchi, Harem, Romance or School anime we have seen so far.\r\nStory : 7 - This story is quite interesting and unlike the usual harem animes. In theusual Harem genre the settings are in a way that the MC gains the love/ attention through by showing their strength or by being intelligent or sometimes by having a tragic past. Meaning the MC is pretty irregular/abnormal. However in the Shomin Sample the MC gains their love/attention by showing how normal he is. The MC is a type of character that wants to help a 'maiden in trouble', in which he spends time with each girl, help them out and solves their problems to the most of his best. This type of character and story makes the Shomin Sample a bit different and interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9 - One of the great points of the show. The art is very good , but is by no means perfect. Character designs and coloring while greatly generic, are done well enough to make them eye catching and lovable. the background and scenery is breathtaking and very appealing. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8 - Very fitting for the anime specially the OP. It gives off a feeling of a feeling of a ridiculously funny but charming when I watched it. Specially I loved the part that shows the Kimito (MC)'s distress of being mistaken for musculophilia/a man who prefers muscles ( \u012c ^ \u012c ). And the ED is very appealing specially with the crayon painted art. So, the sound gives off the perfect feeling of what kind of anime it is. \uff08\uff3e\uff56\uff3e\uff09\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7 - 'Shomin Sample' is different from the ususal 'harem' animes. THis is pretty much a shock to the cultural view of the anime. The MC is pretty normal for one thing. He never tries to act cool and different from the usual. And that is one of his best points. It gives off a feeling that this is good , this is what is normal. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girl in this pretty abnormal, their pure views about things can be some times anoyying but most of them becomes funny and amusing. The characters shows what it would be like if such girls were raised in a close environment and taught to be a first class lady. For people not used to standard characters types in anime the characters will come of as a new type. 'Tsun-pure' which could be hard to swallow at first but it becomes normal after sometime. \uff08\u2312\u25bd\u2312\uff09\\n\\n\r\nThe MC becomes accustomed to the term 'expect the unexpected' in the very differrent cultural world. So without thinking of them as 'annoyingly-overreact' with everything. The MC finds to come in terms with it and grows accustomed to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9 - What I enjoy the most about 'Shomin Sample' is the great comedy. By watching this anime you will come to realize that bu having characters completely out of touch frm the real world is very interesting. For example these high class ladies wow the first time they see the MC use his cell phone or the time he ate ramen. And what I enjoyed was the the various intresting interactions between Kimito and other Main Female Characters. Shomin Sample may be labeled as a Harem but honestly there are times I don't feel like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8 - The idea is great and it is very charming. But It has its own great points and bad points but overall it is a one of the best harem of this fall 2015. So I recommend that you watch this anime. Specially, I recommend to the simple minided anime fans. And the fanatic Harem lovers this is a must watch. Hope you like it. (^\u222a^)",

            "content": "Harem is a genre that is widely known to be quite stale in comparison to a lot of other ones.  With the concept of one gender being surrounded by members of the opposite sex being the main focal point of the series, it becomes rather difficult to create something that is unique to the majority of the other hordes of shows that share the same tags.  As such, we have Shomin Sample, a series that...actually is rather unique in the grand scheme of harem, oddly enough.\r\nStory: Kagurazaka Kimito is your average everyday Japanese high school student in the big city.  As luckwould have it for any member of the male human species in a show like this, his world is turned upside-down when he is suddenly kidnapped, taken away by some really burly men, to a place known as Seikain, a school filled with prestigious rich girls who know nothing about the outside world.  His job here?  To teach these innocent and clueless girls about the outside or 'commoner' world so they won't become NEETs while also masking the fact that he's straight, putting on the facade that he loves really, really muscular men.  Oh what a world...\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Shomin Sample already earns itself a couple of speciality points simply because its base plot is so ridiculous and out there.  However, the story that we witness here is repetitive at best.  Shomin Sample's structure is largely episodic, with each episode introducing the girls in the series to various aspects of the modern Japanese culture and society.  This includes things more cultural things such as Japanese memes and otaku culture, to simple tasks like ordering food at a restaurant or shopping for their own clothes.  (Yeah, these girls seriously don't know anything about how outside society works.)  This in turn separates the general harem story as it not only focuses on Kimito's relationship with the four girls of the series, but also on what the series's base plot is.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue that comes with this is pacing.  Every episode pretty much pulls one or two chapters from the Shomin Sample manga, and either really condenses certain chapters to fit what they want to fit, or, elongate what they want to show in order to fit the runtime.  This in turn creates some moments that first of all, were not part of the original source material, but were just...cringe to watch sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Shomin Sample has Kimito teach the girls various Japanese memes and aspects of otaku culture.  (Mostly the simple stuff like anime, manga, and maid cafes.)  As such, the series doesn't inherently click or seem funny with a western audience simply because people outside of Japan just don't know what some of these things are.  In addition, the show uses a lot of retorts and some perverted comedy in order to convey other parts of comedy.  Most importantly though, the perverted comedy.  Ever seen a character go on and on and on and on about his fetish?  Well, if you haven't, Kimito expresses that kind of character perfectly.  As a man who loves thighs, a common gag with the series is the fact that he LOVES thighs.  And I mean LOVES thighs.  To the point that the show spends quite a lot of time on his monologues on the beauty of each female character's legs.  (They're still too short if you ask me.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shomin Sample's real problem was its pacing issues.  As a result of those issues, the show was added in original material that to me didn't really make sense (and was rather cringe to watch), and ended in a place that was rather odd and kind of shoehorned in.  It was part of the original series, mind you, but it just didn't make sense as a proper ending, like Silver Link expected everything to fall in place at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique and great base story plot\\n\r\n+/- Unique brand of humor  (As always, comedy is subjective.)\\n\r\n-  Lots and lots of pacing issues\\n\r\n-  Weird and somewhat open feeling end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Kagurazaka Kimito is the main protagonist of Shomin Sample.  As a man who loves nothing else but to feel and appreciate the female thighs, Kimito serves as the \"Shomin\" (Commoner) of the series.  Usually the instigator in most of the series's plot, Kimito as a character gives me severe...botheration.  The reason for this is because he doesn't feel all that different from a normal harem protag.  (Even though he SHOULD be.)  He still possesses the nice quality like every harem protagonist, and he's unique in the sense that he has the thigh fetish and loves to troll Aika to the extent of accepting his divine punishment, but he feels too...plain still.  (I'll get to why I think that later.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the harem girls, we have Reiko, Aika, Hakua, and Karen. \\n\\n\r\nReiko, is the elegant Oujo-sama who is kind and popular amongst everyone, while also harboring a crush on Kimito so large that she has decided who her lifetime partner will be.  \\n\\n\r\nAika, is the opposite, being a more tomboyish girl who seems nothing like a rich girl and tries to be popular, but fails because she thinks people don't like her.  Known as 'tsunpure' for being a bit of a tsun and failing for every trick in the book.\\n\\n\r\nHakua is the loli character of the group, being younger (and tinier) than everyone and also possessing an IQ so large that huge corporations need a 14 year old girl in order to manage their finances.  Likes to sit on Kimito's lap.\\n\\n\r\nKaren is the bushido girl of the group, being the one girl in the entire school who wields a katana at her side.  Has a pension for cute things to the point of possibly being called a pedophile on account of her drool and heavy breathing.  (Likes to call things 'pointless.')\\n\\n\r\nAs a cast of females, Shomin Sample is quite an interesting group.  However, as the series goes along, they don't really change, and there's really nothing significant about them in that sense.  They are unique enough to separate themselves from other harem females of years past, so that is something worth noting.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are rather minuscule in terms of importance, mainly because they either show up a small amount or add in very little to the story.  The only other character worth mentioning is the head maid, Miyuki, who pretty much in the anime is meant to threaten castration onto Kimito in order to prompt him to like musclemen.  (Of which they use somewhat excessively.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique characters\\n\r\n-  No character development\\n\r\n-  Side characters aren't really all that important\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art...oh my god, Silver Link, why...  The art for Shomin Sample is something of a monstrosity in my opinion.  Compared to a lot of shows these days, Shomin Sample has a lot of inconsistencies and design changes that really make the show look less than average.\\n\\n\r\nFor on thing, the show has a color palette that's just bright without really much depth or color detail to it since everything is rather one note.  Aside from that, the characters really bother me.  Not only is Kimito lacking his sharper look and has been turned into more of a moe character, but there are a fair amount of noticeable inconsistencies with the show has.  Things like one eye drawn differently from the other and little things like that really made the show a little bit harder to watch as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Below average art \\n\r\n-  Inconsistencies.  (Come on now, Silver Link.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP and ED for Shomin sample, are songs that to me...really don't fit the show or what the series is about.  Both of them are rather generic in terms of sound as they're just ordinary moe songs and I don't really see much memorability to them.  (Plus, their visuals are just what in the world are you thinking, Silver Link?)\\n\\n\r\nThe one track that I do say is even remotely worth listening to in the grand scheme of this show is the one that they played in the PV of this series.  They use it in the show sometimes and for me, it fits and works with the whole rich girl school since it gives a more royal feel, like those of high society.  I just wish it was used more because it's the only thing I felt fit.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  That one track I mentioned above\\n\r\n-   Average OST otherwise\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Alright, I got a bone to pick with Silver Link.  Shomin Sample is by far one of my favorite series to read.  And so, with seeing an adaptation, I was excited.  Then...I watched the first episode, and then it all went downhill from there....\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nIt had qualities of Shomin Sample in there, so it was tolerable.  But saying that I fully liked this adaptation?  That's...a bit of a stretch\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?  (Warning, rant incoming.)\\n\\n\r\nAlright, this adaptation is an abomination towards the Shomin Sample series.  Reason being is being Kimito, as a character, does not fluster with any of the situations that he's put in.  He felt far too normal and standard of a harem MC, and as such, really didn't feel like the sharp witted character that he was supposed to be.  Another is the fact that the entire story was just thrown together.  The entire plotline was a mishmash of what happens in the series all blended together, adding in a couple scenes that were just cringe to watch.  And don't get me started on the art for this one.  The production quality for this show is awful.  Out of the three shows that Silver Link decided to produce this season, this is the one that they left out the door to rot in terms of animation quality.  If it wasn't clear, I don't like this adaptation.  At...all.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't read any part of the Shomin Sample series, but you still want to experience what it is about, then go ahead and watch this.  But if you are like me and know about what happens in the series to some extent, then I would suggest no.  It's a unique blend of comedy with a different setting and really stands out in that regard.  However, on account of its pacing issues and Silver Link's creative liberty, there are some parts of it that are just really...really out there.",

After 125+ watched this was my first review just because I enjoyed how much it made me laugh and how much fun it was. Definitely give this a shot if you need something to watch.\r\nOf course the art was good as well as the sound. The OP was pretty nice and got really catchy. Had some kinda feel that I liked about it. Overall this deserves a good 8-9 in my book. Enjoyable series with a pretty funnyMC who likes to prank some of the other characters.",

            "content": "The premise of the show is a dime a dozen utterly forgettable plot, the porno equivalent of a handyman turning up on a helpless house wife's doorstep. It exists solely to drive the service of the show and is not realistic in the slightest. That being said, the show rather wisely chooses not to take itself seriously and even incorporates a meta in this respect which serves to \"lamp shade\" (a literary device used to bring attention to an issue or flaw and poke fun at it to acknowledge it and lesson its dissonance affect), raising its entertainment quality value above that of the averageharem. To clarify, one of the issues many harem shows have is that they rely solely on the service to sell its content and so the suspension of disbelief is unfortunately often loose at best because of a lack of effort in other areas like writing. This show whilst not putting in a *lot* of effort at least is written relatively intelligently.\\n\\n\r\nHarems are unfortunately what i consider to be entry level \"anime\" projects, easily exploited as a genre by either up and coming studios to make something that will easily sell and provide a footing for something more ambitious or just lazy studios with no ambition beyond making an easy buck. The result is that often the show's quality will be sub-par. As far as this show is concerned its art is actually not bad, in fact the background art is particularly passable, the animation itself is also respectable and the characters themselves quite pleasant in design.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the character designs are cookie cutter archetypes you've seen a thousand times before, the voice acting and (relatively) clever writing really brings them to life in a way you wont see in other shows of this type. You might even find yourself relating to one of them. This added to the overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nHarems are a guilty pleasure of mine, but i do like to think that i also have taste. I come from a creative background and so quality is still important to me. In this respect, as a harem watcher, this show will always be better than the sum of its parts because the important points come from its service and this show does provide a good and honest tease. Hence enjoyment will score better than the combination of the other criteria would suggest and i think this will be true for many people who consume this kind of content. But it's worth noting that the other areas don't suffer as much as they have been known to for this genre so in short, i would recommend this show to someone who consumes this kind of content, but perhaps not to someone who likes anime as a media in general and expect a bit more than panty shots and generally appealing to sexual fantasy.",

            "content": "This is one of those more guilty pleasure shows, it\u2019s got a ridiculous concept, but the genre is nothing new. It\u2019s another harem comedy genre, yet I found this to be quite entertaining, as it\u2019s one of those anime that is just fun to watch. (The Video Review is up on my Channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nShomin Sample story begins as our protagonist, Kimito Kagurazaka, an ordinary high school student, is kidnapped by man service and is brought and force to enrol in an all prestigious girl boarding school. But why do all this in the first place. The reason is because theschool is completely isolated from the outside world, in order to protect the innocence of the girls, however there is a problem in that, as the moment a student graduates from the school, they are unable to cope with the outside world, as they have been isolated from that. So Kimito is the \u2018Shomin Sample\u2019, Shomin meaning common. They chose him because they believe having a male commoner, will provide a gentle way to introduce the girls to the realities of the outside world. Also for the fact they chose him, because they thought he was gay, therefor didn\u2019t feel he was a threat to the girls.  \\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample episode structures are more broken into skit segments. There not really an overarching story, except for the first half when Kimito was trying to help one of the girls get popular, but after that, the cast of characters just go off and do various things with Kimito. However do find these skits to be rathe entertaining and a bit interesting at the same time. It\u2019s like a mixture of the slice of life activities that you see in other anime, but with the twist as Kimito, is the one teaching the girls how common things work, and this can sometimes lead to him trolling these girls. It\u2019s what you expect into typical moe show, it\u2019s not really that deep or all that special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazka is the main protagonist of the show and also the victim of the lucky harem situation he\u2019s been put in. Unfortunately for him, he has to play the gay guy, otherwise they snip something off of him. What sets him slightly apart from other harem protagonist, is that he is aware of the situation his in, and sometimes use it to his advantage to play pranks on the girls, by trolling them about the common outside world. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from being oblivious at times. Un fortunately as he just plays the role of a helper and observer to everyone else, he doesn\u2019t really have much development compared to the others.\\n\\n\r\nAika Tenkuubashi is one of the 4 main female protagonist part of the harem. Her aim to get popular, and she believes by being the most commoner out of all the girls in the school, she believes she can achieve that. And it\u2019s a really nice development we see from her, as she was outcast at first, but grows to hang out with the other girls soon after. \\n\\n\r\nReiko Arisugawa is the most prestigious role model girl in the school. She is one of the perfect examples of a girl who is completely adopted to the life style of a pure girl. And hence she is incompetent when trying to understand the commoners life. But she does try her best and probably gives the most effort trying to retain her most popular girl status at the school still. She does have a nice arc towards the end of the show, but other than that, not too much development.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the main girls is Hakua Shiodome. The loli of the group and quiet one, rarely showing any emotion. She is considered a genius, and actually isolated not only from commoners, but also the pure girls in the school, so she doesn\u2019t know any almost common sense, and she doesn\u2019t really show any signs of development, being the emotionless doll she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we finally get to best girl Karen Jinryou, who is a katana wielding awkward beautiful girl. Other than playing the awkward girl who just does entertaining things and taking things too seriously, she doesn\u2019t really have much character development, other than respecting Kimito over time, although she doesn\u2019t really do too much.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I love the characters and their interactions with one another. I can\u2019t really say that any of them get really that much development. Sure Aika and Reiko get some, but that\u2019s only during their respective character arcs, and they are kind of back seated during the other episodes. But it is the interactions between all these different personalities is what I love about the characters in general, even though they\u2019re not very deep, they do provide a good chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound 6/10, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a very moe show, the art style is rather cutesy. The character designs make every character look much smaller than their ages, even they\u2019re not really lolis. It\u2019s rather standard and simple for the most part even during the more intense scenes. The animation in general repeats itself a few times, but I guess that sort of understandable consider Silver Link did put out 3 anime during the season, and you can clearly see which one did put more effort in. Even the art style does look innocent, that doesn\u2019t stop it from giving us fan service, for both guys and girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not that great in general. Nothing at all really stands out, as they are just there to be put in the scenes. It fits the theme of being at prestigious school, so there is quite a bit of classical music to fill up the scenes. The opening theme is a really catchy song, and it has a nice tune and ring to it. The ending song is fine as well, although it doesn\u2019t have the most memorable tune to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI found this to be a rather enjoyable show, despite its simplicity. I liked the character and their interactions with each other. I like how Kimito trolls the other girls and I like how the girls react to situation they never been in. I also like the fact Kimito, goes along with most situations and can make some clich\u00e9 scenes even funnier. There is quite a few references in this show, if you are able to pick up on it. It is more one of those guilty pleasure shows, that just makes you laugh for a bit.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to end of the review, I give the story a 6. Even though there may not be much of an overall arching story, I do like how they take the concept and try to create situations for the characters to react differently in normal circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 6 and 5. The animation is not really that special in general, the cute art style fits the moe genre of the show, and I do like how they use bright colours a lot to make it slightly innocent. The sound even it fits, the scenes, it is very subtle, as you would not notice or hear it. The opening is nice and catchy and the ending, is alright for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I give them a 7. I like the different personalities of each character and their interactions with one another. I like how Kimito is a bit different to other protagonist and trolls the girls. They bring out most of the enjoyment into the show. There is not a lot of development in them, except for maybe Aika and Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it 8. I love some of the skits that were pulled off, I like how the girls react differently to a common situation, I thought it was smart with the comedy. I like how the main protagonist was not a complete dense idiot, but more like the situation he was forced in. The laughed quite a bit during this show, and it became one of my guilty pleasure shows, but there was some drama in the show, that I really felt nothing for.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Shomin Sample, after rounding it all up, I give it a 6.5/10. It\u2019s a harem show that uses its concept smartly for comedy. I recommend this show to those looking to kill time, or who like the harem comedy genre. It\u2019s not really a deep show, but it can make you laugh.",

            "content": "One day, a normal high school student named Kimito is randomly whisked to an unknown location by a bunch of macho men and told that he would now live and study at a new school.\r\nThe theme of a guy being transferred to an all girls school is nothing new anymore; we've seen it countless times in other shows such as Infinite Stratos, Unlimited Fafnir, Blade Dance of Elementalers, and Maken Ki. This show differentiates itself by focusing less on action and more on comedy, poking fun at cultural differences between the societal statuses and really abusing the viewers by repeatedly showing macho men and flashing\"gets\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a light, comedic harem for the season then this is one of the contenders. If you're looking for more action, you might want to jump over to one of the other many action-based harems of the season. As for me, it was decently entertaining though the story ended up a lot more open ended than I'd have like.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation style comes across as soft with light saturation and overly-blushed character cheeks. Backgrounds are often simple and usually blurred; expect fairly average production values in general. Silver Link may have gone a bit cheap overall with this work, the OP and ED sequences use mostly static images stitched together. The heroines are all easily distinguishable, though I kept thinking that Aika reminded me Inaho from Maken Ki. One small annoyance is that all the other girls at the school look way too similar to each other, granted they don't really play a part in the story. Another small annoyance is the drawing inconsistencies if you really pay attention to it. Expressions were fair overall, don't expect too much depth to the facial animations.\\n\\n\r\nThere is action only in the comedic sense as Karen swings her sword wildly causes massive collateral damage everywhere (though I have no idea who pays for it) but apparently doesn't cut people; this creates sort of a female version of DxD Issei's clothes shredder. There is a fair amount of ecchi with your expected onsen mishaps and accidental encounters. There's also a loli who repeatedly strips herself for no real good reason. Kimito does profess his love of the zettai ryouiki at least to the viewer but still gets embarrassed like most normal harem leads. In all, the ecchi isn't very heavy, especially given that the massive amount of macho guys kind of balances it out.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with a playful OP that grows addictive with each successive playing. The ED is more of a standard fare light rock piece. The BGM uses a lot of light orchestral and piano pieces, which fits with the high-class lady environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is really fresh, all the main heroines are relatively new. Likewise, this is the time I've seen Atsushi Tamaru as the lead protagonist. The performance was average overall. It is a pretty good series to watch if you want to practice listening to keigo though.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nKimito has no hope; his parents have literally sold him off to be a guinea pig at a school in an unknown location. If the school finds out that he isn't technically gay, then he loses his genitals. If he wants to leave the school, then he'll be under house arrest the rest of his life to protect the ridiculous secrecy of the school. Though maybe it's not that bad, he's surrounded by innocent, virgin daughters of immensely rich families that he could marry into and become a househusband or something. Given the uniqueness of his situation, he quickly becomes everyone's center of attention; everyone is curious about the amazing feats that \"commoners\" have to endure (like putting on their own clothes, using a mobile device, etc.). A particular outcast, Aika, approaches Kimito and creates the Commoner's Club so that she can learn the ways of the common folk and become popular too. Other girls soon join in and thus there's your harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is pretty light throughout with a quick introduction of harem members in sequence followed my many slice of life episodes where Kimito introduces some facet of a commoner's life. There is a bit of tension towards the last two episodes that follows a very predictable sequence and yields a very \"common\" conclusion. If you want an involved story, you're going to be a bit disappointed here. If you're looking for some decent romance beyond simple jealously cat fights, you'd do best to look elsewhere as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show follows a pretty safe pattern used by other shows and thus has cookie-cutter characters with some frosting. Aika is your standard playful and clumsy friend, who happens to be a bit aloof with others. Reiko is your perfect lady candidate with a competitive flair. Karen is your fighter tsundere who hides a love for overly cute things. And Hakua is the randomly stripping loli who happens to be a scientific genius. Oh, and Kimito's maid Miyuki who at least seems to despise him at all levels.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of character tension as, well, obviously the girls have no choice but to fall in love with him as there's no one else to choose. Relationships and characters in general feel static and, strangely, a lot of screen time is taken up by Miyuki and Eri who don't really contribute much to the central plot; perhaps they have larger roles if there's a sequel much like Anna in K?\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nShonin Sample is a fair entry to a crowded category. It isn't really standout in any way but isn't so bad that I'd drop watching it. There was a bit of wasted potential but, well, given the ridiculous nature of the setting I guess it isn't too much of a loss. The show has decent comedy and a lively group of characters but it lacks polish and really any defining characteristics. It's a lightweight comedic harem to tide you over till the next show.",

            "content": "Just what makes this show THE BEST ROM-COM OF THE FALL SEASON?\r\nPLOT\r\nMost generic harem animes have the same premise, especially the trope where the protagonist is the only male in the entire school. Though Shomin Sample has harem-esque tropes and cliches, it brings brand new things to the table. For example, how many harems have you seen where every girl in the show assumes the main protagonist is gay? How many harem shows have you seen where the Ojou-sama character lacks knowledge of anything \"commoner\" related? In this regard, Shomin Sample is just as innovative as it is naughty.\r\nI'm not going to pretend that itdoesn't exist: Shomin Sample is an ecchi anime. If you're planning on watching this show, expect panty shots, booty wiggling, booby jiggling, muscle men boners\\n\\n\r\nAnd dem good old THIGHS! If you like Zettai, this is a MUST WATCH for you. Disregard the entirety of this review and start watching the heck out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nHUMOR\\n\\n\r\nThe main type of humor that Shomin Sample prefers to use is where a person is unknowledgeable about certain objects that most should be expected to know. For example, give a starving African an iPhone. They'll most likely be amazed at what it is and when I say amazed I mean AMAZED. Of course, that'd be pretty funny, but it's morally wrong to laugh at starving Africans. However, since these are cute anime girls we're talking about, it's perfectly fine.\\n\\n\r\nThis humor is distributed in two ways by our main character, . He can either introduce something new to the masses, like an iPhone, or McDonalds; or he can be a total troll to orange-haired tsun-pure. In the situations that he's being mischevious, he tells Aika that performing a certain action will make her EXTREMELY popular, which is most definitely not the case. If that were true, then every single girl I've asked to \"Skip Netflix and just chill\" would've slept with me by now, but we don't see that happening, do we... DO WE!?!?!!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOh boy oh boy, it's time to talk about the best characters ever \ud83d\ude0e lets jump right into it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to introduce you guys to my bro, Kirito-I mean Kimito. Why is he a bro? Well, not only is he a complete troll, but he has a massive fetish for thighs and all things Zettai. Any character that acknowledges the beauty of kneesocks is alright with me.\\n\\n\r\nAika is Shomin Sample's \"Tsun-pure\". To give you guys an idea about what that exactly entails, a tsun-pure is a character trope introduced in Shomin Sample (hey, that anime sounds familiar) that has the personality of a Tsundere, but at the same time, cannot keep what she's thinking inside her head. Additionally, she'll believe anything that you're told. Props to Shomin Sample to bringing new ideas to the harem genre left and right.\\n\\n\r\nHakua is that one loli that was the main reason over half of the fanbase even watched the first 3 episodes of Shomin Sample. She has the personality of a shy 3-year-old and has a mind larger than Einstein. Other than being a loli and smart, her only quirk left that makes her interesting is  her tendency to take off her clothes when she has sudden... \"insights\"?\\n\\n\r\nArisugawa Reiko is the generic Ojou-sama character that you'd expect in an anime such as this. She has absolutely no other traits other than her big boobies.\\n\\n\r\nAND NOW ITS TIME TO COVER THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERS OF THE ENTIRE SHOW! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nKaren Fuyou is an \"elegant\" young woman with long flowing black hair who considers herself a swordmaster. Her skills with a sword are unmatched as well as her cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Karen so great, you ask? In the beginning of the show, she's objectified as a tomboyish character, similar to Shovel Knight in Gakkou Gurashi. However, later on, we discover that she has an unrivaled adoration for all things cuteand adorable. Sure, this is pretty kawaii, but the other girls still outmatch her. Well, it's time for her to get serious.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, folks. Karen has, by far, the best thighs of 2015. With Kimito having a massive love for zettai himself, the anime HAD to include a character with thick legs, and that character was Karen Fuyou!\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Karen's zettai power, Shomin Sample shows off just how cute and adorable she can be when she's in love. After the dressing room scene, Karen looks at Kimito in a new adoring way that causes her to blush and do the craziest things in order to try and win his love. These factors are what makes Karen the best girl of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying Karen on the Waifu ride is Miyuki Kujou, Kimito's personal maid. Now I'm not usually the type of person that likes Kuuderes and maid characters, but there's something about Miyuki that makes her so much better than any maid or Kuudere I've seen, and that's her personality. From episode 1, Shomin Sample shows off Miyuki's hatred and disgust for Kimito. This causes her to say the most hilarious lines, including threatening to cut off Kimito's manhood, wishing he'd died in his sleep, and even clicking her tounge in disgust at him. Oh did I also forget to mention those garterbelts!?!?\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\\n\r\nAll of you who watch Shomin Sample already know that they're a little bit odd with including a bunch of macho men into the opening. However, less of you may know about a scene with a glowstick inside a mans butt, in sighting homosexual tendencies. However, have you guys seen the upside down man in the moon? To be honest, I have no idea who the man is that's featured posing, but I have reason to believe that he's a director of sorts. If you guys have any knowledge about this man, please leave it in a comment below.\\n\\n\r\nObserving the opening more in depth, it's just an average song for a harem or comedy anime, beginning with the chorus, then a few lyrics followed by the bridge, which brings us to the chorus one final time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is worse than the opening in terms of average-ness and isn't even worth mentioning...\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike thousands of other viewers, I first began watching Shomin Sample because I was curious about the loli, Hakua. What would I expect to see from a character that looks like a toddler? Little did I know that I'd continue watching it because of the unsuspected comedy and the amazing antics of Karen and Miyuki. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that the ending was a bit anticlimactic and could've been a bit better. Because of this, I was left feeling as if I didn't receive enough of Shomin Sample, which is why I plan to start reading the manga, since I hear that Karen is much better there.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nIf the harem genre was a plate of raisin cookies, Shomin Sample would be that chocolate chip cookie you randomly pick up and savor each bite. It brings brand new original ideas in which they can call their own. Other harem series will try to use these tropes in which people will respond: OMG, they're copying Shomin Sample! \\n\\n\r\nHowever, though it's a great harem, it's still has its few raunchy moments in which watching with family members wouldn't be advised.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and did I forget to mention waifus? How about Zettai? I mentioned those a million times already? Ok\\n",

            "content": "In the second episode of this anime the main character's maid tries to undress him. He says no, but she insists, saying it's standard for maids at the school to dress their charges. At the beginning of the third episode, a maid is told that she has to obey particular rules to serve a new character. Chief among these being dressing her.\r\nYeah, they didn't bother to think the story through. It's cleary not the priority here, which is good because this anime has very little to offer in terms of story or characters. They're well worn archetypes that were included without much thought. No, themain thing this anime is trying to do is make you hard about the pelvis. And maybe make you laugh a bit too.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes it hard to review. Comedy and arousal are both very subjective areas where your milage may very. About all I can do is talk about whether it did it for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't. The jokes are cliche for the most part. I've seen them before and that takes away the surprise and the absurdity, the most important things to comedy. It makes this joke about the girls not recognizing something ordinary like soda or a cell phone all the time with no variation and it never becomes funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnd too many aspects of it creep me out for me to get hot and bothered by it. Like the character who looks like a little girl. \\n\\n\r\nBut whether it works for you or not, it probably won't stay with you. Definitely safe to pass. You could probably do better if you're looking for a harem or ecchi anime.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review for an anime on MAL, and I do it because this has to have been one of the worst, if not THE worst, anime I've ever had the displeasure of watching. I'm honestly not sure why I watched three full episodes before dropping it, but that alone was enough to give me a good idea of how terrible it is.\r\nFor those who want a short summary, here it is: The art is decent except when it's used to provide fan service in an attempt to obscure everything else that this anime shouldn't have but does, or shouldhave but doesn't. Everything else regarding this anime is appallingly bad. I would recommend you spare yourself the psychological trauma and avoid this at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nI'll now explain what I said. Be warned that there are spoilers in this section.\\n\\n\r\n1) All of the characters in this school are rich girls who were, judging by the fact that they know NOTHING of the outside world WHATSOEVER, raised there or in similar places from birth. They are provided with everything they want, and have personal maids to help them with literally anything. And yet, they don't act like spoiled brats--in fact, everything they say and do seems to be calculated (by the producers rather than the characters) to be \"perfect,\" to the point that it isn't even laughable; it's just pathetic.\\n\\n\r\n2) The school has seemingly infinite funds, but they don't provide the students with phones, access to any online resources whatsoever, or pretty much any other commodity largely regarded as a daily necessity in any time period after the 1600's.\\n\\n\r\n3) This is one of two particular things that annoy me more than the others, and it seems to be present in almost every romantic comedy wherein a poor/ish person comes into contact with a rich person for the first time: the cheap food, in this case a cup of instant ramen that probably cost about 30 cents, is immediately regarded as \"delicious\" or \"amazing\" by the rich people who have been eating nothing but the highest quality foods for their entire lives. In real life, such a person would gag, dry heave, and possibly vomit at such an unexpected disaster upon their palette. Instant ramen just isn't that good, especially compared to the food served by even a three-star restaurant, let alone a five-star one.\\n\\n\r\n4) The other thing that annoys me more than the other terrible aspects of the anime is this: Despite these girls having been raised in isolation from society and all male members of their species, they exhibit some behaviors that could ONLY stem from influences from those sources. For example, NONE of them act like they aren't completely straight, at least in the first three episodes (I'll explain this using a real life example: In ancient Sparta, the boys were taken and trained in near-isolation from women from the age of five up until they were married off to provide more children to the nation. And what happened? Most, if not all, of them were gay. I mean, seriously, if you're going to write a story where one gender is isolated from the other, try to make it at least a little bit realistic). When a female character walks into a room in which male character is trying to dress what appears to be a child, she attacks him and screams \"pervert\" rather than trying to understand the situation in the least (this influence could only have been from watching other anime with the same fatal flaw). When the female characters' clothes are removed by magic--and I'll get into that later--they panic because a MAN saw them.\\n\\n\r\n5) They immediately introduced fantasy and science fiction aspects into a slice of life romantic comedy. For example, one of the characters, at the age of fourteen, is at the forefront of EVERY scientific field, making \"groundbreaking\" contributions to EACH AND EVERY ONE. Mind you, this is at the school that has NO TECHNOLOGY and wherein none of the other characters had even seen so much as a flip-phone. Additionally, another character \"self-trained\" in pointless sword styles, among which was the ability to wave the sword around like an idiot and somehow remove the clothing of every character in a thirty meter radius.\\n\\n\r\nGiven this information, I hope anyone who reads this will think a second, third, and maybe fourth time about starting this anime. Keep in mind that all of these things occurred in the space of three episodes. Be prepared to suffer even more horrific failures if you watch more.",

            "content": "Shomin Sample is one of those rare ecchi harems which actually feels genuinely original and refreshing to watch. Not just because the setting is somewhat unusual, but also because its ecchi elements feel perfectly natural and that it's actually really funny. It's even got a likable harem protagonist for once, just how rare is that?\r\nThe idea of having a sheltered all-girls high school for rich young ladies and then letting a lone male student transfer into it is nothing new to the world of anime. But for the ladies to be completely and utterly clueless about how the world of ordinary citizens works, and forthem to have a misconception that the protagonist is actually gay and has a serious fetish for muscle men? Yeah I don't think that one has been done anywhere else before.\\n\\n\r\nThat is to say, our main character Kimito is one day kidnapped and forced to enroll in the school in order to help the female students to learn how to interact with not only a commoner, but also a person of the opposite gender for the first time. And I dare you, do *not* underestimate just how unbelievably ignorant these girls are about how the real world functions. In their eyes, ordering food at McDonald's is equivalent to the second coming of Jesus. That's how disconnected they are from reality in this series, and it's also the main source of the comedy that Shomin Sample has to offer. It's incredibly silly, but that's also what makes it so charming and original.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also emphasized a lot by the fact that Kimito is, in lack of a better phrasing, quite simply a huge troll. Since the girls are not only clueless but also about as gullible as it gets, he time and time again tricks them into learning things about commoners which are complete nonsense, and then watches them make fools out of themselves before springing the truth upon them a bit later on. It might be considered rude, but it's done in a very light-hearted and comedic fashion, and it rarely fails to make you laugh as a result.\\n\\n\r\nOf course seeing as this is a harem, the anime still hinges on the likability of the main heroines. There are primarily 5 of them in Shomin Sample. First we have Aika, the so-called \"Tsun-pure\" girl of the series. She is a loner who has a very hard time making friends with the other students, but desperately wants to be popular on the inside and she therefore asks Kimito to help her. She is also mind-bogglingly easy to trick as she believes literally anything Kimito tells her without a second thought. Secondly there's Reiko, one of the most respected ladies in the school and pretty much your stereotypical Ojou-sama character, albeit a lot less haughty. For what it's worth, she's probably the most generic and least interesting character of the show. Thirdly we have Karen, a beautiful black-haired woman who carries around a katana. More unexpectedly though is that on the inside... she's also a pretty hardcore lolicon of all things, which becomes very noticeable in the presence of the fourth girl: Hakua. She is the emotionless loli of the series who is supposedly 14 years old but looks quite a lot younger than that. She's also a genius who has her own laboratory in the school where she helps resolve serious issues in the fields of math, science and engineering. And fifth, there is the school's head maid: Miyuki. She is... also quite emotionless as far as her facial expression goes, but on the other hand the words coming out of her mouth are incredibly blunt and rude. Out of obligation she comes to wake Kimito up every morning, but instead of politely greeting him, her catchphrase would rather be \"I wish you had never woken up.\" There's also a sixth girl called Eri who is Kimito's childhood friend, but we don't get to see her too much in the anime as she is not a student in the school, however she works as a voice actress and you can see Kimito playing games starring her sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the character cast is a very mixed bag, but there ought to be someone for everyone in there at least. Personally I think Hakua is irresistibly cute, but Aika's gullibility and Karen's incorrigible behavior are certainly treats to see as well, and let's not even get started on Miyuki. That, and I also have to say that for a harem protagonist, Kimito really deserves an honorable mention here. He's honestly one of the better ones I've seen. He knows what he wants and he's not afraid to show it, he's not shy in any way when dealing with the girls, he's got a great sense of humor and he's just a very friendly person in general.\\n\\n\r\nNow it should be stated that at heart, Shomin Sample is primarily a comedy anime, and the ecchi elements are only secondary, not the other way around. That being said, there is still a decent amount of ecchi in it, and what it has is actually very tastefully executed. It's not just half-assedly slapped on as it is in so many other anime out there, but rather it generally stems from the characters' personalities. First of all, although the girls may incorrectly believe him to be a homosexual with a fetish for muscle men, the truth is that Kimito is most certainly hetero, and more so he actually has a pretty serious thigh fetish instead. He doesn't particularly care much for tits or asses; instead he's all about the legs. Many times throughout the series, we get to hear Kimito having an unbelievably rich and detailed internal monologue about just how and why the girls' legs in front of him are as beautiful as he believes them to be. Meanwhile, Hakua has the tendency to sometimes get flashes of inspiration which causes her to start writing down complex mathematical formulas all over the walls and the floor, and for some reason she also subconsciously starts stripping while she does so. This is also much to the joy of Karen who then really can't keep herself from panting like a dog in heat and having nosebleeds all over the floor as she greedily ogles Hakua's naked body. And there's plenty of eye candy starring the other girls as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value is... well probably the weakest part of this anime. Especially the animation, made by Silver Link, is quite clearly a very low-budget production. It looks pretty rough around the edges a lot of the time and it's not exactly pretty to look at. But at least it isn't straight-up ugly, and it doesn't really hamper the enjoyment of the comedy or ecchi scenes anyway. The soundtrack is about what you'd expect it to be, in other words barely noticeable. I like the OP quite a lot though, it's pretty catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat perplexes me the most is just how much lower rated this anime currently is compared to its own light novel and manga versions. I have not read the novel since it's not translated very far, but I have read the manga since quite a while ago, and honestly I don't think the anime is any worse at all. Apparently a lot of people seem to say otherwise but I personally don't see why at least.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, Shomin Sample was something I did not expect would ever get an anime adaptation just based on the fact that unorthodox ecchi series like this rarely do, but I'm so glad it did. Compared to the abundance of magic academy ecchi harems we normally get (this season included), Shomin Sample is better in just about every category to me. It's funny, it's cute, it's original and it doesn't feel forced at all. And for an anime of this type, that's about as much as you can ever ask for.\\n\\n\r\nGets!",

            "content": "On paper, this one looks like your typical harem series where the male protagonist enjoys (or doesn't) moments with the each of the girls. While I can't deny that this aspect did exist in this series, there was also something which felt a bit different. Lets get right into it, then. \r\n[STORY: 8/10]\r\nThe main concept of Shomin Sample isn't anything out of the ordinary. For those not new to this genre, I'm sure this isn't the first time you've seen a male protagonist somehow pulled into a situation where he ends up being the only male student in an all-girls school. While this set-up issimilar to some other series, it's the progression from that point onwards which I feel differentiates this series from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of heading towards the ecchi and overly fanservicey route, this series chooses to focus more on the development of the relationship between characters. The former route still exists here and there throughout, but the latter covers up that fact well. The episodes tend to be episodic, which the exception of a couple of them, yet we can clearly see how this group of one dude and four girls develop as a team and work together as a team, fighting for one another at times. A pity that this is just a one-cour series, which inevitably hastens that process. \\n\\n\r\n[ART: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nNot exactly the best, but still decent enough for you to find a best girl in it. The art style certainly fits a simple RomCom series like this, although arguably for those who are really picky about art there are times when the animation quality can be considered low. But overall, it's still on an acceptable scale for me, who is a sucker for series with bishoujo. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nReally catchy OP that may not sound so when you first hear it, and a good ED as well befitting of a series with multiple \"feel trips\" here and there. Fans of anime songs will probably enjoy these two. In addition, the background music played during the scenes itself are good, especially during emotional periods. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nLike aforementioned, the development of characters is what boosts the rating of this series up for me. None of the characters are perfect. They all have their own fair share of flaws and problems. This is what made them cute and likeable. Also, all four of the main girls have differing personalities and traits, so viewers will surely have a clear-cut decision on who is their best girl. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 8/10] \\n\r\nI didn't think I would, but I ended up really enjoying this from start to finish. The jokes they cracked got me good and the few references they made to some other series were hilarious. It was also heart-warming to see the characters interact with each other, helping one another in times of distress and, most of all, have fun with their daily activities for our viewing.  \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nGreat humour and unexpected feel trips. Shomin Sample is definitely one of the dark horses of this Fall 2015 season. A decent series to watch if you're looking for a simple, school, romantic comedy, slice-of-life series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've read till here, I thank you for giving me your time and wish you a MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR! :)",

            "content": "Execution is important when telling a story. An idea may sound good on paper, but when implemented, many things can and will go wrong. Sometimes, this is the fault of the talent or lack there-of putting it together, as there was too much going on and they had to cut it down. Other times, it was too vague and it goes someplace the creator didn't originally want it to go, or wasn't open to experimentation. Or it was just all slapped together, and/or relied on too much ass pulling and so it just falls apart. But then there are ideas that simply just don't work,and nothing, not even good talent, will save it unless it doesn't take itself seriously from the start\u2014but even that doesn't always work.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d exists. Creators rely on, perhaps even expect their audience to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show/book, because it's only for entertainment. In reality, it can only handle so much before it gets broken. For the most part, the story lays its rules out in such a manner that unless something very ridiculous happens that doesn't follow the rules as such, it's easy to roll with it. Universes are easy to create, they're just harder to keep it well-oiled and functioned without having to throw in a wrench to \u201cfind and fix\u201d a problem.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOre ga Ojousama Gakkou ni 'Shomin Sample' Toshite Gets-Sareta Ken\u201d, another light novel adaptation with such a ridiculously long title that it's shortened simply to \u201cShomin Sample\u201d, tries too hard to get its audience to just \u201croll with it\u201d. The synopsis already tells you what to expect, yet it just doesn't work because even in its own little universe, it doesn't work, and they acknowledge it's a failure. Newsflash: Being meta at the door is not enough to save your little harem from self-destruction.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Kimito Kagurazaka was just chilling in school one day when suddenly, militaristic muscle men nab him from the hallways, drag him into a limousine where they sexually fawn over him, and take him to a secluded prestige all-girls academy. The reason is because he was chosen to be a subject to help teach the girls more about the outside world, but he can only stay as a student if he was a raging homosexual with a muscle fetish. Since he wants to keep his penis intact, he has no choice but to roll with it, and he begins to develop a friendly relationship with the girls and correcting their misconceptions on the \u201ccommoner world\u201d, as they call it. At the same time, he attracts a few socially inept girls who becomes his harem on the side, but he is not allowed to romance them. And even then, would he really want to?\\n\\n\r\nHere's where my suspension of disbelief is thrown out the window from the first episode: the fact all of these girls don't know anything about the outside world, and they become shut-ins because of it. And here I thought I was a sheltered girl, but they all take the cake and eat it, too. Becoming shut-ins aside, how the hell do they even function in life? Are we to just assume that from the day of their birth they weren't allowed to leave their premises? I don't care that they're rich and they have maids waiting hand and foot to cater to their every little needs, they clearly are living in a messed up world where they don't know about other people\u2014I'm sorry, \u201ccommoners\u201d. Apparently, this was such a huge problem with their graduates that the administration had to bring in someone from the \u201coutside world\u201d to teach them. This is proof they are warped in the head, blinded by their own perfect little bubble where nothing bad happens to their perfect little angels, and the concept of boys and how they function as people are close to a thing of fiction. Just what the fuck were they expecting? \\n\\n\r\nIdiots.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's really no way one \u201ccommoner\u201d boy can tell all of these girls everything about the outside world unless he was to really go into politics and social cues (which he himself has to understand, but he's \u201cnormal\u201d, so apparently he does), because that's how the outside world works, ladies and gentlemen. It's not just about the kind of phone you own, or what clothes you wear, or what food you eat, it's about interaction with the people around you. I don't expect these girls to go out and find work when they're probably just going to be married off to wealthy businessmen, but they should still at least be able to go out in public and be normal, and make friends. If they can't even do that, which is what the school and parents are supposed to prepare them for, then they are failures because they were set up to be failures. And since there's only one of him, they can't all personally interact with him, and many of them don't.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what this school is? A gilded cage, plain and simple, it's just that at least they're getting some kind of education. It's probably why they haven't gone mad yet, but maybe that'd make for a more interesting harem to have a cast of loons. And speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: One of the issues (albeit it's an attraction) with the harem genre are its character archetypes, which is believed to have been set in stone by \u201cLove Hina\u201d. \u201cShomin Sample\u201d doesn't appear to have been inspired by it, but the female leads still show signs, just in a \u201cdifferent\u201d light. The saying \u201cOnce you've seen X, you've seen them all\u201d pretty much sums up the genre, and this is no exception to its characters. Character archetypes aren't bad on their own, mind you, it's when the characters are stagnant that it becomes a problem.\\n\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazaka has my sympathy for being forced into a school and become someone he's not. The raging homosexual with a muscle fetish they label him with? That was all a misinterpretation of his normal everyday life, because he was interacting more with his male peers than female peers\u2014even though he has a female childhood friend they personally interviewed. The school believed her lies, but they refused to take responsibility for their mistakes, let alone listen to what Kimito had to say in his attempts to correct them, and pretty much threatened him to cover it up. So now, he has to put up with all of these loony bins who have attached themselves to him all while hoping he'll still get to keep it in his pants or it'll get snipped. But unlike with other harem protagonists, his penis is honest-to-goodness in real peril to the point I'm shocked it hasn't shrunken into him, he's constantly on his toes.\\n\\n\r\nPenile peril and humiliation is grade-A comedy in romcoms, apparently.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'll have to give him some credit in that he's actually rather nice and helpful to the girls and doesn't ogle them\u2014usually; this is because he has a thigh fetish, so most of his ogling is focused on the thighs and going on monologues about them. Although it's generalization to label every harem protagonist as a pervert, it hasn't always been the case since they're typically thrust into a harem they didn't want. It's pretty clear Kimito respects them, and that he's managed to stay sane despite being watched like a hawk, however, he still has his perverse moments that he still ends up getting into on accident\u2014like every other harem protagonist. At the very least, he's not getting himself beat up for this, but his genitals still run for the hills each and every time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the roll call of your classic one-dimensional harem girls obliviously trying to get him castrated in the process of getting in his pants, politely. From sane to the less sane:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of personality, Reiko Arisugawa is the most normal of the harem girls, very ladylike and formal, but can't socially interact with a \u201ccommoner\u201d. It's a form of anxiety for her, although there's nothing that proves she improved since Kimito basically is always there to hold her hand. Then episode four happened, in which she went very much out-of-character, and became borderline yandere, if not clingy. It was very jarring, and I don't know if this is out-of-line or not, but she only acts like this around Aika and not with the other girls for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, Aika Tenkuubashi is introduced trying to force herself on Kimito because she was told by a classmate, and believed 100%, that kissing a commoner would make her dreams come true. Of course, she's also the odd one out, because she believes she doesn't fit in, even though she's not actively interacting with everyone despite others attempting to (or so they say). And yet, she wants to be popular when she won't talk to anyone, which is why she forced her Commoner Club upon Kimito. She's ditzy, loud-mouthed, and clingy, but not in a good way with her lack of social cues. Some girls do come forward wanting to be her friends, yet somehow, this gets reversed, so she remains stuck in square one.\\n\\n\r\nKujo Miyuki is Kimito's personal maid while he's a student, and although her mannerisms are as such, she clearly doesn't like him and is cold around him. She reminds him (more like calmly threatens with giant scissors) that if he puts so much as a toe out-of-line, he'll be castrated (or emasculated), and she'll most likely be the one doing the snipping. But of course, like all of the girls, she comes to love him, too, she's just more stoic about it.\\n\\n\r\nKaren Jinryou is the supposedly-Yamato Nadeshiko girl with tsundere tendencies who neurotically pulled a katana on him in her introduction. As to be expected from wildly swinging an actual sharp weapon around, after exposing him, herself, and all the girls in the sidelines, she gives herself to Kimito\u2014although nothing has come out of it. There's hidden depths of her wanting to be girly, but it goes nowhere. She immediately gave me bad \u201cLove Hina\u201d flashbacks, and she is the least-developed of the girls (which doesn't say much, since hardly anyone develops).\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the token loli character, Hakua Shiodome, except let's pull the rug out from under the feet of lolicons because\u2014gasp!\u2014she's actually fourteen. (So are loli-traps a thing, now?) Unless she just has really recessive genes or she was forced to stay a certain size for life (which is all sorts of messed up on its own especially because she can't even dress herself), I'm calling bullshit, because this character is clearly the size of an elementary school child, about six-to-seven years, maybe less. And apparently she's also a genius, even though she's in the exact same boat as every last one of these girls despite being locked away in a lab for most of her life. I can't tell if she's the metaphorical sultan of the group of students, or if the lab's a gilded cage in a gilded cage and she's just as cuckoo, if her stripping like a toddler every time she does equations is anything to go by.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: Silver Link at least is talented in this department, but as with all productions, the quality has taken a steady dip after the first episode with occasional spurts of energy here and there, like the dance sequence in episode two, Hakua's epiphany in episode three, and the so-totally-not-DDR sequence in episode six. It doesn't automatically mean the animation has become stilted, though, there's still fluidity in parts when it calls for it, reflecting the grace of being a lady. The colors have a pastel look to draw your eye to them, particularly in the hair, eyes, and panties, complimenting with the mo\u00e9 style. However, the only thing that really pops in this category is the opening, but that's only because it's on a sugar rush and has a few different stylistic choices going on throughout. The ending also deserves a little bit of mention for looking like a sketchbook, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: It's rather generic, to be frank. No voices stand out (although Aika's is a bit bothersome when shrilly, and Miyuki sounds collective at the least), no piece of score has left an impression lasting longer than the scene it's played in, there is nothing to be said here. Far as I can tell, it probably does fit the elegance of being prestige, but it's all blended in together that there's no way to really pick them apart. Same goes for the opening and ending, although the opening at the very least has something to it in being cute and light-hearted, but not enough for me to care outside of wondering what the hell I'm looking at during the opening. But damn it, I can't say it's not an earworm, albeit one I don't want. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: If it couldn't be gleaned from this review, then I'll come out and say I had not enjoyed this show, let alone have any care for it outside of my snarky comments here and there. While I have run into a few pleasant surprises, the harem genre is not for me, but it unfortunately is part of the package in some romance anime. If the characters weren't so chiseled out from their respective archetypes and more was done with them, then maybe I wouldn't have too much of a problem, but it'd still be another generic anime series that'll end up being forgotten except among the fans\u2014maybe. So it tries to at least stand out a bit from other harems by having a stupid, broken premise, but it became like every other harem anime almost immediately, it's just that Kimito is falsely accused of being gay. Clever. Bet that took the creator months to plan out rough drafts for.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hadn't been for the stupid premise and the fact it's animated by Silver Link, I'd have glossed over this one and not given it a second thought this season. It's clearly made for fans of the harem genre, and since they seem to come back to the same thing over and over again and don't bother caring about its story, I'm not going to take that enjoyment away from them. I'm just disappointed in how homogeneous the genre tends to be, in all honesty.\\n",

            "content": "Comedy is a term of subjectivity around the anime community, whatever you find it funny, for someone else could be found atrocious or boring, the same thing would go around for the vice versa tone. Also the comedy genre would be considered as something not to be taken seriously unless it really tries to do that (without consistency to know where to put the seriousness) to the point that it seems like it\u2019s making itself look like an train wreck (I am making this point just in case). In the idea, Shomin Sample may be a nice treat for a comedy fanatic, especially for thosethat are fans of the ecchi harem genre, but without tourneys or anything that goes like Rakudai or Asterisk, so don't worry. \\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind this review will solely be based on my perspective and idea of the anime, so anyone that feels like there\u2019s some sort of disagreement you can communicate with me and we can talk if you have any problem with the opinion. Everyone has a different opinion so understanding is the key point.\\n\\n\r\nWithout further, let\u2019s go to the Shomin Sample Review.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a concept where, these girls are in a high class academy, where they are more like damsels and polite civilians, however due to such academy the girls became closed from the outside world, where the \u201ccommoners\u201d (aka the outsiders), and in recent times, more graduates are failing to get into the modern society, so they decided to go upon and kidnap our main protagonist Kimito, a male student commoner, in order for him to show the young female girls about the modern world to become part of the place they all live upon.\\n\\n\r\nTo start things off, the concept is rather original and refreshing, unlike your other shows around, the show has an idea where its concept is mainly focused on the group of our main protagonist or also known as the \u201charem\u201d to learn about the modern world, and it does it pretty well to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nAs well with the show adding this idea of the main protagonist having to say that he\u2019s gay, and having muscle fetishes. I really think this type of idea has not been done before in an anime (unless I am wrong and someone shoots me at the head).\\n\\n\r\nEach Episode cooperates with the themes of the show by showing how the main protagonist helping these girls and at the same time showing them the stuff outside of the spectrum of the school. By adding these ideas the girls gets a solution and it\u2019s quite something to say the least. It just looks nice and it just feels different than your average school show.\\n\\n\r\nThis idea also helps with the comedy, as it works well with the show when they add these ideas of the modern world\u2019s usual life and the technology they use, also the amount of other things I can mention.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy can be considered as solid and on point with its themes and its setting, in fact; I will say this, the comedy is also ridiculous and at the same time laughable in a way for my eyes. But of course, the comedy part is subjective.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for the show is rather slow though to say the least, however it does help with the anime because the slow pacing helps the comedy and the themes execute them nicely without seeming to be dragged out for my eyes, it\u2019s a nice way to do the show for my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nFor the dialogue, well, I wouldn\u2019t say MUCH about the dialogue considering this is considered as a show that shouldn\u2019t be complex at all, so at the very least I will say the dialogue works with the setting they\u2019re in for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fanservice part I will say that the show does have fanservice, but for the most part it\u2019s concentrated on the thighs. If you are a thighs lover or rider, you will actually love this one since each or so episode does show thighs. \\n\\n\r\nI will say the show does a nice job in terms of the modern idea themes, ridiculous comedy (this is subjective), nice and original concept and a nice executed idea. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few departments where I really don't have to explain much (which is just usually absurd unless when it comes to bland characters).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this type of setting for the outside of the male cast, each said character has their own trait and personality (as in the main female cast of characters) and each said one of the cast of characters gets involved into ridiculous and also laughable situations.\\n\\n\r\nEach said female character has their different ways to become rather cute and likeable, and many would go and have a different taste on personalities so here you would have some for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nFor the main male protagonist I will say that he's one of those rare and unusual main protagonists though, it's really hard to explain which why he stands out on his own (terms of general main protagonist) but somehow his gags, and his moments through the anime makes him somewhat likeable and tolerable enough for me. Though this is coming from a rather personal view.\\n\\n\r\nI guess to say the characters are one fun of a ride to say the least because along with the story they help at least with the plot and its comedy moments, which all of them participating is like a nail in the cake.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the weak components of the anime series, being produced by Silver Link (by the same people that are behind the shows as Rakudai and Taimadou for the Fall season, and completed for example Kokoro Connect and Fate/kaleid) the budget for the show is quite a bit lacking. Not saying that this is bad, but it's not all that great either.\\n\\n\r\nFor example the production quality of the show is quite decent enough, although there are parts in the production quality where the faces aren't really well done, or to say the least not well produced, but it doesn't mean it equals as atrocious. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation it seems quite mediocre at the times, at some points they just concentrate on the budget on the thighs at most case, at times it looks nice as a standard moments, but at times it just seems rather lazy since a little bit of the parts seems rather inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nFor the backgrounds it seems rather fitting for the designs, as at the school setting backgrounds it looks quite light and alright. Not one of the best out there but it works for the designs at least.\\n\\n\r\nFor the character designs they look quite clean and pretty looking (I am saying this because I have no other words to say for description) at the same time the characters in the series at most stands out from your typical designs for the most part for these type of settings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Art/Animation department is essentially one part of the downs of the show. Yes, one of. There's more to it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few weakest components of the show, by far the weakest part. The music soundtrack would be considered as fitting for the scenarios, but quite unoticeable. That's because this could have been heard loads of times before from my eyes. It's kind of a mellow and soft instruments, not rough or anything there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the sound it's really mediocre. To say it's really not that BAD but it's not all that amazing either. So I will say this is at least passable at least it doesn't sound like a ground breaking ear screech.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Opening and Ending, the Opening seems rather catchy and at the same time ridiculously engaging for me. I've heard this 100 times around and for some reason I can't stop hearing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song however... not my type of music to say the least. It's not bad but it's not for my personal taste either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment standpoint of my review I will say I like the show because it's kind of like this. After one comedy show ends from today (Wednesday) I have another one to actually enjoy. It's pretty funny and ridiculous, some very cute characters that I really like, it doesn't seem to be dragged out at least.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of my enjoyment I would say, should I recommend this show? Well, sure I suppose. It's not for everyone, but if you want something to pass the time and enjoy yourself then you may have a nice time with this.\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this is a review for Shomin Sample. I'd like to start off by saying this was a splendid anime. I've read a few of the negative reviews, don't pay them any head. Do you like comedy? Do you like harems? If yes is the answer then give this show a watch. If the answer is no, then why are you here at all?\r\n    We begin our story with the male MC(Kimito Kagurazaka) being kidnapped and forcibly transferred to a new school. This new school is for wealthy young women to learn how to be brides. Hisrole is to teach these women about commoners and how to interact with males so when the girls graduate there isn't a large culture shock. Apparently some women have had a hard time adjusting and even became shut ins because of they couldn't adapt.\\n\\n\r\n    Now when see a guy going to an all girls school you may be a tad worried that its going to be terrible(that was what I thought too). However this anime does a splendid job of setting up the world so even though its unrealistic, we don't feel like its pandering to the \"Male Otaku\" image that people constantly try thrust onto every harem on the market. Of course I don't want to bash that image, I myself enjoy those shows but, I must admit that they do get tiring. This show was refreshing and a joy to watch. There isn't much in the way of story. The first half is dedicated to learning about the school and introducing the girls and some of their particular quirks and traits. The pacing is well done and I cant complain about the lack of story because the slice of life feel fits.\\n\\n\r\n    The second half of the show continues in much the same way as the first. Though they did throw in some unnecessary semi dramatic events at the end but it wasn't terrible. There is no completed romance, as is the standard of your typical harem. The show does a great job showing its worth in the comedy field. I was constantly smiling and laughing at the jokes and moments in the show. There are running jokes, parody skits, and small things that I find funny though that seems to depend on each person.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters are what makes a slice of life show and Shomin sample doesn't disappoint. We ultimately have a small cast of characters and even though we don't have any deep, intricate, or sad/destiny type characters we can still enjoy what we are given. The girls personalities come out clearly. Aika is \"tsun-pure\" she says whatever she is thinking and constantly worries about talking around people, thus she lacks friends. Reiko is the proper model of a rich young woman though seems to be easily swayed by thoughts of marriage and some naughty ideas. Karen is a self proclaimed swords woman who even though shows amazing powers with the sword is a complete klutz, and an over the top tsundere. Hakua is the loli character who is a quiet genius. Kimito is our male lead who is pretty much your standard protagonist but he is forced to take on the role of a homosexual man who enjoys muscles. Of course I wish they done more to expand on these characters and give us some more time to experience them. However the amount of screen time is well divided and we get to know the characters well enough I can tell you a bit about each one, again something I cant say about some anime.\\n\\n\r\n    The art is well done. The eyes in particular are noticeable however its pretty even among the other shows released this season. The music was catchy and fit the mood, voice acting was great as well. I really enjoyed Chitose Morinaga, who voiced Karen who was my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this show immensely and will be looking for a season 2. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these genres. For those of you worried about how much \"Ecchi\" is in the show, there is a some. but nothing as outrageous as shows like Maken ki or Highschool DxD. Comedy, semi decent mini stories, nice art, and a harem full of pretty girls. What else could we ask for?",

Gets!\r\nOverall: Good 7. Gets!\r\nFeliz Navidad everybody, so this anime has ended, so no more BS at let's GETS down to business.....Gets!\r\nStory (up).\r\nOk, I gave this anime's category its score since it was still the usual romcom/harem genre, and as usual it still involve one guy, in a club , with the usual set of  girls and everyday crazy antics that come with it. But, then again the anime's title plot did live up as to what was expected , it maybe the usual butoriginal creator Nanasuki Takafumi  did made some nice tweak in it , which would otherwise be just another harem based rom com anime. Gets!\\n\\n\r\nArt (up).\\n\\n\r\nTbh, the fanservice was the good part in this anime....well, at least the score is for the fanservice . But, set aside from it, it looks like Hakua's attire wasn't very much uniformed, at one point we see her wearing  a white blouse and black skirt,and in some occasion she's wearing what can be describe as the school's standard middle school uniform. But then again at least in this anime them girls' school uniform don't look like rompers from the manga, now I can't say if that's manga illustrator Uru Gekka's way of keeping the fanservice at bay, but here in the anime FUNnimation sure was brazen enough to go through the usual panty shot.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for both the opening and closing theme of this anime, cu'z I see both of which as a good fit for the anime, and frankly I don't give a shit about them VA's who did the character's voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nUsually in a harem the guy is either the strongest or the most obnoxious, thought the character's here can be describe as the usual , it is not always where there is a reversal were the guy is the normal one and it's them girls who were the obnoxious ones, so despite to the usual character roles and characteristics, the fact that such reversal was implemented was enough for me to give this category a high score, I say, Kimito's role really did play up in here as a commoner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really does deserve a 7 , since it maybe good, we can't deny that it was still a usual romcom/harem based anime, and that it still has to rely on the fanservice to sell, not enough for me to give it a higher score than 7, but not too much for me to rate it any lower, so, season 2?????? I don't see why not, GETS!\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas, essess, Gets! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nothing much to say. An anime with a guy who (is forced to) love muscles and men in a school full of girls?  Sounds good to me!\r\nEven though the plot is not too unique: a boy suddenly changes to a female school, Nanatsuki-sensei has expanded it: more situations, more secrets and in fact it adds more colors to this series, so don\u2019t dismiss this hastily. Let\u2019s read this review instead and take a few second to decide whether you want to spend time with it or not.  \r\nWhen people see something beautiful, attractive and very expensive compare to their normal stuff, notsurprising to know their feelings. But we are talking about the wealthy people\u2019s daughters who use its every day. Since they were born, they have lived in a prosperity life that separated them from outside world, no wonder they act awkwardly while contacting with commoner people.  That\u2019s why the value of a thing is relative.   \\n\\n\r\nShomin sample\u2019s context is about a school which teaches influential family\u2019s daughters only to guide them to the government. In this school, they have to learn like the way princesses had been taught long time ago. After realized that they had been struggle with communicating with normal people, the principal offers to add a male normal student as a \u2018commoner sample\u2019 to teach those girls everything about outside world except staining them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazaka: a man who kidnapped by the school under the assumption that he prefers men. He is to summarize \u2019average\u2018. \\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Kujou: A head maid and Kimito\u2019s personal maid. She\u2019s very cold and cruel toward Kimito.\\n\\n\r\nReiko Arisugawa: She\u2019s the monitor in Kimito\u2019s class. As one of the most influential member in school, Reiko usually acts like a princess .\\n\\n\r\nAika Tenkuubashi: A childish, tsun-pure girl who has great trouble socializing with the other girls in the academy, but she\u2019s very confident in front of Kimito.\\n\\n\r\nHakua Shidome. A 14-year-old loli has \u2019Savant Syndrome \u2018. For Kimito, she\u2019s like his little sister.\\n\\n\r\nKaren Jinryou: A strange student who loves katana and always wants for challenging. She\u2019s definitely one of the strangest students in the academy. Also her suddenly appearance makes me confuse. \\n\\n\r\nEri Hanae: Kimito\u2019s childhood friend.\\n\r\nMost of their pasts are still unknown which is very interesting to find out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow talk about the art. Well, it\u2019s not too good or you can say it\u2019s just average. Even though I can\u2019t deny the fact that ecchi scenes have a good quality, the character designs aren\u2019t fit too well to their characteristics, and the details, structures might be better if Silver Link focused on.  Luckily, it doesn\u2019t affect too much to the series which has hundreds cute girls cover your eyes.\\n\r\nI just saw manga\u2019s and LN\u2019s posters and claimed that their art styles are really different to each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComedy, ecchi and slice of life combination is always fun and relax to watch and Shomin Sample isn\u2019t an exception. There are many missing pieces in this series that I want to find out, so it still has a lot of potential. I am also curious about what will happen after that open ending so that if Kimito and his muscle buddies showed up for ss2, it would be fascinating.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll try to be helpful with this one.\r\nThis is a harem comedy with some Haganai vibes. I recommend the dubbed version because it's hilarious (in a good way). I'd put it on par with the dub of D-Frag! as far as harem comedies go.\r\nStory:\r\nA boy is enrolled at an all-girls academy for extremely rich and refined high school students. It's out in the boonies and is kept secret from the public, so you know these chicks are as isolated and sheltered as Tarzan--except instead of being unfamiliar with the civilized world, they're strangers to the life of the \"commoner.\" The MC is one such commoner.He's introduced to the academy as an experiment and is allowed to stay, provided that he pretends he's into dudes (which is more of a running joke than a plot point) and manly muscles (even though he's a thigh-man). He makes a club that does random stuff. You know, your typical harem affair.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be up-front with this, since I believe it's not a spoiler: this show ends without a winner, meaning no one girl definitively ends up with the protagonist. In other words, it has a \"go-read-the-LN\" sort of open ending. If that's not an immediate turnoff, I'm sure you'll enjoy the comedic banter the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is passable. There's some ecchi with an ass-man bias, but I managed to ignore that aspect for the most part. But hey, if you're into impossible wedgie outlines in every uniform, more power to 'ya.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis animu has music. The track wasn't uniquely stylistic like Kill la Kill or No Game No Life, and no songs particularly stuck out like \"Lost My Pieces\" from Toradora! or \"You Say Run\" from MHA. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFor a harem protagonist, the MC is a pretty cool dude, but not in a badass sort of way. He's just a funny guy who acts like a normal person would if thrust into a 2D world. You've also got your four heroines: a spunky/socially-awkward best friend type (AKA, \"best girl\"), the perfect popular one, the loli kuudere genius, and the katana-wielding samurai who tries to be badass but is easily flustered and loves cute things. There is also a sadistic maid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you've already watched all the good stuff and you're looking for more, I say give this show a shot. It's a nice way to pass the time.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nUnlike the girls of Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \u201cShomin Sample\u201d Toshite Gets\u2665Sareta Ken (if you tried to say the title ten times fast, you would not get done for an entire year), I have never been a fancy person let alone a rich person. I do not buy expensive clothes. I do not own exquisite pieces of art. I do not seek out caviar taste-tasting parties.\r\nThe fanciest I have ever been treated is at Disney. More specifically, the Disney cruise. Like any cruise, the ocean, the boat, and the activities are abundant. However, whatseparates a Disney cruise from most other cruises are the unique restaurants they contain. But the restaurants were not the best part.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part was that each family got not one but two personal waiters or waitresses. I sadly cannot remember their names, but they were jovial and kind, waiting on our beck and call for food, drink, and anything else we needed. For just a few days, my family and I were not treated as guests \u2013 we were treated as royalty. At dinner anyways.\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample (shortening the title because the official title is a little absurd), does not have waiters and waitresses, but it does have maids. A lot of maids. But still not enough maids to clean up what this one offered.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample takes a look at a rather interesting situation. Kimito, a boy, or more commonly called a commoner, is thrust into an all-girls school. But this is not one\u2019s run-of-the-mill all-girls school. This all-girls school contains girls of the upper-upper class. The rich beyond words. The classy.\\n\\n\r\nThis dichotomy between common and class gives the anime its comedic edge. Having these girls, who are so na\u00efve of the normal world outside of their exorbitant bubble, creates one funny episode after another. One episode has them visiting a replicated, commoner city. Another episode has them learning about a popular gesture. Another still has them discovering the \u201creliability\u201d of horoscopes.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the dichotomy, Shomin Sample introduces a harem element. Karen, Reiko, Aika, and Hakua each fall for the thigh-loving boy in their own way, but there are three main problems with the approach.\\n\\n\r\nOne, the anime does not give equal proportion to the whole cast. Karen and Hakua in particular are not given the same amount of time. They have scenes and even half of episodes dedicated to them, but whole episodes and arcs are reserved for Aika and Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the harem element does not serve much of a purpose. Nothing ever comes of the relationships between Kimito and the girls, and, when it does, the anime makes a point to regress it.\\n\\n\r\nThree, the harem element arguably conflicts with the main motif. The anime is (mainly) about what common people do, what classy people do, and how these two camps coincide. Common people usually do not have multiple suitors, settling with one man or one woman \u2018till death do they part. And while classy people may have the money to have multiple partners, as Reiko\u2019s arc shows, classy people likewise settle with one man or woman (and through arranged marriages no less).\\n\\n\r\nThe sexualized nature of the anime can also be called into question. Mostly because it is rather pointless. Having both Reiko and Aika in nothing but their bra and underwear, wrestling on Kimito\u2019s bed, does not help the narrative all that much. Arguably, though, the girls \u201clowering\u201d themselves to such levels matches the commoner versus class motif.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime includes this weird side plot. Eri, Kimito\u2019s female childhood friend, is shown quite sparingly throughout the season, wondering where her friend has disappeared to. Like the sexual content, it\u2019s pointless, but it may be unfair to criticize it given that her plotline did nothing whatsoever. Still, they do allude to it, indicating some modicum of importance, importance that is not present.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the comedy, the harem, and the random plotlines, Shomin Sample has a more dramatic side when it so chooses, drama that does not lend itself to a grander message. There may be something to be said about common folk and classy people \u2013 that the two sides can be together despite their financial and societal differences. But the show does not explore this route until the end when it tries to tie together every single episode in a few lines of dialogue. I.e., shallow exploration. Instead, Shomin Sample remains content with the muscle-men comedy and the up-skirt ecchi-ness.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this is a misstep since the anime wanted to be nothing more than this. However, having drama that goes mostly nowhere does mostly nothing for the show.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample\u2019s art treads into difficult territory more so than it may wish to.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the character designs are cute or attractive in their own right. Reiko and Karen have ample figures, Aika\u2019s orange hair matches her fiery, bubbly personality, and Hakua is an adorable-looking kid. The characters have an odd sheen to them, and they regularly stick to their black-and-white, plain school outfits, but, as harem members, they class it up well enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt is everything else that sours the experience. The rest of the art tends to be bland due to the same locations shown over and over \u2013 namely, Kimito\u2019s room and the surrounding grounds of the school. The anime does try to diversify its art through comedic representations, like with funny faces and imaginative depictions, but, for the most part, the art is not that impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode, in fact, earns a special negative shout-out. It gets quite rough: Some wonky drawings and even missing animation make the final stretch disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of animation, the animation overall sticks more on the low end. Action sequences are not prevalent (and they are not expected to be), but even the everyday happenings like dressing up as maids or playing a dance-centric video game do not have the characters moving all that much.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, as an aside, there is a sneaky picture of a dude giving two peace signs in the moon depicted in the OP. He\u2019s upside down and faded, blending in with the craters and colors. Perhaps he is related to the standup comedian they emulate. Probably pointless, but it was at least worth pointing out.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Shomin Sample are a mixed bag, but, ultimately, they are financially unstable.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it is best to start with the best: Reiko. Reiko is perfect beyond words: She is unbelievably kind, articulate in action, and a beauty to boot. Naturally, she falls in love with Kimito, wanting nothing less than to take his hand in marriage. Her time in the club and, more specifically, around Aika reveals that she may not be as perfect as one is led to believe. She has difficulty grasping commoner topics, and she (initially) despises Aika and Aika\u2019s behavior. And, for a time, this is all that is given of Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until the final few episodes that more to her character appears. Forced into an arranged marriage, she finds herself not wanting to follow the tradition of her household. Instead, she desperately wants to be with Kimito and her best friends \u2013 Aika included. After they come to her rescue, Reiko demonstrates courage in standing up for what she wants, proving that, however slightly, her character has changed for the better.\\n\\n\r\nAika comes next. Aika is initially shown to be quite shy. Seemingly ostracized from the rest of the school, she finds it difficult interacting with anyone due to her accent and due to her accidentally (and constantly) blurting out what isreally on her mind. Thankfully, Kimito arrives, giving her the opportunity to form the \u201cCommoner\u2019s Club\u201d and the chance to finally attain the social life she has always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nTo get to that point takes several episodes filled with foregone chances and comedic asides, but, eventually, Aika finds comfort in friendship from the other students. This friendship almost immediately gets revoked, however, calling into question the point of her conflict to begin with. At the minimum, her time in the club provided her with everlasting friends and a social life that is a sure step up from where it was before.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the rest of the cast sharply falls off in terms of strength. The other two main female protagonists \u2013 Karen and Hakua \u2013 miss out on the character investigation that Reiko and Aika received before them. Their characteristics are more than made known. Karen\u2019s swordplay is unrivaled, but her willpower is weak. Hakua\u2019s genius literally causes her to strip naked, and she has quite the adorable crush on Kimito. But as relatable people, ascharacters, they more than fall short.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for Miyuki, Kimito\u2019s personal maid at the school. She is oddly passive-aggressive towards Kimito, yet her true feelings for him are apparent when the secret of her \u201cI wish you had never woken up\u201d mantra is made known.\\n\\n\r\nBut, again, very little else about her character is given. Their past connection is not shown. The reason for her actions and feelings is not shown. Even something as simple as having her interact with the other cast members is not shown.\\n\\n\r\nYet the worst character in Shomin Sample is undoubtedly Kimito. Now, yes, Kimito is designed as more or less a self-insert male lead. He is nice, he is plain (impressive relative to the school and the students), and he is followed by a harem of pretty girls. I.e., Kimito is a rather bland character. But these traits are somewhat expected given the harem, ecchi, and comedy genres that the anime steeps itself in. So his traits are not so much negatives as they are acceptances.\\n\\n\r\nNo, what makes Kimito the worst character is something that he never gets. To reiterate from earlier, the main motif of the anime is the common versus the classy. And, for the most part, the classy people learn a lot through the commoner Kimito. But the opposite, that Kimito learns a lot through the classy Aika, Reiko, Karen, and Hakua, is almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls learn and grow and change as a result of Kimito\u2019s arrival and subsequent help, but it almost never seems as if Kimito takes advantage of the same chances. Arguably, the events are designed not for him but for everyone else, but, by failing to reciprocate Kimito for what he did for all of them, his character consequently fails to make his experience a worthwhile one.\\n\\n\r\nHe even gets in the way of the main theme of the cast: the tried-and-true importance of friendship. As has been said, Reiko and Aika both better themselves through the friends they find. Karen and Hakua, despite not having their own exploration, are no longer lonely (due to, arguably, personal estrangement) because of the friends they make.\\n\\n\r\nFor Kimito, friendship is usually on his mind. After all, he did not aid Aika, fight for Reiko, and put up with Karen and Hakua for the fun of it. He did it because he considers them his friends. Then what is the problem?\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that friendship, while a staple part of his character, does not affect his character. He did not seem to have trouble making friends. (\u201cDid not seem\u201d because his past life is almost never shown.) He never has any conflict that requires the girls, his friends, to help him out. And although he sets up the opportunities for friendship for Reiko, Aika, and the others, he rarely explores the concept of friendship \u2013 what friendship is, how friendship is obtained, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAs has been mentioned, Shomin Sample likes its comedy and its sex, so it not having deeply explored themes is not necessarily an issue. Still, when it tries to push one but cannot even get its main character involved, the theme falls flat. Combined with the problems with the other characters, it is easy to see just how much in debt they end up being.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound-work of Shomin Sample is arguably the anime\u2019s best trait.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is surprisingly silly, relying on onomatopoeia for many of its parts as well as strange sound-effects. The upbeat tone and the fast-paced nature of the piece continue the silliness. It also helps that the piece includes multiple vocalists, symbolizing the group of four girls. While the OP is not superb, it is a fun little song that fitsShomin Sample nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track slows down the tempo slightly when compared to the OP. It also ditches the multiple vocalists in favor of a single one \u2013 the childhood idol friend. It is still a happy song and is a pretty catchy one, too. But the ED is not particularly unique enough or emotional enough to make it into a piece worth remembering.\\n\\n\r\nEven more forgettable is the original soundtrack. One piece includes a serene, floaty composition filled with pianos and pipes. One piece is backed by a choir to accompany Kimito\u2019s fantasies. And another is more triumphant in tone. Most of the pieces have an air of class to them. As though they would be played in a tranquil garden or at some ritzy auditorium. Hence, they may be forgettable, but they are quite fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\n(As an aside, the water-droplet sound-effect that accompanies some of the steamier moments made those moments that much funnier.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting performances, they are generally above average in quality. Rika Tachibana as Reiko drips her words in refinement. Yuu Serizawa as Aika gives the peppy girl a thick accent wrapped in happiness galore. And Yuuki Kuwahara as Hakua whispers her way to cuteness. Chitose Morinaga as Karen and Saori Oonishi as Miyuki deserve shout-outs for their oft weird and intimidating voices, respectively. And for Ms. Tachibana and Ms. Morinaga, these roles are their first major roles, earning them even further accolades for a job more than well-done.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the problems the anime may have, I quite liked this one.\\n\\n\r\nIt achieves the rare feat in a harem: Each girl is likable. Karen is easily my favorite of the bunch. She is hilarious in mannerisms, attractive in her actions, and crazy in her sword skills. Karen is followed closely by Reiko and Miyuki. (Miyuki may not count as a member of the harem at this point because of her lack of screen presence, but still.) Reiko\u2019s constant romance angle made me overjoyed and Miyuki\u2019s horrible attitude towards Kimito, while undoubtedly rude, never failed to make me smile. And the ecchi content helped to make Karen, Reiko, and Miyuki that much more attractive.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the other half of the cast. Hakua is adorable. Whenever she grabbed onto Kimito\u2019s sleeve with her tiny hand, I let out an audible \u201cAww!\u201d Then when she got upset and very lightly punched Kimito, I just had to \u201cAwwww!\u201d even longer and louder. However, I was not a fan of the slight sexualizing of her. She is already a cute and fun character; she is also a child. So when the anime gave her a naked running joke, I frowned and shook my head at the unnecessary inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAika and Kimito were funny in their own right as well \u2013 Kimito less so than the girls, but he still had his moments. Aika\u2019s genuine efforts, Kimito\u2019s \u201cYou got me mad now!\u201d joke, and their silly interactions together added that much more to the hilarity. And when they were all together, the anime had no trouble getting as many laughs out of me as it could.\\n\\n\r\nOre ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \u201cShomin Sample\u201d Toshite Gets\u2665Sareta Ken has a lot of shortcomings. Its art is weak, its story is weaker, and its characters are weakest. Still, parts of the sound are composed well, and the anime makes it difficult to doubt just how funny it is. Be it served by maids or waiters, this anime ends up as quite the mixed dish.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, commoner versus class motif creates comedy, but the pointless harem, the distracting sex and plotlines, and the improper handling of its common-and-class theme shrinks the narrative\u2019s strength\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, nice character designs, bland artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Reiko and Aika are mediocre characters, Karen, Hakua, and Miyuki needed more, and Kimito ruins the whole experience\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, fun characters, hilarious moments, but Hakua\u2019s naked running joke was unnecessary\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Gets\u2665Sareta Ken anime is an anime about a protagonist who gets dragged into a world of rich and high class ladies who doesn't know how the outside world operates. In a world like this the main character Kagurazaka Kimito is dragged into their life to be their sample to learn the ways of the common people. However, I found that this anime is a little different from the usual hentai Ecchi, Harem, Romance or School anime we have seen so far.\r\nStory : 7 - This story is quite interesting and unlike the usual harem animes. In theusual Harem genre the settings are in a way that the MC gains the love/ attention through by showing their strength or by being intelligent or sometimes by having a tragic past. Meaning the MC is pretty irregular/abnormal. However in the Shomin Sample the MC gains their love/attention by showing how normal he is. The MC is a type of character that wants to help a 'maiden in trouble', in which he spends time with each girl, help them out and solves their problems to the most of his best. This type of character and story makes the Shomin Sample a bit different and interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9 - One of the great points of the show. The art is very good , but is by no means perfect. Character designs and coloring while greatly generic, are done well enough to make them eye catching and lovable. the background and scenery is breathtaking and very appealing. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8 - Very fitting for the anime specially the OP. It gives off a feeling of a feeling of a ridiculously funny but charming when I watched it. Specially I loved the part that shows the Kimito (MC)'s distress of being mistaken for musculophilia/a man who prefers muscles ( \u012c ^ \u012c ). And the ED is very appealing specially with the crayon painted art. So, the sound gives off the perfect feeling of what kind of anime it is. \uff08\uff3e\uff56\uff3e\uff09\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7 - 'Shomin Sample' is different from the ususal 'harem' animes. THis is pretty much a shock to the cultural view of the anime. The MC is pretty normal for one thing. He never tries to act cool and different from the usual. And that is one of his best points. It gives off a feeling that this is good , this is what is normal. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girl in this pretty abnormal, their pure views about things can be some times anoyying but most of them becomes funny and amusing. The characters shows what it would be like if such girls were raised in a close environment and taught to be a first class lady. For people not used to standard characters types in anime the characters will come of as a new type. 'Tsun-pure' which could be hard to swallow at first but it becomes normal after sometime. \uff08\u2312\u25bd\u2312\uff09\\n\\n\r\nThe MC becomes accustomed to the term 'expect the unexpected' in the very differrent cultural world. So without thinking of them as 'annoyingly-overreact' with everything. The MC finds to come in terms with it and grows accustomed to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9 - What I enjoy the most about 'Shomin Sample' is the great comedy. By watching this anime you will come to realize that bu having characters completely out of touch frm the real world is very interesting. For example these high class ladies wow the first time they see the MC use his cell phone or the time he ate ramen. And what I enjoyed was the the various intresting interactions between Kimito and other Main Female Characters. Shomin Sample may be labeled as a Harem but honestly there are times I don't feel like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8 - The idea is great and it is very charming. But It has its own great points and bad points but overall it is a one of the best harem of this fall 2015. So I recommend that you watch this anime. Specially, I recommend to the simple minided anime fans. And the fanatic Harem lovers this is a must watch. Hope you like it. (^\u222a^)",

            "content": "Harem is a genre that is widely known to be quite stale in comparison to a lot of other ones.  With the concept of one gender being surrounded by members of the opposite sex being the main focal point of the series, it becomes rather difficult to create something that is unique to the majority of the other hordes of shows that share the same tags.  As such, we have Shomin Sample, a series that...actually is rather unique in the grand scheme of harem, oddly enough.\r\nStory: Kagurazaka Kimito is your average everyday Japanese high school student in the big city.  As luckwould have it for any member of the male human species in a show like this, his world is turned upside-down when he is suddenly kidnapped, taken away by some really burly men, to a place known as Seikain, a school filled with prestigious rich girls who know nothing about the outside world.  His job here?  To teach these innocent and clueless girls about the outside or 'commoner' world so they won't become NEETs while also masking the fact that he's straight, putting on the facade that he loves really, really muscular men.  Oh what a world...\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Shomin Sample already earns itself a couple of speciality points simply because its base plot is so ridiculous and out there.  However, the story that we witness here is repetitive at best.  Shomin Sample's structure is largely episodic, with each episode introducing the girls in the series to various aspects of the modern Japanese culture and society.  This includes things more cultural things such as Japanese memes and otaku culture, to simple tasks like ordering food at a restaurant or shopping for their own clothes.  (Yeah, these girls seriously don't know anything about how outside society works.)  This in turn separates the general harem story as it not only focuses on Kimito's relationship with the four girls of the series, but also on what the series's base plot is.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue that comes with this is pacing.  Every episode pretty much pulls one or two chapters from the Shomin Sample manga, and either really condenses certain chapters to fit what they want to fit, or, elongate what they want to show in order to fit the runtime.  This in turn creates some moments that first of all, were not part of the original source material, but were just...cringe to watch sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Shomin Sample has Kimito teach the girls various Japanese memes and aspects of otaku culture.  (Mostly the simple stuff like anime, manga, and maid cafes.)  As such, the series doesn't inherently click or seem funny with a western audience simply because people outside of Japan just don't know what some of these things are.  In addition, the show uses a lot of retorts and some perverted comedy in order to convey other parts of comedy.  Most importantly though, the perverted comedy.  Ever seen a character go on and on and on and on about his fetish?  Well, if you haven't, Kimito expresses that kind of character perfectly.  As a man who loves thighs, a common gag with the series is the fact that he LOVES thighs.  And I mean LOVES thighs.  To the point that the show spends quite a lot of time on his monologues on the beauty of each female character's legs.  (They're still too short if you ask me.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shomin Sample's real problem was its pacing issues.  As a result of those issues, the show was added in original material that to me didn't really make sense (and was rather cringe to watch), and ended in a place that was rather odd and kind of shoehorned in.  It was part of the original series, mind you, but it just didn't make sense as a proper ending, like Silver Link expected everything to fall in place at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique and great base story plot\\n\r\n+/- Unique brand of humor  (As always, comedy is subjective.)\\n\r\n-  Lots and lots of pacing issues\\n\r\n-  Weird and somewhat open feeling end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Kagurazaka Kimito is the main protagonist of Shomin Sample.  As a man who loves nothing else but to feel and appreciate the female thighs, Kimito serves as the \"Shomin\" (Commoner) of the series.  Usually the instigator in most of the series's plot, Kimito as a character gives me severe...botheration.  The reason for this is because he doesn't feel all that different from a normal harem protag.  (Even though he SHOULD be.)  He still possesses the nice quality like every harem protagonist, and he's unique in the sense that he has the thigh fetish and loves to troll Aika to the extent of accepting his divine punishment, but he feels too...plain still.  (I'll get to why I think that later.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the harem girls, we have Reiko, Aika, Hakua, and Karen. \\n\\n\r\nReiko, is the elegant Oujo-sama who is kind and popular amongst everyone, while also harboring a crush on Kimito so large that she has decided who her lifetime partner will be.  \\n\\n\r\nAika, is the opposite, being a more tomboyish girl who seems nothing like a rich girl and tries to be popular, but fails because she thinks people don't like her.  Known as 'tsunpure' for being a bit of a tsun and failing for every trick in the book.\\n\\n\r\nHakua is the loli character of the group, being younger (and tinier) than everyone and also possessing an IQ so large that huge corporations need a 14 year old girl in order to manage their finances.  Likes to sit on Kimito's lap.\\n\\n\r\nKaren is the bushido girl of the group, being the one girl in the entire school who wields a katana at her side.  Has a pension for cute things to the point of possibly being called a pedophile on account of her drool and heavy breathing.  (Likes to call things 'pointless.')\\n\\n\r\nAs a cast of females, Shomin Sample is quite an interesting group.  However, as the series goes along, they don't really change, and there's really nothing significant about them in that sense.  They are unique enough to separate themselves from other harem females of years past, so that is something worth noting.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are rather minuscule in terms of importance, mainly because they either show up a small amount or add in very little to the story.  The only other character worth mentioning is the head maid, Miyuki, who pretty much in the anime is meant to threaten castration onto Kimito in order to prompt him to like musclemen.  (Of which they use somewhat excessively.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique characters\\n\r\n-  No character development\\n\r\n-  Side characters aren't really all that important\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art...oh my god, Silver Link, why...  The art for Shomin Sample is something of a monstrosity in my opinion.  Compared to a lot of shows these days, Shomin Sample has a lot of inconsistencies and design changes that really make the show look less than average.\\n\\n\r\nFor on thing, the show has a color palette that's just bright without really much depth or color detail to it since everything is rather one note.  Aside from that, the characters really bother me.  Not only is Kimito lacking his sharper look and has been turned into more of a moe character, but there are a fair amount of noticeable inconsistencies with the show has.  Things like one eye drawn differently from the other and little things like that really made the show a little bit harder to watch as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Below average art \\n\r\n-  Inconsistencies.  (Come on now, Silver Link.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP and ED for Shomin sample, are songs that to me...really don't fit the show or what the series is about.  Both of them are rather generic in terms of sound as they're just ordinary moe songs and I don't really see much memorability to them.  (Plus, their visuals are just what in the world are you thinking, Silver Link?)\\n\\n\r\nThe one track that I do say is even remotely worth listening to in the grand scheme of this show is the one that they played in the PV of this series.  They use it in the show sometimes and for me, it fits and works with the whole rich girl school since it gives a more royal feel, like those of high society.  I just wish it was used more because it's the only thing I felt fit.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  That one track I mentioned above\\n\r\n-   Average OST otherwise\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Alright, I got a bone to pick with Silver Link.  Shomin Sample is by far one of my favorite series to read.  And so, with seeing an adaptation, I was excited.  Then...I watched the first episode, and then it all went downhill from there....\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nIt had qualities of Shomin Sample in there, so it was tolerable.  But saying that I fully liked this adaptation?  That's...a bit of a stretch\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?  (Warning, rant incoming.)\\n\\n\r\nAlright, this adaptation is an abomination towards the Shomin Sample series.  Reason being is being Kimito, as a character, does not fluster with any of the situations that he's put in.  He felt far too normal and standard of a harem MC, and as such, really didn't feel like the sharp witted character that he was supposed to be.  Another is the fact that the entire story was just thrown together.  The entire plotline was a mishmash of what happens in the series all blended together, adding in a couple scenes that were just cringe to watch.  And don't get me started on the art for this one.  The production quality for this show is awful.  Out of the three shows that Silver Link decided to produce this season, this is the one that they left out the door to rot in terms of animation quality.  If it wasn't clear, I don't like this adaptation.  At...all.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't read any part of the Shomin Sample series, but you still want to experience what it is about, then go ahead and watch this.  But if you are like me and know about what happens in the series to some extent, then I would suggest no.  It's a unique blend of comedy with a different setting and really stands out in that regard.  However, on account of its pacing issues and Silver Link's creative liberty, there are some parts of it that are just really...really out there.",

Thought I would write something short and sweet compared to what everyone else does because I don't feel you need 6 paragraphs to review an anime XD.\r\nP.S definitely a harem that leaves all ends open even when you think theMC is finally going to pick one.",

            "content": "The premise of the show is a dime a dozen utterly forgettable plot, the porno equivalent of a handyman turning up on a helpless house wife's doorstep. It exists solely to drive the service of the show and is not realistic in the slightest. That being said, the show rather wisely chooses not to take itself seriously and even incorporates a meta in this respect which serves to \"lamp shade\" (a literary device used to bring attention to an issue or flaw and poke fun at it to acknowledge it and lesson its dissonance affect), raising its entertainment quality value above that of the averageharem. To clarify, one of the issues many harem shows have is that they rely solely on the service to sell its content and so the suspension of disbelief is unfortunately often loose at best because of a lack of effort in other areas like writing. This show whilst not putting in a *lot* of effort at least is written relatively intelligently.\\n\\n\r\nHarems are unfortunately what i consider to be entry level \"anime\" projects, easily exploited as a genre by either up and coming studios to make something that will easily sell and provide a footing for something more ambitious or just lazy studios with no ambition beyond making an easy buck. The result is that often the show's quality will be sub-par. As far as this show is concerned its art is actually not bad, in fact the background art is particularly passable, the animation itself is also respectable and the characters themselves quite pleasant in design.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the character designs are cookie cutter archetypes you've seen a thousand times before, the voice acting and (relatively) clever writing really brings them to life in a way you wont see in other shows of this type. You might even find yourself relating to one of them. This added to the overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nHarems are a guilty pleasure of mine, but i do like to think that i also have taste. I come from a creative background and so quality is still important to me. In this respect, as a harem watcher, this show will always be better than the sum of its parts because the important points come from its service and this show does provide a good and honest tease. Hence enjoyment will score better than the combination of the other criteria would suggest and i think this will be true for many people who consume this kind of content. But it's worth noting that the other areas don't suffer as much as they have been known to for this genre so in short, i would recommend this show to someone who consumes this kind of content, but perhaps not to someone who likes anime as a media in general and expect a bit more than panty shots and generally appealing to sexual fantasy.",

            "content": "This is one of those more guilty pleasure shows, it\u2019s got a ridiculous concept, but the genre is nothing new. It\u2019s another harem comedy genre, yet I found this to be quite entertaining, as it\u2019s one of those anime that is just fun to watch. (The Video Review is up on my Channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nShomin Sample story begins as our protagonist, Kimito Kagurazaka, an ordinary high school student, is kidnapped by man service and is brought and force to enrol in an all prestigious girl boarding school. But why do all this in the first place. The reason is because theschool is completely isolated from the outside world, in order to protect the innocence of the girls, however there is a problem in that, as the moment a student graduates from the school, they are unable to cope with the outside world, as they have been isolated from that. So Kimito is the \u2018Shomin Sample\u2019, Shomin meaning common. They chose him because they believe having a male commoner, will provide a gentle way to introduce the girls to the realities of the outside world. Also for the fact they chose him, because they thought he was gay, therefor didn\u2019t feel he was a threat to the girls.  \\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample episode structures are more broken into skit segments. There not really an overarching story, except for the first half when Kimito was trying to help one of the girls get popular, but after that, the cast of characters just go off and do various things with Kimito. However do find these skits to be rathe entertaining and a bit interesting at the same time. It\u2019s like a mixture of the slice of life activities that you see in other anime, but with the twist as Kimito, is the one teaching the girls how common things work, and this can sometimes lead to him trolling these girls. It\u2019s what you expect into typical moe show, it\u2019s not really that deep or all that special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKimito Kagurazka is the main protagonist of the show and also the victim of the lucky harem situation he\u2019s been put in. Unfortunately for him, he has to play the gay guy, otherwise they snip something off of him. What sets him slightly apart from other harem protagonist, is that he is aware of the situation his in, and sometimes use it to his advantage to play pranks on the girls, by trolling them about the common outside world. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from being oblivious at times. Un fortunately as he just plays the role of a helper and observer to everyone else, he doesn\u2019t really have much development compared to the others.\\n\\n\r\nAika Tenkuubashi is one of the 4 main female protagonist part of the harem. Her aim to get popular, and she believes by being the most commoner out of all the girls in the school, she believes she can achieve that. And it\u2019s a really nice development we see from her, as she was outcast at first, but grows to hang out with the other girls soon after. \\n\\n\r\nReiko Arisugawa is the most prestigious role model girl in the school. She is one of the perfect examples of a girl who is completely adopted to the life style of a pure girl. And hence she is incompetent when trying to understand the commoners life. But she does try her best and probably gives the most effort trying to retain her most popular girl status at the school still. She does have a nice arc towards the end of the show, but other than that, not too much development.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the main girls is Hakua Shiodome. The loli of the group and quiet one, rarely showing any emotion. She is considered a genius, and actually isolated not only from commoners, but also the pure girls in the school, so she doesn\u2019t know any almost common sense, and she doesn\u2019t really show any signs of development, being the emotionless doll she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we finally get to best girl Karen Jinryou, who is a katana wielding awkward beautiful girl. Other than playing the awkward girl who just does entertaining things and taking things too seriously, she doesn\u2019t really have much character development, other than respecting Kimito over time, although she doesn\u2019t really do too much.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I love the characters and their interactions with one another. I can\u2019t really say that any of them get really that much development. Sure Aika and Reiko get some, but that\u2019s only during their respective character arcs, and they are kind of back seated during the other episodes. But it is the interactions between all these different personalities is what I love about the characters in general, even though they\u2019re not very deep, they do provide a good chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound 6/10, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a very moe show, the art style is rather cutesy. The character designs make every character look much smaller than their ages, even they\u2019re not really lolis. It\u2019s rather standard and simple for the most part even during the more intense scenes. The animation in general repeats itself a few times, but I guess that sort of understandable consider Silver Link did put out 3 anime during the season, and you can clearly see which one did put more effort in. Even the art style does look innocent, that doesn\u2019t stop it from giving us fan service, for both guys and girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not that great in general. Nothing at all really stands out, as they are just there to be put in the scenes. It fits the theme of being at prestigious school, so there is quite a bit of classical music to fill up the scenes. The opening theme is a really catchy song, and it has a nice tune and ring to it. The ending song is fine as well, although it doesn\u2019t have the most memorable tune to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI found this to be a rather enjoyable show, despite its simplicity. I liked the character and their interactions with each other. I like how Kimito trolls the other girls and I like how the girls react to situation they never been in. I also like the fact Kimito, goes along with most situations and can make some clich\u00e9 scenes even funnier. There is quite a few references in this show, if you are able to pick up on it. It is more one of those guilty pleasure shows, that just makes you laugh for a bit.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to end of the review, I give the story a 6. Even though there may not be much of an overall arching story, I do like how they take the concept and try to create situations for the characters to react differently in normal circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 6 and 5. The animation is not really that special in general, the cute art style fits the moe genre of the show, and I do like how they use bright colours a lot to make it slightly innocent. The sound even it fits, the scenes, it is very subtle, as you would not notice or hear it. The opening is nice and catchy and the ending, is alright for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I give them a 7. I like the different personalities of each character and their interactions with one another. I like how Kimito is a bit different to other protagonist and trolls the girls. They bring out most of the enjoyment into the show. There is not a lot of development in them, except for maybe Aika and Reiko.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it 8. I love some of the skits that were pulled off, I like how the girls react differently to a common situation, I thought it was smart with the comedy. I like how the main protagonist was not a complete dense idiot, but more like the situation he was forced in. The laughed quite a bit during this show, and it became one of my guilty pleasure shows, but there was some drama in the show, that I really felt nothing for.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Shomin Sample, after rounding it all up, I give it a 6.5/10. It\u2019s a harem show that uses its concept smartly for comedy. I recommend this show to those looking to kill time, or who like the harem comedy genre. It\u2019s not really a deep show, but it can make you laugh.",

Of course the situations where this can beused as comedic setups are limitless, and in almost no time we have a core harem with the rest of the school playing second fiddle.\\n\\n\r\nOvershadowing the entire scenario is that he has to keep the school administrators convinced he's gay with a man-muscle fetish, or the scissor toting maid will snip off his man-parts.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great slice of life series that's ideal if you need a break from mecha, etc. or just like laugh-out-loud anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'd call it a cross between shojo, seinen and ecchi.",

            "content": "One day, a normal high school student named Kimito is randomly whisked to an unknown location by a bunch of macho men and told that he would now live and study at a new school.\r\nThe theme of a guy being transferred to an all girls school is nothing new anymore; we've seen it countless times in other shows such as Infinite Stratos, Unlimited Fafnir, Blade Dance of Elementalers, and Maken Ki. This show differentiates itself by focusing less on action and more on comedy, poking fun at cultural differences between the societal statuses and really abusing the viewers by repeatedly showing macho men and flashing\"gets\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a light, comedic harem for the season then this is one of the contenders. If you're looking for more action, you might want to jump over to one of the other many action-based harems of the season. As for me, it was decently entertaining though the story ended up a lot more open ended than I'd have like.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation style comes across as soft with light saturation and overly-blushed character cheeks. Backgrounds are often simple and usually blurred; expect fairly average production values in general. Silver Link may have gone a bit cheap overall with this work, the OP and ED sequences use mostly static images stitched together. The heroines are all easily distinguishable, though I kept thinking that Aika reminded me Inaho from Maken Ki. One small annoyance is that all the other girls at the school look way too similar to each other, granted they don't really play a part in the story. Another small annoyance is the drawing inconsistencies if you really pay attention to it. Expressions were fair overall, don't expect too much depth to the facial animations.\\n\\n\r\nThere is action only in the comedic sense as Karen swings her sword wildly causes massive collateral damage everywhere (though I have no idea who pays for it) but apparently doesn't cut people; this creates sort of a female version of DxD Issei's clothes shredder. There is a fair amount of ecchi with your expected onsen mishaps and accidental encounters. There's also a loli who repeatedly strips herself for no real good reason. Kimito does profess his love of the zettai ryouiki at least to the viewer but still gets embarrassed like most normal harem leads. In all, the ecchi isn't very heavy, especially given that the massive amount of macho guys kind of balances it out.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with a playful OP that grows addictive with each successive playing. The ED is more of a standard fare light rock piece. The BGM uses a lot of light orchestral and piano pieces, which fits with the high-class lady environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is really fresh, all the main heroines are relatively new. Likewise, this is the time I've seen Atsushi Tamaru as the lead protagonist. The performance was average overall. It is a pretty good series to watch if you want to practice listening to keigo though.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nKimito has no hope; his parents have literally sold him off to be a guinea pig at a school in an unknown location. If the school finds out that he isn't technically gay, then he loses his genitals. If he wants to leave the school, then he'll be under house arrest the rest of his life to protect the ridiculous secrecy of the school. Though maybe it's not that bad, he's surrounded by innocent, virgin daughters of immensely rich families that he could marry into and become a househusband or something. Given the uniqueness of his situation, he quickly becomes everyone's center of attention; everyone is curious about the amazing feats that \"commoners\" have to endure (like putting on their own clothes, using a mobile device, etc.). A particular outcast, Aika, approaches Kimito and creates the Commoner's Club so that she can learn the ways of the common folk and become popular too. Other girls soon join in and thus there's your harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is pretty light throughout with a quick introduction of harem members in sequence followed my many slice of life episodes where Kimito introduces some facet of a commoner's life. There is a bit of tension towards the last two episodes that follows a very predictable sequence and yields a very \"common\" conclusion. If you want an involved story, you're going to be a bit disappointed here. If you're looking for some decent romance beyond simple jealously cat fights, you'd do best to look elsewhere as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show follows a pretty safe pattern used by other shows and thus has cookie-cutter characters with some frosting. Aika is your standard playful and clumsy friend, who happens to be a bit aloof with others. Reiko is your perfect lady candidate with a competitive flair. Karen is your fighter tsundere who hides a love for overly cute things. And Hakua is the randomly stripping loli who happens to be a scientific genius. Oh, and Kimito's maid Miyuki who at least seems to despise him at all levels.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of character tension as, well, obviously the girls have no choice but to fall in love with him as there's no one else to choose. Relationships and characters in general feel static and, strangely, a lot of screen time is taken up by Miyuki and Eri who don't really contribute much to the central plot; perhaps they have larger roles if there's a sequel much like Anna in K?\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nShonin Sample is a fair entry to a crowded category. It isn't really standout in any way but isn't so bad that I'd drop watching it. There was a bit of wasted potential but, well, given the ridiculous nature of the setting I guess it isn't too much of a loss. The show has decent comedy and a lively group of characters but it lacks polish and really any defining characteristics. It's a lightweight comedic harem to tide you over till the next show.",

            "content": "Just what makes this show THE BEST ROM-COM OF THE FALL SEASON?\r\nPLOT\r\nMost generic harem animes have the same premise, especially the trope where the protagonist is the only male in the entire school. Though Shomin Sample has harem-esque tropes and cliches, it brings brand new things to the table. For example, how many harems have you seen where every girl in the show assumes the main protagonist is gay? How many harem shows have you seen where the Ojou-sama character lacks knowledge of anything \"commoner\" related? In this regard, Shomin Sample is just as innovative as it is naughty.\r\nI'm not going to pretend that itdoesn't exist: Shomin Sample is an ecchi anime. If you're planning on watching this show, expect panty shots, booty wiggling, booby jiggling, muscle men boners\\n\\n\r\nAnd dem good old THIGHS! If you like Zettai, this is a MUST WATCH for you. Disregard the entirety of this review and start watching the heck out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nHUMOR\\n\\n\r\nThe main type of humor that Shomin Sample prefers to use is where a person is unknowledgeable about certain objects that most should be expected to know. For example, give a starving African an iPhone. They'll most likely be amazed at what it is and when I say amazed I mean AMAZED. Of course, that'd be pretty funny, but it's morally wrong to laugh at starving Africans. However, since these are cute anime girls we're talking about, it's perfectly fine.\\n\\n\r\nThis humor is distributed in two ways by our main character, . He can either introduce something new to the masses, like an iPhone, or McDonalds; or he can be a total troll to orange-haired tsun-pure. In the situations that he's being mischevious, he tells Aika that performing a certain action will make her EXTREMELY popular, which is most definitely not the case. If that were true, then every single girl I've asked to \"Skip Netflix and just chill\" would've slept with me by now, but we don't see that happening, do we... DO WE!?!?!!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOh boy oh boy, it's time to talk about the best characters ever \ud83d\ude0e lets jump right into it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to introduce you guys to my bro, Kirito-I mean Kimito. Why is he a bro? Well, not only is he a complete troll, but he has a massive fetish for thighs and all things Zettai. Any character that acknowledges the beauty of kneesocks is alright with me.\\n\\n\r\nAika is Shomin Sample's \"Tsun-pure\". To give you guys an idea about what that exactly entails, a tsun-pure is a character trope introduced in Shomin Sample (hey, that anime sounds familiar) that has the personality of a Tsundere, but at the same time, cannot keep what she's thinking inside her head. Additionally, she'll believe anything that you're told. Props to Shomin Sample to bringing new ideas to the harem genre left and right.\\n\\n\r\nHakua is that one loli that was the main reason over half of the fanbase even watched the first 3 episodes of Shomin Sample. She has the personality of a shy 3-year-old and has a mind larger than Einstein. Other than being a loli and smart, her only quirk left that makes her interesting is  her tendency to take off her clothes when she has sudden... \"insights\"?\\n\\n\r\nArisugawa Reiko is the generic Ojou-sama character that you'd expect in an anime such as this. She has absolutely no other traits other than her big boobies.\\n\\n\r\nAND NOW ITS TIME TO COVER THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERS OF THE ENTIRE SHOW! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nKaren Fuyou is an \"elegant\" young woman with long flowing black hair who considers herself a swordmaster. Her skills with a sword are unmatched as well as her cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Karen so great, you ask? In the beginning of the show, she's objectified as a tomboyish character, similar to Shovel Knight in Gakkou Gurashi. However, later on, we discover that she has an unrivaled adoration for all things cuteand adorable. Sure, this is pretty kawaii, but the other girls still outmatch her. Well, it's time for her to get serious.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, folks. Karen has, by far, the best thighs of 2015. With Kimito having a massive love for zettai himself, the anime HAD to include a character with thick legs, and that character was Karen Fuyou!\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Karen's zettai power, Shomin Sample shows off just how cute and adorable she can be when she's in love. After the dressing room scene, Karen looks at Kimito in a new adoring way that causes her to blush and do the craziest things in order to try and win his love. These factors are what makes Karen the best girl of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying Karen on the Waifu ride is Miyuki Kujou, Kimito's personal maid. Now I'm not usually the type of person that likes Kuuderes and maid characters, but there's something about Miyuki that makes her so much better than any maid or Kuudere I've seen, and that's her personality. From episode 1, Shomin Sample shows off Miyuki's hatred and disgust for Kimito. This causes her to say the most hilarious lines, including threatening to cut off Kimito's manhood, wishing he'd died in his sleep, and even clicking her tounge in disgust at him. Oh did I also forget to mention those garterbelts!?!?\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\\n\r\nAll of you who watch Shomin Sample already know that they're a little bit odd with including a bunch of macho men into the opening. However, less of you may know about a scene with a glowstick inside a mans butt, in sighting homosexual tendencies. However, have you guys seen the upside down man in the moon? To be honest, I have no idea who the man is that's featured posing, but I have reason to believe that he's a director of sorts. If you guys have any knowledge about this man, please leave it in a comment below.\\n\\n\r\nObserving the opening more in depth, it's just an average song for a harem or comedy anime, beginning with the chorus, then a few lyrics followed by the bridge, which brings us to the chorus one final time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is worse than the opening in terms of average-ness and isn't even worth mentioning...\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike thousands of other viewers, I first began watching Shomin Sample because I was curious about the loli, Hakua. What would I expect to see from a character that looks like a toddler? Little did I know that I'd continue watching it because of the unsuspected comedy and the amazing antics of Karen and Miyuki. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that the ending was a bit anticlimactic and could've been a bit better. Because of this, I was left feeling as if I didn't receive enough of Shomin Sample, which is why I plan to start reading the manga, since I hear that Karen is much better there.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nIf the harem genre was a plate of raisin cookies, Shomin Sample would be that chocolate chip cookie you randomly pick up and savor each bite. It brings brand new original ideas in which they can call their own. Other harem series will try to use these tropes in which people will respond: OMG, they're copying Shomin Sample! \\n\\n\r\nHowever, though it's a great harem, it's still has its few raunchy moments in which watching with family members wouldn't be advised.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and did I forget to mention waifus? How about Zettai? I mentioned those a million times already? Ok\\n",

He says no, but she insists, saying it's standard for maids at the school to dress their charges. At the beginning of the third episode, a maid is told that she has to obey particular rules to serve a new character. Chief among these being dressing her.\r\nYeah, they didn't bother to think the story through. It's cleary not the priority here, which is good because this anime has very little to offer in terms of story or characters. They're well worn archetypes that were included without much thought. No, themain thing this anime is trying to do is make you hard about the pelvis. And maybe make you laugh a bit too.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes it hard to review. Comedy and arousal are both very subjective areas where your milage may very. About all I can do is talk about whether it did it for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't. The jokes are cliche for the most part. I've seen them before and that takes away the surprise and the absurdity, the most important things to comedy. It makes this joke about the girls not recognizing something ordinary like soda or a cell phone all the time with no variation and it never becomes funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnd too many aspects of it creep me out for me to get hot and bothered by it. Like the character who looks like a little girl. \\n\\n\r\nBut whether it works for you or not, it probably won't stay with you. Definitely safe to pass.

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review for an anime on MAL, and I do it because this has to have been one of the worst, if not THE worst, anime I've ever had the displeasure of watching. I'm honestly not sure why I watched three full episodes before dropping it, but that alone was enough to give me a good idea of how terrible it is.\r\nFor those who want a short summary, here it is: The art is decent except when it's used to provide fan service in an attempt to obscure everything else that this anime shouldn't have but does, or shouldhave but doesn't. Everything else regarding this anime is appallingly bad. I would recommend you spare yourself the psychological trauma and avoid this at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nI'll now explain what I said. Be warned that there are spoilers in this section.\\n\\n\r\n1) All of the characters in this school are rich girls who were, judging by the fact that they know NOTHING of the outside world WHATSOEVER, raised there or in similar places from birth. They are provided with everything they want, and have personal maids to help them with literally anything. And yet, they don't act like spoiled brats--in fact, everything they say and do seems to be calculated (by the producers rather than the characters) to be \"perfect,\" to the point that it isn't even laughable; it's just pathetic.\\n\\n\r\n2) The school has seemingly infinite funds, but they don't provide the students with phones, access to any online resources whatsoever, or pretty much any other commodity largely regarded as a daily necessity in any time period after the 1600's.\\n\\n\r\n3) This is one of two particular things that annoy me more than the others, and it seems to be present in almost every romantic comedy wherein a poor/ish person comes into contact with a rich person for the first time: the cheap food, in this case a cup of instant ramen that probably cost about 30 cents, is immediately regarded as \"delicious\" or \"amazing\" by the rich people who have been eating nothing but the highest quality foods for their entire lives. In real life, such a person would gag, dry heave, and possibly vomit at such an unexpected disaster upon their palette. Instant ramen just isn't that good, especially compared to the food served by even a three-star restaurant, let alone a five-star one.\\n\\n\r\n4) The other thing that annoys me more than the other terrible aspects of the anime is this: Despite these girls having been raised in isolation from society and all male members of their species, they exhibit some behaviors that could ONLY stem from influences from those sources. For example, NONE of them act like they aren't completely straight, at least in the first three episodes (I'll explain this using a real life example: In ancient Sparta, the boys were taken and trained in near-isolation from women from the age of five up until they were married off to provide more children to the nation. And what happened? Most, if not all, of them were gay. I mean, seriously, if you're going to write a story where one gender is isolated from the other, try to make it at least a little bit realistic). When a female character walks into a room in which male character is trying to dress what appears to be a child, she attacks him and screams \"pervert\" rather than trying to understand the situation in the least (this influence could only have been from watching other anime with the same fatal flaw). When the female characters' clothes are removed by magic--and I'll get into that later--they panic because a MAN saw them.\\n\\n\r\n5) They immediately introduced fantasy and science fiction aspects into a slice of life romantic comedy. For example, one of the characters, at the age of fourteen, is at the forefront of EVERY scientific field, making \"groundbreaking\" contributions to EACH AND EVERY ONE. Mind you, this is at the school that has NO TECHNOLOGY and wherein none of the other characters had even seen so much as a flip-phone. Additionally, another character \"self-trained\" in pointless sword styles, among which was the ability to wave the sword around like an idiot and somehow remove the clothing of every character in a thirty meter radius.\\n\\n\r\nGiven this information, I hope anyone who reads this will think a second, third, and maybe fourth time about starting this anime. Keep in mind that all of these things occurred in the space of three episodes. Be prepared to suffer even more horrific failures if you watch more.",

Nothing really stood out to me for the story apart from the setting of the all girls school that takes a 'common' boy into the school, so that the girls are more use to thenormal world upon leaving the school.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the animation and art style of the anime. Had a nice overall tone of using bright colours which helped to carry across the fact that the school was truly in its own little world and didn't really know of mainstream technology, ideas and culture. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song didn't grab me as a particularly amazing song but wasn't awful either. The closing song I thought was better but still not all that great to me, so for both songs (opening and closing) I wouldn't choose to go out of my way to listen to them. The sound within the episodes itself was good but nothing that stood out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs with most harem animes the main character (male) of Kimito was nothing special in terms of looks or personality. Moving onto the 4 girls of the harem of Aika, Reiko, Karen and Hauka, each had they own looks, personalities and was nice to see that not all 4 of them were fighting between each other all the time throughout the series to get Kimito's attention. The characters are what I would say the strongest part of the anime, but nothing truly unique within the harem genre. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed myself in that I would go from one episode to the next, when there was nothing else I wanted to watch and didn't find anything too annoying or cringe worthy that stopped me watching or dropping this anime altogether. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nA nice but not too out of standard example of a harem anime. Something I would recommend to someone who hasn't watched a harem anime before or wants one with a decent setting and characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shomin Sample is of the harem archetype, meaning there is one male character who is desired by two or more female characters. This certainly is not unique to anime or any other media, so in a saturated genre such as this, the creators have to introduce something to separate themselves from their contemporaries.\r\nFor this anime, it is its story--to an extent.\r\nPlacing a man into a situation surrounded by many women is not new. However, there is an inherent difference between this man and these women in this case: the former is a commoner (\u201cshomin\u201d in Japanese) and the latter are affluent. I can acceptwhy there is a need for a commoner at Sekain High School. These young ladies are sheltered, and there are examples of alumni not being able to adapt properly to the modern world upon graduation. Therefore, having a competent commoner as a transfer student (or transfer teacher) who, in theory, can introduce this different culture better than the faculty, staff, and administration is plausible. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the administration created a logical issue in choosing Kimito. There is nothing wrong with Kimito from the perspective that he really is a likeable, kindhearted character. I just believe the school should have chosen a woman, based on what head maid Miyuki and the principal stated right from the first episode. Indeed, having a woman defeats the purpose of at least a quintessential harem in this case, although this would have made the administration of this serious, prestigious high school appear more competent. \\n\\n\r\nStill, even with its simple story, Shomin Sample is funny because of the often awkward situations Kimito is put in. The comedy has to be one of its best elements. It really does make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ending was a bit lackluster, personally. It contains deus ex machina and plot-affecting contradictions made by one character in a matter of minutes. The rising action leading up to this climax is too sudden and convenient, and it is to the clear detriment of this last act. I just wonder why this has to be the finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a moderate fan service, most of which is not ludicrous. The audience\u2019s viewpoint will focus on the ecchi elements at times, although without using extreme close-ups, I will add. The fan service is not done often for me to be rendered silly by it.\\n\\n\r\nShomin Sample\u2019s art style is well-done, as expected from Silver Link. Silver Link has created such anime as Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Non Non Biyori, and Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya. In Shomin Sample, Silver Link focuses less on showing its scenery and backgrounds and more so on the characters. The art style stays consistent throughout the series and serves to emphasize the aura of prestige of Sekain High School and its inhabitants. Speaking of inhabitants, the women from the main to the supporting cast are quite pretty.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are quite convincing, as well, in their archetypal roles. I would say the quality of all of their performances are equal to each other, and they also are consistent through the series. They do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is also nice with appropriate orchestral arrangements during calmer segments and more pop-related themes during humorous segments. Neither of these seem overused to me, and they definitely do not detract from the mood. However, I believe it is relatively easy to not notice the music at times. It fits in with the mood, nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OP and ED, I like them mainly for the vocalists\u2019 good performances. The OP has an upbeat, whimsical nature with its mix of pop, EDM, and orchestral elements. The ED, my favorite of the two, is alternative metal with satisfying build-up throughout in the vocals and the instrumentals.\\n\\n\r\nNext are the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of a common trope in the harem genre, the characters are personality archetypes to an extent. Within Shomin Sample, I believe these are a deredere, a kuudere, and two tsundere for the female protagonists. Kimito is typical for your male lead in that, as a reflection of the mostly male audience, he is more well-rounded than the female characters who desire him. He is kind, as I said before, and he also knows what to do or to say in essentially any circumstance. Still, there is some dynamicism to be had by two of the female protagonists because they have vices their personas would not give away upon first glance.\\n\\n\r\nI think the manner in which characters react to situations and events is plausible, but their reactions are exaggerated for the sake of comedic effect. I do not find this to be bad at all. In fact, it is quite humorous to see the ladies act in situations expected for a commoner but foreign to them. \\n\\n\r\nI have been able to relate to Kimito, although, it\u2019s not because he simply is a harem lead. Rather, I identify with him most when he is introducing commoner culture to those around him. I don\u2019t relate to his situation but I do relate to his culture because I am a part of it, as well. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching them interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for my conclusion. Shomin Sample is for those who like harem and ecchi anime and who do not mind an overall decent story. Anyone who can\u2019t tolerate either of those genres probably will not like this. This story just is not going to change people\u2019s minds about them. It\u2019s made worse by the fact that the explanation for Sekain High School\u2019s choice of Kimito as the shomin sample, the reason this is a harem, is a forced one. Again, I know it would no longer be at least a typical harem with a female lead, but this would have been more logical, given said explanation, and more unique, perhaps. I\u2019m essentially saying this could have very well worked without the harem and, possibly, the romance elements. By no means am I saying the comedy and ecchi shouldn\u2019t be there. The comedy and art are great, actually, while the sound is very good, and the characters\u2019 situation is unique enough for this series. It\u2019s just this uniqueness is compromised for the sake of the harem genre.",
