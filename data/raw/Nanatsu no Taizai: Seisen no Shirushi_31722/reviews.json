Good set up for another season right? \r\nWrong.  This season is just four episodes of blurry, low quality filler.  \r\nThe character's behaviors have been changed to fit into the stupid side story, and everything just seemsto be put together for no rhyme or reason.  A jealous love triangle of side characters seems to make up the majority of the season, with silly events occurring that forces as much unnecessary character interaction as possible .\\n\\n\r\nIt felt like I was watching a strange imitation of the original story.\\n\\n",

As I said, there's not much story, but I don't think these episodes were meant for story.

To be more specific, after the Seven Deadly Sins and the Holy Knights defeated Hendrickson and before the Sins start their journey for their next adventure. Given this time frame nothing happens in the entirety of these 4 episodes.\r\nThe \u201cplot\u201d is nothing more than small interactions or conflicts between characters that get resoled basically immediately and have no consequences whatsoever. Adding to this isthe fact that we are not even getting any new information about the characters or the world they live in. Even the animation quality is below that of the first season, this becomes especially apparent in the fight between Meliodas and Ban in the first episode. Some of the movements just look incredibly odd. The whole time I kept asking myself \u201cwhy?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if this OVA didn\u2019t have only 4 episodes I would have dropped. I just can\u2019t think of a reason why this was made. I really advise all of you to just skip this.",

The second episode focused on the fight between Meliodas and Ban as they settle the score. The third episode focused more on therelationship between King and Diane, while the final episode pretty much cleared up whatever happened to Vivian after the battle and also shows Gowther trying to understand human emotion more.\\n\r\nEach of these episodes were really fun to watch and carried on the aspect of why I loved the series in the first place.\\n\r\nYet somehow it continues to annoy with it's lack of character deaths by showing Hendrickson is still alive though not for long as he sacrifices his body to open a seal, but he managed to do it thanks to Dreyfus, who has somehow come back from the dead which didn't seem possible since he was literally turned to ash by Hendrickson. Luckily these scenes were short and are pretty much the buildup for the threat season 2 is going to offer us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite being only 4 episodes we still see the sins develop quite a bit, especially King and Diane who are pretty much my favourite ship at this point now.\\n\r\nWe get to see Gowther develop a little too, considering he went out of his way to help a young boy remember what his mother looked like, even if it didn't go the way he expected.\\n\r\nWe also got to see a little more of Merlin and what her character is like, but it was only a little and doesn't give us much to make her a truly likeable character yet, however we do know she's the only sin who actually doesn't go along with everything Meliodas does.\\n\r\nThe tension between Meliodas and Ban also grew more here and it was sorted out in a pretty epic way, much like during the tournament match when they were trying to get Diane's hammer, we really got to see why their best buddies with each other and why they are more than just comrades in arms.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere really wasn't anything significant with the artstyle, other than it keeping up with the previous series, although Meliodas and Bans fight was definitely a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op wasn't exactly that great, it's a far cry from the two good ops we got in the first season, but considering this is just filler type series leading up to season 2 I'll cut it some slack, plus it was interesting seeing the sins wearing classy outfits.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say here, other than that this filler series still retains what made the first season so enjoyable, a bunch of funny comedy, good character development and some kickass action, although the only action was between Meliodas and Ban, but that was enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a nice filler series leading up to season 2 and the hype for me wanting to watch season 2 when it's finally finished just keeps on growing.",

I use quotation because it was so short that if my internet hadn't been down the last 4 days i could have finished it in like 2 hours. Although watching this was kind of a nice break from the series plot points and started doing a little more character development (which they threw out the window COMPLETELY) and fooled around a little with the characters in a canon OVA style show. I find it sadto say that the only appealing part to all of this was the visuals and the fight scenes(love me a good SDS fight). and also, more fanservice. the one thing that brings down an anime in my opinion. Welp, here's to hoping the REAL season 2 will be better than this mess of an adaption.",

Hence \"Signs of Holy War.\" One might think that these 4 episodes are unnecessary, but as I've said in another review, narratives don't always have to follow a completely plot-dependent structure. As the Deadly Sins just won, what else would they be doing but taking a light breather? Chilling around the bar, drinking and makingmerry, pursuing love... It's like a casual look into their life outside of fighting against an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nBut these 4 episodes also show some insight into the relationships among and between the Deadly Sins. King's love for Diane, Ban's desire to be with Elaine clashing with his loyalty to Meliodas, and so on. You see them more as people.

Not a Season 2 as advertised by Netflix. More of a season 1.5. The series was mostly episodic with not a lot going on. Kinda daily life in Liones before the journey continues. \r\nIf you have completed these episodes. I'd love it if you checked out my Review and Discussion from my You tube channel in the link below. I could really use the support and constructive criticism from the fanbase to get better and keep putting out good content.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YXIR0YpHSvg",

Good set up for another season right? \r\nWrong.  This season is just four episodes of blurry, low quality filler.  \r\nThe character's behaviors have been changed to fit into the stupid side story, and everything just seemsto be put together for no rhyme or reason.  A jealous love triangle of side characters seems to make up the majority of the season, with silly events occurring that forces as much unnecessary character interaction as possible .\\n\\n\r\nIt felt like I was watching a strange imitation of the original story.\\n\\n",

As I said, there's not much story, but I don't think these episodes were meant for story.

It\u2019s a complete disappointment and I have no idea why it was ever made.\r\nChronologically speaking Nanatsu no Taizai: Seisen no Shirushi happens in the 24th episode of the first season. To be more specific, after the Seven Deadly Sins and the Holy Knights defeated Hendrickson and before the Sins start their journey for their next adventure. Given this time frame nothing happens in the entirety of these 4 episodes.\r\nThe \u201cplot\u201d is nothing more than small interactions or conflicts between characters that get resoled basically immediately and have no consequences whatsoever. Adding to this isthe fact that we are not even getting any new information about the characters or the world they live in. Even the animation quality is below that of the first season, this becomes especially apparent in the fight between Meliodas and Ban in the first episode. Some of the movements just look incredibly odd. The whole time I kept asking myself \u201cwhy?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if this OVA didn\u2019t have only 4 episodes I would have dropped. I just can\u2019t think of a reason why this was made. I really advise all of you to just skip this.",

The second episode focused on the fight between Meliodas and Ban as they settle the score. The third episode focused more on therelationship between King and Diane, while the final episode pretty much cleared up whatever happened to Vivian after the battle and also shows Gowther trying to understand human emotion more.\\n\r\nEach of these episodes were really fun to watch and carried on the aspect of why I loved the series in the first place.\\n\r\nYet somehow it continues to annoy with it's lack of character deaths by showing Hendrickson is still alive though not for long as he sacrifices his body to open a seal, but he managed to do it thanks to Dreyfus, who has somehow come back from the dead which didn't seem possible since he was literally turned to ash by Hendrickson. Luckily these scenes were short and are pretty much the buildup for the threat season 2 is going to offer us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite being only 4 episodes we still see the sins develop quite a bit, especially King and Diane who are pretty much my favourite ship at this point now.\\n\r\nWe get to see Gowther develop a little too, considering he went out of his way to help a young boy remember what his mother looked like, even if it didn't go the way he expected.\\n\r\nWe also got to see a little more of Merlin and what her character is like, but it was only a little and doesn't give us much to make her a truly likeable character yet, however we do know she's the only sin who actually doesn't go along with everything Meliodas does.\\n\r\nThe tension between Meliodas and Ban also grew more here and it was sorted out in a pretty epic way, much like during the tournament match when they were trying to get Diane's hammer, we really got to see why their best buddies with each other and why they are more than just comrades in arms.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere really wasn't anything significant with the artstyle, other than it keeping up with the previous series, although Meliodas and Bans fight was definitely a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op wasn't exactly that great, it's a far cry from the two good ops we got in the first season, but considering this is just filler type series leading up to season 2 I'll cut it some slack, plus it was interesting seeing the sins wearing classy outfits.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say here, other than that this filler series still retains what made the first season so enjoyable, a bunch of funny comedy, good character development and some kickass action, although the only action was between Meliodas and Ban, but that was enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a nice filler series leading up to season 2 and the hype for me wanting to watch season 2 when it's finally finished just keeps on growing.",

            "content": "First off, VERY misleading title, seeing as the ending AFTER THE CREDITS is the only REAL story development we get out of this \"season 2\" of the seven deadly sins. I use quotation because it was so short that if my internet hadn't been down the last 4 days i could have finished it in like 2 hours. Although watching this was kind of a nice break from the series plot points and started doing a little more character development (which they threw out the window COMPLETELY) and fooled around a little with the characters in a canon OVA style show. I find it sadto say that the only appealing part to all of this was the visuals and the fight scenes(love me a good SDS fight). and also, more fanservice. the one thing that brings down an anime in my opinion. Welp, here's to hoping the REAL season 2 will be better than this mess of an adaption.",

            "content": "Just 4 episodes of a pleasant midway between the first and upcoming second season, Signs of Holy War offers the same endearing quality that the first season did -- bright, cheerful characters who are insanely powerful and are facing quite the deadly opponents, which are right now in the shadows. Hence \"Signs of Holy War.\" One might think that these 4 episodes are unnecessary, but as I've said in another review, narratives don't always have to follow a completely plot-dependent structure. As the Deadly Sins just won, what else would they be doing but taking a light breather? Chilling around the bar, drinking and makingmerry, pursuing love... It's like a casual look into their life outside of fighting against an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nBut these 4 episodes also show some insight into the relationships among and between the Deadly Sins. King's love for Diane, Ban's desire to be with Elaine clashing with his loyalty to Meliodas, and so on. You see them more as people. More character development/filling out.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you've seen the first season, go ahead and breeze through Signs of Holy War.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRATINGS\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 8.2\\n\r\nResonance -- 6.4\\n\r\nOverall Quality -- 7.5",

Not a Season 2 as advertised by Netflix. More of a season 1.5. The series was mostly episodic with not a lot going on. Kinda daily life in Liones before the journey continues. \r\nIf you have completed these episodes. I'd love it if you checked out my Review and Discussion from my You tube channel in the link below. I could really use the support and constructive criticism from the fanbase to get better and keep putting out good content.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YXIR0YpHSvg",
